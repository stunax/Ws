306 lunar landing plates year released 1979 piece count 2 minifigs 0 list price unknown as part of the classic space collection lego offered two sets of moon plates one was a set of two crater plates and the other this very useful landing plate set not much to review but worth sharing a few images the landing plate and tplate the two plates connect to form this very nice classic space landing platform set 497 galaxy explorer included the landing platform but the one that i had was lighter in color than the one contained in this set at least the yellow circle future lego space sets could benefit by having similar road plates share your thoughts	neutral
these are my only space base plates from classic space actually with only 2 plates i could not do much serious expansion with it instead i merged it with my old city baseplates and used it as a docking station for scientific purposes or restricted facilities that is guarded by the police these baseplates are very useful and is suited for creating a space command center up in the space  	positive
these are pretty good but i think they look too much like the standard town roads from that period i like the black space plates from the early 90s better 6710	negative
cp5670 on jul 7 2008 1004 pm said i like the black space plates from the early 90s better 6710 awesome i had not seen these before they would really make nice plates for a sw death star scene thanks for sharing	positive
first what i liked sooooo much was the cover of these plates with this large picture of a classic space scene i still have a 306 misb just to keep that nice feeling of taking it out of a plastic box and look at it there were different versions of the cover though second the markings of the landing platform changed at some point id have to check it later when im at home think it had something to do with the interupted yellow lines	negative

why pay 350 dollars just download the instructions on buy the pieces off bricklink this is was i did when i wanted to create the blacktron ii in the futuron colour scheme also i tend to like both sets of base plates i bought the black ones myself and they were of great use but there more for creating the idea of a city or space station something more completely man made the gray ones give a better look of the roads being laid over bare rock especially when you introduce the plates with the craters i would love to see a 4848 baseplate with roads through them which would allow more building space on the side and maybe some craters also 4848 baseplates with craters but a few different kinds to create more or a realistic look and less of a repeating pattern and with all those rocks you have to put everything up on supports much better looking bases then	negative

year released 1976 piece count 53 minifigs 2 lego brought out floating boats quite early and in many ways the first were the best ill explain why later this set in particular is interesting as it came out in two versions one that includes the first minifigs and another that included the nonarmless type set 709 the police signs are stickers and are in surprisingly good condition considering the age of the set i am missing one sticker on the front though note the technic bush and axel they are the old type the position of the second figure is not a mistake i think hes supposed to be sitting down the first boats out by lego needed a weighted keel to prevent them keeling over i have tested this i suspect this is because of the density of the old hulls and the flat bottom but i could be wrong it cant be just because of the flat bottom as the new cargo ship doesnt need one the keel in detail the bottom extension is for a motor not included nor made by lego at the time the keel had longer studs even now it holds extra firmly this is why i prefer the old design you can extend or shorten the hulls as you please or even insert other lego in the middle you can easily add wheels or any other piece to the bottom of these hulls i wish they would go back to this idea the 4 hulls were of this concept but were too wide probably so the keel wasnt needed the old minifigs aside from having odd feet and no arms had a normal stud as the neck thus when you turn the head it tends to come off i love this set	negative
thebrickster on jun 22 2008 0141 am said it looks like your boat is in really good shape considering its 30 years old excellent review i know i got it for a song on ebay most 1970s sets dont seem to be in much demand	neutral

nice review sinner the old sets i donÂ´t know  every old set especially equipped with the old nonmoveable arms minifigs look very odd nowadays i agree with you with the hull shape and its possibility to be extended but every other aspect the lack of detail the keel itself you canÂ´t float it in shallow water keeps me from rating it higher than 310 in my opninion the best police boat so far is 4021 click to enlarge	negative
i love those minifigs theyd go for alot on ebay i bet great boat as well i love the old hull design	positive
this set showed what potential variations on the standard brick had back then i think that tlg was still finding its legs back then and learning new things so this is a solid set for the year it was released nice review sinner	positive
thank you for the nice review sinner holodoc on aug 1 2008 0859 am said nice review sinner the old sets i donÂ´t know  every old set especially equipped with the old nonmoveable arms minifigs look very odd nowadays i agree with you with the hull shape and its possibility to be extended but every other aspect the lack of detail the keel itself you canÂ´t float it in shallow water keeps me from rating it higher than 310 in my opninion the best police boat so far is 4021 click to enlarge well if youre meaning really old sets than i agree with you but a lot of the sets from the very late 1970s and onwards are still very nice this set just isnt a good example thats all oh and i also agree with you about that police boat however the newer one in the city line is also great imo the only thing that weighs against it is the giant size which makes it feel awkward in more classic towns edited by grevious 03 august 2008  0630 pm	negative
so youve been bitten by the classic bug too sinner great review but one would think arms would come in handy pun intended when you are a police officer right its a shame that many of the original figs must now be forced to stand looking like they have their hands in their pockets eh i have no idea where i was going with that last sentence	neutral
nice review mariko this set is way past my time the baseplate is okay though i hate those dots the car is pretty cool too	positive
way before my time tooin fact this set came out twenty years before i was born the baseplate doesnt actually have dotsim not sure if they were there once and then rubbed off a possibility as the studs are rather smoother than i imagine they once were or if this particular one didnt have the dots this set also shows that the difficulty lego has in doing vehicle scale isnt new the house is the perfect size for microfigures from the lego games however the car is massiveover twice as tall as a microfig	neutral
image link from brickset i thought i would do a pic review of the 1st lego castle the yellow castle 375 released in 1978 first let me say that this set was truly ahead of its time it introduced new building concepts such as the hinge and new figs most were still the armless faceless minifigs during this time this set introduced me to castle which was my first real favorite theme i enjoyed breaking it out from the garage and building it again the majority of the pieces are 1x1 1x2 1x3 1x4 1x6 and 1x8 standard yellow bricks the set also includes yellow 1x4 1x6x2 and 1x8x2 arches yellow 2x2 2x3 and 2x4 bricks various grey plates 1x2 black inverted slopes red drawbridge pieces two classic red castle doors 8 hinges 2 for each corner and a few other nifty pieces including six red 1x1 windows a complete inventory is available at peeron 375 inventory a view from the front the drawbridge is 6x8 the front tower stands 12 13 bricks high plenty of room for horses the drawbridge does work the string originally black is attached to the opposite side between a plate and the arches the right side of the castle identical to the left ive always loved the 2x2x3 sloped bricks and corner pieces the back i love these red doors a 1x4 brick attached to the other side of the baseplate keeps intruders out that banner was the original sticker piece notice the wear the rear tower largest of the towers and backside two hinges at each of the corners allow the corners to open for playability before opening open lots of arches add to the detail of the inner walls inner front this set included 14 figs how about that for quantity unfortunately i peeled off worn stickers from the shields and the breast plates years ago the blue castle guards and knights are the keepers of the castle i still think that these helmets are the best lego ever made they just look good the black and white knights and the red knights ive always prefered to use the black and red guards and flags from the knights joust sets conclusion the yellow castle is truly a classic set and im so glad i kept the pieces to this together after all these years if you have a chance to buy one or even obtain the set instructions its worth building and wouldnt be difficult to substitute grey or other colors i hope you enjoyed this review and feel free to share your comments	positive

theme hobby sets set name harleydavidson 1000cc set number 394 price new 260280  185200 euro price used 14175  10125 euro pieces 143 year of release 1976 links peeron bricklink and brickset looking at the release date of this set makes me remember the good old times when lego sets stayed in production and could be found in stores for long years yes i hear you younger fols say this meant we had less variety at the time but at least we did not have to go on a frenzy to get them all in just 1 or 2 years before they disappeared to reappear on the secondary market at crazy prices anyway i also realise this set is older than me by 5 years at least the first boxes of this set i think my parents bought it when i was something like 12 year old or even before as my father really liked the hobby set line and took any chance to get one you know for the kids when theyâ€™ll be old enough to play with themâ€¦ i am really happy my father did it too as a matter of fact this has always been one of my favourite nonminifigure scale sets i know younger eyes will look on it and wonder how we could love and enjoy a model like this so blocky and rough just remember this was the best tlg designers could do with the bricks available at the time enough about memories letâ€™s start with the review the box front the front of the box here cut and folded to save space shows the harley davidson 1000cc in all its glory upon a nice town landscape i really appreciate how tlg box designers used a real life photo of the model in a real life environment to give this hobby set a better background moreover the landscape does not distract the eye even with its lights since the focus is strongly set on the motorbike itself back and sides the back of the box shows the model on a more neutral background and from another angle we can see the stickers in place take a good look at them here because i did not apply them the right side we also see a pic of the set from the front and one with a child playing with it in this latter shot the model rests upon a nice black box with a harley davidson sign on it i frankly do not remember if this was some sort of tray or smaller box within the lego one or if it is meant for publicity only another thing we can notice on the rightmost side of the box is a white band right below the lego logo sporting the sign â€˜designed for experienced lego buildersâ€™ in various languages all in all a really well done and professional job contents inside this set includes a number of parts in mainly black white and light grey some blue and yellow add nice touches of colour to the total the partsâ€™ selection is not mindblowing as most of the pieces had been in production in these same colours for years anyway iâ€™d like to focus on a couple of details the milky white technic axles as well as the red technic bush old 2 are among my favourite parts the bushes in particular are quite useful to build more sturdy looking tubes than what can be achieved with the newer and slimmer ones it would seem that the tile pieces appeared in the â€˜without groveâ€™ version as a standard and in the â€˜with groveâ€™ version as alternates see bricklink inventory notice though that the box above and instructionsâ€™ below pictures all show the â€˜with groveâ€™ variety as said there are no recoloured parts in this set new pieces the few new molds used in this set are black and white slope inverted 45 2 x 2 old type with round bottom tube black technic brick 1 x 2 with hole type ii and red hinge plate 2 x 4 with articulated joint â€“ male and female the most interesting piece from this lot as many of you will have noticed is the technic brick 1 x 2 with hole type ii this kind of technic brick was use during 1976 and 1977 only it would seem tlg tried a new design variant which did not meet success and was later replaced with the standard bricks again nonetheless iâ€™m sure that people who own these bricks like them for the unusual design and the possibilities they offer into adding details to their creations instructions cover â€“ as usual the instructions are not organised in the form of a booklet but they consist of a folded double printed sheet the â€˜coverâ€™ shows again the same shot as the front of the box with bigger lego logo and set number and without the other additional information â€˜back coverâ€™ â€“ here we see the full name of the set harleydavidson flh 1200 this makes me wonder why is this set known as 394 harley davidson 1000cc when it is indeed a 1200cc anyway what really makes me love this page is the list of stats below the photo and in particular these two lines hp not given this calls for just one question why did harleydavidson not release this info my opinion is that since this is a motorbike built for the police they did not have permission to share the specifications on the motor which was probably customised either by harleydavidson upon request or by the police themselves â€˜random pageâ€™ â€“ as expected no callouts here but the build is pretty straight forward and does not need them apart for one passage weâ€™ll see later the colours are easy to tell apart in the end there is no dark grey in this set that could be confused with black again notice how the instructions include the â€˜with groveâ€™ tiles and not the older ones maybe this was changed during the long time this set stayed in production the â€˜last pageâ€™ shows other four models included in the hobby set line unfortunately i own only one of them the 396 thatcher perkins locomotive indeed i would have liked to have them all building start the handle bars look a bit too squared to me but itâ€™s just a minor feature and the overall shape is still good in my opinion notice the red hinge plate which will be almost totally hidden in the finished model see below and the blue tiles which work as indicators the first steps used to build the front wheel and windshield are really easy until you get to the wheel in facts the instructions do not show clearly all the pieces needed for it and i found myself with a â€˜floatingâ€™ wheel for the absence of one of the red technic bush old 2 on one side the one not visible on the instructions of course not a big deal but something that could have been done better motor and seat the second part of the build includes the motor seat and â€˜saddle bagsâ€™ the technique used for the motor or better the radiator is very clever to get the ridged feel tlg designers used 4 light grey plates stuck one on the other but not completely in contact this way the studs while keeping the plates in position keep them raised from one another at the same time the yellow round bricks add some details and colour touches to this predominantly light grey parts of the vehicle the use of the engine smooth small 1 x 2 side plates for the exhaust pipes while quite clever still looks a bit strange to me iâ€™m mostly used to see them in airplanes helicopters and spaceships â€˜saddlebagsâ€™ a simple build for one of the iconic parts of this motorcycle here you see them in place as well as get a look at the finished seat i like how lego designers managed to make its shape with just a few quite big bricks the â€˜saddle bagsâ€™ are a really nice touch and they work perfectly when compared to the original this is the rear wheel as said before only when you get to this passage in the instruction you get a real understanding of how the front wheel is supposed to be mounted as well careful readers will notice how this is not one of the original wheels in this set the original ones were mounted using the technic gear expert builder 9 tooth unfortunately i could only find one of them in my collection an itâ€™s used as the front wheel by adding the rear wheel which is shown from a better angle in the instructions we complete the model notice how the two technic bricks supporting the wheel are held in position by two 2x1 plates i think this was a bad case of â€˜building by compartmentsâ€™ mentality if tlg designers had considered this a bit more they would have used 2 4x1 plates instead of 4 2x1 on the other hand this is not the worst case i have seen in a lego set and they keep up the tradition nowadays too finished set front and here it is our fancy police harleydavidson indeed the front looks blocky and quite horrible to our eyes but again it was almost the best that could be done at the time i only wish they had made it a little less bulky even though this build is clearly thought to give better stability to the wheel the blue tiles work nicely to emphasise the indicators the slightly unsightly red plate is normally covered by the plate sticker and the windshield albeit being hard to see through is nicely shaped back the back side is less detailed than the front but shows the red light and antenna which are typical of the police motorbikes from this period how many times have we seen this angle in the chase scenes from tv shows like â€œchipsâ€ side all in all this model looks pretty sturdy apart for the antenna which falls off all too easily and detailed especially considering the limited variety of parts available and used at the time they even got so far to put a 2x2 tile as kickstand to display it without fear of it falling on the sides bonus images size comparison what i never understood about this set is what scale it is meant to be i mean it is clearly not minifigscale and it could not be technicfigscale those came later but it is not even miniland scale moreover the only other model with the same scale is the other hobby set motorbike as the cars have a scale of their own and the thatcher uses still another one final comments overall this is a great set for collectors of old models and motorbike fans or both it does not sport a huge variety of bricks but was a good choice at the time and even if the result is matteroffact blocky when compared to the original it implements some good solutions to minimise the lego brick appearance and maximise the similarity as much as possible design  colour scheme â€“ 910 the design is as accurate as possible apart for the front mudguard maybe and the colours are completely in line for a police vehicle the solutions and details included in this set justify the â€˜expert buildersâ€™ label and add to the appearance and why not playability of the model parts  810 not a huge selection and very few new molds nonetheless a good source of black and white standard parts for mocs and one of the few sources for the extra rare technic brick 1 x 2 with hole type ii pieces playability  910 a sturdy model which can take some serious play and swooshing without falling apart the easily detachable antenna and the lack of an appropriate scale interaction with most other models make it lose one point though build  710 pretty straight forward with few nice solutions and an already mentioned slightly obscure passage in the instructions price  510 like most older models especially the hobby set and model team ones this set can be found at reasonable prices only rarely most of the times people are asked shameful prices for such a smallish set overall 810 very good as always questions comments and pic requests welcome edited by whitefang 17 april 2011  0619 pm indexed	positive
great job on this review of a unique and rare set luxorv considering the year it was released this must have been a cool set back then even up to now with all the specialized pieces and advanced building techniques i could still appreciate the beauty of this brickbuilt harleydavidson police motorbike the various elements are instantly recognizable and it even has the unusual partlystacked plates technique for the motor overall id say this is an above average set that is a musthave for any hardcore lego collector	positive
great review the set is really nice i love that the front of the motercycle can turn and the engine is just beautiful with its half stacked bricks like kieldaman said the price used or new is quite a bit but there is a good variety of bricks here like the bricks inside the wheels did you get this set from your father great review luxorv	positive

theme hobby sets set name thatcher perkins locomotive set number 396 price new 369450  258314 euro price used 100355  45250 euro pieces 434 year of release 1976 links peeron bricklink and brickset my father assures me this is the very first lego set i ever got in facts he gave it to me as a present for my first half year of course that is to say he bought it for himself and used me as the official excuse when i grew up at first i found it to be quite boring no minifigures limited play features in the end it was just a locomotive it soon went to forgottenland then when i was about 10 years old i one day found again the instructionsâ€™ â€˜bookletâ€™ and saw this bright coloured big steam engine and i suddenly wanted to build it again it would seem i finally got to the right age at least for me to appreciate the design of this great set but enough about memories letâ€™s start with the review the box front the front of the box here cut and folded to save space shows the thatcher perkins locomotive in all its glory upon a nice countryside landscape i really appreciate how tlg box designers used a real life environment made of sand gravel and pebbles to give this hobby set a better background moreover the landscape does not distract the eye since the focus is strongly set on the locomotive itself the box measures about 395 x 245 x 55 centimetres or 1556 x 965 x 217 inches this is more or less the size of the 4840  the burrow or the advent calendars back and sides the back of the box shows the model on a more neutral background and from another angle we can see the stickers in place take a good look at them here because i did not apply them the right side we also see a pic of the set from the 34 back and one with a child playing with it in this latter shot the model rests upon a nice black box with a thatcher perkins sign on it unlike the harley davidson 1000cc set the thatcher perkins does not have the sign â€˜designed for experienced lego buildersâ€™ for some reason contents inside this set includes a large number of parts mainly black blue and red with some nice yellow to lighten it up more parts of interest the partsâ€™ selection is not exceptional but weâ€™ll see this set includes some unique pieces which have not been in lego sets for long years since the 1980s like the very nice black plate modified 1 x 2 with steam engine cylinder flat surfaces black train wheel spoked for motor and the red train steam drive rod holder  train steam drive rod group the wheel spoked large as beautiful as they were saw the light from the production line for the last time in 1976 the only new mold used in this set is the black and blue slope inverted 45 2 x 2 old type with round bottom tube as you can see in the above picture this locomotive was designed to work well be played with on all kind of surfaces so the wheels sport tyres in this picture you can see how they look without the tyres of course builders can use the thatcher perkins on their brickbuilt tracks another group of interesting parts are shown in this pic red wheel spoked 2 x 2 with stud and tyre black brick modified 2 x 4 with wheels holder old clear bottom and yellow minifig head plain  stud solid many newer fans will not be familiar with the last two parts they were standard fare in a number of sets between the 1960s and early 1990s but then unfortunately they were taken out of production to be fair the replacement of the black brick modified 2 x 4 with wheels holder old clear bottom with the standard technic parts was probably due to the fact that the metal pin used to connect the wheels to these bricks had a shameful tendency at getting off the wheel too bad it could not be fixed and these parts kept in production for those interested here is a picture of the dss courtesy of peeron instructions cover â€“ as usual the instructions are not organised in the form of a booklet but they consist of a folded double printed sheet the â€˜coverâ€™ shows again the same shot as the front of the box â€˜back coverâ€™ â€“ here we see the name of the set and some additional information like the year when the first thatcher perkins started working 1863 and the type 460 of this locomotive which as shown in the image is related to the number and position of the wheels on a side note the pencil signs on the sides of the sheet were made by my father while counting the parts in the set â€˜random pageâ€™ â€“ as expected no callouts here but the build is pretty straight forward and does not need them the colours are easy to tell apart full page â€“ as you may have noticed all the building steps are drawn on one side of the â€˜bookletâ€™ making it more properly an instructionsâ€™ sheet what really makes this â€˜instruction bookletâ€™ stand out in my eyes is the fact that it is indeed a poster the building steps are all on one side while the other is a bigger image of the completed set with the name thatcher perkins in yellow enclosed in an old styled red tag building start the build starts with the base of the locomotive putting the 10 wheels in place and strengthening the engine notice the use of this â€˜illegalâ€™ technique to build the bumpers lego as we all know can be a tricky medium to build with and some details need special solutions to be completed we then start building the boiler and cabin going up fast and steady in the penultimate step we build the chimney and cow catcher iâ€™d like to spend a few more words on the chimney and how it is attached to the main body as you can see in the left picture the 3x3 base of the chimney is asymmetrical with a 3x2 base on one side and a combination of a 1x2 and a 1x1 plates on the other in the right picture you see the top of the main body where the chimney will be attached it is made of a 1x2 base and 1 1x2 tile using another â€˜illegalâ€™ technique or at least one lego designers do not like much nowadays the holes of the 3x2 plate of the chimney will connect with the studs of the 1x2 plate on the main body giving a well centred and quite sturdy build finished set front the front of the model sports 3 big headlights a nice cow catcher and the nicely detailed engine front i can almost hear it whistle side and here it is our good old thatcher perkins locomotive indeed it looks like a classic and powerful engine form one of those spaghetti western films doesnâ€™t it what i found strange in the beginning is the choice of colours i was convinced steam engines were all black at the time then i checked some pictures of the original and i must admit the resemblance is almost perfect back the back side is less detailed than the front with cabin almost devoid of details i think lego could have done a better job on it 34 front and â€¦ just see how good it looks from this angle with all the tubing moving parts and the lovely 3 headlights â€¦ 34 back the back view is not as impressive but grants us a good look at the big posterior wheels and the bumpers bonus images size comparison as i stated elsewhere i never understood what scale these hobby sets are meant to be they are clearly not minifigscale and they are not technicfigscale either but they are not even miniland scale moreover they use different scales between locomotives cars and motorbikes amongst the hobby set line as i said before the set comes with tyres on the wheels to allow a wider playing experience not limiting this model to tracks nonetheless builders can assemble their own track maybe using the vintage blue 45v tracks and make the thatcher perkins run its proper environment final comments overall this is a great set for collectors of old models and steam engines fans or both it does not sport a huge variety of bricks but was a good choice at the time and even if the result is matteroffact a bit blocky when compared to the original it implements some good solutions to minimise the lego brick appearance and maximise the similarity as much as possible design  colour scheme â€“ 810 the design is as accurate as possible and the colours are completely in line for the thatcher perkins locomotive the solutions and details included in this set justify the â€˜expert buildersâ€™ label and add to the appearance and why not playability of the model though i still wish tlg had included more details in the cabin parts  1010 quite a big selection but only one new mould nonetheless a good source of black blue and red standard parts for mocs and one of the few sources for the extra rare black plate modified 1 x 2 with steam engine cylinder flat surfaces black train wheel spoked for motor red train steam drive rod holder  train steam drive rod group and wheel spoked large playability  910 a sturdy model which can take some serious play and swooshing without falling apart the somewhat easily detachable chimney and the lack of an appropriate scale interaction with most other models make it lose one point though build  710 pretty straight forward with few nice solutions price  510 like most older models especially the hobby set and model team ones this set can only rarely be found at reasonable prices most of the times people are asked shameful prices for such a smallish set overall 810 very good more pictures can be found in this brickshelf gallery as always questions comments and pic requests welcome edited by rufus 10 july 2011  0705 pm

rare classic sets are always a priceless part of any lego collection and its a good thing you still have this first set of yours luxor or did you purchase a new one excellent review btw its always a pleasure getting a closer look at these classic sets which i wouldnt have known to exist had i not seen this review overall i think its a really good set at that time of course judging this one by modern standards wont be fair but at the time im pretty sure it was a cool set to have though less cooler than having the harley davidson set	positive

thank you very much for this wonderful review this is the oldest lego set in my collection i received this model from my grand parents many years ago  im not exactly sure who in my family it used to belong to but it has a home with me now its a very simple but attractive looking vehicle and functions pretty well too overall very nice	positive
nice review great nostalgic set like you said it has nice designsimple yet effective i like construction vehicles so this set has even bigger impact on me	positive
ah the good old daysthanks for the review yoshi648  cute and cool at the same time its interesting to see that the same front end parts had been used from the early 70s up in to the late 90s  nice again to step back in time and keep on bricking everyone 	positive
i voted outstanding regarding this set i found mine at a consignment store it was inside of a larger set from the same time period	positive
woah 25 cents for a mint condition set thats amazing	neutral
this classic space shuttle is simply superb i love the layout of this shuttle in fact it reminded me as one of the space fighter jet that roam around in space defending the boundaries from intruders i just love these old grey bricks very much and the printed computer brick is just lovely its such a pity that i did not grow up with classic space in my childhood these are actually great stuff and formed the base of the space theme in lego brickster thanks again for another outstanding classic review	positive
the computer is my favorite part sadly i dont own any classic spaceexept for some space police and a blue classic space man	positive
indexed everyone remembers their first time for me it was in 19coughsomethingsomethingcough we were at her house and her mother was gone for at least an hour she slowly unzi uhhh sorry wrong story um yeahh anyway i do remember my first time it was 1977 in late summer our neighbor who worked for a department store called famousbahr said that the main store had a travelling lego display so my family filed into the car and drove into downtown st louis to see this display to tell you the truth i dont remember much about the display itself but i do remember that my parents bought me my first lego set set  456 the spirit of st louis set  456 also sold as set  661 name spirit of st louis theme legoland  large vehicle year 1977 pieces 49 minifigs 0 price 500 usd bricklink misb start  17500 usd used complete 3500 usd links peeron bricklink brickset packaging box front the original box that my set came in was most likely trashed 5 minutes after returning home this image was lovingly stolen off of the peeron page for this set i feel lucky that i even got this much similarly i have no pictures of the plastic baggies the set came in truth be told i cant be sure that there even were plastic baggies that the parts came in the set side view well there she is my first set ever  actually i seem to recall the real spirit of st louis was silver colored not black and yellow if you need a history lesson the spirit of st louis was charles lindberghs plane when he made the first transatlantic solo flight more details can be found on the wikipedia page the overall shape is pretty close at least the cockpit window could stand to be moved forward one stud but everything seems to be relatively close the tail piece isnt the right shape but it is likely the only tail piece lego produced at the time if you look closely you can see the various bite marks that my brother and i inflicted over the years i know some people would be aghast that there are bite marks but brick separators wouldnt come out for another 10 years besides we were young we didnt know any better i certainly had no idea that it would become my obsession there are some interesting part choices here everything is brick and plate built as you might expect the same set nowadays would have lots of slope wedges and wedge plates to round things out but lego was all about the brick in 77 so bricks are what we got the black inverted slopes worked pretty well asthetically as the wing struts the wings are simple 4 x 10 plates nice and square there were no minifigs in this set if i remember correctly 1977 was just about the time when minifigs made their first appearance i know i have one other set from 77 that does include a minifg at least i dont have a lot of comments for the following photos ill let the pictures speak for themselves 34 view back back 34 top front parts interesting pieces i have no idea if there were any extra pieces that came with this set i kind of doubt it instead i took a photo of some of the interesting parts to the model that translucent white piece didnt photograph so well but it is a technic axle 8 thats right sets from 1977 contained technic elements the two black parts are the forerunners to the 1 x 2 technic brick as well everytime i hear someone on the forums complain about technic elements in system sets i think back to this set the round brick is special as well here is a closer view of it complete with bite marks  round brick as you can see the stud is closed it is only one of two closed stud 1 x 1 round bricks that i own they stopped appearing in sets in 1981 for those that are interested the dss you thought you were going to escape this heading didnt you surprise yes even in 1977 lego sets had stickers the oldest printed elements i can remember were in the classic space sets that started in 1979 again when people in the forums complain about dss in sets i can only help think of this set and chuckle to myself maniacally the sticker has held up really well considering its been stuck on the brick for 32 years no discoloration very little curling i think if all stickers held up this well over time there would be less dss complaints the ratings playability 610  the set is quite swooshable and the propellor spins outside of that though minifigs na design 610  the overall shape is quite good especially given the era the color choice leaves a lot to be desired price 110  its been retired for 30 years its going to cost you to get your hands on it overall 1330  this set is for true collectors only i cant imagine anyone wanting one because they want to play with it it was a great set back in the day but the design feels really dated and if youre wondering mine is not for sale ever all the photos plus more can be found in the gallery	neutral
great job i love reading vintage reviews as it reminds of our childhood days glad to see this in very good condition by the way i will move this to lego trains  town to see if thebrickster will like to include this set inside the review index over there i believe he is maintaining vintage town set reviews over there and this suits there well	positive
im sorry you had to move this topic white fang when it was in the reviewers academy the teachers agreed it belonged in other themes shrug i guess it ended up where it belonged eventually	neutral
great review its good to see some of the old sets reviewed i think i learned something about the history of lego from this one	neutral
fantastic review iÂ´d love to read more like this trivia about oldrare pieces is almost as fun as the set itself	neutral
outstanding review of a very special set i actually remember seeing this set on the store shelves of local department stores can you believe it fantastic review walter i really enjoy looking at these vintage sets this one deserves a blog	positive
daoudbazaar on jul 15 2009 0526 pm said  there is no 45Â° slope in the original plane design  and no front cockpit window  except that it wouldnt have been the spirit of st louis oooops youre completely right the spirit of stlouis didnt have any front window nor rear wheel anyway i think a standard ryan m1m2 plane would have been a better choice less a legend but more a flexible plan for multiple uses	negative
i really like the design it has an aesthetic value lacking from most official lego planes and follows closely to the real thing minus the colours something that cant really be claimed for more recent sets	positive
483 alpha1 rocket base year released 1979 piece count 170 minifigs 3 vehicles 1 two sections list price unknown despite the nuclear nonproliferation treaty of 1968 lego dared design a rocket base complete with a rocket system that may have had nuclear capability in 1979 luckily the rocket was defective having rather flimsy white bricks that did not stay together well during launch attempts lego scrapped its wmd program and the result was this classic blue era space set known as the alpha1 rocket base instructions on the backside of the instructions the set is featured with the space command center space cruiser and a few vehicle sets the set includes three figs and this great rocket fuel tanker heres the front section complete with computer and the rocket fuel section the set has some interesting features including the control section fuel control and launch pad on top of the control section is a nicely design radartracking system heres the open control room the launch pad and fuel control the fuel control includes two sink pieces and blue steering wheels and legos wmd weapon of mass destruction the alpha1 on the launch pad heres a shot of the launching mechanism unfortunately i have lost one of the blue sinkfaucet pieces as well as a black hose a closeup of the alpha1 rocket the white bricks never stayed together well often times coming apart within your hands the arming and guidance system was nicely designed a view of the complete set and another this is a great set the base fuel vehicle and launch platform offers a great amount of playability my only complaint is the rocket as mentioned above i dont think i ever played with it a sa kid because it always fell apart share your comments regarding this classic space set	positive
thebrickster on jul 4 2008 0414 am said a closeup of the alpha1 rocket the white bricks never stayed together well often times coming apart within your hands huh did they not think of putting a technic axle down the center of the rocket come to think of it when were technic axles invented its a neat little set makes me think i oughta make some similar kinda layout in ldd very elegant for playability	neutral

hey ebers i got my market street on monday and finished building it last night i know its not such a nice review like yoda did the last times but i hope you enjoy some of the pics first a pic of the complete building the 3 minifigs and i pic of the stairs one of my highlights at this set more pics you can find here my opinion about the set i like this set very much it was really fun to build it im happy that that i got some more cherries and a croissant now sweet  a funny idea is the salad in the one box at the front i think normally its a hairpiece of an exoforce fig i also like the colours of the house the dark blue is sooooo nice i think i have to take more of this soon the lighter blue is also nice this set has really nice details like the stairs or the owl at the entry of the market or the balcony i paid 8999 eur a fair price for a really nice set greetings sandra	positive
thanks for the review my favourite detail is the salad d btw could you exchange the modules and make pics of that id like to see how the building looks with the flat roof instead of the dutch style one im not sure though if the vents on the flat roof makes sense as long as its only used as a garage top  maybe they should be removable as the balconies and such things to make the modularity leading not to weird results other than this in combination with a lot of money and the cafe corner set this really could get me into city 	positive
thanks for the great review sweet now that ive seen the set im afraid im a bit disappointed 8 1 the color combination doesnt really do it for me blue dark blue grey black tan white theyre all mixed together without any over all design 2 is there any interior it doesnt look like it and in any case you can only reach it if you remove the modules hm  now it looks too much of a box 3 there are most certainly some nice ideas in this model and some great parts the best part of the model is the staircase 4 i dont think he spent much time in thinking about the design as apo said the chimneys on top of a garage is kinda weird theres also a gate next to another gate which is weird as well also if this is supposed to ba a grocery then the owner has done a lot to hide it the croissant is nice but next to the brown box with vegies theres nothing that suggests this is a shop 5 the white lamp and the the yellow cylinder are at the same level of the tiles imo it should be above the level of the tiles 6 imo not worth the 90 euro edited by snefroe1 20 june 2007  0903 am	negative
thanks i love the look of this set i love the mix of colours it breaks up the model rather than being a single monotone colour hes used several complimentary colours in order to make up the model i agree i think the chimneys on the flat roof is weird ontop of the garage but not so weird one you place it ontop of the building i guess hes done it to give us the choice of roofs and chimneys you can always remove the ones you dont like he also seems to have screwed up a bit on the tiling for the sidewalk on the side module on cafe corner and the building module of this set the sidewalk has the pattern light grey 1x6 at the front then dark grey 1x2 next then dark grey 2x2s however on this hes put the 2x2 tiles first then the 1x2s at the back easilly fixable though overall i love this set thanks for the pics compliments cafe corner perfectly	positive
hi thanks for posting those great pictures i got the cc some time ago and i really looking forward to get my hands on the market street i think the colour scheme of this set is great maybe because blue is my favourite colour just check my wardrobe i really like the design of the roof and the staircase i am not so sure if i like the gateways but i believe they will grow on me when i get the set myself snefroe1 on jun 20 2007 0902 am said 5 the white lamp and the the yellow cylinder are at the same level of the tiles imo it should be above the level of the tiles i am totally agree with snefreo1 the yellow cylinder and the lamppost should be on a level above the tiles actually i have put a 2x2 plat under the lamppost on my cc looks much better if you ask me unfortunately shop at home does not send to norway so i have to purchase this set in billund yes i am going to legoland this summer or on ebay	positive

here is a review of the new monster dino creator set with power functions first lets start with the box which is much larger than it needs to be it is one of the new style recloseable boxes rather than the rip the sides style this set is typical of creator and comes with three sets of instructions the monster dino a kind of spider and a crocodile the set comes with two of the new motors one small and one large a sound module plus the new ir controler and receiver there is a mix of techniques in this set the core is mainly studless technic there are some studded technic parts and most of the details are standard creator style there are two mechanisms one to control the legs and one to control the head and arms the leg drive is from the large motor and the arm and head are operated from the small motor the completed mechanism will stand on its own without any detail added the detail is added to the base unit to complete the model the operation of the dino is very good the design for the motors and drives is very compact and well thought out the walking motion works well although there is no steering and it will fall over it it encounters obstacles the sound module is built into the head so when the mouth opens the dino roars sort of glyman made the comment that this set is ugly as sin and i tend to agree i think there are too many colour variations with different shades of grey black and that lime green p which confuses the look of the finished model but i guess it might apeal more to younger kids i also do not like the spikes along the back which glow in the dark because the are loose and keep falling off this set is not cheap at 70 but i guess this is because of the motors and ir controller while on this i was surprised how good the range was on the new controller it would still operate ever when not in direct line of sight i would give this set a 1010 for playabilityit has kept the kid amused for hours i would give it 610 for value for money it is a bit pricey overall 810 it took approx 3 hours to build and has been well played with i have posted some more images and some videos of the finished models on my brickshelf page here if you have any questions please ask pete edited by whitefang 23 may 2009  0628 pm indexed	positive

thank you very much for that interesting review ickelpete y well the color schemes pretty bad and the design of that dinos a bit to blocky for my liking but the two alternative models youve builtre quiet nice at least therere a lot of possibilities coming with that set 	neutral
tks a lot for your review ickelpete  i saw that set at tru a couple of weeks ago but was really not interested due to the design  i am not a fan of those motorized lego sets  i guess the lime colour is to please kids as well as the general design far from a real dino  i am sure that its going to sell well to a younger croud let me quote you here quote the walking motion works well although there is no steering and it will fall over it it encounters obstacles hum i really hope it works welll because i will have to buy that motorized atat and i dont want it to crash p yoda	neutral
ugly as hell but an awesome parts pack worthy of purchase	neutral
 such a beauty the functions are great cool video i want to get this set so badly great review y	positive
i bought this set last night and it is great my biggest surprise was the wheels that were included i didnt even know they existed and there arent even that new back to the set he is such a cute dinosaur d since he is so tubby i think he looks like a baby i suspect my wife wanted him more than me my biggest interest in the set was to have more motors and ir parts so i could make an ir car overall i highly recomend this set but as others have said be warned that the box is very oversized i wish lego would give up on this whole 11 picture thing wacko	positive
the box is has really strange dimensions  its very flat but has a large front  the 11 scale regarding the spines because theyre made of the softer nonabs plastic the stuff the 1994 cutlasses and brown muskets were made of they lose their shape a bit and so are hard to grip they simply fall off i suppose tlc use loads of different colours because a single or twocolour dino isnt very nice to look at especially when the surface isnt very smooth  it takes your eyes away from the surface and puts it on the colours someone should make an all terrain dino that can walk everywhere from this set  i dont have the skill with technic  i always end up layering and never finish any models 	negative
i didnt spot this great review earlier thanks for the effort of posting all those pics and videos they helped me decide that this set is worth getting	positive
got this baby via shophome a little early and i though it was time to post my view of this set  snefroe you need to get this one   sorry for the lack of pics but there are already many pics online of this baby so here it is  best space set since a way too long time this is my first new space themed set since more than 20 years and i must say that i’m not disappointed at all i have much to say about this little gem first let’s cut it straight about the martians minifigures they are absolutely rubbish i can’t imagine how lego could produce such atrocity this said let’s move on to the dropship a real piece of art reminiscent of the aliens movie dropship the cockpit is spacious and provides a great field of view too bad there is no hinges to open it you must remove the canopy completely to switch pilot the drilling unit can be attached under the ship with the clever use of a rubber piece it stays well in place once attached good point some people don’t like the inclusion of the 2 containment area for the martians and crystal on both side of the ship but i kind like it it makes the ship less empty the 2 wings are complete with air intake some armaments and 1 standard launcher on the right wing normally i don’t like launchers but this one is very discrete and well integrated on the tail section are 2 thrusters that can be rotated and provide thus some “realistic” movements to the ship one of the last highlight of this ship is the landing gears or i must say landing dishes 6 medium sized radar dishes provide and incredible stability to the set they are quite sturdy and can take a beating i’m not going to review the alien spaceship in detail since it’s quite uninteresting i consider it more like a bonus addition to the set than anything else the look is passable and there are some interesting building techniques in it that’s all to end the review a little proscons table we all love proscons table   pros  incredible design  at last a decent space set  modular functions  quite sturdy  beautiful  great value for money cons  martians are rubbish  no hinges for the canopy  the drilling unit could use some more details score 910 by the way  i added a nice cool feature on my site  you can download the stickers for some sets that i own before building i always scan the stickers we never know it could come handy check this out on my site you need to go in the lego lists on the left vtx classic games	positive
mutex on jul 13 2007 1016 am said by the way  i added a nice cool feature on my site  you can download the stickers for some sets that i own before building i always scan the stickers we never know it could come handy check this out on my site you need to go in the lego lists on the left vtx classic games thats a good idea and very nice thanks mutex y nice review hmm now im pretty sure that ill have to mod that cockpit a little when i get that set	neutral
great review i must admit i didnt like mm at first site but seeing this review and looking at the mm boxes at stores appeal to me rather greatly i may get a couple of these sets great job y 	positive
ive got it also but i think ill replace the ball joint pieces with the kind of pieces that give the wings their angle	neutral
great review sweet maybe i will buy this one but not this month buying lego in billund has left me totally broke x 	positive
i like the dropship kit and got this now that i built it i see so many things i can do to tweak it to make it a moc i think this is a set everyone mm fan should get	positive
nice review	positive
of course right before i post this i see that ickelpete reviewed this set earlier in the week sorry for being redundant but it is already written so here ya go monster dino reviewed by dunamis set 4958 792 pieces 8995 from lego online store build time 35 hours here we go with another offering from the creator line im kind of fond of these sets as they are pretty imaginative and usually have instructions for multiple models i like the reusability of all the pieces and the varied things you can build the box the box that lego shipped this thing in was absolutely huge when i first got this in the mail i thought i had won the lottery and they had shipped the ucs falcon early once i opened the shipping box i was surprised to see an unusually large creator set box the box itself is pretty standard creator type box but this one shows off the power functions prominently on the right side of the box the back of the box shows some of the motorized features as well opening the box is a matter of breaking two seals were back to the reusable cereal box type tab system for those of you who stay up a night wondering about legos next box design inside the box we have a bunch of sealed bags immediately the power brick remote and motors stand out as they are each in individual bags also there are three manuals the manuals the three manuals are 76 76 and 56 pages in length they are laid out well and are pretty standard with all the usual trimmings  piece call outs for each step  parts inventory at the end of the primary model build  page numbers color separation in these manuals were fine for me interestingly the instructions for the primary build took a full manual plus about a quarter of another manual random manual photos parts list ill explain a bit more below but it would have been nice to have some written documentation on all the functions of the motors remote and receiver such as motor load guidelines and specific explanations of all the remote control functions it is severely lacking in this area the pieces obviously the pieces were most interested in are these new motors and wireless remote control note that before you fire this bad boy up you had better byob since this is prominently a european community i had better clarify my acronyms over here across the pond byob usually means bring your own beer in this case it still means bring your own beer im on my second heineken right now but in addition to numerous bottles of beer you will need a total of nine batteries to get through this set i kid you not anyway there are two motors a small and a large each with its own very unique name according to the manual the smaller one is called motor and the larger one is called xl motor very creative indeed the battery box takes six aa batteries and there are two compartments to hold them here is the first that seems pretty normal however the back side of it holds the other three batteries and it seems to be very poorly designed note in the photo above where the bottom battery is placed compare it to the previous photo and you will see the difference i played around with trying to get that bottom battery out and you better pack a lunch or byob because it is no small task why couldnt they make this compartment just like the other side there is a single power cord connector and a three position switch the middle position turns the power off and the other two positions seem to provide the same functionality in either position as far as i can tell perhaps a little blurb in the manual would have been nice to clear things up a bit the remote takes three aaa batteries it is fairly small and lightweight even with the batteries installed it has two thumb controls which could be levers if you insert technic bars or even pins the two controls are color coded and match the plugs on the receiver to control two separate motors in addition there is a four position switch which i assume changes the channel finally there are two tiny levers that seem to have no function im not sure if they are a trim control or variable speed control i messed with them and didnt notice any difference in the motor speed again some documentation from the incredibly verbose lego manual would have helped as far as the rest of the parts its really a mixed bag there are a lot of varied parts in this set to the point that there is almost one of everything lots of technic gears pins studded beams studless beams axles wheels etc also lots of little 1x1 slopes in various colors teeth horns etc you cant really say it is a parts pack because there is not enough of one thing to make it a parts pack a couple of notes it seems the quality control issue on the axles has been fixed i initially reported this back when i reviewed the 8285 about a year ago all the axles worked fine for me the color quality control issue is still alive check out the different shade of red in these two parts also included is the sound brick this looks just like the other sound or lightup bricks we have been seeing lately it does have a load dinosaur roar sound embedded in it though so hide the younglings if they are a bit on the skittish side finally ive never seen one of these before although someone will no doubt rattle off a dozen sets where you can find this part in about 5 seconds no i am not referring to the studded beam i put that in the photo for scale the build the build was fun and was fairly straightforward as i mentioned there is a lot of technic parts so if you are not a fan of the technic line you should run not walk away from this one there were no gotchas to speak of but you need to pay careful attention to the placement of the wires that go from the motors to the receiver they kind of sneak them around a bit so watch closely otherwise it was fine here is what is left over so far i have only built the primary model as seen on the box there are instructions for two more models both of the other models seem less complex than the primary model and are likely quicker builds the dino took me about 35 hours which included some time to screw around with the motors im an old school technic fan from way back in the 80s so i had some familiarity with the old technic motors obviously 25 years has improved some things and these seem much more powerful the design if you have built the 4507 prehistoric creatures then some of the design will feel familiar especially the head and tail it is almost like they took the dinosaur from that set and figured out how to motorize it this is not necessarily a bad thing just a comment the set does a good job of showing off the features of the new motors and remote it is nice to see how one motor can perform multiple functions in this case the small motor makes both arms move and opens and closes the mouth of the dinosaur when the mouth is completely open it pushes the activation switch on the sound brick which emits the roar sound pretty cool the xl motor handles the walking feature of the dinosaur there is both forward and reverse forward works really well while the reverse just makes the dinosaur look like he is doing a michael jackson moon walk wow i never thought i would use michael jacksons name in a lego dinosaur set review it is almost like the dinosaur cant get traction going in reverse however as noted previously forward works really well this guy actually gets going at a pretty good clip as you might expect he kind of waddles like a duck since there is no articulation in the knees it is a bit awkward but it works the xl motor seems to kick out plenty of power overall the design seems to be a mixed bag the way the tail is attached seems to be an afterthought the arms look to be too small however the walking mechanism and legsfeet are pretty cool as well as the head and mouth i guess it is a reasonable effort to get people introduced to the parts and well see designs improve as time goes on here are a few views of our new friend but what about the atat of course the real reason you are reading this is that you hope i will have some epiphany on how all this relates to the new walking atat judging from the box on the atat it looks like we get one motor i dont see the remote which is a disappointment as i hope it is not controlled by a switch on the body and you either turn the atat on or off if that is the case the first thing i am doing is scavenging the receiver and remote from this set to add to the atat granted it could be that it comes with a remote but is just not seen on the box also the atat box looks like one of the images shows that the head turns i sure hope this is controlled separately as it would be really lame to not be able to control this independently from the walking feature im kind of skeptical on the walking feature of the atat i suspect it will be rather cumbersome but hopefully i will be pleasantly surprised needless to say this is all speculation but those are my initial thoughts based on this set overall thoughts its an ok set kind of pricy but i suspect a large part of that is due to the motors and remote i havent built the other two models they seem less interesting to me but at least it has some variability also you get a ton of different parts which can either be a good thing or bad thing depending on what you are looking for the dinosaur is average the color selection is marginal black and lime green and the tail section is just lame i appreciate it more for the mechanical functions and how the motorized parts work it does do a good job of waking up my dog who seems pretty irritated by it it is a nice set to show off to the neighbors or the endless caravan of my wifes friends that seem to materialize out of nowhere people are quickly impressed by it and then promptly move along once you start trying to explain how it all works im a bit disappointed that the manual did not explain more about the remote and motor functions i suspect that there is more than meets the eye and ill just have to play around with it to find out it would be nice if lego had a website that showed all the cool functions of the motors and remotes so we fully understand the capabilities final rating 72 build 910 pretty quick and fun the mechanical part is cool functionality 610 it is a creator set so you have multiple builds as far as it being a dinosaur its just ok motorized parts are cool though design 610 partly cloudy some things are cool others are lame parts 810 new motors and remote are cool lots of varied parts included but nothing to write home about price 710 it is kind of expensive edited by whitefang 23 may 2009  0623 pm indexed	negative
a very nice review thanks dunamis y i really dont understand that color scheme but the new motorsre very interesting well that dino is just mediocre to me i think that the new technic bulldozer is much more interesting	neutral
ickelpete on jul 13 2007 1106 pm said great review dunamis i hope you have as much fun with this as i have one point yes they are new axles they have appeared in a few sets this year yes the kids seem to love it as you pointed out and the wife still thinks i am crazy so its all good i read your review after i posted mine seems like we shared the same thoughts on a majority of it i always think it is good to have multiple opinions on sets as it gives the community more data points to evaluate a given set	positive
i already made my 5 cents to this horrible colour bastard x x x in ickelpetes thread but i wanted to clarify about this dunamis on jul 13 2007 1041 pm said finally ive never seen one of these before although someone will no doubt rattle off a dozen sets where you can find this part in about 5 seconds heres one of the sets its included in it didnt even take me 5 seconds  p	negative
thanks for the bonus review i am still on the fence with this one so every opinion is good dunamis on jul 14 2007 0741 am said but what about the atat in case you dont know the atat in the dark side development kit had a single motor and a moving head it worked by the head simply swinging from side to side due to balence shifts i suspect the atat will be same i also think that there will be no remote for it either edited by sinner 14 july 2007  1131 am	positive
thats a nice looking dino set there great review dunamis also on this side of the border see that big thing above the us thats canada where im from byob still means bring your own beer my uncle is already on his third molsons edited by lieutenant colonel thok 14 july 2007  0221 pm	positive
oh is he ugly or what ive never seen a dino that needed to go on a diet more then him d but id get him for the pieces all those limegreen pieces drools but meh im not really in to mindstorms so i dont think id get this but anyway nice review i now know exactly what hes like kml	negative
wowthat set is really something but i prefer pehistoric power and triceratops or are they the same i can never tell	positive
awesome reveiw thanks i gotta get this one y wub	positive
paulc on nov 4 2007 0221 pm said i kind of like the design of this but more importantly i really want to get my hands on the power functions motors and ir control system id prefer the 8275 technic bulldozer but theres no way i can stretch to the 100 price tag so i was thinking i would have to see if i could get a 4958 monster dino cheap in the january sales if you really want the power functions the bulldozer is better value as you get two large motors two small motors and two receivers compared to the one in the dino set alos watch toysrus and argos both have had the bulldozer for 7075 in there pre christmas sales usually for a week only i am hopeing they will be on sale soon as i want a second bulldozer to get some more motors	neutral
i ended up buying both this and the dozer  i plan on using my dino for a ir car in a month or two	neutral
this is both my first set review and post about a star wars set even though i have been collecting them since 99 i got this one early this year so i thought i would post a review on it please bare with me i am not a great photographer so with that in mind here goes front of the box 75083 atdp boxfront by whitesidewjw on flickr back of the box 75083 atdp box back by whitesidewjw on flickr shot of the bags 75083 atdp bags by whitesidewjw on flickr the sticker sheet i normally dont apply them but for this i am going ahead and putting them on 75083 atdp sticker sheet by whitesidewjw on flickr minifigs i really like the two atdp pilots but the best agent kallus really does shine of course we get an extra stormtrooper 75083 atdp minifigs by whitesidewjw on flickr no new molds in this as far as i can tell however these printed 4x4 domes are really great i can see lots of uses for these in space mocs 75083 atdp new printed elements by whitesidewjw on flickr bag1 complete nothing earth shattering here an easy build 75083 atdp bag 1 complete by whitesidewjw on flickr bag 2 complete 75083 atdp bag 2 complete cockpit seats by whitesidewjw on flickr cockpit assembly 75083 atdp cockpit assembly by whitesidewjw on flickr bag 2 complete 75083 atdp bag3 complete by whitesidewjw on flickr foot assembly i like how they positioned the slopes 75083 atdp foot assembly by whitesidewjw on flickr complete atdp 75083 atdp complete by whitesidewjw on flickr complete atdpside view 75083 atdp side view complete by whitesidewjw on flickr complete atdp over view 75083 atdp complete overview by whitesidewjw on flickr complete atdp rear view 75083 atdp rear view by whitesidewjw on flickr extra pieces 75083 atdp extra pieces by whitesidewjw on flickr the verdict minifigs 55 we get a total of four figs i like the two atdp pilots and agent kallus is a well done minifig i can complain about another storm trooper either parts 35 other than the dome pieces i commented on before there is really not any new parts in this if you build space star wars or machinery this will still be a welcome assortment experience of build 45 this really was a fun build it came together fast but was challenging enough for its target age group playability 55 this thing is much more sturdy than it looks the legs take a little bit of effort due to the double locking hinges but hold together very wellthis is a very minor complaint value 45 typical 4999 for 500 pieces i must admit i paid a little more than msrp due to shipping but i cant complain about the value overall 2125 i really believe this is one of the best walkers that lego has designed the only changes i would make would be adding real control panels in the cockpit and it would be nice if lego made a real widow to fit in with these types of builds rather than a transparent tile over another plate all in all i would recommend this set and i hope the rest of the 2015 star wars sets are on par with this	positive
thanks for the early review i dont know much about the rebals show at all but i can say that the over all design of the walker really appeals to me and the minifigs look top notch i also like how the spring shooters are pretty much hidden in the frame nice job	positive
looks really nice one complaint is the back it is a pitty that lego didnt use any plates greebling there	negative
great review thanks for doing it im a big fan of this set the minifigures are good as is the parts selection i like the piece used in the cockpit to secure the minifigure in place i wouldve liked to see some panels in the cockpit though rather than translucent red pieces that said however they are useful pieces	positive
pretty good first review this looks pretty great i probably wont be getting it due to budget constraints bionicle but still very nice set to me it kinda looks like the missing link between when the atst evolved into the atat also i know the rebels stormtroopers get a lot of hate but i really like them thanks for the review	positive
great first review as a huge walker fan its great to get one thats not a redesign or one of those tiny battlepack vechicles	positive
flieger on 24 december 2014  0304 am said thanks for the review i have two questions  what is the driver standing on when the hatch is open and he is looking out  could you show the face of kallus without helmet please my only complaint is that the colours of both kalluss and the driverss uniforms are wrong kalluss uniform is way too dark and should be more dark olive than black and the driverss uniforms are too bright and should be more greyish compared to what we saw in the series here are the pics of kallus his head would be good for a steampunk character agent kallus front by whitesidewjw on flickr agent kallus back by whitesidewjw on flickr the driver isnt really standing on anything he is just kind of wedged in there irispen on 24 december 2014  0420 am said whats behind the printed 4x4 dome is that 2x4 yellow plate im planning to replace that yes there are several yellow accents on this however in person it looks really good edited by whitswj 24 december 2014  0255 pm	neutral

smitty500 on 25 december 2014  0721 am said awesome i am really looking forward to buy this but is it really 5000 us i was hoping more around 3000 i mean it fits the 10 cents per piece count and has 4 figures so for a licensed theme you cant beat that but i guess lego can never satisfy everyone	neutral

thanks for the early review how tall is this next to the most recent recreation of the atat im picturing the two of them standing next to each other looking silly due to the scale differences	neutral
its a different helmet ezras is an imperial cadet helmet the same one he wears in breaking ranks	neutral
thanks for the review and pics this is a really nice looking walker one question  how snug are the atdp drivers sitting in their seats the cockpit looks good actually im not crazy about the atdp helmets on the show but i dig the minifigs good stuff awesome facial hair for kallus	neutral

hi i need some helpwhen i atach the pod to the place where the legs are placed the small piece that unites the pod to the legs is loos from the bottom so the top of the walker just moves around freely wich is different from every video review that i have seen where they can rotate the pod but its not loose the small piece that serves as the axis isnt staying locked on the bottom piece and i have reassembled it all and still its the same  help edit sorry i found out what went wrongdidnt push hard enough d edited by mrpinache 05 july 2015  1210 am	neutral

brilliant review and thanks for plenty of detailed shots of the interior i may invest in this set but ill have to wait until 2015 star wars is sorted and budget for the arrival of pirates in april	positive
how was the pool table legs made	neutral
firstly great review  i was really on the fence on this one this review has greatly changed my view on this modular a definite buy for me love the interiors and the whole concept the more i see it the more i see the little features which put this set apart or at least slightly different from the others of course great playability for the younger lot and i think a nice building to give any lego city more character and colour	positive
great review oky i really love your introduction text you put a lot of effort in this review with lots of nice touches well done for me the set gets 4 out of 5 its a great set but theres something preventing me of giving it 5 stars	positive
wow that is the best start to a review i have ever seen great job oky amazing set ill be picking it up this weekend	positive
great review oky i managed to pick this set up a few days ago and i must say it might be my favorite modular yet for the feel alone the pool hall barbershop and the detectives office itself are all wonderfully designed	positive
can you please take some picturesexplain how the water tower is built i understand that there are some tank treads bot how exactly and it is there can be only one edited by yooha 01 january 2015  0714 pm	neutral
great review the intro was great but im still not convinced on this one the height seems too small for comparison with the rest of the modulars the play features are ok but i wish it would have been taller	negative
nice review thanks a lot managed to improve my opinion of the set a bit but im still getting two to build larger buirldings as soon as we get the next 2x vip points special	neutral
thank you for the review it was very interesting and changed my opinion of the set im now considering a future purchase  just one question the mirror is on cardboard i was hoping for it to be a window piece with a mirror on one side i hope its not the same cardboard we had on some of the early harry potter sets or the element wont last long	neutral
thank you for the great review of this set im also curious for the backside of the mirror	neutral
snaplock on 01 january 2015  0740 pm said totally agree with you the height does seem rather small also 2x buildings on a 32x32 baseplate with a lots of spare studs behind the buildings are these buildings 12 studs in width it still looks great style wise however this might be a set i buy and look at it after i have built it  regret the amount of  i have spent on it 239 for us aussies  both are are 14 deep on the upper floors do is 3 studs deeper on the ground floor buit thats pretty much it cant believe how cramped the upper floors of the barber shop look weve come a long way from the wide and empty halls of cc and gg	neutral
amazing review very thorough with lots of details	positive
thank you for the amazing and really wellreadable review makes me want to get the set even more	positive
thanks very much i love it wub  it needs tweaking but isnt that half the fun incidentally when people were calling it rhino i thought it was just a reference to captain scarlet seeing the stickers in the middle made me realise my mistake buy buy buy	positive
thanks dude this is a great set can you please take more pictures thanks	positive
seems like they infuse system sets with more technic bars must be that technic isnt selling too well and they want to educate ppl how cool technic can be p its quite apparent when even the small bike needed technic frame	neutral
thanks for that very interesting review snefroe1 y that vehicle looks really nice with a lot of playability but too much technic brick construction for my liking it seems like theres pretty much space wasted inside of it some kind of small laboratory or a room for the crew and at least a mining toolshed wouldve been cool	neutral
awesome review if i pick up any mm sets it will definately be this one	positive
i echo the consensus of this thread  too much technic looks great too expensive looks great	neutral
please build the alien craft im sure that we would all like a review of that 	neutral
sinner on jul 15 2007 0102 pm said incidentally when people were calling it rhino i thought it was just a reference to captain scarlet yeah me too thats a great programme is it not and i mean both new and old anyway i like this ill probably get it when it finally becomes available in the uk i think theres a few things ill mod but overall its very nice although its interesting and slightly creepy how much the lights at the front look like eyes and as ive said many a time before i love the motorbike edited by brainbox 16 july 2007  0111 pm	positive

the life on mars theme was so much better with the aliens dominating mars instead of the humans and the aliens were so much better with their own names etc good times anyway i think this is the best set in the series it looks so neat and reminds me of the pelican form halo xd edited by iamded 31 august 2007  0511 am	positive
i agree iamded life on mars while not even that truly great was far better than this line  i am hoping the next space line lego does takes place in just that space  by the way iamded i continue to stalk you batbrick away 	negative
i think the life on mars series was great although i didnt click until the line was gone that the red hangar on the alien base was for the red mech and same with the blue one man i was gutted when i realised that i want those mechs however the base was great with the small mech and the flying crafts could the lom mechs have been the spark of life for exoforce 8 edited by iamded 31 august 2007  0515 am	positive
lego 41062 elsas sparkling ice castle lego managed to get a frozen licensed set in the new wave of disney princess sets however im very surprised by the size its a 40 set and comes in a small friendsstyle box roughly 12x12 size  i almost didnt see it on the shelf when i was looking for it because its so small i mean i know its only 40 but its a friggin castle and why did lego only make this a smaller set if theyd made a 200 frozen castle they still would have sold every one they could produce they made big harry potter hogwarts sets and those sure sold and have you seen the toys in the frozen section of stores huge playsets for barbiesized dolls but i suppose im getting the cart before the horse here reviewing before ive even opened the box so name elsas sparkling ice castle set number 41062 pieces 292 price 3999 minifigs 3 theme disney princess year of release 2015 links bricklink peeron brickset the box the front of the box is standard lego fare other than the large anna and elsa in the bottom right corner oh and surprisingly nowhere on the box is the normal minifig lineup the only way to know what characters are included is to look at the set pictures the 11 this set uses one of the minidolls as the actual size sample thats probably not a bad choice since the minidolls are not nearly as well known as a minifig the back on the back the play features are shown in insets around a rear view of the castle like friends sets you also have an array of play accessories the seals is this standard on 2015 sets or is this specific to this set ive never seen 3 tape seals on a set even huge modulars or technic sets only have 2 so 3 on a set this small seems excessive perhaps lego expects people to try to steal the dolls if so why bother with extra tape a tiny pocketknife makes quick work of the tape so the third strip doesnt even slow you down the contents in the box are 2 instruction booklets bent a white plate a sticker sheet and 3 numbered bags of parts the stickers these are very hard to photograph since theyre shiny i mean polished chrome shiny those dark lines across the corners are not really there theyre reflections of my ceiling the manual backs the back of one booklet has a friends win girl the other has an ad for the lego disney princess website that site is so girly theres even sparkles following your mouse cursor around so i didnt stay too long or look too deeply the sample page the interior pages of the manuals are on lavender backgrounds its standard lego instructions with part callouts and insets when needed the build 1 the first thing you build is anna but im not showing that yet then you build this little picnic scene its tiny but effective and nice to have something not icy in the set since the movie has the in summer song for olaf im curious whats in that sandwich though  green and pink after the picnic is the olaf build but ill save him for later too the build 2 next is this small sleigh it has an amazing amount of style for something so small the curved front and decorative whips on the back make it look sleighlike instead of blocky but come on it already had pink accents are the pink flowers really necessary technically yes so the whips can mount to them but still its just overgirly for my taste the build 3 the sleigh needs a ramp to help it rocket along for a couple inches at least the ramp starts like this with a hidden lime green jumper plate that gets a cookie on it i couldnt remember anything in the movie like that so i asked my wife and she couldnt either a hidden cookie under a hill the build 4 after putting the tilting 2x8 onto the base and adding decorations this is the result a lime green bucket holding a pair of ice skates a flower in the snow really green and white round studs that i assume are supposed to be grass and snow the build 5 the sleigh looks huge sitting on top of the tiny hill but it actually works pretty well assuming youre on a smooth surface like a table you can give the sleigh a little nudge and itll shoot down the ramp and a few inches across the table the unevenness of the slopes vs the blue tiles holds the sleigh in line well and the bumps in the slopes dont seem to hamper anything the build 6 moving on to bag 2 man thats a lot of colors in this base already and im already starting to feel like theres transblue cheese thrown around randomly the build 7 continuing and rotating some steps and even more colors thrown in magenta in elsas ice palace i sure dont remember any of that the build 8 wait seriously an ice cream stand in the castle that is what the magenta is for i kinda actually like the looks of it but it doesnt fit the set the build 9 spinning back around now theres a light aqua spiral staircase added along with a roof this is where im really starting to wonder about legos thinking those light aqua stairs and the light aqua 1x4 tiles are exclusive to this set as far as i know its possible some other 2015 sets use them but nothing in bricklink yet seems expensive to produce to me when theres no huge reason to need them another blue for the tiles would have been fine and the spiral stairs really elsas castle is known for staircases but not spiral ones there should be a huge straight ice stairway out front or sweeping curved stairs inside but not a spiral the build 10 and now we finish the tree again why where is there a tree next to elsas castle and so weird with ice hanging from green branches that have both snow and flowers on them huh did lego watch a different movie the translight blue bits before looking at the upper level a brief pause to look at some other parts heres the 1x2x5 brick in translight blue and the 2x4x6 rock panel in glitter translight blue do those look like the same blue to you and again another unique part for this set why do those rock panels need to be glitter when lego made the same panel in trans light blue in 2013 and 2014 for superheroes friends and chima sets apparently disney really wanted glitter because there are a bunch of transglitter parts in the new princess sets theres transneon green cones for jasmine ariel jasmine and sleeping beauty all get glitter trans purple cones so theres a bunch of new glitter parts for 2015 the build 11 back to building  time to add the upper level we get a bedroom with a decent bed although stickered the build 12 the other side of the bedroom has some little accessories perfume and a crown i assume the build 13 time for walls and a roof i like the small white macaroni bricks for a wall but whats with the lavender fence piece in the center ill grant that it looks nice a common white fence would have been a little boring but its another unique piece to this set the build 14 the very top of the castle is built separately not a whole lot to say here other than why is there a torch in an ice castle the finished castle once the roof is put on the castle is done and that big purple star on top says everything to me about the styling it just doesnt look like modern lego to me it looks like this should be an old belville fairy tale set from around 1999 if i saw a photo of just the castle with no figs or picnic blanket id assume thats what it was the oops not actually done yet accessories at the end theres a few bits left to add there are these dark purple skis yup another unique part in the lower level let me tell you theyre a pain to get into that location at least with my big man hands more accessories the top level gets a stickered book the sticker has a nice castle image on it that is while not quite exactly the castle from disney world very disneylooking i actually had to google and see if thats the castle they use in their logo nope but its the same style the leftovers there are a lot of extra parts in this thats almost 10 of the part count in the set right there they are pretty useful overall though its great to have an extra carrot and brown branch for olaf since you know those will get lost as hes played with the figs finally the reason for the set lets face it the castle set is just an excuse to make these figures and theyre great i mean just fantastic the print on them is just such a good match to the real characters compare to the cartoon version from the front of the box elsas hair is a little darker than the cartoon but overall these are just dead on if i had to pick out a flaw its the spell elsa is holding its too bad she can only shoot it forward with her arm down like that itd be nice to have the end of the splash part bent 90 degrees so she can have her arm forward and the spell shooting forward too oh one other thing the minidoll heads dont press down tight to the body like minifig heads do theres still exposed neck it looks nice but it means elsas cape can swing around the fig backs elsas cape is glittery on the back and you can see the removable bow in her hair the full set one final issue when you put anna on the sleigh her cape doesnt have enough flexibility since its a wraparound kind and so it folds out funny thats why on the back of the box it shows her standing on the back of the sleigh with elsa in the seat edit how on earth did i forget to comment on those orange flowers to each side of the castle im pretty sure elsa did not have any flowers blooming outside her castle the conclusion hm i really wanted to like this set but i just cant quite bring myself to it feels like lego pulled a random castle design from the files then redid it into white and trans blue to look icy and allow a frozen tie in set the figs are great but the castle isnt i guess the real castle in the movie would be a boring set and this one has play features but it just is too different for my taste the ratings value 710  40 for less than 300 parts is high especially when so many of the parts are tiny but on the other hand theres a lot of rock panels and 1x2x5 trans blue panels but the figs help save it design 410  not one of legos best not as bad as the lows in the 90s but not a great set minifigs 1010  possibly even a 1210 they are the reason to buy the set  playability 810  there are a bunch of play features but they actually detract from the design so i had to knock off a couple points parts 710  a bunch of impractical unique parts how often do you need dark purple skis or a lavender fence piece but also a bunch of nice parts if you wanted to make your own icy scene overall 710  a great bunch of figs but id recommend not bothering with the manuals just use the parts to build your own castle thats better	neutral
very nice review mostlytechinc once i saw this set i was interested in it for the colours and piecesthanks for this review to shed more light onto it	positive
vorkosigan on 09 january 2015  1229 am said isnt getting parts in new colors a good thing it is a shame there is only this one set i think tlg could make a whole subtheme out of frozen i do agree that they overuse lavender and magenta i dont see why every girl set has to have these sort of colors instead of what would be accurate to the source material  sure new colors are good but cramming a bunch of oddball ones into a single set where they dont even make sense just seems financially unwise for lego id rather have seen a larger set than light aqua spiral staircase parts or lavender tiny fences lego made the stairs in dark purple last year for rapunzels tower and those probably would have been ok here or make them in a more useful color like white	neutral
thanks for the review mostlytechnic i too wish they had done a real castle for this set it certainly deserved it my sons and i figure they could have used the old rock monster mold from rock raiders in white for the missing snow beast i will pick it up though for the figs and unique pieces	positive
thanks for the review i have the same opinion about the design looks like belville i bought it on legostore orlando december 30th it was impressive my wife saw them putting on shelf 8 or 10 boxes she ran and grabbed the last one the girls faces around it was indescribable mix of ecstasy and afraid to loose it it happened in less than 2 minutes my 7 yo girl didnt want it she likes the dresses but hates the movie prefers lego movie but my 2 yo girl who never saw the movie grabbed it for good and we bought it lego will sell it like water but i do not understand why a set so small it is the worst set design since the introduction of lego friends my 7 yo has more than 50 lego friends minifigures all the lego fiends stores and concluded that the castle had a terrible design she is 7 lets be honest lego should have released this sets months before this christmas and is loosing a perfect opportunity to sell a decent set with much more pieces i am wondering if they are going to make another set with the same characters at the end it is just for the minifigures	negative
when i first saw the pictures i didnt realize that this set had so much color barf going on in it also there is a bunch of stuff that does not fit in with the movie and it is pricey the minifigures are nice but no kristoff or sven i thought about getting this but this review is pushing me towards no	negative
yep my family all thinks they should have made a bigger set added figs and just been printing money this feels massively rushed into production which is weird the other princess sets that just came out look worlds better	negative
i wish elsa had more of a white hairpiece rather than blonde but it could be worse not a bad set overall although olaf doesnt look right without the twigs on his head anna is a really nice and accurate fig	positive
the review is very well done thanks i dont know the movie my key question is whether the bricks in the set will allow to build my own snowice creations now with transglitter being part of the design approach i am not so sure can those who have already bought it tell me can transglitter be used as transparent with snow particles or is it just terrible i cannot really tell from the review pic above	neutral
i think the transglitter blue panels can be icy or snowy just fine im sure thats why they used them for this set now if youre looking for realism like the photos in your sig seem to be it might be tougher but ive been thinking about using those big glittery panels to make a waterfalltype scene	positive
very nice review indeed and i also cant wait for the release of this set it will be a superb wonderful addition to the lego disney princess theme	positive

bennemans on 13 january 2015  0608 pm said there is a very simple reason for the flowers and greenleaved trees you should remember from the movie it was actually summer when elsa set of the eternal winter… true but all around her ice castle it is all winter so why are there nonwinter bits in this set doesnt make sense the picnic is because they wanted a minivignette for olaf to fit into but the rest of the green and flowers dont make sense tenorikuma on 13 january 2015  0958 am said im pretty sure ive gotten other sets recently with three pieces of tape on them cool good to know was wondering but havent remembered to look when im at a store recently whitefang on 13 january 2015  0912 am said very nice review indeed and i also cant wait for the release of this set it will be a superb wonderful addition to the lego disney princess theme thanks for the fp but a lovely sweet review i thought i bashed this set pretty hard	negative

hello everyone i am back to share with all of you another of my legends of chima polybags review it will be pretty comprehensive since the finished built will be quick and will be focusing more of what kind of fun that you can derive from there this polybag was bought in september 2013 when i visited legoland malaysia and i did not hesitate to put this in my shopping basket name 30253 leonidas jungle dragster theme lego system  legends of chima year 2013 pieces 30 minifigs 1 minifigure price usd na gbp na euro na sgd na resources brickset bricklink an original polybag image of the 30253 leonidas jungle dragster back view of the original polybag image of the 30253 leonidas jungle dragster the road scout of the lions tribe this polybag design is definitely plan to be the quickest and fastest dragster to recce enemy front by making a swift scout for the lions tribe i believe by the sound of the name jungle dragster it might just be suitable to use in jungle terrain well i dont quite agree that this is a dragster even though it has the kind of open view concept of rolling in fast but it does not have the length of a typical dragster similar to this town polybag design for example still it is nice to have smaller variants of their vehicular supremacy instruction manual front instruction manual back the lego building content with just 30 lego elements you can be pretty quick to be able to display these laid out content after the built is completed these are the remaining spare parts i am fond of the wheels which are some useful parts other than that there are nothing spectacular about it my name is leonidas and i belonged to the lions tribe do not be mistaken of his name leonidas to be the king of sparta who led the brave men of 300 spartans warriors to fight to the death against the persians instead this character is based on the bio resided in legocom you will realise that he is aligned with the lions tribe and is a proud lion footsoldier he may have that goofy idiotic look but he can be very serious in his commitment to discharging his duties you are able to observe his nice back view printing which reveal his black and blue sash leonidas has a dual facial feature to reveal his much serious appearance leonidas is one of the common characters available in the legends of chima universe it can be found in a total of five sets it is a great pity that there is no weapon being made for him in this polybag design which will certainly make a fine addition the completed built of the jungle dragster this is the main design of the jungle dragster which is very simple looking there is no distinct fighting capability from the vehicular design and it look just like a regular patrol vehicle one thing i like about this is the close distinct colour schema of the lions tribe other than that there is nothing special about it moving off with my jungle dragster to conclude this polybag is really meant for lego fans or collectors who appreciate legends of chima or wanting to sample the legends of chima theme it is a very simple built but yet could form a decent force size for recce purposes before sending in the big arsenals to whack their enemies either way i will only suggest you to buy it if you really love this theme at an inexpensive price otherwise it is perfectly alright to give this a miss summary review playability 410 you need to have more lions tribe vehicles in order to bring the best and fun out of it since this is more of a supporting vehicle design 410 simplistic built of the dragster and main focus is just acquiring the minifigure price 410 bought at about usd7 which is not an awesome price so get it if you can get it more than half of this price overall 410 if only you are a huge mega fan of the legends of chima then you need to get this i gave it a 2 based on my review score card what about yours i hope every one of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine comments and criticisms are strongly welcomed pictures can be found in my flickr	negative

when i first saw pics of the biplane i wasnt sure if i liked it or not but after seeing it in more detail i gotta say i love the thing wub its a great plane with so many good aspects its also the perfect counter vehicle for the new batplane for me though the best part of the set has got to be the new pumpkin heads those are just beautiful and i cant wait to get lots of them	positive
christian on jul 18 2007 0821 pm said i would love to have this set but the price is just to high here far worse than i had expected ill be better off buying the battank which is much better priced actually there is almost no price difference between the batcopter and the battank here wacko that is insane wacko 450 and 500 indeed you should just buy the tank comparing the price of the tank to the batwing you seem to be getting quite a good deal there both are over priced for australians and the tank is twice the price of the copter they are 60 aud and 120 aud i am still not sure if i will buy either  edited by sinner 18 july 2007  1147 am	negative

7665 review part 2 the second half of the build goes quicker than the first once you start to add the engines the ship really begins to take shape the main body of the ship has a few surprises hidden away under a removable cover inside you get some retracting guns a storage box a little shuttle and space for a droid and figure here is everything you can fit inside the guns are concealed behind the side vents pushing them forward causes the vents to open closed and open the final feature is the passenger areaescape pod inside is plenty of space for two figures the pod cleverly attaches by pushing the front section of the ship forward sliding the pod in then returning the front everything locks together and is held securely in place by an elastic band  heres a couple of pictures of the final model its not the most beautiful creation ever but it is an excellent representation of the ship from the film the angular shape actually suits a lego build well theres one more useful feature the whole ship can be safely and comfortably picked up by two ball ended technic pins towards the back end it balances well at this point and does allow you to swoosh the ship around much more easily this was the most enjoyable star wars build ive had in a long time everything progresses nicely with almost no repetitive bits the ship looks good and is also huge sweet compare it to the 6211 isd and youll see its only fractionally smaller when i first saw pictures of this on the internet i thought it looked ok once you see it for real it is much more impressive for 6999 in the uk im not complaining its the best value star wars set of the year so far to conclude pieces 910 minifigures 710 would be a 9 apart from the stupid quigonobiwan head error playability 810 originality 910 set design 810 overall 8210 the box says this is a limited edition set whatever that means so if youre planning to get it id suggest you grab it at the first opportunity im glad i did xd edited by kernow 22 july 2007  1056 pm	positive

shakar on aug 1 2007 0134 pm said third note is it just me or did you attach the two black gate pieces too high shakar no i think this is correct the upper plate with clip for the door is a little high on top of a dark gray 1x1 brick so if you want the door to operate well you have to place it like that i just put the clip under that brick a very easy fix so my door now is lower which looks better imho and no sneaky skelly can crawl along under it xd	neutral
not sure i like this one much i like many of the new parts but the boat isnt that great and i would rather get each seperately so i can avoid the whole skeleton army nice review though	positive

yes very nice review mr brickster i think i  for a change like the castle part better the ship doesnt look quite right to me if theyre gonna make a pirate theme with ships like this i wouldnt be very happy but i think the ship brings some nice accesories like the anchor a black mid piece steering wheel etc i think ill buy it eventually wout on aug 1 2007 0819 pm said nice review i like the buildingport the most mmmdark blue plates wub pity it is a toysrus exclusive in the netherlands there are only toysrusses in the greater cities ah thats good to know now i wont be searching in other toystores as well thanks mr tiber	positive

ok here is the set alot of us star wars fans have been waiting for the 7666 hoth rebel base wub first the box now the great minifigs that stunning k3po fig now the snowspeeder aaaaggghhhhh these parts are all stickers now for the turret the 2 cones on the side press in to fire out 2 blue lights saber blades d now for the small crane thingy yes the part under the engine on the snowspeeder is another sticker 8 echo base well the front door anyway d  the main control room d again these are stickers on a tinted clear panel and on the slope  i have no idea what this is meant to be d finally 2 shots of the full set wub well over all i really like this set and think it is great value for money the minifigs alone would set you back more than the cost of this set the build time was a good 2 hours or so and was good fun the snowspeeder is not as good as the second snowspeeder and no where near as good as the first in my opinion but i did love that first one the k3po fig is perfect and it is good to be getting more droids that arent r2d2 and c3po it is a shame about the stickers but that is the price of keeping the cost down i suppose the only printed part in the whole set is the snowspeederxwing windscreen i will definately be getting atleast another 3 of this great set 910	positive
i love it depending on the australian price if it comes down here that is incidently i have no idea what that other yellow thing is either thanks for the review	positive
all i can say is wow cant wait for my local stores to stock this nice review btw  does the snowspeeder actually fit through the door thanks edited by supernova 02 august 2007  0206 pm	positive
a very good review thanks mutley777 y hmm that shattered base looks better than i thought a very playable set really nice for the snowspeeder i prefer the main gun design of its predecessor but the grappling hook gun is a good improvement if the door would just be large enough for it p	positive
dont worry guys the snowspeeder fits through the door easily 	positive
i thought after the kings royal castle uproar about stickers lego would have gone back to printed bricks obviously it is all about costs these days and not about keeping people happy	negative

excellent set the snowtroopers are just amazing most lego imperial troops are really good however its sad that except from luke all the rebels have the same face which is what is more the most unexpressive that you can find for the rest the quality looks excellent the snowspeeder is far better than the first they realized but only one thing it looks a bit too white to me i think i remember they were grey and orange rather than white in the film and the echo base door is really cool really nice set edited by lord beckett 02 august 2007  0414 pm	positive
nice review mutley y i agree with all your observations especially stickers versus printed parts  i get some of this and replace the snowspeeders with my v2s hoth on copmike	positive

review  42039  24 hours race car introduction when the preliminary images of the le mans racer surfaced somewhere last year 2014 it got a lot of praise this changed dramatically when the final images of the 24 hours race car showed up the front side of the car especially the head lights and the curvature of the side of car had changed a lot the car obviously still resembled the prototype but the new design raised a lot of eyebrows the new design was considered a step back instead of forward eventhough i still liked the design i must admit i liked the earlier design better too with the emphasis on past tense liked i am not sure anymore and this review will show you why like the arctic truck this set has a bmodel which is well worth checking out thats why this review includes both the amodel and bmodel for people who are on the fence the bmodel might actually convince them to buy the set after all lets see what this set is all about note all images can be clicked for hires versions set information number 42039 title 24 hours race car theme technic released 2015 part count 1219 box weight 2110 gr box dimensions 478 cm x 373 cm x 87 cm model dimensions 40 cm x 18 cm set price msrp €9999    £9999 price per part €0082    £0082 links brickset bricklink the box the box measures 478 cm x 373 cm x 87 cm and weighs well over 2kg 2110 gr to be precise the width of the box is the same as the box of the arctic truck this box also feels like its filled to the brim the front the front shows a picture of the main model in action with radial blurred wheels to emphasize the motion of the car the lower right section shows the dimensions of the model upon completion it will measure a length of 40cm and a width of 18 cm the back like the front the back side has exactly the same setup as the box of the arctic truck the top shows the functions of the model while the lower left side shows the bmodel and the lower right side shows the motorization options the picture of the bmodel looks so cool it could be a model of its own at this point i was very eager to build both models and compare them the side one of the sides usually shows a part in 11 scale this time its one of the wheels indicating the size of the model content of the box the box contains 1 booklet 1 sticker sheet 13 bags 4 tires instruction booklet since i own two copies of the set i also received two instruction booklets whats catching my eye is that my second copy is supplied in different packaging than the first one its for the first time that i am aware of that the instruction booklet and stickers come in a sealed bag without cardboard back hopefully this will be a new standard for all sets with sticker sheets instead of multiple booklets this set contains a single square bound book in earlier reviews i have epxressed my preference for a single book i dont see any advantage in having 2 3 or even up to 6 booklets sticker sheet like the actual model the sticker sheet looks very vibrant the bright green white and black color combination has found its way to the stickers as well either you love em or hate em since i started writing reviews i have been applying stickers and i am happy i started doing it stickers do give the model its finishing touch bags with parts thirteen bags with a total of 1219 parts give or take a few are supplied in the densily packed box the rims and flex are sealed in a bag as well sometimes looking at the bags makes you wonder what the logic is behind the distribution of the various parts across the different bags well this time it really got me confused take a look at two of the bags below theres a bag containing all the 3l blue pins then theres a bag with various partsand a single 3l blue pin i figured this might be an error but both of the sets have the same anomaly tires the tires have been supplied unbagged as usual highlighted parts this chapter describes new and interesting parts this set actually contains a lot of them this set also contains an abundance of panels if you arent into panels this isnt the set for you changeover catch this year 2015 the new changeover catch parts were released its a combination of three parts the advantage of the new parts is that the red gear is the same on both sides which avoids mounting it the wrong way around it also avoids the changeover catch slipping out of the driving ring like it used to do you can apply lots of pressure but the catch doesnt slip out pins some of last years new pins are also included in this set 12 x pin with pin hole and 21 x 3l pin with 1l axle securing technic beams can be quite simple with the new pin with pin holes the new 3l pin with 1l axle gives you more possibilities when connecting beams and other parts below are two example situations where the new pins have been used granted the examples below can be accomplished by using other techniques however some predicaments from the past can be easily solved by using these new parts like me you will most likely appreciate the ease of use engine and suspension also included are two steering portal hubs and steering portal hubs with ball joint arms and four steering portal axles for driving and steering the vehicle these parts are commonly used nowadays the picture below also shows some other parts like gear rack steering arms and suspension frames this set comes with a single 5x7 frame and three 5x11 frames panels this set contains a whopping 47 panels in three different colors i personally like panels a lot and i do appreciate the variety we have at our disposal lately this set even contains a new 13x3x2 curved mudguard panel new 13x3x2 curved panel this is the first set to contain the new 13x3x2 curved panel looking at the pictures doesnt do these panels justice in real life they are actually quite big i figured they would be smaller but they are even longer than the 11 x 5 frame with a length of 13 including the attachment points hopefully this part will be available in other colors as well preferably white for adding variety to your ev3 robot 19l white flexaxles the white 19l flex axles have only been released in a single set the 8461 williams f1 racer in 2002 current prices on bricklink are as high as 15 euros needless to say we are very happy with the return of these white axles now we can build jeroen ottens awesome alfa romeo 4c spider for a decent price as well i am really happy that useful rare parts are being used more often by tlg designers part list heres the complete list for all 1219 parts as you can see in the highlighted parts section this set contains a lot of interesting and useful parts if you dont own sets like the 8070  supercar this might be the set to pick up if you want to start building your own supercar the build enough with all the set and part information lets build the model rear suspension the build starts with the rear suspension and drivetrain as you can see in the picture below the length of the axle between the steering cv joint is 4l where it usally is 3l this is an indication that the finished model will be a bit bigger than usual 8070 for example the finished suspension is one of the cleanest suspension setups i have seen in an official model its pretty basic but it works like a charm this setup is defintely worth using in your moc heres a video after attaching the suspension to the frame you rotate the module and secure it at this stage the rear section of the chassis with suspension is almost finished v8 midengine extending the chassis forward results in the picture below where the front spoiler is already visible whats also visible is the v8 engine placed right in front of the rear axle resulting in a midengine setup perfectly suited for sports and race cars two exhaust pipes have been fitted on either side of the engine together with two hoses attaching them to the engine the instructions are easy to follow although you sometimes you need to bend the beams a bit minor improvements are possible here and there but nothing shocking front suspension the front suspension is a bit more complicated than the rear suspension which makes sense considering the fact it contains the steering rack the shock absorbers are placed in a different angle than the rear ones resulting in a somewhat stiffer front suspension all in all the front suspension is well designed and the steering rack can be easily powered with a servo motor the picture belows shows the front suspension attached to the chassis if you follow the official instructions to motorize the model the area in front of the suspension is used to mount the battery box when you are modding this model to make it full rc this area can be used to mount the servo motor gearbox like the gearbox in the 8070 its not used to switch gears powering the drivetrain its used to switch between two functions opening the doors and the hoodbonnet the gearbox is located at the left of the vehicle near the cockpit the mechanism to open the doors is located on the left side while opening the hoodbonnet is taking place at the right side to accomplish this some axles traverse under the cockpit to the other side of the vehicle following the axles to other side of the vehicle and adding some gears results in the situation below the video below shows the gearbox in action door opening mechanism the mechanism to open the door is comprised of some knob wheels links without stoppers and pins with towballs take a look at the doors opening and closing the front using the new mudguards and various other panels you finish the front of the car the front is probably the most controversial part of the car this is caused by the preliminary pictures shown before the release of this car in the early pictures the front of the car had smooth curves and beautiful lines while the final car lost these smooth lines and got a more blocky look in return i must admit that at a first glance the new design lost some of its appeal however this model grew on me pretty rapidly the headlight design can be found in more or less the same way on several real le mans type race cars the rear the rear of the car looks great with the stickers continuing from the mudguards to the panels underneath the spoiler the two exhausts sticking out give some details to the back i absolutely disagree with all the negativity surrounding this car maybe its one of those models which needs to grow on you finished model here it is the finished model i know some of you dont like the looks of the car but i think it looks great the color scheme is outstanding the new for technic bright green parts combined with white and black make this car look very vibrant and colorful i am not a big fan of the green used in the 42008  service truck but i do like this bright green a lot it fits perfectly well with the mindstorms ev3 set the curves on the side of the car are not as smooth as some of us hoped but i still think the car looks more than acceptable from the side the stickers add some nice details to the car giving it that characteristic race car look the model looks great in pictures but it does even look better in real life i love this picture of the front of the car however i do wonder if a dedicated 24 hour le mans racer has the seat and steering positioned offcenter using the good ol google machine i come to the conclusion that they do have centered seating and steering at least the majority of them theres ample space in the cabin which makes me wonder why tlg decided to place the seat offcentered the rear view looks cool too with some of the suspension showing and the two exhaust pipes clearly visible the bottom view is very useful to determine the size of the car in studs it measures approx 59 x 27 studs the chassis looks organized and well designed the engine has been placed close to the ground which is perfect for the weight distribution a low center of gravity improves the handling of the car i really enjoyed building this baby the build is very clean and organized although there are some steps where you need to bend the beams a bit to get things into place seeing the model come to life and seeing it grow to pretty impressive proportions is very satisfying for me it was fun but i reckon kids will go nuts over this set and the build size comparison what became obvious during the build but whats emphasized when you have finished the model is that its quite big the size of the car is pretty impressive the pictures below show the car next to the 42030  volvo l350f the side view emphasizes the size of the car its even longer than the volvo if you dismiss the bucket parts left some parts left nothing out of the ordinary features and functions unlike the bmodel this model doesnt implement any unexpected features the functions it does implement are exactly what you would expect from any car steering hog working fake engine suspension opening doors gullwing style opening bonnethood opening trunk gearbox for switching between functions unfortunately the steering wheel hasnt been linked to the hog hand of god steering mechanism placing the seat in the center would have provided an easy way to link the steering wheel to the steering mechanism its a shame we hardly see actual steering anymore opening the hood actually opens up the entire rear section of the car providing you with easy access to the motor compartment the mechanism to open the hood works properly which results in smooth opening and closing of it the same goes for the gullwing style doors both functions are operated manually and you need to switch with the lever to the left of the cockpit these two functions are also the ones which can be motorized by placing an mmotor near the cockpit and a battery box in the trunk all things considered i think this car offers lots of playability the model is solidly built and the functions are easy to operate id say its pretty safe to let your kids play with it bmodel unlike the amodel the bmodel for this set received almost universal acclaim and i can see why often the bmodel is a pale shadow of its part donor in this case the model looks so good it could be a model of its own it even incorporates a neat feature which actually deserves to be in the amodel theres a lot a variation in the quality of digital building instructions tlg is providing but these ones are of very high quality the picture below shows most of the chassis with suspension fake engine and gearbox in place finished model some concessions have been made but overall the car looks fantastic the black of the roof has been extrapolated from the hood which definitely works for me the rear section of the car feels a bit empty but the panels do cover up most of it so its hardly noticeable the v8 stickers will be upside down if you use the parts from the amodel since i could apply new stickers i have placed them using the proper orientation the bottom of the car shows the chassis its obviously a bit smaller than the amodels chassis features and functions taking the functions into account this model isnt playing second fiddle to the amodel besides the obvious functions like steering opening doors and hood this car features folding fog lights which deserve a better podium than a bmodel steering hog working fake engine suspension opening doors manually opening hoodbonnet manually opening trunk operated by gear folding fog lights operated by gear gearbox used to switch functions fog lights one of the most interesting features of the bmodel are the folding fog lights it almost feels a bit weird that a feature like this is implemented in the bmodel instead of the amodel below are 4 steps showing how the mechanism works i have also included a video the mechanism is somewhat reminiscent of fork mechanism used in the 8109  flatbed truck which has been described in effermans review take a look at the video to the fog lights in action parts left a fair number of parts left which isnt uncommon for a bmodel summary to summarize how i feel about this set you need to take a look at the picture below the combined image reflects the quality of this setor better yetsets you actually get two great models for the price of one you dont like the amodel no problem you can have lots of fun with the bmodel i cant stop playing with the fog lights its mesmarizing the color scheme on both models is outstanding i simply cant emphasize enough how well this color scheme pleases the eye the regular green is dull and boring but this bright green really pops out especially when combined with black and white and possibly some red details black white and a little red sounds familiar yes bright green can easily be combined with your ev3 robots so while you are combining the bright green with your robot why not use the great new curved mudguard panels these new panels are introduced in this set and they look great they open up a lot of possibilities in the design department the build of the amodel is outstanding it is fairly simple but since its so clean i really enjoyed it a lot i think the build should be entertaining which doesnt mean it needs to be a real challenge and lets be honest when is a build really challenging the rear suspension is a good example of why i liked the build its very simple yet very effective works like a charm the same goes for the other functions in both models and the star of the entire show can be found in the bmodel hows that for a surprise being aware of the fact that i like this model a lot better than most of you seem to do i really encourage you to give this model a chance the sheer size is impressive the color scheme is awesome and you get a bonus model which is actually worth building score okay so how do i grade this set 8 design open to debate but i like it a lot 8 building experience fun and clean build 9 features superb function in bmodel steels the show 9 playability both models offer lots of playability 8 parts lots of new parts and cool existing parts 10 value for money two models for the price of one 87 twice the fun i hope you enjoyed this review

thanks for a great review ive got a pile of tru and lego credit i wanna spend and was thinking about getting this since i got a sneak peak of your review in the academy but its not here in the us yet too bad wonder when itll hit i do disagree about the manuals though i find the thinner stapled manuals easier to use than single large squarebound ones since they lay flatter when open have any links to the prelim photos of the front end i dont remember seeing that and was curious how different it looked	positive

i think this set will be my next purchase i love the color scheme and indeed it looks like a nice set also 1200 parts for eur 100 is not a bad deal and yes the looks of the car have really grown on my since the first official pictures appeared im curious how the bright green will work combined with other colors than white i really hope more sets in the future will use the color so that more different parts will be available over time i think im the only person on eurobricks who doesnt like the looks of the b model but i appreciate the extra functionality it offers besides the set itself i think this is one of the best reviews i have read in a while great job on the superb photographs which i think are essential to a review and the extensiveness of it all you really touched every subject which is great d	positive

fantastic review jim from the quality of the review alone it is easy to see how much hard work you have put into it im with you on the instruction manual i much prefer one quality bound book over umpteen stapled booklets already have 2 of these sitting in the build queue one for display model as im a fan of this one and one to build the b model then dissemble for parts so im already sold on his set but still very much enjoyed taking the time it deserves to read through the review and ogle at your pro photography	positive
ted have you described your photography setup somewhere i love the crisp quality of your pictures	positive
great review i think it look like a great set both a and b however the panels are the only thing i would need but still a great looking set	positive

a great review jim just finished building this set a couple of steps required abit of lego stressing to get together when there was an easier way just made it into rc  almost finished it in ldd which was easy to do as it has so much room for nearly any configuration of motors and not have them showing a great set edited by jonorocky 13 march 2015  1053 am	positive
wonderful review but i am still not sold on the set if we get more sets with the bright green i might be tempted to get it but until then it is too few parts in bright green too few different types not the number of pieces to be able to use that colour effectively in making mocs	neutral
true but i must say i like the new colour very fresh looking compared to the rather dullish regular green cant wait to build mocs with it	positive
i have been waiting for this set since the pictures for the toy fairs eirlier in the year and i am glad to say i am not disapointed first the price it is not cheap at 9999 but i guess that is typical for a set with this amount of electronics in itthere is no parts count and i have not had time to add up the 2 pages of contents to get a figure first the box standard flip top with large internal picture and rip to open lid inside there are no numbered bags in this set which i prefer i like to open all the bags and put all the parts in the box before building next is a picture on the electronics 2 xlmotors as lego describe them and 2 standard motors 2 ir receivers and 1 ir transmitter i know these have been discussed before but i really like the thought that has gone into the transmittersreceivers each receiver has 2 outputs to corespond with the 2 controls on transmitter they also have a choice of 4 channels so one transmitter can control up to 8 independant motors by changing the channel switch the transmitter also has a neat motor direction switch so you can configure the transmitter operation the set comes with three manuals 1 is the main drive mechanism 2 is the cab and engine and 3 is the attachments front and back there is also the now standard parts list in the back of the third manual there is no alternative model instructions despite the pictures of one on the box however there is a reference to the technic website on the back of the box but at the moment the page only has an advert saying the set is to be released on 1st september so i guess i will have to wait untill then to see if the instructions will be online the build is fairly straight forward the main chassis is studless the next picture shows the motors mounted into the chassis and the drive for the shovel and claw it also shows the v6 technic engine this next picture shows the ir receivers mounted on the back the battery box slots into the back and can be easily slid out with the removal of two pins which is useful because i can imagine i will need to change the batteries on a regular basis the next 2 picture are of the completed model overall i was very happy with the finished dozer the functions work really well and as i have the monster dino i have used a second transmitter so i dont have to touch the channel switch i have included some video on my brickshelf page unfortunately this set does suffer from some quality issues for example moulding marks on the plates colour diferences some of the pins not finished properly some pins were very stiff and quite hard to push into the holes but the worst issue was an axle that would not turn freely in a hole which just adds extra friction into the system i am glad to see some studded technic in this set i much prefer sets that use both varieties of technic beam there are only 2 fairings which is a great improvment over recent sets if tlc had tried to make the bulldozer shovel with fairings this would have been a complete disaster marks for the set 810 for price with the number of motors i expected it to be greater 910 for fun my kids love this type of set that does something when finished 610 for quality tlc really need to work on this one 810 overall i would definately get a second one if i see it in the sales feel free to post questions but i will be on holiday next week more pics and videos available here	positive

ah mani wanted to review it with mine oh well here in the us it cost 150 and has 1355 pieces total the pins and axles did seem a bit difficult in putting them into place a problem i have been having is the batterys are done after about 4 hours of play which i really wish they would last longer   overall it is a stupendous set and it is really nice to see our old friend the studs make a return	neutral

thanks for the great review of this set ive been looking forward to it as well and i am excited about the wireless controls like the dino i too am curious if this set has been released here in the us i was told that it was a sept 1 release i agree about the battery life my dino set lasted about 4 hours too	positive
thank you very much for that neat review ickelpete y your picturesre very interesting and your videos really good that set looks very beautiful to me a formidable new technic set that quicklyll turn into an everlasting classic for sure  im just a little sorry for those quality problems well i hope that tlcll work on that matter and fix it soon 8	positive

thank you ickelpete for that great review i give you two y up i am not a technic fan but this set definitly looks sweet  i see great potential using this set as a model for a smaller dozer for my towntrain layout i really wub the crawler tracks they used i have been thinking about buying the snowmobile for the tracks but if possible i just might buy this set instead i could definitly use the other parts for mocs model on	positive

the new small technic sets have incredible functionality for their size and this one is no exception with only 106 parts this crane can roll extend rotate lift and hold in any position and has working stabilisers the boom extends the same as the other sets with this boom simply pull it it works surprisingly well and due to circular ridges inside the boom the extension which is just a standard beam will hold in place the gear at the back controls the height of the boom as you can see the boom is only half extended boom fully extended half down the cable is kept in place via two gears and a blue pin same as the 7905 crane even under decent weights this works well the stabilisers however cannot handle much weight once the load is moved off axis the stablilsers are a very simple but effective design another shot of the stablilsers this also shows how far the boom will decend the boom height mechanism works well also i love the cab design overall this is a remarkable achievement for the low price i bought it for the boom piece as i want to improve the crane that came with 7998 7898    i highly recommend it	positive
very nice review sinner y wub so we are getting more and more reviews with figs in it thats great  i actually wanted to skip this technic set but your review made me think again i havent seen you posting a price so i will do that for you p  its just 999 in germany	negative

thanks for all the feedback you guys robert8 on 12 april 2015  1125 pm said i cant help but think the minifigures are the weak part of the set snake and apu are great but the rest i dont know they kinda redundant now they could at least give us new torso printing like homer wearing his jacket or bart wearing his blue tshirt or marge wearing her coat or as i said in the discussion thread id have included jasper in cmf series 2 and a frozen version here overall the set looks kinda smaller than what i thought i agree but so many people were complaining about how the simpsons house should have included the most common versions mostly because the eyes or whatever so i think lego played it safe and just included the normal versions it makes sense since series 1 is gone forever and the common versions were in there and this set is bound to be in stock for a very long time like the death star i never really agreed when people were complaining about the alternate eye prints personally but i guess this is a good business choice based on previous feedback edited by just2good 13 april 2015  1206 am	negative
hello everyone excellent review english is not my native language but i want to express my opinion simpsons house was the first of its kind and i can say without exaggeration that this is the most impressive set that im going my collection httpbricksetcomsetsownedbyceleb  i look at the video from the kwikemart and is difficult to say how good it is compared with the house the main disadvantages that i said to myself is this build the walls of the large panels next is access to the roof gray parts in front of the back door i think they represent the stairs is not on the level with doors on the roof and when you open them you can see the white block is openly trash my points of view boxes on the left of go to the store and powersauce box i want see make real and not just a cube fe such as in the unreleased star wars set about minifigures i fully agree with robert8 two more of the same homer marge and bart personally i put my set as a scene and all the replays minifigure are inside the house that was not identical characters next and also absolutely terrible barts accessory this set is made parking for bikes and it looks very cool but damn it is hoped to see the bart or lisas bike instead of useless balloons with paint the walls are made with convex inside panels why so can anyone know have not seen any pictures with such walls in tv show why did not they turn i personally really like how realized roof but my brother says that it is terrible  garden could do more in the series there were almost jungle i do not know how to be considered here maybe anyone can express any opinion or idea i look at the simpsons house and then look at the photo of this emart i can not understand in the house we have a garage two floors cool floor a lot of furniture all the rooms and walls collected from cubes many additional accessories and where is all this detail here it looks much smaller maybe even poorer if they still will release next year comic book store it will be even less of course it is difficult to estimate without seeing it live we have it will be sold only in may at first sight it does not look so impressive as the house can certainly the case in the limit on the amount of detail but why it was impossible to add  50 to the cost and make jasper the more detailed the roof the walls of the smaller elements that it was not convex sad thanks all for attention edited by celeb 13 april 2015  0510 am	positive

i have sooo mixed feeling about that i loved the simpsons house save for the terrible wall in the homer and marges room but this so far is inferior in almost every aspect the walls made of panels is a bummer i expect a d2c set to be better that this 60 stickers the same thing same price for less bricks and smaller build then the house strange coloured bricks on the outside wall some ugly mix of yellow  tan panels again with their fronts facing towards the inside of the shop so we and up with those squares all around the walls are yellow this was so nice lost opportunity to make it in some other less common colour then again the set overall looks is good the roof is a nice detail the shop looks actually like a real one not just an approximation of one the roof tiles are in dark orange  we got newrare colour here the car looks interesting to build just like the pink one from the house lots of nice references to the show its the simpsons definitely a must buy but for a discounted price ill try to find one with maybe damaged box or afterdisplay copy edited by mestari 14 april 2015  0115 pm	negative

one thing that may justify the price it has 527 different parts if i counted correctly i alway heard the more different parts the more difficult the set is to produce the simpsons house already had an astonishig amount of different pieces but this one is even more extreme	negative
its the level of detail that floors me a licensed set with the mindset of those great creator sets i think it displays much better than the simpsons house which from the outside is a bit drab	negative

great review	positive
did anyone else have a problem with the piano against the wall of the simpsons house it just kept coming off way too easily and i was getting really frustrated with it sticking out and not fully going on so i had to put the two tiles that hold them one place over away from the wall for it to sit properly without falling out i think i might put snowball ii behind it since cats love to hide underneath or behind things lol but just curious to know if anyone else was encountering this problem with the previous set	positive
i recently acquired 90 of this set so i thought i would do a review of it please note that half of the minifigs are wrong and there are some part substitutions this is the only set that comes with this plate there is a depression under the grey plates to the back the pool depression can be easily covered by three quarter circle plates which just happen to be included in this set good set design lego the stairs are old fabuland ones and have been used in a few other sets this is the only one that has them in parapink however what is the difference between parapink and pink dunno the big windows are in only two other sets both of them dacta ones the smaller ones were in one other paradisa set the interior while simple works very well i love the coffee machine a cute car came with the set as well the bird house is a nice idea as well once the current visitors leave i will probably be breaking this set i wish lego would go back to these sets as they always had some great parts in them	negative

nice review of a surprisingly interesting set y those windows are great and no doubt difficult to get classic coffee maker simple yet exactly right that baseplate was in a few other sets but never with that pattern would have made a great base for some of the classic 80s houses lego used to treat us to in tan was part of the adventurers egypt sets as recently as 2001 it was a base for ogel versatile plate that hopefully hasnt disappeared completely parapink is apparently light pink on brickshelf so i guess its just lighter than normal pink and stopped appearing in 1995 just so you know that monkey is drinking too much and likely to fall in the pool  	positive

another great review thanks yoda man those smooth slopes really look like crap when on a roof  that was the whole reason they had texture in the first place  ill never liked those they feel so cheap the new sb head is great and can mrs puffs legs move i just ask since her feet are separate and in figs where the legs cant move theyre usually one piece at the bottom to keep them from breaking off the set looks great and seems to have a lot of playability	positive
nice review  im not a big fan of those spongebob figs however this set has some very useful pieces this is actually the first time i took a decent look at a spongebob set	positive
thank you yoda for strike 2 its sb again  sticker alarm x but this set is better than chum bucket there are far more interesting parts if you dont like sb especially the light house and the little hut with the wooden pontoon y and yet again another set with smooth slopes and rough ones too bad too bad    if i just knew the person who is responsible for that 	positive

the set and the other designer sets that came out with it especially 4888 are incredibly well designed sets i wish lego would go back to doing sets like these as i loved the multitude of instructions and ideas the last batch of creator sets had zero ideas even though i know several were made  anyway less whining more review the lion is the main model his mouth doesnt fully close but it does open more the head works well from most angles i love the dark orange bricks great for rust he is quite solid but the joints take the weight well the neck goes side to side and rotates but doesnt go up and down the body is built in two parts and pinned in the middle with what is left you can make what i think is a hyena a silly plant moc and what i believe is a vulture there are also instructions for a few other models including a bat boar and a snake which i quite like he can be built at the same time as this cute little lizard overall this is a great set with an excellent blend of colours and pieces i wanted it for steampunk potentials sweet i hope you liked the review till next time	positive

great review as always y lego is timeless so there is no such thing as an old set i never build brick monsterscreatures but this set had such a nice assortment of parts that i had to pick a couple up as they werent clearancing out on shop  home i absolutely love dark orange and tan so it was an automatic win i love the use of familiar characters in the review i can almost hear hinckley screaming my megabloks p you sort of look like youre planning some vulture stew though might have to start a new challenge to determine a winner there sinner and his big pot o doom vs giant vulture only thing is does everything horrify the mrs she seems perpetually shocked andor dismayed at the goings on here now that i think about it i can see why im occasionally shocked andor dismayed 8 brick built beasties on y	positive

thank you for the nice review sinner i also bought this set but in combination with 4883 when it was on sale 50  hurray at sh i made a short review of 4883 but wasnt really sure what to tell about 4884 so im glad you did that for me d i have different feelings about this set on the one hand i love the lion he is really impressive even my wife not known for being lego enthusiastic asked me if there were more animals of this kind the lion is  restricted  poseable and the colors used are fantastic wub 3 models can be built simultaneously  thats great on the other hand i still dont know what to do with these rotation joints wacko and the other models are somehow disappointing compared to the lion i seem to have missed the little lizard  i put it on my to dolist like all the creator sets great parts pack  but wait until they get on sale xd for me  i had a lot more fun with 4883 indeed roarrrr on 	neutral

great review very thorough its not a set which makes me run to tye store but it definitely has some fun elements i do like your new grey background your pictures look great	neutral
a terrific very comprehensive review  but im not at all impressed with this set it feels like a mishmash of bricks with no clear design aesthetic and as such blatantly underdeveloped ie designed to hit a pricebrick count point rather than provide a solid set in the creator town tradition compared to other creator sets at this price point 31025  mountain hut for example it feels utterly uninspired and ugly edited by johnny6666 04 may 2015  1002 am	negative
thanks mostlytechnic for this review i only brought this set to continue the shop series from creator in my opinion its only half as good as the bike shopcafe one plus it doesnt fit the same as that pair of shops oh well maybe next year lego creator will have a better one brick on review on mostlytechnic 	neutral
reviews for this set really should picture them next to the bike shop  cafe which its intended to be compatible with right down to the size of the baseplates and grey tiles around the edge it doesnt look that great on its own but if you add the two sets together you get something that begins to look like a street scene	positive
this seems like half of a set compared to the previous bike shopcafe as i like many of the elements i will probably buy a second one and build a mirror image version making one entirely a toy shop and the other a book storenews stand and adjust the sidewalks to work with the previous model then i think they will work well together i remember a little area in copenhagen that had this sort of architecture i would hope the subsequent models are better deigned to create more complex alternatives but these are both good starting points for original or enhanced models	neutral
as a fan of creator houses i really want to like this set however i think that creator houses have long filled a niche thats neglected elsewhere residential houses we havent had a larger residential house since 2013 im not sure if these sets have anything to do with that but it seems like they may be the replacement for larger houses and id much rather have a larger house set than a set like this i also agree with many others here something about it just feels incomplete i think that the various city business buildings weve gotten in recent years including those in this years city squarewhich is much more expensive than this but also contains much more make for better buildings at this scale	positive
thanks andy0306uk your very clever strategic decision to serve us with blurry pictures allowed me to glance at this review without ruinating that whole wonderful advent surprise too much p y but although i loved the last years one i think they could do another theme or perhaps even two calendars because right now castles pretty hot imo	positive
thank you andy for your speed review y so theres nothing left to open while advent  i like all the tiny sets it neednt be another police and fireman   but well what would an advent calendar be without them d one thing about the train traffic lights tlc used to give us similar lights but you could show either of the lights with the other one being covered that one was waaay better  just a little piece more would have done the thing and i wont mention the radarcrapdish x let me quote franz beckenbauer is denn scho weihnacht legendary quote from an promotional job he did years ago  is it xmas already	neutral
andy0306uk on sep 13 2007 0136 pm said really hope they do different themes next year but not sure how theyd managed 24 different minisets for castle can envisage 78 minifigs but what else yeah i guess this would need a little more out of the box thinking than tlcs doing usually for their castle line things that are similar to the city theme and more civil life based like some blacksmith equipment market place bakery farmer and so on but a wizard workshop a hidden treasure and some medieval furniture would also work fine and an evil santa with spiders and coal pieces as gifts and a sledge pulled by a dragon of course d	neutral
whoa its out already places order i guess i should thank you andy because i might have missed this one just like i missed last years calendar now all i have to do is wait two weeks and pick it up at the post office across the border	neutral

nice review  but you paid how much this set is priced around 7 euros here in germany which is a very fair price for what you get in my oppinion its a little disappointing though that i couldnt think of any alternate builds for this set and there are no inspirations on the box or the ef website	neutral

nice review but i dont think ill get this set i dont relly like the look it looks ugly hmmm anyway	negative
i couldnt find a review of this wonderful set in here so here it goes i got the set for msrp 180kr  24 euro which is a fair price here in denmark as all other creator sets there are instructions for several models 3 in this case the box the box is a little larger than city sets in the same price range the primary model is shown on the front while you see the secondary ones on the back what you get 312 pieces in 5 polybags and two building instructions one for the primary model and the other for the rest the built it was impossible for me to speed build this model because of the nifty functional details from the retractable landing gear to the wings that can turn by means of the handle in the back of the model it took me a full hour to build it because i had to test how it all works together the finished model the landing gear isnt fully enclosed when retracted and the models are subminifig scale but i still love the design of the models the doors for the rear wheels open as you pull the wheels down and the final piece of functionality comes from the wings that can either tilt the horizontal stabilizers or have elevators wing in wings out wings in wings out ratings as a whole i actually like this set even more than the big rig the models are just as diverse but the added functionality makes the plane more fun to play with than the rig price 710  a good price but not a bargain as the big rig design 910  there could have been a sligtly higher level of details in the main model but all models are really good looking and i especially like the design of the hovercraft functionality 1010  i guess you could ask for working rudders opening cockpit and so on but the plane is really filled with movable parts and the turning of the wings works really well secondary models 710  a hovercraft how awesome is that if only the last model was just as inventive instead of a standard helicopter modifiability 810  the bricks are in ordinary colours and there is a good variety of them giving you plenty of possibilities for mocing you can easily make the main model into something that looks more like an f14 910 probably as good as it gets for a creator set in this price range it is entertaining to both build and play with looks good and the secondary models are worth building as well brickshelf gallery	positive
thanks i was planning on doing this review but i have been a bit swamped lately  great review of a great set it isnt too hard to convert the plane to minifig size either sorry i forgot to take photos i might add some photos to your review	positive

3499 is not too shabby the big guy itself is nice but the gem of the set is the mech really nice mech i must say great for posing the mini figs suprisingly nice little buildvehicle never seen this element beforeits probably nothing new though lol no articulation of the legs nooooooo phew the front two legs do articulate would of been bad if they didnt overall i give the set 7810 not the best but its actually quite nice and the yellow mech is awesome if it was him on his own then 9410 cheers	positive

personally i thought your review was spot on and i very much enjoyed your tone im not usually much of a minifig person but i will admit i bought this set mostly for dr doom and considered nova a bonus growing up i was a big fan of the fantastic four and an even bigger fan of dr doom i hope that someday the film rights will revert to marvel and well finally get a ff film that respects the original source material and features a dr doom worthy of the name as for the set itself i dont have much use for playsets not that theres anything wrong with them i think the marvel lego line could use more of them in fact and i didnt even realize it was linked to a specific show as ive fallen a bit out of touch with the franchise of late i bought it i built it it sat a shelf for a while i scrapped it for parts i think most of it wound up as a greenhouse for my winter village setup its not a bad set but i think you summed things up nicely when you called it mediocre thanks for the entertaining review	neutral
thanks for the reviewim not a big fan of spider man sets but this set really impressed me this must because of the design of this set and the minifigures that included in this set	positive

many tks dunamis for doing that its really great and i cant wait monitoring your progress on the beast 8 like it was mentionned in another thread the box looks less gigantic than i thought  remember the isd box  that was a huge box  is the instruction book in the pizza box  how big is it  im sure its really big and i hope for our sake that the colours are clearly marked xd if you know what i mean d  tks againand im so looking forward to your next post  ras 74 on sep 27 2007 0851 am said you always seems to pull it of nicely in comparission with the exasperating yoda xd p what what what  have you stopped your medication once again xd yoda	positive

tks for that comparison pic dunamis  ok the box is big  i pictured it a tad smaller though  i know what i dont like its the fact that it has the regular lego star wars logo on top with vader ucs sets should have a different iconography like they did in the past sure its a trivial detail but it adds to the fact of owning something special  after all its the most expensive set ever as of now  happy building  and well wait patiently for some cool pics later on p yoda	negative
the manual the gigantic manual measures 17 x 12 and is almost an inch thick it is spiral bound with a cardboard like front and back and it is 314 pages interesting decision not to break it up into multiple manuals it is almost unwieldy at this size and thickness unfortunately the manual is not available electronically from the lego website hopefully it will be soon missing were the little instructions at the beginning telling you to not build this beast on shag carpet and to sort out the 5000 pieces before you get started i guess they figure if you got 500 to spend on this thing you can build it however you want as usual we get the regular lego manual features  piece call outs for each step  parts inventory at the end of the manual  page numbers  photos of all the other 2007 sets at the end of the manual manual paperback book provided for scale various manual photos 8x8 plate provided for scale im about 2 hours into building and sorting im trying to stay a day ahead in my posting the build has been easier than i thought so far despite the massive number of pieces it has not been too hard to sort and find what you need build photos will start appearing in tomorrows entry	positive
my gawd that manuel is huge thats enough to put a sane man off of buying this setthank gawd none of us are sane thats all i can say xd just how many technic pins does this monster need 8 judging by that one pic theres gotta be a lot in this set	negative
nice idea reviewing the set while constructing it this is the top of the bill for any legocollector also financially speaking and i like the look of all those thousands of pieces the manual is incredible i thought i had a really thick manual coming with set 8479 but this one exceeds it with ease review on	positive
good review y me i cant build it before saturday 	positive
great review so far i am looking forward to additional posts as for the number of pins  from the peeron inventory for the set there are over 400 technic pins of various lengths insert the my fingers hurt from building emoticon keep the pictures coming	positive
the minifigs as you can see the minifigs are really nice they even throw in an extra fleshie head no doubt these will fetch quite a bit on the bricklink and ebay markets im keeping mine continuing the build this photo shows how well this model is put together notice that they use four of the threehole beams per side to hold this together i remember reading that you can hang this model from the ceiling i dont doubt it these right angle technic pieces are used to reinforce the structure of the model you can see them used here i was shocked at how many light gray plates are in this set i have two tubs full of these the infrastructure is now complete i got hung up for about an hour looking for one of these turns out lego gave me an extra left wedge and shorted me a right wedge so frustrating i had to stead one off my 6211 star destroyer it is not a very common piece by the way	neutral
hey nice review im up to about the same point as you page 70 to be exact  tho i didnt have that missing piece thankfully i think lego have done a much better job at packing the lego this time i remember it taking me much longer to find pieces on the ucs isd build	positive
so i see they even do mistakes on these  that beast looks really sturdy  that is great  are these yellow parts new  i am not a technic fan and never saw these before another question for you is the instruction book easy to follow especially regarding the colours does the black rally stands out comparing to the dark bley and so on  i sure hope so  cant wait to see moer hehe yoda	neutral
i have been taking photos for this review for a few months and i finally took the rest of the photos last night all the parts if you want tan this is the set to get main model the garage is a great addition but the car only just fits the main house is very nice looking the windows extend to the sides but not the back the chimney and drainage work very well and i love the basement i think the front works very well when i was making this i was multitasking doing weight training do a set do a step do a set and i ended up missing one of the row paths i discovered this after i finished the basement  the removable roof reveals byo floors probably why this is called a model house the roof was quite interesting to build this is my first large house set so it all was very new to me i love the garage door more nice pipework this photo i misfocused but there isnt much to see anyway the door is a nice touch the grill to the right on both sides is not just decoration as it hides the hinges for the door i also made one of the submodels i was considering keeping this but i decided against it once again the sides have windows but the back doesnt the truck is there to make the photo more worthwhile the roof to this one doesnt come off easily as all the tiles are used for the front just to clarify these houses arent attached so you can arrange them however you want the fronts are quite elaborate and it seems that lego were trying to make this almost like a simpler market street the truck is too small for a minifig but it probably was my favourite car thoughts i highly recommend this set in most countries it is good value for money including australia the design is excellent and three instructions are included the third is a school if anyone has made it and wants to post photos feel free at least one person at eb has made it i love how each house has its own car due to the way the primary model is made it is a bit weak at the corner but that was a design choice my only real complaint about this set is how lego is going though a mould transition and thus some roof slopes are rough others are smooth i can accept either and lego has been moving to smooth slopes for years now but to have a set with about 5050 is annoying the mtt was the same but that is my only gripe with this excellent set wub	positive

thanks for this review sinner i love this house with the nicely made tiled corners the colorscheme and the garage the only thing i dislike about this set is the way the windows are attached in train windows so they turn inwards a little instead of the usual frames with shutterattachmentability but that is something that can be fixed in the blink of an eye i will certainly buy this house some day when i find it at reasonable price	positive

thanks for the review sinner i definitely want this set now the mixed rough and smooth roof bricks would annoy me on a model like the mtt but here it looks as is if the roof is quite old with some parts being worn and pitted and some parts being replaced with new roof tiles i quite like the effect i agree on which is the best vehicle and if it doesnt fit minifigs just mod the heck out of it xd	positive

remember when i said in my review of 7090 to expect a review after i went to toysrus well somehow things didnt work out but fortunately im finally reviewing my latest purchases starting with 7091 catapault defense which happens to be one of the best sets in the castle line the box and instructions lego box art is at its highest point ever these days with lots of special effects and great action poses the castle theme is no exception and 7091 isnt either ill let the box speak for itself i love the back of the castle boxes as well since they give another action scene and other neat info like a layout of all the accessories the contents only the bare essentials as usual piece bags and instructions i seriously wish they still put mini catalogs inside sets like they did when i was young but i guess they are too expensive to make or something ah well cant have everything no picture of the instructions this time but since that isnt necessary ill just say that they are fine and do not have a problem with distinguishing dark gray from black the pieces heres your basic shot of every piece included minus a few extra pieces like an extra viking horn and black skeleton leg not too shabby for a 10 usd set theres a lot of nice pieces in 7091 as you can see and this doesnt include the accessories or minifig parts the brown plates wheels and spoked things are always useful and the dark blue and gold slopes are really cool however theres also a fair amount of technic in here so be warry as usual for the castle line 7091 has a heaping helping of accessories most of them are old pieces recolored but the ball on chain whats the actual name could someone tell me and the shields are brand new i actually like the new skeleton weapon since its fairly detailed and was really the only way tlc could make a part like that and yes the shields are printed quite nicely too if i do say so myself plus you get viking horns always useful to have a grey boulder a basket and 3 helmets not a half bad deal eh oh who am i kidding  its awesome minifigures ah yes one of the highlights of any castle set you get 2 soldiers and 2 skellies this time all with different weapons the two soldiers are just regular crown troops with different faces  nothing special except that they are awesome anyway the skeletons on the other hand are much more interesting an archer and a black skellie archers cool of course but i know many dont like the printing on the black skeletons well let me say that i dont mind it so much the only real problem is that the eyes are dark red instead of just red which makes the printing a bit less noticeable and ive been through it before that the new skeleton molds in general dont bother me at all  go skeletons the finished set alright theres two builds in this set and ill start with the smaller the skeleton barricade okay so its nothing special but its cool all the less the shield on the front and the slanted spears are nice touches heres just how the skeletons can tower over their own barricade with a little step ah the catapault the lovely catapault seriously i love tlcs design very effective and also very realistic especially compared to kk love the side details and the swiveling base and you gotta love the clever use of that basket playability yes ive made it a tradition now to write stories for any castle set i buy and this isnt the last one you can be sure of that heres one featuring everything in 7901 oh and heres a small ship i made out of all the pieces in this set plus a couple extra figures and weapons from my copy of 7901 not half bad imo considering what i had to work with overall rating presentation 910 pieces 810 minifigures 910 finished model 910 playability 810  final score 8610 once again i highly recommend the reviewed set castle is possibly the best theme this year and this set is one of many that prove it as with all castle sets its best if you buy several if you want to truly enjoy it but this set alone is also impressive in both design and pieces and minifigures get at least one if you have even a slight liking for castle edited by kimt 10 august 2008  0131 pm	positive

sinner on oct 13 2007 0248 am said great review sweet i wasnt aware that the catapult rotated either this set isnt on my buy list though as it is all more of the same for me thanks for the cool moc d i always plan to add a moc to my reviews but i always run out of time  true there are too many catapults already and in my opinion some with a better design as well but my lack of interest in this particular set doesnt reflect at all on my opinion of this review which i enjoyed very much please continue making great reviews like this one grevious y	positive
i just got this today it is amazing like my other two castle sets the joust and the crossbow i am currently starting to save for 2008 but for christmas i think i want the skeleton carridge and the naboo n1 fighter	positive
thanks for a great review first of all i do like the upgrades and changes made from the original 2009 set more colours and parts are offcourse available today than back in 2009 it does look like a great set and i would really realy have loved to get it myself if i had the funds however their are so many other sets thats first priority for me this december and next year so sadly i might have to pass on this if its not that i can get it redicioulusly cheap at some point and yeah we should appreciate that lego does keep sets coming even if its just upgrades from earlier releases town is known for a new police and fire station every year cant see why a new toyshop is so upsetting once again thanks for a great review and happy holidays to you as well	positive
great review thanks oky imo the only significant improvements over the 2009 version are the figures toys and printed shop sign as i already have the older one ill have to give this one a pass	neutral
thanks for the excellent review unfortunately it only highlights how minimal the upgrades are though they are nice definitively a pass for me lets hope lego does continue to make the more realistic winter village sets versus santa im not opposed to a rehash the post office could use some improvements for example but this one is just a wee bit minimal	negative
i missed out on the first one but i love the improvements made in this version like the tree having an actual brown trunk so it looks less like an artificial one and the carolers as well i may pick this up but im sorry to those of you who already have one	positive
cheers for putting up the review some nice improvements but not enough for me to pick it up the original set is good enough for me pity the poll has no option yes but only in addition to new sets not in stead of new sets edited by withacee 01 december 2015  0938 am	neutral
thanks for the review they definitely improved upon the original but since i already own the original i cant justify this set also unfortunately it seems to be the trend but im sure there are a lot of first timers out there too that will snatch this up since it is a really lovely building and the updates make it better for sure	neutral
thanks oky for this fine review i agreed with your sentiments on the unnecessary rants i also owned the 2009 version and even though there are minor improvements there must be a logical reason for its release again but is not entirely the same i felt is an excellent opportunity for others to acquire this design especially after six years ago as for myself i will probably buy this if my spare funds allow me to own this set	neutral
oky on 29 november 2015  1145 am said as for the controversy over rereleasing the winter toy shop i can see where the haters are coming from but i find their complaints to be quite petty i can understand if youre disappointed because you already have the first winter toy shop and were looking forward to a new set this year but theres always next year if youre a completist and feel like tlg is forcing you to buy a set you dont need youre wrong nobody is forcing you to buy anything but yourself if you decide to buy every set in a theme no matter what it is thats your problem not legos so put down your torches and pitchforks and just be glad that they improved the set design and gave us another chance to buy this classic set there are far worse things that can happen in this world than lego rereleasing one of their most popular sets sorry for that little rant so what is your opinion on rereleases like this please cast your vote in the poll above after mocking people for holding a particular opinion you then turn around and ask people to express their opinion no thanks i guess ill keep my opinions to myself i certainly dont want to be labeled a hater	neutral
i didnt own the original toy shop so i bought it this time around i just finished building it saturday and i love it however i wish they had both rereleased this one and came out with a new addition to the village 	positive
review  42044  display team jet introduction the smallest of the 2016 sets is the display team jet it doesnt seem to have lots of functionality but maybe the landing gear is retractable this set kind of reminds me to the 9394  jet plane although its obviously a lot smaller as you can read in my review of the 42052  heavy lift helicopter basically anything flying is 1 for me so lets find out if this set also fits the bill note all images can be clicked for hires versions set information number 42044 title display team jet theme technic released 2016 part count 113 box weight 193 gr box dimensions 154 cm x 138 cm x 59 cm set price msrp € 999 price per part € 0088 links brickset bricklink the box being a small set it obviously comes in a small box the display team jet is an aerobatics jet used in air shows on the box its flying rather high but at least its at a safe distance from the crowd front side shows the main model together with a small section indicating you can use digital building instructions to build this model back side the back side shows the bmodel a stunt plane and again a reference to the apps for digital building instructions more on the stunt plane later content of the box the box contains 2 instructions booklets a and bmodel 1 sticker sheet 3 technic liftarms 2 bags instruction booklets both the instructions for the a and bmodel are included in the box sticker sheet a lot of stickers for such a small set apparently no panel is left untouched liftarms three liftarms unsealed nothing out of the ordinary for a small set bags two bags containing the rest of the parts highlighted parts this section describes the new andor otherwise interesting parts yellow 5l axles the 5l axle in yellow has never been released before so its one of the new parts for this year black 7l flex axles for the layman this seems a common part but the 7l soft axle actually has never been released in black before combined with the rerelease of the 19l soft axle in black this will open up lots of possibilities for those of you thinking youve read this text before you are right the new drag racer contains these new 7l flex axles too white panels this small set comes with a whopping 10 panels great for the ones who like panels not so great if you think tlg is using too much panels lately rudder this part the small bionicle wing is the same as the one used in last years 42033  record breaker part list this set contains 113 parts all listed below the build this is the collection of parts used to build the jet it sure looks like we are getting a landing gear the build is fun but pretty straightforward there arent any special or cool techniques used in this set it almost took me more time to apply all the stickers than to build the actual model finished model the finished jet does look cool though the white and yellow color scheme combined with the stickers work really well i have seen people refer to the plane as being orange but its definitely yellow technic or lego in general tends to have some color variation when it comes to yellow i do concur this is the warmer variant of yellow but its not orange the back of the plane looks nice too although i am not a big fan of the rudder part it looks too detailed compared to the other panels its not a big deal though and maybe its just me parts left only three common parts left features and functions this set has a single feature and that is a retractable landing gear its operated by the black 12t double bevel gear near the cockpit in the following picture you can see the landing gear retracted this image shows the landing gear when the plane is ready for landing hopefully the pilot will roll the plane before landing but you probably know what i mean video heres s short video demonstrating the display team jet bmodel this set also includes the building instructions for the bmodel a stunt plane the building experience for the stunt plane is more or less the same as for the jet well what do you expect when both models are planes with a limited number of parts for an alternative model the stunt plane looks fine theres not a lot of functionality in this plane but its worth mentioning that the tail wheel allows the plane to roll on a flat surface the plane also has working propellors both functions are demonstrated in the video unfortunately the landing gear of the stunt plane is not retractable parts left a couple of extra leftover parts but its nice to see that most of the parts have been used in the bmodel as well actually theres probably an extra yellow technic smooth 12 bush left i just found it on my desk but it could belong to one of the other sets video heres a video demonstrating the stunt plane summary two nice planes for 13 bucks thats basically what you get both models look good and the set has some interesting new parts especially the 7l flex axle will be very popular it comes with a decent collection of white panel although they are very common nowadays both models have limited functionality but each of them has at least one function to give the model some playability for kids other than the swooshability that is okay it might lack some proper functions but i still think kids will love this set i can see kids running around with one of the planes in their hands all in all i think this set delivers what youd expect score lets see how this set flies remember that the grades are based on it being a small set obviously a set like this cannot be compared with a mercedes flagship 8 design for a small set the model looks very authentic 7 building experience no surprises 7 features just the retractable landing gear 8 playability it has swooshability so i see kids running around with this model 7 parts lots of panels if you are into that 8 value for money cant go wrong with these small sets 75 fun for kids more image can be found on my flickr page thank you for reading i hope you enjoyed it	positive
it says 5l in the parts list	neutral
love this model awesome swooshability interesting parts and a nice little model to put on my desk at work 	positive
for 10 euros very usefull parts i like it as well as other 2016 sets i like the gear retracting mechanism a lot very good set for good price thanx for good review  max	positive
megaroi on 01 december 2015  1056 am said hi there nice model great review i almost reverse engineered this model but used wrong parts for landing wheels didnt know how to fix the nose proper and so on so i was very interested in this model and i like playing with it i love the reviews but i think i have to mention that the yellow axle must be a 5l the picture shows a 5l and a 5l would fit the size of the model the cart has also a 5l in yellow what sitze is the yellow axle in this seit really 4l as written in the text greetings robert the picture of the manual says 4x 5l yellow axle and that seems to line up with what im seeing in the pics as well so i assume the 4l is a typo	neutral
very nice review for a nice little set i especially like the smoothness of operation for the retractable landing gear i dont like the lack of symmetry for the propeller of the b model though but understand the alternative would be to add one extra small panel to the set or skip two of them in the b model	positive
good review as always jim when i first saw this set i thought that it would make a great parts pack for me as that i have about 20 white pieces in my technic collection all from 42043 and this set has some really useful ones all for a cheap price those 7l flex axles will be extremely useful in my current build im doing	positive
nice review even with the missing demonstration video of the amodel looks like this is an excellent panel pack for the price and those soft axles will go down a treat will this set be the dark horse of 1h 2016	positive
i am definitely getting set for the panels	positive
fixed the video and fixed the stars in the voting thanks for paying attention guys	neutral
i just built the a model and i rather like it it is much bigger than it looks from the box  about 30 studs long there is only one function  the landing gear  but it works very nicely apart from that its a very solid build and achieves an elegant shape with an absolute minimum of parts i dont usually get excited about small sets but this one appeals to me i like the feeling that every single piece has a purpose	positive
my favourite of the 2016 sets ive built so far id go so far as to say this is the best budget set in years i would have loved this when i was a kid  great swoosh ability 	positive
boulderer on 27 december 2015  0544 pm said my favourite of the 2016 sets ive built so far id go so far as to say this is the best budget set in years i would have loved this when i was a kid  great swoosh ability  good to hear that im gonna check the toy shops in my lunch break tomorrow see if they got their shipment in yet if they have ill definitely buy one of these little sets	positive
thats a cool little mod two small nigles though 1 your navigation lights are flipped on the main wings 2 the panels on the tail i think were supposed to be the intakes for the jet engine by using them to close up the tail youve turned it into a glider cant wait untill i find one of these on shelves	positive
so this set showed up in stores yesterday and i immediately picked two up all in all it is a nice set but it is slightly different from what i was expecting the plane feels a bit flat pointy nose wide bottom etc and while the panels work very well as wings it feels a bit simplistic to just have singlepart wings the stickers really work for it though its a cracking set though nice parts pack and a nice model as well	positive
review  42046  getaway racer introduction starting with the 42010  offroad racer and 42011  race car in 2013 tlg released two sets in the first half of each year using a pullback motor the pullback motor allows the model to be pulled back followed by forward motion usually theres no apparent relation between the two set other than the ability to combine them into an alternate build this year there seems to some sort of cops and robbers scene going on a getaway racer and a police interceptor that cant be a coincidence makes you wonder who will be victorious the good guys or the bad guys lets find out note all images can be clicked for hires versions set information number 42046 title getaway racer theme technic released 2016 part count 170 box weight 302 gr box dimensions 260 cm x 138 cm x 59 cm set price msrp € 1999 price per part € 0118 links brickset bricklink the box the box has the same dimensions as previous years pullback motor sets in the lower right corner theres a visual explanation of the pullback mechanism the dark model with its decals sure looks like a cool hot rod content of the box the box contains 1 instructions booklet 1 sticker sheet 2 technic liftarms 1 pullback motor 3 bags instruction booklet just a single booklet unfortunately no booklet for the alternate model sticker sheet the sticker sheet contains a lot of cool stickers with flames and skulls etc pullback motor and liftarms the pullback motor and two liftarms are found unbagged bags a total of three bags containing the majority of the parts highlighted parts this section describes the new andor otherwise interesting parts actually this set is the only set of 1h 2016 which doesnt use any new parts not even parts in a new color tires the getaway racer uses four low profile tires tire 37 x 22 zr rims the rims are wheel 304mm d x 20mm in pearl gold found in 12 other sets panels this set contains three 3 panelsand three 4 panels in black part list this set contains 171 parts all listed below the build this being a small model i wont show any building steps lets skip right to the finished model below you can see the end result in my opinion the model looks great its got that hot rod vibe going on and the stickers add darkness to the vibe slight problem with this set is that it really needs the stickers to finish the look otherwise its quite dull with black and dark grey liftarms and panels the rear view shows the pullback motor connected directly to the rear axle in this image you can also clearly see the exhaust pipes on the side which are very well executed the 3x3 technic discs with stickers used in the rim result in only seeing a part of the rim this works very well with the golden rims the bottom view shows the chassis of the car nothing really noteworthy as you would expect from a pullback set video the following video gives you an overview of the finished model parts left these six parts are left after building the model seems about right features and functions this being a pullback motor set it only has a single feature the video below demonstrates the acceleration of the vehicle my girlfriend was kind enough to catch the model before it fell to the ground or did it hit something before it fell to the ground video this video shows the pullback functionality bmodel the alternate model is a combined build with the police interceptor which you can see on the back of the box unfortunately the instructions for the combined bmodel are not included so i didnt get a chance to build it this would make for a fun challenge building the bmodel without the instructions summary pullback sets are not the most technically advanced models so you cant expect any other functionality than hitting the walls in your house however i think they are very appealing to kids the fact that this years pullback sets form a duo adds to the fun in my opinion tlg hit the nail on the head with the getaway racer and police interceptor the getaway racer looks very badass which is something you dont see every day in a technic set score how do i grade the bad guy in this years duo 8 design it looks so cool but it does need the stickers 7 building experience nothing out of the ordinary 7 features limited to the pullbackanddrive functionality 7 playability combined with the police interceptor kids will love it it does need its nemesys though 7 parts collection of common parts gold rims could be interesting 8 value for money pullback sets always deliver a certain value 73 hit it more image can be found on my flickr page thank you for reading i hope you enjoyed it	positive

jim great reviews but can i suggest you one thing take some pics before you apply the stickersand some with the stickers on it helps to have a comparison	neutral
jim on 01 december 2015  0934 am said you are right i came to the same conclusion when writing the review i tell you it doesnt look that good without stickers but i dont have a picture to prove it to be honest i compared it to the model posted in the 2016 topic a few days ago i applied the stickers before building the model so i wasnt able to make a proper comparison i will keep it in mind for future reviews thanks for the suggestion youre welcome im not a huge fan of stickers for 2 reasons i do reuse all the parts normallyand also i believe a model should look great even without stickers then obviously they can be a plus but only afterwords anyway im enjoying the reviews as usual and those pics thanks for making them jim	neutral

lego 42049 mine loader thanks to lego and eurobricks for making this review possible this was supposed to be a previewreview before the dec 1 release date for the set but it got stuck in customs or something and didnt arrive in time well id rather do a good late review than a rushed review so here it is name mine loader set number 42049 pieces 476 i think price 3999 i think minifigs 0 theme technic year of release 2016 links bricklink brickset the box another standard technic box not that theres anything wrong with that it is a littler weird that the mine loader is shown outside the mine but whatever the back of the box again very standard its oddly technical showing the exact angle of the machine when turning but thats the sort of nerdy detail that technic people like the alternate mine cutting machine model looks interesting and unusual as well the 11 part the 11 part on the top of the box is especially helpful with this set these mining machines are very oddly proportioned since they need to fit in mine tunnels so its hard to judge the model size based on the wheels or seat like you can an ordinary set the contents you get manuals for both models a single book for the b and two books for the main a medium size sticker sheet 4 bags and 4 loose tires the special parts this set has 4 of the new mudguard panels in yellow two cylinder halves in red a new color some of the new color red and yellow axles a couple of the newish technic spacers some of the axlepin combination pieces and a couple swords im pretty sure thats an antenna and a spare the start of the bmodel since i like the main model better im building the alternate first so thats how ill write the review theres power for something probably the engine being taken off the one axle here overall a pretty standard technic frame beginning with some structural beams a frame and using liftarms to support axles out to the sides more of the frame the far end of the model has some obvious steering mechanism being formed as well as a pivoting arm right in the center thats probably the connection from the hand of god knob the steering yup called it oddly there is a different turning radius between right and left right now i wonder if thatll get fixed more mechanisms thats looking more technic now sad to see a ujoint being used just as a fixed straight connection like that but it is the alternate model the engine block because all engines should be enclosed in a red cylindrical housing am i right the chassis its definitely coming together now and yes the bmodel instructions tell you to put the stickers on it doesnt matter whether you build the main or alternate first youll get the stickers on almost  there were a couple leftover that didnt get used in the bmodel almost done with the rest of the body done and the wheels on you really get the scale of this machine that blue seat is tiny compared to the rest of it and yes the uneven steering lock got fixed after putting the wheels on you add a couple of pin with ball pieces to the underside to restrict the steering they didnt do that at first so that you could turn the axles sharper while putting the wheels on which made it easier to do the grinder keeping in mind the scale of the machine this thing looks terrifying the tan gear at the back drives the spinning blade up front the red bushes near the turntable let you adjust the angle all done the arm quickly attaches to the body and its done sadly that tan gear doesnt connect to anything  its just a knob so you can spin the blade by hand raise your hand if youre sure i think im dating myself with that title this thing has massive reach im imagining this inside a mine grinding away the rock overhead pretty viciously effective machine the crank on this side of the model is used to raise and lower the arm works well and the grey spacer makes it nice to use since it spins freely the leftovers not much left for a bmodel nice usage starting the main model the main model starts similarly to the alternate with a frame some axles and a drive connection from one axle to something later getting complicated already were only a few pieces in and we already have three separate gear trains going on theres the axle driving the tan beveled gears inside the frame at the bottom theres more tan gears in the middle and theres also a black gear sticking up as a knob that turns the grey connector in the center the body is done i skipped ahead quite a bit but it was a bunch of standard technic building youve got a fake engine with fan at the back driven by one of the rear wheels a knob sticking up for steering and an axle coming forward to open and close the claw the claw i like that they used a link system to open and close the claw instead of just gearing it the axle comes forward from the chassis its the red axle with a couple ujoints for flexibility and drives a worm gear that rotates a gear below with a 2 stud liftarm on each side those arms have pin with towball in them and then a link going from that short liftarm to the claw its a small rotation of the liftarm but makes the claw open widely and works very well raising the claw a few black liftarms join the claw to the body of the loader and allow it to move up and down its a simple mechanism there  one yellow beam goes back and connects to a lever that lets you raise and lower the claw when raised as shown the lever locks in place by going just slightly past the centerline and its done add some wheels a cab and some wheel arches and were done its a great looking machine pretty unique and looks like the real thing the main difference from reality is these usually have a scoop for moving loose rock since weve had so many scooping vehicles in the past tracked loaders the volvo l350f excavators etc the claw here is a fun change and adds to the playability for kids like the real thing the body stays very low so the cab only has to stick up a little bit for the driver to see all around because mines are cramped and busy areas from the rear this angle is great i love the use of the new mudguard panels to make a nice curve to the back of the loader the antenna is a little weird but perhaps they had a big pile of flat silver fencing swords to use up the black gear just to the left of the antenna is the claw control rotating that gear opens and closes it the back end is a little lighter than a real machine would be but lego wanted to leave the engine exposed so you can see the cylinders moving the conclusion so whats my conclusion on this model i like it a lot its simpler than a big set would be but its got lots of design and playability crammed in a midsized set its a unique vehicle however it does have a few flaws the steering on the main model needs some drag added as is you basically have to drive by holding the steering knob since itll bend if you push it from behind i dont like the use of pin with pin hole as mounting points for the orange and red trans plates for lights since they can turn slightly and be at weird angles the antenna is unnecessary and in the way but none of these flaws are dealbreakers or even big deals theyre minor the ratings value 1010  less than 10 cents a piece lots of useful liftarms and such nothing too weird or singleuse design 910  looks very realistic for the size of the set good functionality not too dependent on stickers minifigs na  na playability 910  controls arent perfect loose steering small knob for claw control but very functional and cleverly done parts 910  nice selection although heavy on the standard yellow and black almost zero studded parts overall 9510  its a great intro to technic set  a unique vehicle good functionality nice part selection and decently priced i like it a lot

great review with high quality pictures well done im glad you took the time to do it properly cool that you have built both models i agree with the mudguards they sure look good on this model	positive
thanks for the thorough comments i agree that the set has some limitations both in construction and realism but i think theyre acceptable given the pricepoint and size the antenna is definitely ludicrous  i really do suspect they had a surplus of the swords to use up and yes the way the steering knob is mounted is loose i also noticed that the ujoints to the claw are not in the right spot like you mentioned but didnt include it since it still works fine that axle coming forward to the claw has a very long unsupported section that does bend a bit when you raise and lower the claw it works but is a bit of a cheat that im kinda surprised they let through i just checked and the bucket from 8043 is a couple studs too wide for this set im betting that was seriously considered but itd have meant scaling the whole thing up and that would have put it into a higher price point or they could have pulled the mold for the 8x14 bucket back out and remade it for this set i really like the model you built and thats interesting about the cabs being basically flush with the top but sticking out the side in image searching as part of my research i found both that style and ones like this with the cab sticking up more like the photo of the caterpillar one in my review i wonder if thats a useuropean difference or different types of mining or what because both styles definitely exist in the real world	neutral
excellent review worth waiting for the set itself is very interesting looks like it may have one interesting build techniques thanks for the review andy ad	positive
great review thank you the set to me is kinda blah interested more in the new panels than the rest of it	neutral
think this is the only 1h set ill be getting guess im waiting for 2h for the rest of the construction stuff this set looks okay to me it includes the instructions for both models which is cool and includes some great parts i like that its not just another bucket loader and that it actually tries something different too	positive
great review and great pictures  many thanks for talking the time to review this set  i am a fan of lego technic construction stuff but this set is not so appealing to me but then again i am sure some people will love it	negative
great review one thing reaaaaaally bothers me about this set both models have the engine connected to one wheel the other wheel on the powered axle is just left to rotate freely and that really bothers me as it did in 42022 on 42022 even more tbh since its main feature is being a frigging car looking at the pics it isnt even a space issue as it was in the hot rod where they needed to route the steering through so they just cheaped out and didnt bother fitting a diff in there or even a live axle link im not very interested in this set not into construction stuff but i think this is a worrying trend 	negative
thanks for review mostlytechnic not a must have for me but this set have nice assortment of parts new turntable new panels i like yellow and if ill buy two of this sets  ill get enough wheels for proper 18wheeler and rubber connectors that i almost dont using at all but want to have more and more edited by victor imaginator 06 december 2015  0219 pm	positive
definately a quirky set i think id have prefered a bucket on the front with a complex lift and tip mechanism but a grab is different as for the b model i may prefer its functions to the a model certainly something different we have not seen before	neutral
great review indeed	neutral
looks like its using the z60 turntable thats on the mercedes and the crawler crane 42042	neutral

nice mod there effe might inspire me when i get one and start modding it	positive
cool mod by effe but the original model out of the box is one of the poorest models tlg ever released looks from front to rear as a cheaped out set with really lazy design effort a shame for the responsible lego designer parts assortment seems to be ok but this should not be the most important criteria sry jim i really appreciate your always very well done reviews and offen i agree with the overall judgementsverdicts and of course tastes are different but especially that review sounds like gushing praise in my ears just my 2 ct edit ooops just saw the review isnt done by jimblush so sry jim now my final comment belongs to mostlytechnic edited by kumbbl 27 december 2015  0733 am	negative

lego 42045 technic hydroplane racer thanks to lego and eurobricks for making this review possible this was supposed to be a previewreview before the dec 1 release date for the set but it got stuck in customs or something and didnt arrive in time well id rather do a good late review than a rushed review so here it is name hydroplane racer set number 42045 pieces 180 price 1999 minifigs 0 theme technic year of release 2016 links bricklink brickset the box standard technic box action photo 2in1 logo inset of functions and the new try our app logo in the corner the box back more standard stuff with the bmodel and a larger app ad the contents 3 bags two manuals yes despite all the ads for their instructions app they included printed manuals for both the main and b models a big sticker sheet and two loose black beams the interesting parts theres a lot of panels in this set some are new colors the blue curved panel and the lshaped blue panels are a new mold i see them being used as mudguards on future sets or maybe even this year i havent looked at the other 2016 technic sets in detail yet the hose soft axle 7 long in black is new as well the normal 7 axle in yellow is a new color too and i have no idea why its in this set both models use it in invisible places so theres no reason other than making it easier to grab the right length axle to have it i assume other sets this year are using it but im not sure the manual and the dumbingdown continues now they have to show people to compare axle lengths to the 11 prints on the page that have always been there but how does the 11 work on the app might have to look into that for the record i pulled out my phone and tried to find the app in the google store couldnt find it so then i went to the lego website shown on the page and it had a link to it turns out it wasnt showing up because its tablet only so google wasnt showing it to me on my phone ill try again later with a tablet starting the build two technic standards a bunch of pieces linked together to make a specific pattern of holes and an engine block some weirdness this felt very weird to me  making the crankshaft for the engine they have you build it right to left i dont know if its because im a lefty or what but it felt awkward i need to look in some old manuals and see if its always been this way nope i randomly looked at 2013s set 42000 racer and it builds it left to right assembling the core heres the core of the racer upside down the engine block some gears at each end and a couple boat studs for smooth gliding and yes they cheated and those are only attached on two studs instead of all 4 im always amazed at how lego geometry keeps finding interesting ways that it works like here with those boat studs they fit perfectly into the bottom of the brick and against the beam the front end up front we get a standard blue seat with a couple hidden wheels behind it a boat doesnt typically have wheels but these will drive the mechanisms of this model so well let it slide an odd part choice here though  in the very front there are two tan axle pin without friction parts holding that 3 long liftarm on why theres no need in either model for the nonfriction pin and theres lots of the normal blue axle pins in the set so why include these two different pins and all done it looks like a huge jump here but its really not the front and rear connect to each other and then a bunch of big panels are added that make the model look way bigger the stickers on this set really make it work without them its pretty bland and boring so i recommend using them from the rear at the back we have a fan to propel the boat thats not so accurate all the images i can find of reallife boats use props in the water but since this is a nonfloating model we have to make some tweaks i guess there also should be fins going down into the water for stability and hydroplaning but again had to drop that heres an example of a real boat you can see they nailed the overall look quite well the underside for those that want to see the mechanicals heres the underside of the model minifig scale technic nope not quite a fig will fit the seat but sticks out of the cockpit and cant fit a helmet at all so close starting the b model again with the engine block but this time an opposing 4 instead of inline an odd part its rare for lego to include parts specific to the bmodel so i was curious when i found this 2axle with pin a fairly new part in the main model its used in a place that a normal 3 pin would have been fine and its the only one of these in the whole set so it obviously must be needed in the bmodel sure enough theres an assembly here that needs it the front of the boat more upsidedown building and that silver piston is basically only there as a spacer it has no real function yet it turns out later an axle goes into it so its a support for one end of the axle adding the wheels we keep building around the engine this model uses the same wheel setup as the main model taking shape the bmodel instructions tell you to put the stickers on in case you havent  they actually did a good job making the sticker work on either model but the silver piston used as a crossbrace is a bit weird it can spin so that axle hole on the side ends up facing whatever way it wants the back end the flex axles are used here under the panels just for appearance and to support the exhausts at the right angle same fan propulsion as the main model and just as wrong here  worse the gearing is switched in the main model the pistons and fan spin pretty quickly as you push the boat across the floor in this one they turn very slowly more instruction weirdness im always curious at how lego decides to do instructions heres how the panels on one side of the boat are assembled for the mirror image on the other side they tell you to put all 3 pins into the short panel as step 1 2 black and a blue add the white piece as step 2 and then add teh second panel and stickers as step 3 why two different ways all done heres a similar angle as most of the official images looks ok i noticed though how obvious the wheels are the back of the box image is a lower angle that hides them more and i like the mudguard panels as seats pretty clever from the side im not fond of the profile it doesnt sit level like i think it should the wheels are a stud too low sticking out of the bottom the underside like most bmodels there are compromises theres pins and axles sticking out but thats what you do when faced with a limited piece selection minifig scale yet nope not quite a bit too big this time i think the driver is supposed to sit in the seat with knees over the front of the guard where the grey pin is so the minifig is way too small spare pieces very few leftovers in this bmodel the conclusion so whats my conclusion on this model the bmodel is fairly meh and too similar to the main model however i love the hydroplane racer itself it looks great and is very swooshable for the price its surprisingly large thanks to the big panels on the sides yes this is one set that really needs the stickers to look good but they look great and are well worth putting on the ratings value 910  close to 10 cents a piece and a fairly large model for the price design 910  looks great other than the tiny fan on the back minifigs na  i was tempted to give a score since a minifig almost fits but thatd be cheating playability 810  not much functionality other than the engine and fan spinning but very swooshable and sturdy enough to be played with parts 910  a bunch of panels including some new ones just about every kind of technic pin and quite a few thin liftarms  overall 910  the set is a solid winner as long as your satisfied with the main model	positive
again great review with superb pictures the white and blue certainly works very well with your dark backdrop thorough review for such a small model small in size but great as a set tell me why did i let you review this one	positive
quote and the dumbingdown continues now they have to show people to compare axle lengths to the 11 prints on the page that have always been there but how does the 11 work on the app might have to look into that for the record i pulled out my phone and tried to find the app in the google store couldnt find it so then i went to the lego website shown on the page and it had a link to it turns out it wasnt showing up because its tablet only so google wasnt showing it to me on my phone ill try again later with a tablet funny thing is that they changed colour of 7l axle to yellow and on that picture it still is in lbg	neutral
excellent review i am glad that you did not rush this or the mine loader review could it be that the fan in the back is like a turbo prop propulsion just reaching here andy d	positive
thank you for the review i have this one in my pile to build i wish there was more of the curved blue panels though	negative
review  42038  arctic truck introduction arctic vehicles arent new to lego back in 2000 the town theme already had several small orange arctic vehicles in 2014 tlg again released a number of arctic sets in the city theme formerly known as town some of these sets are actually pretty big containing over 700 parts looking back in history it seems that arctic sets may have found their origin in the technic theme although these sets were white instead of orange they are unmistakenly arctic the 1986 technic arctic sets contained the infamous technic figures unfortunately the 2015 arctic truck doesnt contain any technic figures but nonetheless its great to see a new arctic vehicle in the technic line not counting several snow scooters lets see if the new arctic truck lives up to the expectations note all images can be clicked for hires versions set information number 42038 title arctic truck theme technic released 2015 part count 1219 box weight 2110 gr box dimensions 478 cm x 280 cm x 72 cm set price msrp € 7999  us 8499  £ 5999 price per part € 0088  us 0093  £ 0066 links brickset bricklink the box the box measures 478 cm x 280 cm x 72 cm and weighs around 1385 grams the box actually feels pretty heavy which means its filled properly this seems to be a trend in the technic theme slightly smaller boxes can save shelf space for retailers the front the front of the box shows the main model and in the lower right corner theres a image with the dimension of the model its 40cm long and 18cm wide the back the upper part of the back of the box shows the functions of the main model the lower left section shows the bmodel which looks very promising more on that later the lower right section shows the motorization options for the main model the crane partially and the bed can be motorized besides motorization some leds can be added as headlights the side on of the sides shows one of the newer smaller style panels this is the first time it appears in orange when you take a look at the sticker you can see that its not symmetrical not sure why tlg cut of one of the sides of the stickers since the position of the panel is very suitable for a continuous sticker content of the box the box is pretty densely packed which is better than semifilled boxes it feels like you actually bought something which matches the box size the box contains 2 booklets 1 sticker sheet 8 bags booklets  sticker sheet unfortunately the instructions and sticker sheet havent been packed with cardboard protection which results in a curved sticker sheet and slightly bent instructions in my case this wasnt so bad at least no real damage highlighted parts this set proves to be a great parts pack especially when you might have missed some of the 2014 sets black link treads usually the link treads come in dark blue grey but this sets includes 96 black treads which is great if youd like to replace the dbg ones in your mocs or other official sets undercarriage and suspension several parts are included to build the undercarriage driving the treads four large tread sprockets and eight small tread sprockets which are used as return sprockets also included are four steering portal hubs and four steering portal axles for driving and steering the vehicle several frames including two cshaped pivot frames and two steering ball joints to create an undercarriage much like the 4x4 crawler the set even includes two hshaped frames aka dog bone frames new changeover catch parts this year 2015 three new parts have been introduced to improve the changeover catch more on these parts later new pin connector another new part for this year 2015 is the 1l round pin connector which looks like a pin connector but acts more like a bush new pins furthermore this sets includes quite a large number of three relatively new parts 17 x pin with pin hole 14 x 3l pin with 1l axle and 11 x 3l pin with 2l axle which have been introduced this year 2015 when the new 3l pin with 1l axle was introduced in 2014 it was only a matter of time before the new 3l pin with 2l axle would appear both new pins are a great addition to the parts portfolio panels last but not least this sets contains a fair number of orange panels including the 3x11 panel in orange which is the first time weve seen this part part list below is the entire part list for the 913 parts as usual this part list can be found at the end of the second booklet the build the build immediately starts with some of the new parts used to build the compact gearbox in the center of the model notice the two 20 tooth bevel gears one would have been enough to drive the 12 tooth bevel gear so the second seems to be useless tlg probably used it in the amodel because they needed it in the bmodel which you can see later the front and rear suspension are almost identical the front side also has the 13l gear rack used for steering the picture below shows the steering rack on the front suspension in more detail at this point you have more or less finished the chassis the gearbox is in place and the majority of the functions has internally been connected to the right gears the small turntable shows where the crane will be attached later on at the end of the first booklet some of the bodywork has been attached to the chassis the orangeblack color scheme never fails to please me throw in some cool stickers for the extra effect and we have a winner if you decide to motorize the model using pf the top of the cabin can be lifted to accomodate the battery box the chassis uses lots of orange and some black panels to give the model its distinctive look the protective black bumberrailing is a nice addition which adds something to the exterior the dumping bed at the rear can tilt to empty its load its operated by a mini la the treads which look very cool in black are driven by a large tread sprocket and returned by two small tread sprockets the front and rear sections are identical building the undercarriages feels a bit repetitive which is a problem for most tracked vehicles finished model adding the crane to the model finishes the build your model should look something like this when you take a close look at the finished model you realize this is something else its trully a unique vehicle the color scheme is brilliant and the fact that its an arctic truck is really neat its a welcome change for the technic line to see a vehicle like this this picture emphasizes thats its a very cool vehicle imagine this beast plowing through the snow as far as i know its not based on a real life vehicle ifs probably a combination of several vehicles and some imagination i can be totally wrong though the rear of the vehicle shows the crane and drum placed on the tipper bed from this angle you can see some of the internals of the model the gearbox behind the cabin for example the crane can be partially motorized rotation and base while the boom is operated manually what i like a lot is the protective railing around the vehicle left over parts some leftover parts nothing noteworthy features and functions this set has several functionsfeatures steering driving suspension crane tipping bed steering as you can see in the image below the steering mechanism has quite a bit of negative caster please correct me if im wrong which causes the treads to rotate a bit upwarddownward instead of only to the left and right driving you mention driving as a feature yes i do and let me explain why normally i would ommit this as a feature and take driving for granted however driving this vehicle on a flat surface causes it to simply slide over the surface for other arctic vehicles this would be a plus but with a tracked vehicle it limits playability this is one of the main drawbacks of these tread they simple dont work properly on smooth surfaces suspension the suspension is working properly you do need to apply some pressure but all things considered its not too bad crane the crane has four degrees of freedom base rotation lower boom upper boom hook it does what its supposed to do base rotation and lower boom can be motorized and switched using the gearbox while the upper boom and hook are operated manually tipping bed the tipping is operated via a mini la conclusion while the set does offer various functions and features driving and steering is a serious issue therefor this set is more likely to be showcased than to be played with bmodel instructions for the bmodel are of high quality looking at the image below you will see what i mean heres the finished bmodel a tracked jeep with a communcations device this alternate model looks so good it could easily have made it as a main model one thing that does pop in mind how would this look with tires more on that later when you are in the artcic region its imperative to have proper communication channels since theres no internet backbone you will need a big antenna of some sort this bmodel actually features a small trailer wagon with a transmitterreceiver heres more detailed image of the bmodel without trailer wagon i would buy this model in a heartbeat if it were a main model simply gorgeous the side view doesnt give away that this in alternate model the stickers also work really well in this model and again nothing to complain here the model even has a small crane at the rear operated by the mini la here you can see the arctic fleet comprised of both the amodel and bmodel i bet these two can get some work done a bit of a messy picture but this should give you an impression of the size of both models leftover parts not too many parts left which is obviously a good thing alternate model with tumbler tires just like me you probably have been wondering how this model would look like with tumbler tires well here it is as i imagined it does look great admittedly these are not the type of tires we ought to use but to be honest i dont really care again the negative caster results in quirky steering the tires are a bit too big so they hit the chassis when you compress the suspension while this has absolutely nothing to do with an arctic vehicle i really love this picture summary were almost at the end of my review so what do i think of this set lets start with getting the elephant out of the room this set lacks proper driving and steering does that make it a bad set definitely not its a great set but it lacks some playability when it comes to moving the vehicle the crane and tipper bed do work properly so theres still some playability left does this set look cool definitely i think its one of the coolest no pun intended and most original models of recent years the orange and black color scheme works great and the stickers are well designed the bmodel is of very high quality and some might even prefer it over the amodel and if you are not interested in either of these models this set provides you with a variety of great parts all in all i think this is a great set maybe not to play with but it scores high on all other criteria pros original model great color scheme lots of interesting parts great bmodel cons steering and driving dont work too well repetitive build of undercarriages minor con score below are my scores based on different categories 8 design original and good looking model 7 building experience fun to build albeit a bit repetitive 8 features packs quite a few features 7 playability some features work some dont 9 parts comes with interesting parts 9 value for money two great model in a single set 8 cool as a bonus heres picture of the main model with tumbler tires why because we can	positive
very timely review jim my wife has just surprised me by giving me this set a few days ago and i have just built the a model two days ago and b model yesterday i agree with all that you wrote above i dont have tumbler tires but i have 9398 tires driving is smooth but steering  suspension will be bad as you said due to negative caster and tires hitting the chassis anyway tonight i will destroy the b model and rebuilt this httpwwwbusterhau8cmodelhtml	positive
i was supposed to publish it together with the 42039  24 hours racer but it somehow got backlogged after completing the reviews for the 2016 sets i felt i needed to finish it was already 90 done that cmodel looks cool	positive
the set is a looker youve got to admit it but what it gives in looks does not make up for what it lacks in functions i really wanted this set badly even when i restarted my adventure with technic about a month ago than i learned more and more about what a good model can do mostly thanks to this forum and yt right now im a bit disappointed with the arctic truck  smaller sets offer more functions and teach you much more jim it was a great review nevertheless edited by pgplay 14 december 2015  1122 am	negative

you switched the sides for the panel with the unsymmetrical sticker otherwise you would see that the cut off part is where theres a beam in front of the panel thats probably done because the beam could possibly damage the sticker either while building or while placed against it for a long time or its simply omitted because it wouldnt be completely visible	neutral

review  42001  mini offroader introduction technic mini models are sometimes regarded as models not worth buying i dont agree with this opinion whether its a special part or innovative building technique almost every mini model has something that makes the set worthwhile this time i will be reviewing the 42001 mini offroader this model is not a smaller version of an existing model so theres no real comparison with a bigger brother or sister if you will nor does the model resemble a real life brand or vehicle so it is what it is a mini offroader note all images can be clicked for hires

grams frontside the front of the box shows a though four wheel drive offroader challenging a fierce rocky mountain trailnow does it what the box actually shows is mini offroader challenging a small foam rock formation much like rocks used in star trek the original series yet smaller the box also states that this model is for the age of 7 till 14 more importantly the 2models in1 logo is clearly visible which means this set can be used to build two different models backside the backside shows a picture of the alternate model and a smaller version of the original model the conversion arrow and the 2in1 are printed to clarify that the main model can be converted into a secondary model sides one of the sides shows the 2in1 logo and a picture of the main model another side shows a picture of one of the wheels in actual size and again a picture of the main model contents of the box the box contains 2 booklets 2 bags 4 tires booklets this set contains two booklets which is not very common for a set this size both models share the same chassis which is why the build has been divided over two booklets one for the chassis 8 pages with 10 steps and one for the bodywork 34 pages with 23 steps for the main model and 20 steps for the alternate model bags the box contains only 2 bags which is to be expected from a set consisting of 100 parts one of the bags is filled with liftarms panels rims and two elastic bands the other bags contains all the other parts like pins axles connectors etc opening the bags results in the following collection of parts with the exception of the tires no abundant number parts that will add real value to your collection nevertheless there are some interesting orange parts and elastic bands tires the tires are provided seperately ie not contained in the bags from the picture you can see that these tires have a front and a back side so you should pay attention when fitting them to the rims which have two different sides as well highlighted parts this section describes the unique andor highlighted parts very small smooth technic panel 21 and 22 these two small technic were new at the time of release and this set was only one of two sets containing them in orange the other set is the 42007  moto cross bike at the moment of writing theres a third set containing these parts the black champion racer side a side b small rubber band i was under the impression that these white rubber bands werent that common but it seems that these bands are as common as dirt but hey you cant have enough rubber bands thin liftarm 1x5 with axle holes like the panels these liftarms were also new at the time of release looking at the the frequent usage in other sets this part has proven to be a most useful mammal thin liftarm 1x3 not a very rare piece per se but if you are not into bionicle this liftarm part can be hard to find your other option would be to buy the 9390  mini tow truck or the 8305  dual bikes from a while ago 2000 long pin with center pin hole this relatively new kid on the block is currently used in many technic and nontechnic sets and has well proven its worth axle pin connector hub with 2 axles like the previous part this newish part is also quite helpful in certain situations part list heres the complete list for all 100 parts building experience the build starts with the chassis of the offroader after connecting some liftarms two elastic bands one on each side are attached to the towball pins this is all there is to the suspension plain and simple the two elastic bands contract the lshaped liftarms which results in the long ends swiveling downwards the video below demonstrates the suspension the simplicity doesnt do it justice because it works like a charm the suspension is very smooth with the right amount of stretch and resistance this great working suspension adds a lot of value to this set to quote john hurt in the movie contact why build one when you can have two at twice the price i have purchased two sets so we can simultaneously see both models and make a proper comparison below you can see two identical chassis which will be used for both versions of the build at this stage we have arrived at the end of the first booklet which only took about ten minutes not surprising since the first booklet only has 10 building steps progressing to the second booklet you need to choose between building the main and alternative model thats a choice i dont need to make for this review so lets start with the main model main model when building the bodywork theres a rather peculiar building technique which you wouldnt expect in an official lego set the axle and pin connector hub with 2 axles only protrudes halfway into the double bent liftarm the thin 1x4 liftarm which is added in one of the following steps makes sure the hubs stay perfectly in place but i was still surprised to see this technique the finished bodywork for the main model looks likeuhhwelli dont know exactly it doesnt bear any resemblance to a real life model which makes it hard to judge one things for sure its not the best looking technic mini model the bodywork can be attached to the chassis by using a 7l axle and two bushes one on each side of the chassis alternate model unfortunately the alternate model doesnt look much better than the main model its even a stud less wide while you would like to see slightly more body matching the size of the tires and chassis attached to the chassis the body is even more out of proportion its not really ugly and the color scheme is great obviously this goes for the main model as well but the body simply doesnt match the chassis i can only imagine that this model is supposed to have a chibi look much like the microfighter star wars models comparison the following section shows a selection of images from different angles to compare the main and secondary model the main model has a bit more volume while the alternate model has a more sporty look front view the main model has headlights which are attached at a higher point while the alternate model has headlights which are placed more closely next to each other rear view a slightly different setup in both models where the main model again has higher placed rear lights side view the side view shows that the panels are used differently in both models the main models uses them as doors while the alternate model uses them as engine cover bonnet top view the top view reveals that the main model might have room for a minifig parts left the left image shows the parts which are left after building the main model while the second image shows the parts left after building the alternate model as you can see the main model uses slightly more parts than the alternate model features besides the awesome suspension which we already have discussed there arent a lot of features in this set theres actually a single feature which is only present in the main modelopening doors wow impressive well maybe we cant expect too much functionality in such a small model summary the offroader is a fun model which is fairly easy to build the suspension is simple yet very effective the model could do better in the design department but the suspension offers great playability and that is what this set is all about the orange parts are not very common so they are an added bonus all things considered this set is definitely worth the few bucks you need to spend on it pros great suspension fun to play with some semi rare orange parts great color scheme cons no resemblence to an actual offroader not the best looking model score below are my scores based on different categories 6 design not the best looking technic model 7 building experience the suspension makes it fun to build 7 features the suspension makes up for the lack of functionality 8 playability the model has carswooshability 7 parts some interesting orange parts 8 value for money great present for the younger builders 71 elastic hope you enjoyed it thanks for reading and please rate this set at the top of this topic	positive
the suspension is indeed awesome for its size this is a great set looking at the grades i seem to have lowballed the score	positive
sad i miss this set	neutral
tomik on 14 december 2015  0543 pm said i dont like appearance of this offroader at all but ive got it as gift so its in my technic collection now when i built it i was very surprised how cool suspension it has and how much playability it features ive also tried to build some alternative model out of it but without success anyway thank you jim for great review i did succeeded building an alternate you can see it in my signature httpbricksafecompageslxf42001 edited by lxf 14 december 2015  0635 pm	neutral

during the annual thanksgiving road trip to the relatives i stopped by the tru in portland or lo and behold the new mars mission sets obviously i bought them  the box not much to say standard box art for mm sets nothing new the parts some good parts here even if you dont like the set which i highly doubt after ive had my say p  its a decent parts pack i noticed that some old parts have been renewed i know the wheel has been used in the 07 sets but the cockpit and hitch i havent seen in a while the vldss very large dss grr new part at least i think it is someone slap me if it isnt wacko the figs i know ive seen that head before but i have no idea where does anyone know i was hoping that the aliens would have new arms at least i was sadly mistaken on the upside i finally discovered that they glow in the dark  the alien has a jetpack if thats not the silliest thing ive ever seen i dont know what is the build simple build a block so easy a caveman cou oh never mind geicos used that one enough then we have this jobber right here not sure what it is but it looks like some crystal scanning device its starting to look pretty nice it almost looks practical the cockpit is suffering from a bad dose of overstickering on the upside we have a new piece there to hold the cockpit on part 1 complete it has a nice little radio antenna which is ruined by the use of a random missile that looks like its going to shoot the antenna before it shoots the alien still i never say no to a good missile i can use for something else the trailer fairly simple but it works it features stabilizing arms a handheld saw and an extremely random minibot whos purpose escapes me the whole meal deal erm general pics overall i thought this was a good set in fact it reminds me of this	positive

thanks for the review i still will not get this set speechless about it	neutral
a wonderful set and perhaps as close to classic space as possible y also theres a great amount of very useful and interesting parts too like these round stabilizer parts with clip  theres a complete different feeling with this new sets compared to the first mm ones 8 beside the a little more realistic aspects of it with the more enclosed cockpit nearly with some controls   its the overall more solid feeling i guess the other sets look pretty neat and fashionable at the surface but their internal structure is much more hollow and useless with some studless technic beams and such stuff very shining but hard and boring to mod just aimed for maximal cool looking box art and the rest went down for saving costs beside that already pretty good 7692 dropship that is the only thing i dont get with that is why the minirobots a onearmed one ach pirates on mars i suppose xd	positive
that head might have been from rock raiders lovely set and a good review jifel	positive
great review but am i the only one who thinks this is a pretty homely looking vehicle the small exploration robot is cool but the large windscreen on the main vehicle reminds me about jack stone i also think the bases of the vehicle parts are very basic and look almost unfinished with the holes and such i think i will pass this one even though the alien has a jet pack and there is the nice mini vehicle	negative
tks for the great review mm  its always appreciated to have reviews of new set having said that i really dont see the point of that set and its such money and time wasted imo i dont like that theme apart the dropship and 6wheeler and that tiny vehicle doesnt do the trick for me i see it as a really cheap excuse to try and please classic space fan with that horrendous mm graphics and what amazes me is that you guys loke that d money saved on  yoda	negative

hmm its actually a nice bit better than i expected and great review thanks but think ill pass on this one i quite like the alien fighter though heh and loved the way you described how he sat in the cockpit	negative
very cool review mr mandalorian this isnt a bad set the alien craft is very sleek if only theyd gone with the old alien body in transgreen and the transforming is alright the tank mode looks sweet sweet peace	positive
after seeing this set review it change my mind about this set by the way thanks for the great review	neutral
thanks for a very thorough review i might think about getting this i really like the mini alien fighter and the transformation idea is always a welcome one both modes look pretty good despite the some of the odd coloured bricks which id mod out you know what it reminds me of some of the futuristic designs in the gerry anderson series	positive
friggin sweet thank you mr mandy for the reveiw of this sweet ship y wub	positive
i really like the transforming aspect of this the one thing i wish mm sets would include would be baseplates i liked that about the classic space stuff because it really helped create the environment some red rock orange mars baseplates would be great	positive
hmmm great review for a great set y	positive
lasse d on nov 26 2007 0454 pm said im not sure it would nose dive when transforming from tank mode i guess it would pick up speed and transform quickly since it doesnt seem to have any downwards pointing thrusters the one thing youd have to make sure of though is that it was fairly light and the wheel base had a fairly large surface area actually thats two things so as to make sure it didnt dig into the soil if that happened transformation would be harder as the wheels would dig into the ground and drag through the soil then itd nose dive	neutral
john cleese on nov 25 2007 1056 pm said cool review im actually liking that new missile part as it seems to combine a bar with a pin but its a real eyesore if you ask me a needed solution to those blasted flick missles from falling out while swooshing sweet wonder if the range might have an issue seeing its held in there but who knows maybe they now pop out with a greater velocity than a mere finger flick i had resorted to technic 12 bushings smooth to lock in the missiles technic axle with stud	positive

great review hinckley i know youve been busy so thank you so much for getting this up d the spine construction is clever the minirobots cool this is a fantastic set peace	positive
sweeeet wub its nice to finally see a set thats not bipedal or  tripedal quote exoforce is an anomaly in my lego interests i dont know why i like it so much or why i keep buying it but i do that would be a problem wouldnt it p quote the cockpit itself is constructed very well but the canopy seems like an afterthought closing on to the robots head and leaving his back and sides completely exposed i dunno at least it has a canopy unlike past sets	positive
thanks hinckley its always nice to see your reviews and i cant wait to see the story mode from the pic i guess it will include sinner and hinckley instead of bianca and gavin right 8  luxorv	positive
awesome reveiw thanks for the pics did the instructions come with a comic	positive
thanks for that very neat review hinckley y this set looks indeed very interesting with a very cool antlike look and a simple but essential overall design the cockpit seems better protected than many other ef ones that spines lovely and the way these iron dronesre attached is simple but effective  and hey did i miss something orre there really no crappy shooting devices p thanks to the minirobots and their inventor i guess 	positive
great review y i am sure to get this set for parts now his legs dont look very poseable  thanks hinck vbbn	neutral
great review as always hinckley frankly im in love with this thing so much so in fact that ive been calling it shadow panther for weeks but never mind anyway why do i like it well purple is such a fantastic lego colour its sparingly used which makes it interesting and it simply looks great those jetpackbackpack things the robots are wearing and if they are jetpacks as the back of the box suggests then the use of chaisaws is quite nifty and innovative the minibot is cool and certainly an interesting gimmick sure they dont look quite as good in some of the other sets but here it looks great the overall structure and design are cool too its always nice to see an irregular mech and this is no exception its especially cool whee the spines are concerned plus on top of all that its got a nice selection of parts including some lovely new ones and the inlaid box is interesting well worth getting i think	positive
another fantastic review hinckley i really like this set i wasnt to keen on it when i first saw the pictures bit having seen the review i am starting to like it it seems quite sturdy and it makes a change from the usual 2 legged mechs as well as that purple is welcome anywhere i have such a shortage of that colour i like the rusty orange colour of the robots and their backjet packs are quite cool and the mini robot looks sweet	positive

this designers were on a roll with this one until it came to the flying unit it looks like a shambles epecially the guns looking rather simplistic although they used something similar to the light and sound globe peice which is kind of neat i dont think ill be buying this but your review almost talked me into it	neutral
sinner on nov 28 2007 1253 am said how well do the tracks work the last tank was too light and it didnt roll well at all  its similar in weight but i didnt have to press down so hard to get the treads to move barely at all really i think the mobile defense tank although a better overall design suffered from the odd angle of the treads and that was mostly why the treads didnt turn well plus what was with those weird exhaust pipes anyway they are both cool tanks although i like the mobile defense tank better 	neutral
thank you for the glimps at the new set hinckley y  i saw this set today at my local tru store the new slope 1x2 pieces look very sweet  i definitly see great potential for these pieces on locomotives i hope these are going to be bountiful in the 2008 lines model on	positive
thanks for this great review hinckley  i know youre loving this attention xd p i actually like this set and like it a lot more now that ive seen this review ill most likely get mostly for the figs and parts i reckon it would look a lot better alongside the rest of the 2008 ef mechs anyway thanks for the review to the brickmobile 	positive

thanks for that good review hinckley y a really interesting set and a turning point for lego minirobots instead of shooting crap pretty cool i hope the kidsll like it too for the design i love that asymmetrical look of the front part and the sleek guns of the flyer its smart that the gatling gun moves along with the tank too the set idea with two vehicles in ones not new but very play able and the treadsbig wheel designs cool i dont like the use of studless technic beams but well they do their job i guess and keikens cockpit should be easy to improve	positive
asuka on nov 28 2007 0241 pm said for the design i love that asymmetrical look of the front part and the sleek guns of the flyer the asymmetry reminds me of the wookie vehicles in starwars battlegrounds y and i see they changed back to the first color schemes for minifig suits which i think where better than the dark suits of 2007 except for hikarus wub  luxorv	neutral

thank you for the review hinckley  already waiting for the comic xd	neutral
i think this is probably my least favourite set of next years selection but i still might get it partly because of this review thanks btw i quite like the minirobot and while there are a few problems the front cockpit the exposed axles i relish the idea of moding them out and correcting them and the change back to the original figs is welcome i didnt really get any of this years sets only last years makes it easier from a mocing potential anyway	neutral

here is my review of the set 6265 sabre island overview sabre island was release in 1990 an it contained 92 pieces and its retail price was 1550 it comes with 3 imperial blue coats and a nice outpost for them the pictures  full review anyway you can see here a picture of the box the model shown on the box differs from the actual model slightly and the back of the box which shows some nice alternative models from the pieces provided a close up of two or three of the alternative models and now for the minifigs i prefer the red coats over the blue coats but these minifigs are nice and for the number of pieces one gets a fair amount of them the set itself makes a nice small outpost it comes complete with a palm tree a cannon with ammo on a turntable a small tower a nice large imperial flag and a little red row boat here is a shot from ground level showing the cannon and blue coat patrolling the out post the rowing boat was a nice touch and it comes with a small flag too no pirates will avoid the wrath of myself and my mighty island the top of the tower is rather plain and simple which in some ways is good as it keeps the whole set detailed yet not crowded but i feel a little something should of been added to the top though the back is lacking any type of walls so one can play with the minifigs inside yet their are also no stairs or any other ways for the blue coats to climb up their tower either the rag tag pirates attack sabre island but never fear the lord of pies is here me throwing a pie at captain ironhook from another angle overall i think this is a very good if somewhat simple set and makes a great cheap imperial set comments thoughts and opinions are welcome and sorry about the darkness in some photos i have not had time to take photographs when it is till light recently for when i return home it is dark   edit fixed thank you edited by phred 12 april 2015  0514 am	positive

its not a bad thing to vote sabre island 1 if someone feels that its genuinely worth 1 but twould be interesting to know why	positive
i gave this one a 5 its one of the little pirate sets i had during my youth and i loved it for several reasons first of all it contains 2 of my favorite minifigs it can be used as a small independent base or in combination with one of the bigger sets eldorado or trading posts as a lookup or outer defense besides all that this set just looks beautiful i love the colors blue baseplate and the whiteyellow tower one of the best littlemedium sized sets ever made by lego	positive
i give it a 4 only because there are no pirates i aways loved this set nice little fortifaction lots of details i only wish i could have worked it in aberbrick	positive

lord of pies on dec 6 2007 0724 pm said the top of the tower is rather plain and simple which in some ways is good as it keeps the whole set detailed yet not crowded but i feel a little something should of been added to the top though perhaps a catapult steve	neutral

did i hear right a catapult in the 16th17th18th and 19th centuries wacko perhaps its an appeal for lord of pies to have his own personal catapult to pelt the pirates with whipped cream pastries should they try to sail past but this begs the question why waste perfectly good pie on those scurvy mangy muttfaced villians	neutral

lord of pies on jan 3 2008 0851 pm said what a wonderful idea p a pie catapult although it is a waste of a piewe have ourselves a dilemma theres plenty of stale moldy old maggot infested grog around eldorado fortress perhaps thats worth wasting on the scurvy seadogs afterall my men have taken to eating only coconuts brought by islander girls in their skimpy undies xd	neutral
its a fantastic set cant think of anything wrong with it to be honest even if the island is a bit small the plate itself is still useful and the rest of it is also very useful walls can go toward a bigger fort cannon can extend your ship soldiers extend your army boat extends err your boats and the island prin is just cool	positive
 i really love everything you did with this gas station it looks very cozy amazing how you said you built it by the book does that mean you didnt have the set but you used your own pieces to rebuild the thing the flourescent lighting is genius and the interior space looks just like what youd see at those little shops i really dig the moc  it gives me good ideas and now i want a gas station of my own p and the history behind how it was rebuilt and how it will improve business etc is so cool wub	positive
legobear on dec 8 2007 1132 pm said  does that mean you didnt have the set but you used your own pieces to rebuild the thing  thanx legobear it means that i have the complete set and have kept it complete until yesterday xd since i like the set so much i wanted to keep the general look of it  p edited by phred 09 december 2007  0627 am	positive

my 2nd review what a veteran  again found this set via a shop assistant in my local tru portsmouth uk this evening comes in at 4499 which is pretty steep but you get quite a bit for your money front of the box  back of the box  back of the box closeup  contents  it was a nice surprise to get numbered bags  not had a large set with numbered bags for quite a while at least in none of the sets ive bought recently didnt take a close up of the stickers but i was quite disappointed that the curved pieces had stickers  if they could print the att curved pieces why not these minifigs  oh  and theres a nice backprint on the pilot figure  now the build was pretty good  you build the plane first after the minifigures quite an interesting build in a way becayse for a while you think the back is the front  and then you realise heh now  ive not seen the film in a while but i dont recall a guy flying a plane with a fishing rod  dont flame me if this is what happens see earlier point regards not seeing the film in ages p after that you build the temple in stages starting with the entrance first and then the holey floor section with the spears these spears are just loosely placed into technic holed bricks quite easy to make em flick out but they can go anywhere hehe entrance  holey floor  spears  these two parts are hinged and on an angle to each other and the gap makes for a handy bottomless pit complete with pole for indy to swing over with his whip after that you create the door and the ratchet mechanism to keep it raised after that you add the runners for the ball and the swinging knives trap swords trap  before  after  finally you build the statue that holds the efigy nice bit of construction here especially the way that everything falls over once the efigy is removed do be careful when putting the curved bits on though  it appears one of the edges on mine has slightly bent when putting it on  nowt noticable though temple  preparing to steal  run you can see that the temple has toppled and debris has fallen all around  and then as he goes through the door the door falls he gets his hat and then the rock ball starts a rolling ruuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuun the stickers were a pain though  theres no room for a border around the sticker here beware after all that is done you join all the pieces together and it makes more a really good playset plenty of opportunity for recreating scenes here idol closeup  total set  spares  yet more spare stickers sorry ive already put the spares in my box of bits overall 8 out of 10  lots of play value and a pretty nice build too many stickers though  and defo poor arms for the skeletons edited by imperialshadows 01 june 2008  1218 pm	positive

this set is so cool and another must buy  im in trouble next year it seems the figs are great wub i think the plane is only ok perhaps they should have made that in a separate set as it needed to be a certain size to fit the figs but that meant that the tail is way too short here is a picture of the actual plane so you can see what i mean notice the pilot is fishing   the temple is another story i think lego have done an incredible job with this fitting in the key parts of this sequence without making an absurdly large model addtionally there are many parts in this set that i havent got so it shouldnt be too hard to justify xd thanks for another great review sweet i love the photo of indy running with the idol and the boulder close behind p naith on dec 16 2007 1020 pm said lol is it just me or in the earlier concepts of this set we saw a native on the box i wonder why they removed it  wacko i recall that too  edit yes there was one big pete on dec 16 2007 1128 pm said we dont normally have this many inconsistencies do we  quite annoying ones too i think the plane looks better with those being white	neutral
because of exams and other obligations i havent posted this sooner seeing that noone else has reviewed this set i thought i might as well do it myself the set in its entire glory minus the slammer instructions and the obviously massive sticker sheet the four cars included in this set a muscle car a sports car a roadster and the police offroader because the police obviously have no clue that an offroader is useless for catching streetracers no less a batmobileish sports car it will always trail behind but the police have a trick up their sleeve  the drawbridge gotcha and the mechanism that makes it all tick the motor is nothing more than a slow pullback motor push down the bridge the latch will hook on to the gear and keep it in place until the latch is released and theres the new gas station staying within theme this gasstation is like the tanker in 8147 from the company fuel 4 speed theres a notable presence of detail here such as the sodadispenser water coolant bottles and other accesories two fuel pumps and bumperlevel railings to prevent cars from crashing into them theres no interior however and as demonstrated here by a loyal octanemployee and a pursuing officer the gas station is built to minifigscale my impressions of this set as a collector of tiny turbos and yet to miss a set i got this one regardless of what it included the gas station is indeed very nice and the minifigscale accesories were unexpected the lack of interior is no big issue and the both the station and bridge can with ease be implemented into a minifig town the bridge also solidly built and includes the ramps in its design so it can be lifted with ramps attached without breaking apart the slammer included in the set is identical apart from the white color with those in 8147 the cars are also very nice altough i am yet to get used to the yellow batmobile as ive grown accustomed to calling it i also love the offroaders chunky tires they make perfect wheels for the newer minifigscale cars i never consider priceparts ratio and here it would for me be irrelevant because it will never be demolished for parts the play value is what i would consider pretty good and while the bridge wont rise with a car on it its still strong enough to stay open with a car tipping over the edge hmm every nerve in my body is saying that this sets is worth roughly 810 so verdict 810 edited by whitefang 23 may 2009  0701 pm indexed	positive

picked up from the lego shop in bluewater yesterday front of box back of box price 250 gbp contents a very small instruction manual instructions front intsructions back 25 pieces 23 used in the model regular construction mini fig start of the assembly roll in the drum just attach the drum a little tap with the hammer hammer not included wheel it into position time to start mixing also time for a well earned tea break the cement is all ready now and the 2 left over bits extra cement is always useful and not really wasted overall a nice little set and i am pleased to see little sets appearing again at long last the only negative is with the drum of the mixer although the angle can be adjusted you cannot tip the contents out of the mixer all in all i would say 810 for a good little set comments   edit by hobbes replaced pictures with clickable thumbs and corrected set number	neutral

heres all the parts in assorted baggies and the horribly messed up instructions four astronauts and four aliens with an extra gold visor yay not bad the base of the horribly unstable alien craft the wings move up and down aswell as back and forth the purpose i know not next we build the nerf section of the base basically technic and the rest of the tube connectors heres the farthest i got the little missle to go its fairly dissapointing good thing i didnt expect much from this portion of the set heres the start of the command base more of the main structure will be adding lots of things to all the little beams heres a storage container and the surprisingly not flimsy radar on this side we see the alien elevator it uses a horribly long technic rod i have not seen one of this proportion its like a foot and a half long more of the inner base where all the little tubes shall go all the connected tubes and such i also encountered a problem in the instructions it says for the end of the elevator prong to be touching the tube connector where it is shown here but mine has a 1x space inbetween no matter heres the completed base  my knee again onto the spaceship the bulk of it is just technic supporting beams with some large slope peices covering it all up more on that later the white coverup the middle section lifts up to store the overly large jetpack as you see the storage containers take up most the bulk in the back and you can see the jetpack on the ground aswell as the trigger hand hold thing that allows you to swoosh it look in the back lego greebles despite the large cockpit it only holds one person laying down the wings are really the saving grace  double layered with a nice two toned effect kitty nudged me this picture so its abit blurry my apologies  extra peices and or peices i have no idea where the hell they go p overall the set is quite fun i must admit full price i probably would not go for it but i got it for just under 70 dollars for that price i can confidently say its quite worth it many useful peices nice figures other than the aliens and the tube things are quite fun to boot even though i liked the life on mars system more which i also have none the less its very fun to make them shoot around alright so its not much of a command base either and it looks abit bare but its still fun even if you ignore the nerf section overall i give it a hardy 35 out of 5 the openness and epic fail of a missile launcher are hard to get by but overall its a dandy set d merry christmas wub	positive

i enjoyed seeing this review nice to get some different angles on the components sorry to disagree with anyone however but this was not a great review i appreciate the effort sandra made but a great review would include more details such as what are stickers and what are printed pieces a great review points out flaws or limitations as well as what works or is really neat a great review would have analyzed the price per piece and compared that to other setsthemes one might look at the recent reviews of the indy sets or the new spongebob sets as examples of really good reviews the pictures are good but a great review above all should provide the reader with some new information perhaps even answer questions posed in the prerelease discussion thread i learned nothing new about the set from this review that said it was a good review for someone who had not seen the prerelease discussion and she did a good job of showing said person what they could expect in the set	positive

kimt on jan 4 2008 1025 am said btw which set would you recommend market streeet town plan or cafe corner just curious theyre pretty expensive and i might only afford one of them definitely the coffee corner its a hard desicion between coffee corner and town plan because they are both really great sets the market street is no must have in my opinion but the other two maybe you should start with the coffee corner its the older set the town plan is newer and will be available longer then the coffee corner i hope it helped you a litte bit  regards sandra edited by legocastlegirl 04 january 2008  1043 am	positive
xwingyoda on dec 29 2007 0125 pm said ps  tedbeard  do tone it down youg man  if youre not happy with sandras work do provide one yourself instead of bitching on how you view a review and on how sandras post is veryt far from one according to you  wow i have not been called a youg man by which i assume you mean young for a while as a forty year old with three kids thats unusual sweet i tried very hard to remain positive in my critique and complimented her on those things she had done well i felt that given the somewhat juvenile omg bestreviewever tone that was creeping in amongst the replys that it needed to be tempered with some thoughtful suggestions as to how a good review could be made great your ad hominem approach is offensive and far more negative than i was and to suggest i should do my own review is ridiculous i live in canada and we do not even have the set available here yet thus i am interested in seeing reviews of this set if i already had the set i would not be so interested and next time you propose to critique a critique perhaps you should actually read what i wrote i said she wrote a good review for a specific audience i did not say it was awful or whatever you seem to have assumed i meant saying something is good but could be improved can hardly be characterized as bitching 	positive
thanks for the review i really want this set because 1 it looks fantastic 2 has harder to find colors 3 is a 50th anniversary commemorative 4 some of the models are based on the 50s sets i love the old stuff the tanker truck is a perfect recreation of the old ho 187 scale esso tanker truck i have one and you can look at it for comparison if you would like lego ho vehicles id like to modify the truck from this new set to look even more like the old esso truck getting rid of the green and adding some decals	positive
happy new year everyone i went to my local walmart looking for an exclusive bionicle set yesterday but was amazed to find everything there sw bionicle ef indie the works i nabbed the jsf and the rogue shadow and scampered home to take pics with my new camera wub the box the same as the other 07 boxes nothing new the back shows the various features with pop out r2  luckily the intruction booklet and the dss were intact not folded like the last mm set i got  the dss not too bad but printed parts would have been great the figs anakin is amazing imo wub fits the cw anie great i noticed on the sh reviews the kiddies were saying how ugly he looked  they need to see the cw cartoon for the sake of my health i should probably stop reading those d the build i wont go too indepth on the build since vader posted a very indepth review here the start of the build the body of the fighter starts out long and skinny the jsfs landing gear allows it to sit comfortably without getting in the way while swooshing r2d2s launching device r2 in position when launched he often gets stuck if you dont press the button hard enough  looks like r2 needs to lay off whatever it is robots eat so far the flag stickered its a big sucker sticker completed i forgot to add the nose stickers before i took the pic warning the nose cone sticker is actually two stickers i thought it was one peeled of one of the stickers and put it on the middle of the two 1x8 plates and didnt notice the other sticker wacko various completed shots i think this was a beautiful little set r2s launching unit and the flick missiles are annoying but easily fixed i plan to add proper cannons in place of the flick missiles anakin is a great minifig but he doesnt look so well standing next to my other figs the brickshelf gallery when public will	positive

wow im surprised no one had done this already first off this is a truly lovely set that many people should own even though its sold out on the sh   now lets start off with an overview note i was missing a few of the pieces the rabbit the trike when i toke the pics the figs and a cat the engine i really love this thing its a beautiful 060 steam engine with a tender this is probably the most detailed steam engine lego has given us i loved it so much i made a nonholiday version for my town the flat cars i like these but they seem a bit simple their cargo is good for christmas or a birthday party the passenger car it resembles the green passenger car we got a while back but i like the interior in this one a bit better the caboose a simple caboose like the one from 2001 the sad thing about it is thats there is no interior and its hard to take the roof off overall i like this set but it is kind of hard to use during the non winter months the price is kind of good but with that price it should have came with the motor i give it a 910 happy new year edited by agentrick57 04 january 2008  1200 am	positive
thanks for the review agentrick57 it is a beautiful set and quite cheap for me 50 aud for 965 parts 8 not sure what i will do with the rabbit though it is huge d i was considering doing this review myself but sinnerton is a mess  	positive

i got that set from my grandma on xmas she ordered it early i really like the presesnts and that blue thing 3 wheeler here in america its 100 ouch i like the rabbit whats with the rats in the trees and the cargo train nice review edited by vbbn 04 january 2008  0131 pm	positive
dang it i meant to try to get one of these after christmas  i knew they were halfoff at sh and i just forgot now theyre sold out darn thanks for the review	positive
this is a nice set xo i managed to get 6 of em before thay sold out 	positive
i was fortunate enough to get one along with the hobby train they are the first trains i have ever owned mainly by virtue of them having been half price its a fantastic selection of parts with the holiday train as well as it really looking the part as a set im happy not to get a motor as i think the 9v setup would prove expensive and the ir control system for the rc setup seems a bit poor i got some dead track for with it to have just as a push train for now	positive
okie guys and gals here s time for some droid exploration with my review of set 7670 as a general statement i have to say its really a neat set that is not that expensive for what it holds 1 box art like always i will start with pics of the box art btw notice anything guys  no bloody crappy dss yes finally a set without stickers and that feels great d 2 the mfs nothing really spectacular there the only novelty lies within the inclusion of the new commander yellow torso bd apart from that there are 2 bds and unfortunately yet another sbd i like those but i have a huge amount of them and i would rather had something different you have 3 short blasters and a couple of extra parts 3 the spider droid i think its a pretty cool little buggar its a rather simple yet classic construction i think it has sweet parts such as the bd body in dark bley it really has a spider feel unlike the previous ep3 one 4 the hailfire droid this baby represents the pice de resistance of this set i truly love it  sure its a bit under scale but i dont really mind that its conception is superb even if i totally dislike assembling those technic treads especially 80 of those small things the ellipse of the treads is well balanced and that trans disc is a brilliant idea the great thing is those new flick fire missiles they dont fall unlike the other ones and they do look good on this baby also you can put the wheels together and the missiles to gain some shelf space easy storage on d  in conclusion those druids re really sweet and are perfect target practice for the upcoming rgs hehe  i hope you enjoyed that review and do not hesitate to comment and ask pic requests if any  yoda	positive

they released the battle droid commander in 2000 	neutral
trudop561 on jan 5 2008 0421 pm said they released the battle droid commander in 2000  while there was a yellowmarked battle droid officer in the 3343 minifigure pack released in 2000 the battle droid commander from 7670 is different the new 7670 commander has a torso made of all yellow plastic whereas the 2000 battle droid commander had a tan torso with yellow printings and a tan head with yellow printings so while we have had a bd commander before the 7670 commander is new	neutral
wout on jan 5 2008 0927 pm said a druid battle pack would also be a nice idea for the castle sets may i ask what you paid for this my first and second idea was that 25 euro was a bit to much for this  xd whatever p bloody typo i say however the upcomming castle advent calendar might include druids p i paid 30 for it  dang 1 cent more expensive as sh d  trudop561 on jan 5 2008 1121 pm said they released the battle droid commander in 2000  yes another nice tone meessa so happy  first you are very welcome for my review of a set present in your wishlist then the commander you are talking about has a tan body with oreange markings only check  and the commander here has a full yellow body like in the spiderman set doc ocs hideout 4856  therefore those 2 commanders are 2 different mfs yoda	neutral

great review as weve come to expect from yoda y nice to see that tlg is finding new and interesting ways to get around the no minifig only sets restrictions with hasbro clearly this is another army builder with a minimal vehicle as were becoming accustomed to heck even the diminutive hailfire is technically a droid as well thus making this all minifigs from a certain point of view only negative it is a bit overpriced ill have a better feel for that when i get one treadslinks always drive up a price so it might just be fair the spiderdroid is a winner even with the unusual parts assortment i like it when lego thinks of different ways to use things i think it promotes the same from us im not sure what i think of the new battledroid commanders but at least i can make extras easily if i need to as i bought a bunch of yellow droid bodies off bricklink once thinking i might want to make some kind of new droid out of them they were cheap at the time now i expect the price to go up just because of this potential use between those and the grey ones its good to see more becoming available hopefully well see black and a few other colours produced for some nice customizing possibilities all in all a nice little set with a great army building potential especially on a buyonegetonehalfoff or better type of sale until then ill grab one or two and be glad to have them	positive
i got this and a couple of other sets on mondayand to tell you the truth i was a bit dissapointedi like the set i like the parts but its definitly not worth its rrp of 45 nzd if you ask me i should be more like 35 nzd but hey i still like it i got it for 30 on ebay so im not complaining y y	negative
my hailfire droid is gonna be coming in the mail soon as well as the battlepacks	neutral
great review yoda thanks for sharing i wasnt real fond of the postal truck at first its so different than those in the us but after seeing your closeup images esp the back of the tuck it looks really neat i also like the mail box a lot it looks good in red too bad for the stickers but its still nice the plane reminds me a lot of the design used in the jurassic park set as youve said its similar to 80s designs i really like the brickbuilt design too its just real lego  thats about all i can say very nice sets that are a must together thanks for the review	positive
excellent review you convinced me to buy these two could you tell me how much you payed for them i think im gonna buy them tomorrow if they have it already or if i dont see any cooler sets	positive
i havent spotted these in the us yet im looking forward to finding them overall the 2008 lineup is a excellent and its going to be difficult for me to decide which themessets to pursue theres a lot to choose from	positive
nice review yoda i dont think i have ever read one with as much cursing of stickers d i love these two little sets the colour scheme the little different wheels on the post van and of course the new postmen uniforms would have been nice if they had included little satchels like in the new indiana jones sets oh well  postman yoda on yoda	positive
thanks for the takes on these two sets yoda stickers or not i still think these are charming sets with all the essence and nostalgia of the older sets back in the 8090s am i the first one to notice the new doors used in the back of the van not only is it using the popular new frame but the old container doors have been redesigned to fit with the new frame as well pity theyre not yellow though	positive
aww man is tlc really getting too cheap for printed parts shame on you tlc despite those stickers these are two really neat sets especially the airplane classic wub reminds me of that little plane my dad bought in an airplane not sure whats the set nr the window at the rear of the van looks like a normal window frame without the clips for the shutters i never knew those existed 8 might come handy for ship building thanks for the review yoda	positive
thank you for the nice review pity of the stickers but the design is nice 80ies on	positive
thanks for the review i was always going to get these two sets so you havent swayed me at all xd i reckon lego could enhance this subtheme by releasing a post motorbike with or without a sidecar and post office obviouly the office would be the hub of all the activity while the post bike would take care of the postal run this would free up the van to take or recieve bulk mail or parcels to or from the airport it could then also do the parcel deliveries around the city the office would also serve as the reciever for all the parcels the new goods truck might deliver just some thoughts thats all sweet	neutral
thanks for the review  i was actually considering getting these but i saw they were overpriced for my tastes  too bad theyre nifty lil things wub	positive
loool  spielberg goes on a career change d these are some nice sets i really love that car looks sleek	positive
while the plane does look nice i dont particularly care for the van but the van does have some good parts which is the only reason i would by one yellow mud guards the new windshield and the small door on the rear	neutral
well first off thanks yoda for the great review  hmmm well i have to say im not at all impressed with any of these sets i mean there nice and all but the van just seems way to small it would have been nice if you could fit more than one package in it i guessim one of those that are more of the fan of the 6 wide trucks and the plane hm this has a cute factor and all but i mean comon you have to open a hatch on the roof to get your packages in and what about getting them out you have to flip the plane upside down  weak they should have had a hinged rear end or a hatch on the side	negative
thebrickster on jan 5 2008 1012 am said i wasnt real fond of the postal truck at first its so different than those in the us good point b this design is just too foreign to my eyes for me to enjoy i dont like either of these sets very disapointing  the postal theme has so much potential i dont really like the torsos either  too plaincheap as kanal suggested and i will agree that the wheels on the van look cheap i was sooooo impressed with city 2007 this is a real let down though i am happy to see a small set with a postal box so even though all that aside ill probably buy 6 of the van  just for the yellow mudgards postal box and stickers to populate my city and i think this set will provide some excellent piece to moc a yellow civillian convertable with sweet  bm	neutral
im glad to see the mail van has the doors that used to be on the older cargo containers i had given up on those older ones but now that theyre still out there i may invest in the older cargo system instead of the new 6wide ones both sets are good enough ill get both im hoping for a postal building too even though i have the smaller of the old post offices a nice big modern one would be great im not too hung up about the design of the plane ive got the neat old cargo plane with the tail that swings open one of the best plane sets for big packages the truck is goofy looking but if i get sick of looking at it i can rebuild it into a classic looking one great review by the way the pictures are some of the better one ive seen in a review recently	neutral
5150 lego on jan 6 2008 1108 pm said well first off thanks yoda for the great review  hmmm well i have to say im not at all impressed with any of these sets i mean there nice and all but the van just seems way to small it would have been nice if you could fit more than one package in it i guessim one of those that are more of the fan of the 6 wide trucks i see your point that more cargo capacity would have been better nevertheless my personal preference is for smaller classic scale city sets the mail van is nice and small and should fit well with my road plates and 1990s cars from the 4561 train on a side note did anyone notice the message on the back of both sets boxes designed for easy building and instant play it surprised me a little since these sets seem no less complex than any other city set of late they look like quick builds sure but not as though the designers went out of their way to simplify them	positive
thanks yoda for the great reviews i love the airplane its really cute the van needed to grow on me though but you did the trick i dont like the wheels of the van they will need replacing and wouldnt everything have been better if they were completely red dr brick	neutral
thanks for the great reviews yoda the car looks great y and the plane is very cool too and much more suited to a lego town than the large planes on xd peace	positive
hey everyone my first 2008 set is this one 5613 i thought id share a review of it sweet id like to say sorry about my photos they were taken quickly first we have the box it is the smallest lego box ive ever seen and actually looks cute wub it will be heavy competition with playmobils specials back of the box showing an action pose the contents of the little box with a very tiny instruction manual wub the manual unfolded notice that every part has its part number beside it  the back of the manual showing some fire sets and the other impulse sets the parts 30 in total the small set built the firefighter has a small fire to extinquish armed with an axe chainsaw other saw and foam psssh thing xd  five extra parts in a 30 part set we get an extra black hatchet yellow bar tap light bley 11 plate red 11 plate modified with fingers and 22 dark bley radar dish besides the plate ive never seen these as reserve parts but im not complaining xd here is a small alternate model i created with it a small bbq what hes hungry and he needs to put something on the bbq  xd overall you cant go wrong with these impulse sets i paid 289 euros for this little set so thats a great value sadly the only impulse avaible were these 3 city sets no police and the alien mars mission looking forward to the knight and magician as well as those indy sets tt	positive

looks like ill need to buy another one i just started the garage which is attached to the house but i ran out of yellow bricks   btw nice moc takuto20 y i might have to steal your idea and make a third story since its abit tight downstairs to fit everythingooo yea and i like your kitchen and the dishwasher   edited by darthlegois619 23 march 2008  1100 pm	positive
thanks for the review dunamis this is a great little set im also very impressed with takuto20s mods ive been trying a few of my own i liked the tower block design but a lot of stuff needed fixing firstly i added a 4th wall and made it so the storeys could be lifted off like in the other models i also added flowers on the windowsills and doorways out on to the balconies still to be added is an extra door for the top floor which im going to get from the new doors and windows pack i added a chimney that goes all the way up the back of the house and has a fireplace on every level each floor is fully furnished with a fireplace wash basin and bed on the upper levels and a corner sofa and coffee table plus an extra large fireplace on the ground floor finally here is my idea of what to do with two copies of this set all the parts pictured are from 2x 4996 except 5 extra fence panels and the minifigs the house on the left has its garden at the rear	positive
1 before buying even if i am city fan those new sized planes are really not mine cup of tea my love to lego is firmly frozen somewhere between years 19801995 main reason to buy was that i wanted to write a review at czech afol web kostkyorg i bought it three days ago via web advertising price was  35 usd 2 after opening the box as presumed some very big parts and three bags and as an additional bonus lot of danish air free of charge first sight told me that this will be really short and easy building 3 impressions during building and it was really true 30 minutes of lazy building bag 1  plane bag 2  plane gondols with supports bag 3  wings and propellers when i saw the way how is this plane made i was strongly thinking to play money for nothing from dire straits as a music accordant with whole set 4 impressions after building  lookout juniorized creeps this is my first plane in this scale and for 99 the last one lack of details lot of ugly big parts from whole set you can see the main development target  to keep rrp at some certain low level inner space of airplane absolutely undone no details no luggage no computers nothing at all just a lot lot of air the very only details in whole plane are the stickered pilots desk and some kind of seat constuction 5 impressions after building  playability but what is playability at this set hydroplane which cannot float as seen on enclosed photos  if tlc will make some new kind of big parts used for gondolas to make the plane floating they will for sure make no other damage juniorization couldnt be higher you even cannot drive across the carpet with the plane so how to play open the doors open the cabin part and turn with propellers weak weak weak 6 resumed impressions sadly i must say that at limited release sets tlc boat seems to sailing to the worst part of the coast after quite good 7344 perfect 7899 and 7900 strange but acceptable 7998 juniorization came back with 7906 followed with this ugly playmobilized 7732 7 final word in fact even 15 usd seems to be too much for this kind of set 35 usd expected rrp in our country is really overpriced to hell neither set nor minifig is not interesting tlc maybe knows about juniorization as well as nowhere on the box the number of pieces isnt written if you my afol friends want to spent your bucks better give half of the price to african orphans you will save your money and you will have a good feeling all the photos you can see below as i cannot upload onto this topic due to some limit httpwwwkostkyorc15954newnew edited by kanalk1 16 january 2008  1032 pm	negative

hello and welcome to another redman set review well actually the first redman set review im your host redman and today i adorn my medieval outfit to tell you about the impulse set simply titled the knight this is a great set with 14 pieces 2 of which are spare and a minifig with 2 weapons 2 helmets and some shiny armour all this is packaged in a tiny box just short of 10 cm or 3 inches with a neat little instruction manual that folds up to the size of the weapons rack included in the set as you can see this set only costs a measly 7 nzd disclaimer redman not included here we see the box clearly showing what the box holds on the top we see a 11 scale picture of a minifig for those new to lego or who have forgotten how big a minifig is i guess  xd the instruction manual showing the nice and easy built with me for size comparison d sorry about the dark image i had to lean over the light to get a birds eye pic  here we see the 2 different soldiers you can make with the set a knight and a guard or standard troop or soldier or whatever you want to call him note each set comes with only 1 minifigure and additional accessories of course you know im in the picture just for the sake of it im not really one of the soldiers xd the neat little weapons rack or rather equipment rack as it holds not only a weapon but a shield except the ovoid ones helmet and armour nice and easy storage so your equipment wont get dirty lying around on the ground d one of the spare parts is another of those robot hands so you can stick that in place of the shield and allow the rack to hold 2 weapons just thought youd like to know that  and here we see the nifty little structure of the thing it can even support a whole minifig note the grey stud on the bottom bar is a spare part i just find it better used there to hold the armour  huh i dont remember this picture 8 it appears i drifted off and these guys dont look too happy i overtook their weapons equipment rack  i should go xd so in conclusion this is a great set for army building at a reasonable price with nice equipment and it can be picked up as a little extra with your normal shopping xd thats all for today folks sweet redman so what do you think should i continue with these redman reviews  p or just stop now xd comments and criticism welcome  peace	positive

thanks everyone for your positive feedback its really appreciated d youd be surprised how long that redman presents thing up the top took me to make xd so it appears people do like redman expect him to be reviewing the good wizard and battle arachnoid in near future i know those have already been reviewed but new zealand never gets sets first so ill just be reviewing the sets i get xd thefrisian on jan 19 2008 0444 am said nice review very detailed y as for the spare parts mine didnt come with any both dark grey 1x1 round plates are used on the weapons rack one for the armour one for the helmet and i only got one robot hand for holding weapons thats strange maybe im just lucky xd i also got 2 spare orange viking horn pieces in my battle arachnoid d peace	positive

well today i finally got my hands on set 7038 now since the moment i first saw pics of this set i knew it was for me so lets start with the new troll helmet and torso these are both great this troll really stands out as a leader when next to the usual trolls in the dwarf mining set ok so heres a few shots of the front of the set now one thing i really like about this set is the way that lego have placed the back wheels higher than the front this allows the set to really appear to being pulled here we have a shot at the missiles on the wagon these are better than some around i have to say if you look just behind the bottom missile you will see a simple firing device simply push it down and then let it go to see those missiles fire the troll flag is moved behind the missiles for firing one thing that does bother me about this set is the lack of anything on the rear ok its easy to fix with a little mocing so its not the end of the world but i would of liked something placed there now lets move on to the crownies wagon this is simple yet good for holding weapons as for the crown knights themselves well there the ones from the impulse sets which is great imo heres a few quick shots of the 2 larger trolls we have so far i prefer the sand green one what about you well thats the end for now requests for pics and comments are welcome overall i rate this set as a must for anyone whos a fantasy castle fan i know ill be getting more of this set as for the new wagon well its joined up with the other trolls i do hope the impules crownies i bought today can handle them oh and yes i did change the knights heads xd  fantasy war on vader	positive
seems like a good set should i get it btw how did you get you hands on this	neutral
commander andrew of 501 st on jan 19 2008 1251 am said seems like a good set should i get it btw how did you get you hands on this well if you like the fantasy line then yes if not no i had to get this set through shop  home took ages to get here im sorry to say	neutral
looks like an ace set  i may get this just for the sand green troll even if im not a great castle fan i do want one of them things wub i also love the goblins new metal flaked helmet and the same style with the wheels they look very nice the chicken leg fishing pole is always fun too 	positive
nice review sweet this is a must buy for me since i wub the new sand green giant troll now i just have to wait until its available in the us  general tarful	positive
thanks for this excellent review vader it seems you are succumbing to the castle side of the force i love the new helmet and the new orc torso is fantastic as well which is great to see that the troll faction has many ranks too the troll himself i love i agree with you in saying i prefer the sand green version the battle wagon is cool one of the better wagon designs and the flag is a great touch which improves it sadly the back is rather empty but a few modsll change that  and of course this set includes the infamous chicken pole one pic request if you have time vader could you please post a few pics of the new helmet on its own and on a human soldier please batbrick is back 	positive
thanks for the review vader the first picture of the troll is great the gold armour really shines xd a fantastic set ill definitely get a couple of these wub as for the ogresgiant trolls the dark tan one fits in the mine setting well but for above ground settings i prefer the sand green one y peace edited by iamded 19 january 2008  1021 am	positive
some people say they like the shadow knight helmet better but this one is way better	positive
this is fantastic i love the new helmets for the goblins sweet ive always loved the chicken leg thing really screams lego to me at least how lego used to be  great little bit the goblins are awesome too and the sand green one should look good next to the tan onesgives a nice feeling of a real species in reality not all members of a species are identical its great seeing them in different colors great review xd	positive
those extra helmet pictures just seal how much i love those new helmets wub they look so great	positive
thanks for the review i love this set its a cheap way to get green trolls and i love the new helmet it looks great and i think it will be very usefull for other factions as well sweet dnl	positive
a troll driven by a turkey leg what a wonderful little detail d d thanks for the review vader very clever using a flag to hide that crazy firing device i find it rather odd they used blue pins for this black or gray wouldve been alot more discrete about the big trolls i think using different colours is good i dont think a troll force would be very organized so different colours would make the effect complete y  as for your troops looks quite fearsome definitely compared to my pathetic number of soldiers  a nice set but i would rather get the attack on tower though no matter about the price difference	negative

highlandcattle on jan 20 2008 0915 am said this set looks pretty good to me it is six wide isnt it that is nice for a truck like this yes 6wide the only problem with these big trucks is how they look on the city roadplates ive always thought too big compared to classic city trucks getting off topic id like to see lego make a car transport truck i dont think ive ever seen one in lego it would definately have to be 6wide or even larger	negative
great review my only grip with this set is you can only fit one pallet in the truck it should have been the same size as the trailer so you can at least fit 2 pallets seems like alotof wasted space if im going to transport cargo i want to use the maximum amount of space aviable xd	negative

greetings and welcome to another redman review im your host redman and today i adorn my medieval outfit to tell you about the impulse set simply titled the knight no wait thats the old script xd i mean the good wizard sweet the other castle impulse set the first being the knight this is a wonderful and in my case unexpected addition to the castle line i did not expect to get a nice good wizard but rather another plain white skellie for the impulse and was pleasantly surprised when i saw the first picture of this set the impulse sets give you pieces you wouldnt expect to see in such small sets for example the knight came with the armour and this comes with an owl a gem and a crystal ball piece it comes with 11 pieces including the wand owl and gem and no spares which doesnt really matter as it doesnt need any the box sports the set number age range which i blissfully ignore xd awesome castle logo and the assembled set with the usual 11 scale picture of a minifig the back of the box shows pictures of the boxed skeleton tower and kings castle siege sets note the price is in new zealand dollars and is really the same prica as any other impulse set next are the instructions which are separated into 3 parts 1 for the minifigure 1 for the table and one for the bird stand very simple also worth mentioning is the parts numbers are next to their respective parts for replacement parts etc on the back we see on the top half pictures of skeleton prison carriage skeleton tower and kings castle siege this time not of the boxed sets but the sets themselves on the lower half we have 8 pictures each of the different impulse sets the wizards torso is plain sand blue with no patterns or anything but it doesnt really matter is his beards in the way  the head is that same old white fade to grey beard head but the white beard covers up most of the grey my favourite part is the pants i love that were getting printed belts and legs again his belt has 4 gold crosses as seen in if you look closely the new crownies torso and the crownie archers torso and a belt buckle and the legs have a bottle a coin and a small bag nice little wizardey items the er items no accessories no models the stuff in the set include a little stand for the owl and a table utilising the new 4x4 round piece in light bley with the crystal ball in the middle encasing the yellow gem held on by a 2x2 circle piece in blue why blue im not sure maybe its because the crystal is yellow and the crownies colours are blue and gold so the blue piece with the yellow crystal symbolise the crownies colours or maybe tlc just felt the need to include an odd colour p in conclusion this is a wonderful set with some neat accessories and it doesnt really need to be bought in the masses after all you needs an army of owls and wizards  p so it works fine as a single set and adds a more fantasy feel to your crownie army thats all for today folks sweet redman thanks for reading another of my redman interviews any suggestions on how towhat to do to improve it is greatly appreciated as are all comments and criticisms except those blatant thoughtless criticisms that dont help at all p peace edited by kimt 10 august 2008  0131 pm	positive

well since noone seems to have done one for this set here we go heres the complete set in all its glory yes i really like it but then tabletown has the capacity to support it and my green army have their eyes on it as a potential military transport as well  ill start out with the little airport ground car thingy  very neat and functional here are views front and back next up the steps which allow the plane crew to embark and disembark and to round off this little trio the cargo loading platform here in its lowered position note the prong thingy sticking out from the rear and here raised the prong thingy is now hinged up to support the back of the platform and keep it level heres a slightly different angle so you can see the pieces under there the allimportant cargo itself hmmmnot much for a plane this size the cargo pallet slots neatly onto the loading platform heres the complete set of ground equipment  all attached and so onto the plane itself note that unlike the other large planes the main wing sits at the top of the row of bricks making up the side of the fuselage i took it apart a little so you can see the internal construction of the fuselage note that the cargo area is really small right at the back what else is this thing carrying illegal immigrants  a picture of the rear of the fuselage just because i like the sticker front landing gear way better than on the other large planes i dont know if this is a new piece or what but ive had no problems with it at all and my kids have been playing with it as well the rather sexy rear undercarriage  this area reminds me of one of those giant russian transport planes  wicked those angled grey slopes atop each side of the rear undercarriage annoy the heck out of me as they keep coming off whenever i pick the plane up i think a 1x4 plate on top to bind them together might solve that a slightly blurry view sorry from underneath the gear looks like it might be capable of retracting internally but alas no this is a shame as theres certainly enough room in there and its a wasted opportunity imo might have to modify that a view of one of the four engines i personally think they look too small and should have something under the wing as well to make them rounder cockpit crew door open i love the smooth action of these doors and the way they seal flush against the fuselage when closed cargo door open crew door with docked ladder cargo door with docked loading platform cargo slots inside and locks into place the same way it sits on the loader neat the minifigs sorry this one is a bit blurry and that concludes this weeks show and tell dr s	positive

lt veers on feb 4 2008 1142 pm said i do admit the amount of cargo is rediculously small but it still looks good say how much can the plane hold thanks for the review sweet thats all the space you get now it might be possible to rip out that rear bulkhead at the back of the wing and fill the middle area with tiles so cargo pallets could slide up the fuselage but that would definitely prevent the undercarriage folding internally if thats what you wanted to do as well dr s	neutral

thank you very much for a good and informative review doc sinister y this looks like the best of the bigplanes to me very nice and smoother than the rest  although like youve said what the heckre they transporting diamonds and pearls so much wasted space and the landing gear should really fold in n	neutral
i loved the pics in the catalogues but was a bit disappointed by the build and end result my own thoughts cons  as noted the cargo space is really small considering the size of the plane although i can see this is restricted due to playability  without the barrier in the middle the cargo would slide all over the place while the plane was being swooshed  the cargo lift im not sure how else to describe it is very weak and snaps off although it is a clever design i think its badly implemented  there is nothing to hold the cargo pallet to the cargo lift truck so it tends to slide off all over the place as soon as the truck moves  colour issues  i had at least 3 shades of green with the larger plane pieces and noticeable variances even with identical cargo hatch pieces at least one of them also came quite scratched which was a little disappointing  at 7995 aud its 10 more than the passenger plane was with less pieces and figs and no printed pieces whatsoever more  for less methinks pros  lots of nice cargo crate pieces and even the stickers for these are pretty good  landing gear piece adjusts very well to height differentials so the plane doesnt lose its gear as often as the earlier passenger planes  the hinging mechanism works very well to open the cargo holds  opens very smoothly and is not noticeable  id definitely like to see more of this technique  the little vehicles work well chained together and are all good small designs overall  i really like the large planes since 06 but i dont think theyve still quite hit the nail on the head whereas the earlier planes were a little flimsy this one is sturdier but has its own issues the look of the cargo plane is nice and the new landing piece and cargo hatch pieces are really great but some design weaknesses and colour issues detract from the overall product its a shame as with a bit of tweaking this could have been a musthave set	negative
wow thats a great review of a great set dr s y as you yourself have already noted this has the potential to be a fantastic military moc with a bit of modification you can get the engines to be rounder or perhaps do away with them completely and replace them with jet engines sweet though i cant think of a system to retract the undercarriage at the top of my head it seems like theres indeeed more than enough potential to do so it reminds me rather of an ilyushin il76 one of my favourite cargo planes 	positive

nice review dr s i have been thinking long and hard about the scale of the planes in my town i would like to keep my passenger planes in their classic 4wide fuselage style but i really dont mind the new plane hull pieces if they are used as an enormous transport plane like the ilyushin76 unfortunately i cant afford this lovely new green one at the moment which would be perfect to go with my green army as i took too much of a hit buying the new 2008 star wars sets but i have modified my white one to take huge cargo loads in fact my apc is designed specifically to fit inside unfortunately im a bit busy to take pics at the moment but hope to put some up soon	neutral

welcome to my sigfig sgt joey sh will lead trough this review of the new city 7743 police surveilance truck first of all the box front back the minifigs 3 police officers and a bad guy now the vehicles the cute little atv wub the main part of the set the surveilance truck a shot of the interior the trailer back of the trailer the truck back side the little building front the interior and last but not least spare parts and not needed stickers thats it hope to see you again at the next episode of sgt joeys reviews	positive
it looks to me that the little building is supposed to be like some sort of customs checkpoint between one nation and another or like a toll facility on a highway i like the little checkpoint but i think that should be part of a separate set and 7743 just having the police mobile command center truck	neutral
hello and welcome to another oh wait first batbrick and iamded review today us two sworn enemies will be reviewing the creator cargo chopper here is the front of the box and while pushing iamded to his doom here is the back haha ouch oh dearhere are the parts anyway here is the instruction of the first model the cargo chopper i love creator sets for the different models they always excite me just ignore me finishing off my nemesis in the background something very interesting that i liked in the instructions was this step where you must add those three 2x2 yellow rounded pieces under the chopper this is for support while you build which is handy and later you take it off and even later use it as the cargo i found that to be rather innovative and clever as well as  hey what are you hitting me for both instruction booklets have the same back now heres the chopper itself i love the design of it it isnt quite minifig scale but its great all the same this is my first nonxpod or house creator set and it sure is fun here me and iamded go for a dizzy ride i love the nose of the copter and the landing gear is fantastic a shot from the other side oh dear it seems weve been a bit sick from that ride and were vomiting transgreen 1x1s the cargo itself is nicely made though i forgot to put on two tiles here   it fits in real well with the chopper to and the line is great for giving iamded the wedgie he deserves this is my first power function set so i was pretty excited the motor is intergrated really well into this set and is activated by pushing that little 3x2 plate with the 1x1 slopes on it forward until it hits the motor button that orange knob another point of interest is the use of bley barrels on each side i like this as i dont have those pieces in that colour a shot of the motor its really simple all you do is pull the hook out to any length that allows then press the orange button and it will wind it back up this makes the chopper pull the cargo up into its bay and iamded pull me here reluctantly to a whacking a top view is that my head a view of the chopper without the cargo in it i love the lowered cockpit the leftover pieces from building note iamdeds head does not count as set piece and a final shot of the set with me and iamded oh it appear were dead oh dear hope you enjoyed this review soon i will post the two alternate models i loved this chopper its great to play with and has nice construction it also has some handy pieces too the motor function sounds like a gimmick but is well intergrated into this model well worth the price so far this is another win for creator i say so far i recommend this model but later well see if the alt models are up to scratch also since this is my first review comments and criticism welcome on everything batbrick away  edited by whitefang 23 may 2009  0637 pm indexed	positive
great review batbrick iamded got what he deserved xd	positive
thank you very much for a fine review batbrick y what the i never realized these cool grey barrels till now thats pretty interesting  the whole chopper looks very good with a well fitting power function its for sure a rewardable work to change that baby into a real mf version with accessible cockpit 	positive

haha your review are so funny and so lego cool	positive
i really like this set even though i was hoping for a minimotor d chock full of great parts too thanks for the review sweet	positive
thanks guys heres the final part the instructions for the boat begin on page 46 the overall set its actually much nicer than i thought it would be the pictures on the box make it look ugly top view tommy guns do not actually come with set  side view the designers have done an excellent job with the hull considering the lack of many slopes pieces you can see it is pretty much minifig scale too here you can see that by pushing in the red technic axle the anchor on the front will be hauled back into the boat back view these outboard motors are pretty cool though i wish they could go own into the water more overall though the weakest model its still a lot of fun and has a clever way around the lack of a shapely hull i was impressed with it after the building it it even has two rounded snotty bottom pieces on the nose of the boat to give the impression it is speeding through the water with the front lifting up lots of leftover pieces for this one the pieces sorry about the poor photograph there it was getting late  overall the cargo chopper is another great set in the fantastic creator line loads of fun great play and some clever designs it challenges you to make your own things and even includes some nifty pieces bley barrels wub  i wont give it a rating but ill just say i certainly recommend it to fans of the theme and lego fans in general now finally iamded and i teamup in the face of a larger foe get that lord of pies batbrick away 	positive

6258 smugglers shanty overview smugglers shanty was released in 1992 it consisted of 69 pieces 3 minifigs two pirates one imperial and it cost 925 usd the set itself is a small but rather sturdy den for the pirates review the minifigs consist of two pirates and one imperial the minifigs are not all that rare which is disappointing i would of liked a rarer fig but still it is a good cheap source of pirate and imperial figures here is an overall shot of the set which includes the three figs the shanty which is made using palm leaves pieces and a nice grey shark nibbling at the soldiers oar a close up of the soldier rowing hard in his boat i would have preferred to have a normal soldier with shako hat as i have more officers than normal soldiers now and a close up snap of the main structure note the wine glass which was a nice touch funnily enough only 4 pieces of treasure were included in this set compared to the usual 8 gold coins in other sets a view from the back which also gives a good view of the pieces used to construct the shanty mainly simple black 1 by 1 bricks the shanty looks good from most angles but their are a few where the roof construction looks rather odd but that is just a minor nitpick yet another view from the front this time at a slightly different angle the yellow base plate looks rather nice too i prefer it over the tan pieces we trend to get nowadays attack the stupid drunk pirate in the background does not even notice overall i think this is a rather good set despite some shortcomings such as the lack of treasure and odd roof from some angles the shark imperial soldier and useful parts make up for it and of course the price is cheap on most auction sites i got mine for a mere 5 10 with the cheapest price on bricklink being 8 rate the set then leave your comments thoughts and opinions	positive
first ill comment on the review and at a later date ill comment on the set youve done a top job lord of pies y youve captured the set from a variety of angles and posed the minifigures interestingly	neutral
very nice review lord of pies thanks for taking the time to put this together and especially for all the detailed pics y i very much regret that my dark ages occured when they did basically i missed out on all the cheap and easy troop building sets and this one is certainly no exception the big sets are nice but these are the ones that always make me wish just a little harder for a return of lego pirates  i gave it a 4 out of 5 just because id buy 4 out of 5 sitting on the shelves today were it possible	positive
i bought one of these new from bricklink a few months ago as part of my pirate splurge i went on i really enjoyed this set because of the amount of figs in such a small set though pirates were always pretty good about their fig count also the neat little hut is nicely done for its purpose great review btw	positive
great small set that can help you add to you minifig count the little boats are always cool and the den isnt that bad either	positive
a very nice review of a pretty and neat little set thanks lord of pies guess it´s a 3 for me with strong tendencies to 4	positive
first of all excellent review 55 for me i have yet to attain one of these sets it has a nice trio of men including a redcoat and a nice assortment of weapons the rest such as the leaves is great for mocing imperialshadows on feb 19 2008 0841 pm said i gave it a 4 out of 5 just because id buy 4 out of 5 sitting on the shelves today were it possible if i saw 5 of these sitting on a shelf i would certainly buy all 5 then i would ask to speak with a manager to see if there is any way i can attain more pirate lego stuff simonwillems on feb 19 2008 0847 pm said nice poll as well but you made sure nobody can give this set a 1 which is very nice but probably a little mistake d  i gave it the toprating one should not step into the pirates domain and give a mere 1 to any non4 pirate set duke	positive
woow d this was my first lego set ever	neutral
a nice review and a nice little set for anyones pirate collection a 55 for the review	neutral
id give the set a 3 12 out of 5 it needed 1 more imperial to get a 4 a bigger basplate would have been nice as it appears to hard to fit all the minifigs on the island thanks for this great review	neutral
laurinator i dont mind an occassional old review coming back to life for discussion but it seems youve replied to many old reviews that have been stagnant for years please try to refrain from bumping a lot of old topics as it pushes down new content that should really be the focus of discussion now	neutral
well since this topic has resurfaced i would add my 2 cents about my appreciation of this set it was the first and unfortunately the largest pirate set i owned as a kid but i played the wazoo out of it some of the minifigs have lost almost all their face printing after so many play sessions theres just something about the hut that appealed to me more than the cheesy skullface islands we keep gettingprobably that it wa kind of neutral good for my pirates settlers or islanders though the palm leaves were rather fragile and used to break off the studded parts it would be nice to get more of these beach village army builder sets edited by ardelon 21 september 2014  0340 pm	neutral
hi guys i picked these up the other day but its taken me this long to get round to posting the reviews so here we go tub comparison with a minfig thanks brainbox the lighting changes a bit throughout the photographs as it was going dark outside so i only really had my desk light and i kept getting in the way 4837 mini trains now the box i really like its no different to those of last years sets but the colour here is simply fantastic and really seems appropriate for the theme so this is what you get inside all the pieces are still inside the bag the optical illusion was accidental d  no pieces of particular outstanding interest but the dark green cheese slopes are rather nice look out for those later 1 2 3 this is the main model and uses all the pieces in the set bar these two which according to the inventory are spares but as with all my other creator sets im cheating and leaving them in this is far and away the best model of the three and evokes the iconic version of a steam train the green looks superb but im not sure whether thats due to the model itself or the actual colour moving on we get to the second model 1 leftovers yes i admit i was using a piece of paper this isnt actually a bad model i dont think its quite as nice as the previous one but its not bad its different from the first model as well which is good too muich of the same can be a bad thing finally we come to the third model leftovers now ill be honest i dont really know what this is its not that good a model compared to the other two thats all i can say really and of course all the pieces fit into the tub overall i have to say i do like this set despite the weak third model the strength of the primary and secondary models make up for any weaknesses in the third and i can imagine the pieces being fully usuable in building other trains while the basic idea of these tubs isnt quite as good as the xpods with regards portability and general niceness they arent bad and for a fairly cheap price 34 as well 4838 mini vehicles this is one of those set boxes that you see because of the ridiculously loud colours sound marketing scheme if you ask me ive managed it again there are pieces outside the bag or are there now these i like y  1 2 i dont know what the clip is for there isnt one on the other side 3 4 5 this is the main model of the set and again all the pieces are used bar these three the spares its quite a nice model although the cars a bit odd still i like the ramps and the colour scheme reminds me just a little of g1 ultra magnus hmm i think that boom arm could do with refixing 1 2 leftovers this is actually quite nice as well its that classic breakdown truck and the boom arm itself is quite nice with quite a bit of movement another solid model 1 leftovers im surprised by the amount of detail here actually not only have tlc included a spare wheel at the back but also what looks like a trailer hitch which all adds to the realism another nice model to round out a nice set and in the tub overall im not sure which of the two i like better when i bought them and on the way home i much preferred the train set but after building this set im not sure this is another good set from the year when tlc seems to be giving us so many there are some good pieces in here too and while theres nothing unique theyre still good so thanks for reading hope it helped someone and if there are any requests ill see what i can do thats requests for pics not songs   edited by whitefang 23 may 2009  0656 pm indexed	positive

cheers for the reviews theyre both nice sets and i think i just may have to buy both or maybe ill get two of the dwarf set the figs in each are really cool as well the dwarf well theyre just cool anyway but the troll with the golden helmet and armour thats just wub	positive
the tower raid has the best price per piece ratio in the whole 2008 line thanks for the review 	positive
thanks metalandi these are 2 great sets im definately looking forward to seeing these in new zealand stores the collapsing floorprisoner freeing mechanism on the tower is wonderful a great touch some slight modifications like some walls will make this perfect and the dwarfs mine defender is a sweet little set with some neat minifigs thanks for the reviews y peace	positive
thanks for these great reviews sweet the dwarfs mine defender looks interesting the figs though are wub the only thing missing is a weapon for the dwarf and some shields the battering ram and tower are awesome 8 the troll king with new torso helmet and body armor is simply amazing i like how the troll is handcuffed d the tower shows nice detail except for the poor brig  i love that gold crystal the battering ram is a thing of beauty 30 for the tower and ram and 10 for the defender are very well priced i still want the battle wheel more though damn exclusives   p	positive
thanks for the review i personally think the siege tower is probably the best one which lego has ever produced	positive
thank you for the nice review pity the tower is not designed better but i still want to buy these 2 sets if only there were 2 dwarves in the dmdefender	neutral
i got myself today 3 dwarfs mine defender and i have to say that sets does suck big time the plastic rubber band doesnt do squat and 3 wheels i really not enough i only built 2 of those and changed the front of it with 4 wheels and no plastic rubber band and i changed the 2x2 dark bley plate its still looks good but the crappy rubber band system is really not well thought off anyhow my orc army is growing  yoda	negative
hello eurobricks my first post yesterday i will buy this two sets im waiting for the packs sorry but my english isnt good	positive
well you didnt say anything wrong yet undead army officer i perfer using the batle wheel to knock down the towers walls not the seige tower	neutral
the rancor on apr 22 2008 0554 am said i perfer using the batle wheel to knock down the towers walls not the seige tower i love all the siege machines the orcs have they are certainly a much bigger threat than the skellies batbrick away	positive
yeah the open towers are kinda funny although they were also typical of for instance 90s pirate sets the trolls vehicles are cool though they look evil i cant wait to start collecting 08 castle setsi didnt buy any castle in 07 i only got one set for xmas so im catching up on the 07 stuff first before its all sold out	neutral
now that this topic has been brought up again i just want to say that the rubber band on my dwarf mine defender actually works	positive
theyre so beautiful 4 more months	positive
green grocer reviewed by dunamis set 10185 2352 pieces 14995 from the lego store glendale ca build time 65 hours holy guacamole almost exactly one year after caf corner was released we get the third installment in the increasingly popular lego exclusive town series combined with the famous 10182 caf corner and its trusty companion 10190 market street this trio makes the foundation for an amazing city block of lego goodness for those new to this series of sets check out my reviews of the two previous sets in this line cafe corner market street i would not necessarily recommend reading too many of my reviews in one setting as you might experience loss of brain cells andor drowsiness you have been warned so how does green grocer stack up to the two previous sets you ask well follow along kind reader and i shall attempt to unravel this question the box the gigantic box is pretty standard and looks amazingly similar to the caf corner box the back of the box shows some of the features of the green grocer as well as a lot of the cool interior that was absent from the previous sets in addition we are shown an image of the three sets together and a small insert image showing how they connect together as if we could not master that difficult maneuver opening the box is a matter of breaking two seals as it seems to be the norm now we have the reusable cereal box type tab system that we saw so often in 2007 sets however upon opening the tabs we are pleasantly surprised to find a cardboard tray have not seen one of those in a while as you can see in the photo we have two 32x16 green base plates three instruction manuals and a bunch of bags that are broken into four groups group 1 has 12 bags and goes with the first manual and builds the first floor group 2 has 9 bags and goes with the second manual to build the second floor group 3 has 14 bags and goes with the third manual for the top floor and roof and one bag that is not numbered and hence you can open it whenever you feel like it there are no stickers  yay moving right along we get to the three instruction manuals the manuals the three manuals are 55 47 and 47 pages in length they are laid out well and are pretty standard with all the usual trimmings  piece call outs for each step  parts inventory at the end of the second manual  page numbers color separation in these manuals was fine for me except dark bley and black we get a nice photo of all three sets together plus we get a nice tip showing how to split up the bags and what goes where those additional pieces you see in the photo just below the numbered bags are the pieces that come from the single unnumbered bag along with the base plates parts list random manual shot the pieces upon opening the first set of bags one thing is clear there are a ton of little tiny pieces the minifigs are included in this first section as well interesting to note that there are a handful of printed pieces and as i mentioned previously no stickers we also get a host of new and exciting pieces to add to our collection keep in mind my scope of lego sets is generally centered around star wars technic creator and the occasional racer set so what is new to me might have been around 15 years at any rate here are some of the more interesting pieces again note the printed tiles this time around lego has decided to include 33 more minifigs than the caf corner and market street sets yes we get four minifigs instead of three here are the cast of characters pictured left to right is sir top hat miss jenny blue overalls patti o furniture and little timmy cub scout ill leave it up to the minifig aficionados to decipher which torsos are new and to tell us all about the hairpieces i can say with reasonable certainty that the four yellow smiley heads are not new somebody check that dont forget the lovable little cat named tom he is the archrival of the mouse jerry that lives downstairs overall there are a lot of pieces large variety and wide range of colors the build if you have either of the two previous sets you will feel right at home here just like in the previous builds it seems like the first ten build steps are consumed with laying a bunch of 1x1 1x2 and 2x2 tiles everywhere almost feels like 30 of the pieces are used up right away see below there are several sections where you build various parts of the interior take a look at the cash registercounter below and the beverage cooler and the produce stand and everything that goes in it looks like someone has mail looks like someone just had a baby this set is incredibly well done and gives inspiration to go back and add similar items to caf corner and market street as before the average builder is introduced to some new building techniques like using the hinge plates to make the angles on the front of the building as shown below also the top of the roof shows some interesting ideas overall it is a really fun build that kept me entertained the whole way the design this is a great set with lots of little details i especially like the little mouse hole in the wall leading to the jerry the mouses area they even included a little slice of cheese it seems the designers cant get away from the usual staircase which i always feel is way too big maybe future designs can incorporate a spiral staircase to save room for other things in the model one welcome addition is the fire escape as seen below im going to show a bunch of examples of various items in the set so you can get the feel of the amazing detail in this design take a look at the lamps torches just outside the door and the streetlight with fire hydrant brickwork and archway awning here is the back side of the building note the trashcans and yard tools here is a closeup of the railings on the second story balcony and the second photo is the finished product with curtains in the window nice use of cups to make the banister on the second floor here is the fireplace on the second floor second floor staircase with toms hiding spot check out the radiator on the third floor more third floor nice grandfather clock and rug third floor check out the deck that is up on the roof complete with two chairs table umbrella flower pots and grill interesting use of minifig hammers on the roof finally here is what is left over when were done a couple of shots of the front a shot of the back and here are all three together overall thoughts this is an incredible set and the best of the three in my opinion it is hard to top caf corner but i believe green grocer just did i absolutely love all the details and building techniques that went into making this set there is a ton of different parts and wide color selection as usual we get a bunch of tiles and small plates but that goes with the series also we get four minifigs and lots of minifig accessories im giving this set a score of 100 i thought about it and i really dont know how they could have made it any better in short run dont walk to go pick this set up final rating 100 build 1010 excellent  lots of nice interiors details and accessories to build functionality 1010 outstanding raises the bar with interior and detail think caf corner on steroids design 1010 excellent  cant say enough good things about it parts 1010 great selection and diverse colors great minifigs price 1010 price ratio is excellent but lots and lots of little parts well worth the price as alway feel free to comment complain and question what you see here id like to hear your feedback on this amazing set	positive
a great reveiw dunamis y  you have only backed up what i thought when the pictures first appeared if you are a lego fan there is no excuse not to buy this set it is a must have i love the mouse hole and the mouse and his cheese wub 	positive

great review great set i cant mine until after easter weeps	positive
this is a nice review thanks for all the great pictures	positive
truly an awesome review thanks dunamis i ordered my two copies one to build one to store in the vault last week cant wait to get this one the attention to detail here is what makes the set great theres nothing to criticize about this set its really the closest thing to perfection that i have seen from tlc the difference between this set and cc is the interior detail and because of that gg now become in my opinion the best set ever released by tlc do the ccggms sets fit well with the 50th anniv town plan my impression is that out of the box at least they dont which is too bad however i dont think it would be hard to mod the town plan so it looks like it belongs in the same town as ccggms these sets to me are what i have always wanted from tlc as an adult i hope they keep up the line and add more elements to this excellent lineup	positive
wow thanks for the nice review i have the other 2 sets and waiting for this to come to our shores stupendous design and details i really like the hammerrails on the roof cant wait wub	positive

thanks for another fun review this set is high on my list of things to buy i love cranes built many and bought many including the classic 8460 from 1995 and the more recent 8421 that threaded axle never stopped intriguing me it was use in so few sets i believe 8851 contained one as well and i still dont know why its better than any other axle congratulations with a near mint copy of this set 	positive
simonwillems on mar 10 2008 0132 pm said that threaded axle never stopped intriguing me it was use in so few sets i believe 8851 contained one as well and i still dont know why its better than any other axle the purpose of the threaded axle is to carry tension regular axles are used primarily for carrying torsion for gears sometimes for compression 8855 landing gear helicopter skids and sometimes just for looks roll cages canopies but used in tension connectors will usually just pop off with the threads and the corresponding nuts this part can be used to squeeze parts together like the pen in the plotter of 8094 or to hold heavy assemblies onto turntables like 8862 and 8851 with the power crane 8854 reviewed here that is the complete list of sets which used this part i wrote about it here httpwwwericalbre1984htmlparts eric	neutral
as i bought it i didnt even know i would also get a box it just said all parts with building instructions after opening the parcel i was like woah woooaaahhh and so on  i love legoboxes because as a child i stood in the toy stores starring at the boxes only seeing the front and the back nothing more this brings back some memories 	positive
blakbird on mar 10 2008 0945 pm said i wrote about it here httpwwwericalbre1984htmlparts eric thanks for that information it opened my eyes as to the function of the threaded axle 	neutral
this was my first pneumatic set	neutral
this was my first technic set aged 7 still a great one in terms of function density and a great bmodel in the uk im certain it was called the salvage hoist	positive
thanks for reviewing all these old sets will you be doing any more	positive
this set is really cool i might actually get it	positive
nice pictures i also sort out the pieces the same way if im rebuilding a model y this set packs a lot of functionality into a fairly small size but was rather expensive for its size 70 when it was still available compared to other sets of that time you can also rig up the technic flag sticker that it comes with to the main model ive done that on mine you may want to reinforce it with tape if youre going to leave the model on display though as it will break up over time due to uv exposure like many stickers do i had to do that with mine after it started to crack although it still looks pretty good	positive
thanks for reviewing this classic set i got it when it first came out and still love it the suspension steering and robust look of the model havent been done that well ever since this set puzzled me though back in the days the rear suspending part containing the differential and some gears was shown different on the box from the instructions in the instructions it showed that the grey part of the suspension in the back had to be made using a 1x2 smooth tile and 4 cornerplates 2x2 in grey the box however showed a much sturdier solution using a 1x8 tile and a 1x8 plate it is also visible on the cover of the instructions the pieces i mean are in this picture bernddasbrot on mar 9 2008 0705 pm said otherwise great set	positive
hmm seems like the wheels are recycled into the harley truck in the 2008 batman set	neutral
natelite on mar 10 2008 0557 pm said hmm seems like the wheels are recycled into the harley truck in the 2008 batman set nope the harleytruckwheels are thinner and somewhat more modern i do believe theyre the same like in 8274 aaaaaaaand for a long time in my life these wheels have been the best and coolest looking ive ever had so wheres your deference d recycled  xd	positive
bernddasbrot on mar 10 2008 0556 pm said youve just motivated me to go on a senselesspreliminarydesignerrorshunt man this set is a disaster what were they thinking d p i just remembered one other fun aspect of this set the crane hook can be attached to the underside of the rear bumper to hold it in position while driving along but when things are like this and you try and wind up the cable the winch is strong enough to break the original provided lego rope it worked with my copy d so this set is capable of demolishing itself but still one of the best technicsets i have with all stickers intact im not so sure about that flag though must check on that	positive
wow that first picture is great you must have a very wide angle lens with the capability to focus very close macro the perspective makes the model look huge nice work i think the suspension on this set is my favorite of all technic it has such large travel and is so what word should i use bouncy hey why do you only review sets which are red d eric	positive
blakbird on mar 10 2008 0935 pm said hey why do you only review sets which are red d i exactly thought that today as i made the pics for my signature xd at my school leaving examination i made a model in blender3d and explained to the board of examiners how to build a car and how to animate it it needed a color so i took red because all beautiful and fast cars are red my physics teacher contradicted 	neutral
bernddasbrot on mar 10 2008 0141 pm said at my school leaving examination i made a model in blender3d and explained to the board of examiners how to build a car and how to animate it it needed a color so i took red because all beautiful and fast cars are red my physics teacher contradicted  did you use ferrari to prove your point any physics teacher would have to admit that a really fast car approaching the speed of light will always look red as it drives away due to red shift xd on the other hand 8880 looks pretty fast and it is black although i have seen pictures of one that someone built in red yellow might be good too some cars even look fast in green eric	neutral
i also happened to receive this set this weekend virtually misb the seals on the side of the box were loose however everything inside was untouched this little beast a joy to build and even more so to play with as indicated by eric on the technicopedia page its crammed with functions for a mediumsized set i think i love it even more than my son does	positive
that price is exceptional its less than what i paid for mine 9 years ago and is even less than the original price of the set note that the stickers in this set are the bad variety that will crack and peel over time if you want to preserve them the technic flag in particular you will need to tape over it	neutral
grepin on mar 24 2010 1237 am said  the only flaw i noticed was weak support of the rear drivetrain which was easily corrected with a few extra plates huh like where dont have that much problems with that rear train at least if i you dont trow the model down the stairs or something like that	neutral
junkstylegio on mar 23 2010 1117 pm said huh like where dont have that much problems with that rear train at least if i you dont trow the model down the stairs or something like that maybe its unusual but this section of the drive train didnt hold that well on my model this is how it looks now the parts made redundant were left in the built model thats why theres that useless 8tooth gear there p	neutral
hello my dear friends heres something new i am actually making a review with pictures yes i got a new camera for christmas now i was testing to see how the camera would reflect so some of the pics are a bit blurry i have based this review from dunamiss reviews he is my inspirationso without further ado i bring you the review set  7693 name etx alien strike price 1999 1299 pieces 246 box okay so as you can see below the box is pretty simple as always european versions wont have the piece count name etc just the number i believe mine having the american version has the info on it as you can see it has the classic mm logo and the red planet as well as the set in a pose itself very nice i linked it because the pic wasnt resizing httpwwwbrickshelkedscn0017jpg below is the back of the box it shows the other sets and some features of this set contents next we have the contents this set includes a medium sized dss xwingyoda a bag labeled one and huge bag labeled two the 1 bag contains a smaller bag and the two bag includes two smaller bags 5 bags in all also pictured are the instructions i have linked it due to the nonresize httpwwwbrickshelkedscn0019jpg figs included in this set are three figs two jellies and 1 astro the jeelies are fine but i pefer the lom ones but they glow those new alien commanders for summer look promising though the astro is nice and includes an extra gold visor moc on astro miner in all mm sets there is a human and alien set the astro par of this set is a miniminer here is a pic of construction and that wonderful space logo sticker not much of a cockpit  finished minerthe set number too overall i like the miner and it is nicely designed i feel the cockpit is lacking though aliens the alien vehical is the main part of the set this pic shows the beginning steps solid and sturdy but those four axlespin partsblue are pointless no support and they dont get used at all nice tlc  now we get cooking this pic shows the tail added on and the more bulk being built we get a little repetitive and build the craft up in this pic and this pic from the instructions shows how the alien craft transforms for battle the completed set and extra bits parts 810 figs 810 price per piece ration 910 playability 910 overall 85 the alien craft is great the attack feature is nice and there are a ton of trans green parts the alien falls out of the cockpit when turned upside down i love this set and its perfect for mm fans or beginnersit has nice parts and read the above part for more details gallery when moderated keep an eye out for future reviews please comment 	positive
my friend has this set and the alien ships wings are wobbly and overall x he may have built it wrong im not sure i didnt see the build anyways nice review y	negative
sweet first pic review y i got this set for a birthday present last year and it is pretty fun overall the alien ship in this set is actually one of my favorites it just looks cool and the way you can fold it out is really clever the only negative for me is the cockpit of the mining unit not really because it isnt detailed but because mine is top heavy and keeps falling forward its kinda funny if you think about him driving along and then falling forwardbut not funny at all when youre playing 	positive

thank you for your nice review vbbn y but it only confirms this theme is not my cup of tea weird aliens strange colors parts stuck together with no idea  i always hated this big wheels  its even worse in orange x saving money for different sets on and that doesnt mean it was a bad review  	neutral

great set great review although the set looks better in yellow d	positive
bernddasbrot on mar 21 2008 0707 am said hi this is my forth oldschool technic set review since blakbird pointed out that all my technic reviews are red i chose a yellow dune blaster for today this is my second 8829 and i also noticed that the engine turns very hard the alternate model is really sorry to all those of you who like it crappy i mean a nice idea but not with this wheels  anyway a really beautiful technicset reminiscing this word exists does it thanks for viewing the pictures i hope you enjoyed it please comment if you want to a great set review as always nice try making a review of a set that was not red it almost worked maybe next time sweet one thing i noticed is that a bunch of your pictures are missing the beam that goes over the left hand wheel as a fender like this picture what kind of camera do you use the pictures have very good depth of field meaning that both the foreground and the background are in good focus this is usually hard to do without a very small aperture yes reminiscing is a word it means to fondly remember the past i also noticed that the engine was sticky set 8408 has the same problem it took me forever to figure out what the problem was if you take the engine out of the model it turns nice and smooth then when you put it back in it works terrible it turns out the key is that in the back there is an 8 tooth spur gear and a 24 tooth crown gear used as a spur if you look at technica you will see that there are two different crown gears one of them works well mated with an 8 tooth on parallel axles and the other one doesnt the difference is only supposed to be longer teeth so it really should not matter but it does if your set works bad try switching the crown gear to one of the other variety worked for me eric	positive
blakbird on mar 22 2008 0949 pm said one thing i noticed is that a bunch of your pictures are missing the beam that goes over the left hand wheel as a fender oh no i forgot to put it back i wanted to make a photo with this beam alone 8 blakbird said what kind of camera do you use the pictures have very good depth of field meaning that both the foreground and the background are in good focus this is usually hard to do without a very small aperture the camera belongs to my dad its a panasonic lumix dmcfz30eg blakbird said one of them works well mated with an 8 tooth on parallel axles and the other one doesnt the difference is only supposed to be longer teeth so it really should not matter but it does if your set works bad try switching the crown gear to one of the other variety worked for me wow youre right never thought of that thanks i made a scan  of those two gears you can notice the longer teeth first pic edited by bernddasbrot 23 march 2008  0303 pm	neutral
hello all apologize for digging out a such old post recently i got a bag of lego technic parts where there have been mixed three sets 8858 8829 and 8235 the resurrection of 8858 has been described by me in a separate post going back to the dune buggy – when i saw it for the first time back in 1994 i did not like it as i was always big fan of 8840 which i consider to the day the best looking buggy and set 8829 looked to me ugly so there were those all parts in the bag… then i though why not build it  and i started to do it when i finished i was very surprised how the final look of this set is really taking my words back unfortunately in the bag there were missing some parts and i could not rebuild the back spoiler so i made some changes to it and make it from spare parts that i have and it came out acceptable i also added some additional parts such as “fake” steering wheel “rally” logo antennas i have also reverse mounting of the rear tires – why lego did them like that i never know – as i think they look better this way set well the review has been already made by owner of this post so i will only add few things into it engine – v2 aired cooled is driven by 4 gears  from the single wheel no differential as in 8840 using two old school z14 tooth bevel  then by z24 tooth crown and z8 tooth type 1 actually the as in most old sets the pistons are moving very fast not as in current sets and smooths – i needed to extra clean all engine parts as there was a lot friction suspension – set has “engine bay” working using two old gray shock absorbers 65l – the movement is not big but works very nice better then in 8840 in my opinion steering – this is a bit odd as there is no direct connection to hog as in most old sets but first the gear rack is moved by z8 then two z14 tooth where reverse movement is taking place later connection of two old school z14 tooth bevel goes to hog details – this is the most that i like in this set specially how the use of axle pin connector perpendicular and 1x10 bricks with 3x3 cut corners and plate 1x5 toothed ends 2 studs with center axle hole are making the body shape – is just wonder tires – the balloon rear are pretty nice the front is a new version of those that were in 8840 what i do not like 1 missing of technic figure 8840 had it 2 no steering wheel in the original set 3 no differential – but having in mind that lego has introduce 2412 teeth would be difficult to build the transmission in such small space where the engine is i will shortly upload new pictures and post them here later on  over all – i think it is worth buying it as it is very payable  actually very payable and runs smoothly  the steering suspension – perfect thank you and regards	positive
pictures of my restored set 8829 i was almost 96 complete and for missing parts i add of my own the seat is black and not blue as one was missing in my 8858 the spoiler is different steering wheel added not connected to wheels and some additional items to make it look better this is how i change the tire orientation the new rear spoiler i still need to clean front rims edited by aow 26 november 2015  1232 pm	neutral
wow this buggy was my very first lego set i like this review  it remembered my childhood i also liked its body with those 8 studs long bricks on sides i can also remember trying to build engine in such way that it works smooth without success anyway i think its studless version  set 8048 is much better	positive

thanks for resizing the pics it is strange that you didnt know about that zpiece before it was well used in old space sets the cars are pretty nice but i think the people sit way too high in them  the windscreen gives almost no protection i am planning on modifying them to 7 studs wide since thats my current standard for this kind of race cars seriously looking forward to the next review	neutral
as i said elsewhere i couldnt see this reviewed anywhere so here you are to start with a couple of box shots the contents and the parts laid out the instructions this is what was left over from the build and heres the kit complete build time about ten seconds if you pick your nose whilst you are doing it d i love the little robot it reminds me of that weird machine in the first wallace and gromit adventure in fact give it some skis and you are away oh and it has a metal detector thingy which i might have to borrow for a future episode of grunts im not sure if i have any alreadywho knows cost  £249 value for money erm no knock a quid off and id say yes dr s	positive
doctor sinister on mar 22 2008 0956 pm said and heres the kit complete build time about ten seconds if you pick your nose whilst you are doing it d dr s and i thought the visors were really supposed to be gold  thanks doc that was quick this looks like a very nice simple set ill probaly get one of these except it comes with one of those hideous faces  thats right im talking to you micvash and phred  sweet	positive

nice review the set doesnt seem as good as the crystal hawk and there colouring mistake with gun is just well bad and not the kind of thing i expect tlc to do something that stupid edited by pencoin 03 june 2008  0451 pm	positive
legobear on mar 23 2008 0905 pm said big or small we all love our legos and for that i thank you for the review i would have had liked to see your opinions though about the price the playability or anything else youd care to share about it and perhaps how it fits with your collection ive always been hesitant about getting this set because to me i feel like i have it all already but im missing that dog radar gun and 50 mph sign  its too pricey and the playability only really kicks in with other sets  theres already a speed gun with the recent police car release so this seems a little redundant but it goes well of course with the very large tabletown pd maybe worth it if you want dogs dr s	negative
when i went to blue water they have dogs in the pick a brick wall so i have plenty  yes i think i have everything here thats why i havent baught this the fireman or the construction worker they need to bring out something unique	negative
a very neat and useful little set thank you for the nice review sweet	positive
hi this is my forth preoldschool review as promised a yellowset  my 8862 arrived today survived the washing machine coaster and actually was real fun to build 1 information this set contains 664 parts only i thought i’d be far more and was released in 1989 in the technic theme be sure to visit technopediaif you want to know more 2 building instructions wow these instructions are used im not used to this after all this sets with unread instruction booklets the pneumatics page the last step for the alternate model 3 the parts wow look at all those technic beams gears pins a few parts are missing in this photo 3 building the left worm gear is for the outriggers the right one for turning the “rear boom” the three 12l axles left one outriggers middle one steering right one erm… rearboomrotation the two worm gears in the front part left one lifting the bucket right one dumping the bucket the turningmechanism for the “rearboom” is finished once again a toothed 10l axle the boat weight 2x6x2 is hidden underneath the radiator grill okay… many hoses and a nice comfy seat have been added now you can recognize the backhoes real shape only with a little violence it’s possible to lift the bonnet  through the pneumatic pump yeah outriggers same technique that the 8854 uses the finished “boom  jib  scoop thing” bjst  xd the finished loader bucket and to end the building process the same picture from the introduction offtopic “it is all part of the miracle of nature  the circle of life” 4 functionality this time i tried something new i hope you can spot something  if not technopedia okay here we go 5 random shots i’ve got way too many pictures this time so i refer to my brickshelf folder until it’s moderated you can follow the multilingual links eins deux three quattro fem zes sédem osiem 6 final thoughts definitely worth buying as a child i thought it looks hideous  but today i’ve found out it’s totally fun to build and freaking functional three things i want to mention though the bjst can only be slewed a new word if the outriggers are deployed it is also possible that the bjst will reach the ground danger of grinding or sticking even if the outriggers are deployed the two mechanisms for the loader bucket can actually interlock and the 14 tooth gears might break  disentangle from the axle thanks for viewing the pictures i hope you enjoyed it please comment if you want to	neutral
another nice review the slow shutter speed pictures are great i think that was the only set with 8 distinct functions for a very long time and was only displaced by the 8455 backhoe in that respect the turntable on the back doesnt turn very well though as the weight is all distributed on one side the screw axle prevents it from popping off but there is still a lot of friction in it i dont have mine built anymore but it might be worth trying to put a weight brick or something on it quote do you have 8455 as well id love to see how they compare side by side it looks bigger than 8455 but i dont own any of the big old chuncky tires so i find it so hard to tell yeah its quite a bit bigger when everything is fully extended it becomes something like 26 long although the 8455 actually has morebetter functionality edited by cp5670 24 march 2008  0815 am	positive
thanks for your feedback i like both but i would say 8455 is far more than just a studless version with 10 pneumatic cylinders and 2 pneumatic pumps its a wonderful set for every pneumatic freak unfortunately i dont own the 8455  yet  sinner said i hope you have more planned any chance of a supercar one i foreshadowed a black review a few days ago guess which one xo xd	positive
a great review for a great set it even had the old technic tpieces and bevels which i actually prefer to their modern counterparts cp5670 on mar 24 2008 0814 am said the turntable on the back doesnt turn very well though as the weight is all distributed on one side the screw axle prevents it from popping off but there is still a lot of friction in it i got mine for £20 in a second hand shop it said complete but one of the screw knuts was missing xo so its practically impossible to keep the back arm on with only one  and theyre rather rare on bl too 	positive
yeah i meant theyre rare  but i can imagine that a normal axle with the old half bushes will help sometimes these are really strong if you put 23 in a row edit i just tried it a normal 10l axle with 2 interlocking old half bushes type 1 on each end i chose those who only can be moved very hardly along an axle i slewed the bjst  back arm a few times tried the pneumatics parallel to it and it didnt loose edited by bernddasbrot 24 march 2008  0606 pm	neutral
thanks sweet	positive
quote there are 324 axle nuts on bricklink with an avg price of 089 i didnt know of this accessoryset 51102 you can buy it for 4000 8 i was thinking of getting one of those off bl several years ago back when the price used to be more like 15 or so but i realized that i hardly ever use the couple that i already have p they came out with the modern turntable the year after this set which mostly negated the need for these screw axles i think their only use now is to hold nonlego objects onto models like the technic pen in 8094 i guess you can try to make linear actuators out of them but theyre often too rare and fragile for that	neutral
wow thanks for putting up this thread that reminded me that i own that one too sweet and i loved it as a kid	positive
by the way dont forget to build the alternate model of 8862 it is a combine farm equipment which is just as good as 8274 i liked it so much that i bought two copies of this set so i could display both my favorite alternate model not counting universal sets is the 8480 submarine maybe it is time for a white set review skull white is pretty rare for your blue set i recommend you review 8462 there are only a couple of green sets and 8479 is the best and then of course 8458 is silver i think we all know what the best black set is and according to your photography you have lots of them but dont forget 8868 eric	positive
bernddasbrot on mar 24 2008 0539 pm said could you explain your thoughts please you know my english skills  i was thinking you could somehow attach a 16tooth dark gray gear the one that spins freely around axles to the nut which would make the axle move in and out when the gear turned and convert the gears rotary motion to linear motion in a fairly compact package although there are other ways of doing the same thing that dont use such rare parts and the 2008 technic sets will come with prebuilt linear actuators anyway	neutral
quote how long of a shutter speed did you use 15 seconds quote by the way dont forget to build the alternate model of 8862 i will review it too and post it in this topic quote slewed i think thats a word how about slewn or slain or slewifacated i think rotated is best actually i took it from your site xd quote white is pretty rare unfortunately i dont own 8480 but i think 8824 is also a very good though small white set 8462 rocks as a blue set i just got it a few weeks ago lets see 8462 also is one of the last technic sets i would call oldschool 8479 okay too but 8458 is imho not 8868 and the totally mysteriously black set will follow quote i was thinking you could somehow attach a 16tooth dark gray gear the one that spins freely around axles to the nut which would make the axle move in and out when the gear turned and convert the gears rotary motion to linear motion in a fairly compact package did you had something like this in mind if the toothed 10l axle rotates the axle nuts want to rotate too but they cant because of that 2x4 technic plate so theyll decide to move along the axle the 1x6 bricks on each end make sure that the axle wont move in or out thanks for your feedback	neutral
bernddasbrot on mar 25 2008 0346 am said 15 seconds wow thats a long exposure i would think you would get way too much light and overexpose the image the aperture must have been tiny quote i will review it too and post it in this topic cool i am also planning to write about the combine on technicopedia combine quote actually i took it from your site xd i thought that word sounded familiar quote unfortunately i dont own 8480 but i think 8824 is also a very good though small white set 8462 rocks as a blue set i just got it a few weeks ago lets see 8462 also is one of the last technic sets i would call oldschool 8479 okay too but 8458 is imho not 8868 and the totally mysteriously black set will follow you dont own 8480 that is unacceptable it is imperative that you put a mortgage on your house immediately to get it sweet yes 8824 is a good white set i also see from your room photos that you have the 8839 supply ship which has lots of white this is a really nice set 8462 is hard to call old school but at least it uses regular beams the air tanks are the best part of the set i wish lego had used them more often especially on the highly pneumatic sets the tank makes all the difference on 8459 you are right 8458 is certainly not old school but it is a great set with wonderful suspension it is of the same era as the super street sensation with all of the panels for body contouring 8868 is technic at its best there is nothing else like it especially with the compressor quote did you had something like this in mind if the toothed 10l axle rotates the axle nuts want to rotate too but they cant because of that 2x4 technic plate so theyll decide to move along the axle the 1x6 bricks on each end make sure that the axle wont move in or out thanks for your feedback while the assembly you have drawn would work as a linear actuator i would not recommend it the torsional stiffness and strength of an axle are proportional to the polar moment of inertia a section property most of the stiffness comes from the outside of the cross shaped axle but in the threaded axle you lose all the stiffness of the outer area because it is not continuous this means you only get stiffness and strength from the small core i think the threaded axle would bend and break very easily if subjected to much torque eric	neutral
quote 8462 rocks as a blue set i just got it a few weeks ago lets see 8462 also is one of the last technic sets i would call oldschool 8479 okay too but 8458 is imho not yeah the tow truck was the last set that still used mainly studded beams they made many changes to technic the following year with models becoming predominantly studless and making heavy use of the flexible axleshoses and decorative panels the technic logo and box art style was also changed a lot i really like the overall construction of that set the model is fairly lightweight but extremely sturdy it must be one of the strongest large sets theyve released quote did you had something like this in mind thats basically the idea as blakbird said though it wouldnt be very powerful and would put the axle under some stress the linear actuators theyre bringing out this year do the same thing and should work much better	positive
blakbird on mar 25 2008 0642 pm said wow thats a long exposure i would think you would get way too much light and overexpose the image the aperture must have been tiny for the aperture i dont know what ive used but my room was already very darkend as i tool the photos it was actually serendipity  blakbird said cool i am also planning to write about the combine on technicopedia i will but ill need some time i really shoud do a few things for university thats also the reason why i succeded in so many other things   blakbird said you dont own 8480 that is unacceptable it is imperative that you put a mortgage on your house immediately to get it not again sing just kidding my parents will xd  blakbird said while the assembly you have drawn would work as a linear actuator i would not recommend it the torsional stiffness and strength of an axle are proportional to the polar moment of inertia a section property most of the stiffness comes from the outside of the cross shaped axle but in the threaded axle you lose all the stiffness of the outer area because it is not continuous this means you only get stiffness and strength from the small core i think the threaded axle would bend and break very easily if subjected to much torque the toothed 10l axle doesnt look very robust youre right on brickshelf i once saw another version using a worm gear and a halfbush being moved along another axle edited by bernddasbrot 28 march 2008  0512 pm	neutral

this is a review of speed racer set 8159 raxer x vs taejo this is my second review and the first review of this paticular set and the only one on eurobricks at the moment xd so without further ado i present to you my review i like that saying so much i decided to use it again in this review its originally from my review of 8158 which can be seen here note sorry that this review got delayed but there was a hostile takeover of the computer xo dont worry everythings fine now xd set 8159 racer x vs taejo theme speed racer price 1999us pieces 237 minifigs 2 note 2 i did not take photos of just the new pieces this time because theyre the same new pieces as in 8158 just in diff colors if you want to see a picture of them click here first off pictures of the box instructions dss and minifigs not quite as many stickers as set 8158 but there still are quite a few can you guess which ones which d yes taejos hair really is red and black for racer xs head tlg just reused the baddies head from 7620  now onto the build first racer xs x racer d thats not its official name i think  back end of the car the cockpit and yeah there are no seats for racer xs hiny just a flat 2x2 dark bley plate the cockpit and rearend of the car connect using an sshaped connector piece the front part of the car the fornt and the cockpit are also connected using an sshaped connector piece adding some details including yellow fenders the underside of the car so far adding some more detail newly added motor vents and smooth details adding a front bumper amongst other things side view of the car so far no backseat driving wait a minute theres no backseat the underside with newly added axles demonstrating how hubcap piece is put on the car now onto taejos grr glorious red racer p front part of the car cockpit regular seats check cocpit and rearend of the car connected using sshaped connector piece adding some detail the front part of the car front and cockpit connected also using the sshaped connector piece adding some fenders to the car underside of the car so far adding some smooth details taejos is the only car with an actual hood side view of the car so far underside of the car with axels now some finished shots of both cars first racer xs fine black and yellow racer reminds me of an older ferrari from this angle up close and personal im guessing the 3 holes are exhaust outlets racer x rollin now its time for taejos red racer i couldve sworn i ordered some hubcaps guess who taejo racer x admiring taejos fine red automobile up close with big red rearend shot of the car i challenge you racer x taejo racer x bein a complete badass and smokin taejo  now for some comparison shots the silver pocket knife is just to hold up taejos car now a shot of the extra pieces now if you combine 8158 with 8159 you get this go go go now its time for the summary this set is an excellent buy at 20 dollars its well designed and has lots of details it also has very unique minifigs which are always good in a set its only downfalls are the lack of acessories for the minifigs and that there are no cool contraptions on the cars and by cool i mean lethal to the other racers now to the scoring of the set price1010 pieces 810 too many stickers for such a small set minifigs 1010 unique and creative playability 910 would have been perfect except for the lack of acessories and cool contraptions on the cars but both are easily modifiedfixed hence the nine overall 3740 a great set bonus try and count how many times my silver pocket knife appears and win the knowledge of knowing how many times the silver pocket knife appears p d this concludes the review more pictures of either set 8158 or 8159 or both available through request via pming me  see ya next time folks of course i dont mean that literally xd  general tarful edited by imperialshadows 01 june 2008  1205 pm	positive

generaltarful on mar 25 2008 0143 pm said nope p and thanks hollisbrick they are both really similar so it really depends on which colors you use more in mocing or which characters you like more my personal choice is 8159 as it has cooler minifigs except for racer xs recycled head  and the colors are more useful to me then again if youre like batbrick the only thing that matters is if a set has orange in it p regards general tarful thanks y probably will get this set although the orangeoh the orange peices 8 haha anyway once again thanks for the reveiw and meditate on the decision i will yoda xd	neutral
nice it is probably the only speed racers set i will buy  and i will buy multiples those cars look awesome	positive
thanks for the review and for giving me directions p i think the design of these two cars looks to be better than in the other set the drivers are positioned lower compared to the windscreen and the design of the front on th red car is really nice im missing details of motors and cars this big could use a working steering mechanism	neutral
speaking of pocket knives i just got speed racer and snake oiler at kmart and might mod the helmet so it actually looks like the cartoon the problem is  i dont want to shell out two bucks for a clear visor  by the way i know transclear visors are nonproduction but where did they come from a pickabrick if so what store well at least if i do go through getting the elusive clear visor its not as bad as the insane 25 red vader helmet this set is great i would have gotten this along with the one i purchased but i didnt have enough dough with me to get both	positive
crap now i want these sets great review	positive
thanks for this review its a nice set with some cool pieces and nice techniques i like the way the roof pieces are used to make the spiders back for instance lasse d on mar 26 2008 0948 pm said alternate models 3 it is hard to come up with alternate models with so many small pieces and plates that are only 1 stud wide the colors might make you want to build a spyrius space ship ouch thats not a good thing lets refrain from that 	positive
a fine review of a fine set thanks lasse d y	positive

thank you for review very good army builder i see	positive
excellent review y getting a better chance to look at this set actually makes me interested in it i was in my dark ages throughout the islander days though i have built up a small force of them 10 from ebay buys but no actual sets if this is really as reasonable as you say there i may just have to pick one up soon oddly i do own the baseplates to this set having also picked them up in a lot on ebay so i might be able to recreate it manually but i think id rather pick one up whole it looks like a great mix of parts and makes a decent looking display piece thanks again for the fine review y	positive
thanks for a lovely review i only recently bought this set off ebay pretty good deal misb for 30 euros and i enjoyed putting it together and mixing it with the other piratesets when you put two sets of two baseplates together youll get a large pond with an island in the center just to achieve that i bought two more baseplates off ebay the result is this moc i always loved the islanders and have most of the sets not all of them but that is going to change in the future y	positive
excellent review i really like this set and so i gave it a 55 this set is on my list to get i especially like the speedy pirate boat and the also very fast outrigger canoe with a sail i dont think a small number of these cannibals will make much of an impact on gaming though even if they get a bonus with spears duke	positive
nice review  although im pretty sure eldorado fortress has 8 minifigs making this set no 4 in the minifig count i gave it a 5 the number of islanders and vegetation pieces comes in very handy for land based scenarios ive got 3 copies of this set 1 of them costing me less than 2euros from an ebay auction in scotland along with forbidden island its easily one of the most common and affordable pirate sets to be found on he second hand market	positive
a great and informative review with very fine pictures thanks slyowl sweet a wonderful set this is indeed full of nice details and pretty playable and a cool subtheme that offers a lot of fantasy and charming characters in a marvelous layout i really love that little boat with the outrigger and the neat buildings and sweet landscaping works together very well tlc got sued for using some names of native sounding origin now that sounds really strange to me such names´re widely spread within novels movies and such stuff i didn´t know that there´s some kind of copyright on them 8	positive
good review mr slyowl and good pics too i know it probably deserves better but i only give him a 3 ill be surely the only saying that i dont like this set but i remember i had it for christmas when i was a child and it disappointed me very much because i expected it much larger after seeing it in the lego catalogs well its just a little trauma i had p lol anyway i must admit its an interesant set specially because of the large number of minifigures and accesories it brings with and the two little ships edited by bluebard 31 march 2008  0113 am	positive
excellent review of an outstanding set i love the main image i want this set so bad	positive
yay pictures thank you for the review you made me actually consider looking it up on ebay but i already have so so many things to get on my want list drat my easy ability to get sold on something lego	positive
its a great set and one i have yet to add to my collection despite my large number of islander extras enchanted island aside from having so alluring a name was good value for money in that you only needed this one set and you had a good representation of the islanders both in the size of the set and the number of minifigs the flipping rope bridge and the river give it a great rainforest retreat sort of feeling and one is inclined to think of this set as more inland than directly coastal for me whilst the islanders were never seen in the same light or popularity as pirates and imperials they were an obvious and colourful addition that to me added a whole new depth to the pirate system and one was now able to play a 3 or 4 way war adding a greater political element to the sets enchanted island is probably the 3rd most appealing of the large land bases for me after port royal and eldorado fortress good review and glad to see the set recognised	positive
for some reason i never considered buying this set but your review changed that ill try to get it on ebay thanks for your efforts to make this wonderful review for us its now added to our index	positive
wow that is one great review you made sly i gave it a four only thing i dont like is the raised baseplate it does get you a lot of figs two ships and some nice assecories great set	positive

everytime i saw this at a toy store i always cried to my parents for one but never got it i got the smaller islander sets but the more i see this now i dont want it i could buy it but naahh i am hoping lego does an updated version of the islanders with this new pirates line one can hope right xd	neutral
hello eldiano although the review is fine and you have memories related to that set please have in mind that the post you were replying to was in fact some 7 years old this is what we call bumping of old topics and it shouldnt be done you might want to take a look at our faq posting tips and etiquette edited by phred 06 april 2015  0347 am by phred read next post please	neutral
eldiano thank you for posting about your desire to have this set i do own the set and i do recommend it to others if they somehow find a used one the bricks are kind of sparse but the the bricks it does come with are really nice i love the figs and the base plates are by far my favorite made by tlg captain braunsfeld i suggest that you read through the link that covers topic bumping more clearly i apologize for the confusion eldiano i do believe that i have found a way to remove the confusion of posting in old topics soon among the pirate staff and to the other members of eb please stay tuned sinner on 18 july 2010  0316 am said 3 lego reviews dont date thus if you have something relevant to say then feel free to post in a topic but if its more than a few months old please make sure its good and if its been a few years it better be really good for example if you liked the review or set and want to say so you probably shouldnt if youve got an answer to a question such as does anyone have pictures of the alternate model then by all means post what you shouldnt do is ask questions to the original poster heshe may not even visit eb any more	positive
fortunately i got this set on 2000 not the released version the original one and i said fortunately because its a lovely set how could i rate it but awesome a little islander army the islander girl ironhook and that cool boat with two sails the jailpolynesian statue i must recognize that i have a thing with the islanders i know that they are weird poorly based on the polynesian aborigens etc but they are very original broke with the traditional enemies and gave to the pirates theme an exotic and wild look	positive
here is a preview of my review of speed racer grand prix race i will try to get a full review up later today pics when public sorry about the blur i am not a great photographer also if there are any pictures you would like that i havent included just ask	neutral
judging from your pictures there seems to be many interesting torsos and new fleshy heads but i dont think this set is for me fueling my dismissal of this set is that i saw the trailer for this film at the cinema today and it looked pretty terrible x thanks for taking your time to review this set though ricecracker  edited by casewindu 29 march 2008  1018 pm	negative

i will most likely get all the speed racer sets as it was one of my favorite moviesthe animated one i just loved the decked up and tricked out cars  great review and red tux  xd	positive
looks like a great ole set to me the cars seem abit overly slopey to me though ill probably pass on this but as a note i especially like the black and yellow cars horizontal wheel covering things nice 	positive
again no problem personally i would have liked a lower price 9604 cad with tax n  also my favourite would be the gray and black car	positive
thank you for the pics y i want a trixie impulse set wub and otherwise that little boy with his monkey i like the print on his t shirt	positive
sorry to bump such an old thread but i´ve just discovered this set is on sale at amazonde  for a mere 25 euros i am tempted not because i like the set or the models but because of the parts as most of you might know i´m especially into exoforce so would you recommend to get this set just for the parts are they a good choice to combine with efsets would anyone of you be interested in obtaining the fleshieparts of the minifigs from me as i totally don´t need those	neutral
i picked up this set a few weeks ago along with the smaller sets that come with the mach 5 and racer xs car and i was pleasantly surprised the commentators stand is nothing to write home about but the assortment of figs is great numerous new face prints in flesh i believe and in spite of the large amount of stickers the three cars are each unique and very welldesigned my only gripe about them is that cannonball taylors car the black and yellow one was a missed opportunity as in the movie its yellow and purple i know tlc is dropping purple for the future and had a bunch of problems with it in the past but it would have made for a great looking car imo	positive
well thanks for your posting but i couldn´t care less about fleshie minifigs or movieaccurate cars  or the cars at all this set would really only go into my parts bin therefore i need to know what parts are in there and if they are cool enough to go into an exoforce collectors parts bin	neutral

hi ive promised a lot lately ill review 8868 8880 space police ii blacktron ii and i will its just the time that is blocking me and my university and the fact that i just picked up 8460 in original box for only eur 3650 sweet the other reviews will follow  please bear with me and this set review is also a gift to this nice fellow who gave me the title thats what im talking about 1 useless information with high numbers this set contains 841 parts and was released in 1995 in the technic  tech build  advanced sub theme the bricklink price guide displays for “used” a qty avg price of 12585 and for “new” a qty avg price of 21282 i got it for 5698 still can’t believe it  this set was rereleased two times 8431 in 2002 and 8438 in 2003 2 the box front back open the box is higher than other technic boxes why i don’t know 8460 doesn’t have any real large parts whatever inlay i wonder why tlg doesn’t make inlays anymore… they’re noisy and brake easily but are great for pre sorting 3 building instructions i will quote myself from the 8862 review quote wow these instructions are used im not used to this after all this sets with unread instruction booklets triplewow ‘nuff said this is the “first” page fortunately peeron offers scans the last step for the alternate model and a few nice photos showing how the pneumatic pump will be erm pumped yeah random page i forgot the overall thoughts to the instructions these are technic instructions as we’re used to them part count easy to understand okay the string part at the end was too much for me and the color distinction is okay too 100 pages long and if i can trust my eyes the pneumatics page can be fold out i don’t have this page but i assume it 4 the parts 5 building an easy and fun build okay this could take some time my longest building review up to date the front steering the rear steering the axle pin between the rear steering is for the axle which rotates the crane the two worm screws in the front are for the outriggers they’re not linked one for each side the small wheel in the back is for the rotation adjusting front and rear steering outriggers are finished you can notice a 8 tooth gear that will rotate the technic turntable a steering wheel has been added could be the same stickers like the alternate 8880 used to have the steering can be operated with both actinic lights  no we’re far from finished i’ve got a lot of parts left at this point wow a 4x4 corner plate pneumatics and a winch if you can’t recognize it on the photo the technic beams are the erm wrongother side up the 1x6 technic beams on the left side are normal the axle that will extend the crane 7 gear racks 1x4 the 1x6 technic plate will keep the two pneumatic cylinders straight sad 8 huh did you blink you missed a special part the whole rotatable thing will be attached to the technic turntable using two long technic pins the pin on the right side should be in the middle of the three “turntable holes” on the right side it’s the first hole asymmetric why because we’ll add a cute cab 6 functionality you can find the features in comparison to other technic cranes here technopedia of course i made one sentence out of it please don’t find any mistakes p “two axle rack and pinion steering pneumatic luffing and gear driven telescoping via crank for the boom which can slew 360° on turntable driven via gear crank driven hoist and gear driven outriggers at four corners which snap over center” 7 random shots comparison to 8854 uuuh… once again a depth of field i tried to make it look authoritarian like 8858 but i failed somehow 8460 looks cute 8 comparison to 8421 mobile crane  crane truck i feel that a question concerning this will be asked so i deal with it right now first of all i don’t own 8421 yet i know a technic freak really should own it anyway 8421 has more than twice as much parts as 8460 is motorized features a v6engine and a very neat mechanism to extend the craneboom twice using a braided string with end studs try to find out how of course 8421 features far more than 8460 imho 8421 should have been a copy of 8460 a set so successful that it has been rereleased two times but the designers overshoot the mark 8421 is a breathtaking monster compared to it 8460 looks cute  not pale 9 final thoughts i got it on ebay in kind of good condition for about 50 dollars i know that it has been worth the money in any point of view wub i didn’t use the word “oldschool” for now i’ll change that 8460 belongs to the favored few of oldschool technic sets thanks for reading and viewing the pictures i hope you enjoyed it please comment if you want to	positive
ah thanks sommuch again for that great review y sweet man i am so happy they made this set the new one seems too boring 	positive
somehow i competely missed your review when you first made it i saw your pics on brickshelf and wondered about the review you have managed to review my all time favourite technic set it was the first large technic set i was given by my parents when it first came out in 1995 i played for hours with this set making minifig seats in it it was so huge there was room for four minifigs to sit next to eachother in front i made various applications for it a bungeejump system with a large rubber band and lots of containers to be lifted the first changes i made included the inverting of the wheels and the disabling of one of the flashlightsteering wheels because they obstructed eachother by the way the nob for your winch is yellow instead of black i know this set by heart so watch out p  i always liked those nobs i do own the 8421 and i can tell you this 8460 is much much stronger it can carry more weight because the boom is lighter then the 8421 they are powered by the same two pistons you know when you made it right when the crane is in upright position fully extended and you release the brake from the winch does the hook lower without having to pull it if it does you succeeded in constructing the set right the alternate model was great fun too the pump is cleverly hidden and the crane folds up great between the cab and the loading platform you could easily mod it with a pneumatic claw on the crane a motor to turn it and a compressor the only flaw was the loading platform which had no floor only some axles thanks so much for reviving my memorie concerning this great set y	positive
a great review thank you i do not know these old sets like this one but it is very cool to see how they were made i have an unopened 8421 maybe i should do a small review of that when i get to build it btw boxes are expensive so at a given price point its a choise between more bricks or nicer boxes i have no doubt what most people would chose front edited by front 06 april 2008  1021 pm	positive

thanks for the review sweet for its size and parts count this is a remarkably featured set i dont think ive never seen the alternate model before personally i prefer 8421 because i think it looks much better and i love the six wheel steering i also love the three segment boom and the transmission they fit it all in so neatly i realise that it has trouble even holding up itself but ultimately it doesnt matter as its not like you are really going to construction work with it what bothers me more about 8421 is the design change in the boom from chainlinks to strings i would try to mod mine but all i have is the prototype picture to base it on and i dont have enough links anyway p bernddasbrot on apr 7 2008 0729 am said yeah somehow i wonderd why only vbbn thanks responded indeed i have been very busy the last few months and i kept meaning to reply at last i managed to find the time to reply today bernddasbrot on apr 7 2008 0729 am said another reason for the 8460 as favorite set its got a real alternate model not just a different erm crane yes that really sucks somebody i havent got the time to look  on brickshelf has made a quite good alternate lego have been a bit inconsistant with alternate models lately the recent tow truck had a good one i even made both	positive
thanks guys  sinner i hope you refered to 8285 so my answer will match 8285 is interesting main model american styled truck alternate model european styled truck i dont think tlg produced many european styled truck edit i just found a wonderful mocalternate on brickshelf 8436 by industrialdesigner if i got him right he designed a few offical technic sets for tlg  all promises promises promises hm and again its ebay thats blocking me i want to foreshadow my next review although itll take some time to make it i know you know but please act inconspicuous until youll can act very astonished edited by bernddasbrot 09 april 2008  0325 pm	neutral

ok i think its a nobrainer that this is a musthave for pretty much anyone who likes lego its cheap and a great minifigs  parts pack ill be getting at least 1 of these here is what i like about it 1 great minifigs with nice torsos sweet faces and awesome hair gotta ask em where they get it done  2 golden katana 3 chicken leg yum 4 nice campfire and this is what i dont like about it 1 dark bley knife seriously they could have at least made it silver like the sword if not chrome 2 rehashed tent 3 spiders with 6 legs i actually dont really care about the tent and the multilegged creatures those go straight into the sorting boxes perhaps i might use the tent someday for a steampunk moc of some kind or a stopmotion film or maybe some kind of contest anyway whats up with that thing that holds the katana the sword and the saber its in the airplane set too is it perhaps one of the treasures of the new movie or is it something indy takes with him everywhere in this film 44however nice pics nice review thanks dude edited by oky wan kenobi 16 april 2008  0938 am	positive

set ref 7625 name river chase number of minifigs 4 number of pieces unknown price 2290€ a general view of the set we’ve got an amphibious vehicle a small boat an observation post and a dark green croco so beautiful  for the figs we’ve got indy of course marion and two russian soldiers nothing special here in the back of the tree there is a box to put some things the amphibious vehicle is very nice the proportions are really great not too big not too small and there are a lot of details everywhere like the propeller a back view an inside view the small boat is a dark grey zodiac but the details are nice too giving it a retro look in the same way of all the indy vehicles the outpost has a net to permit to the bad guys to capture some nice guys and girls… but it seems that the girl marion is scared of the nice croco so indy comes and help her pushing the technic axle with this round inversed tiles which push out the net and capture the croco now marion feels happier and she takes a can of oil and whacks the poor croco without defences who has said marion is a nice girl so i’ve bought this set like an add on to my city in fact the elements of this set can easily be integrated in a town layout i plan to use the outpost for my forest section and the amphibious vehicle is always a nice touch of originality in a layout yes you can use all those military things without creating an army in a layout just put the violent parts out and you’ve got nice things like a biologist car in the case of the amphibious vehicle	positive

thanks for the review i really like this littleish set quite alot of detail it reminds me of sets from the late 90s more soviets are always welcome too and the new torso for marion is nice as is the new dark green alligator all of the neat little accesories are great too a cup shovel binoculars and of course the cans of gasoline again thanks for the review alex	positive
shoc on apr 15 2008 1031 pm said is that a laptop its on does it come with the set yes its a laptop and it was in the set when i opened it i understood why this little box was so heavy asus is my official sponsor so i have to show the logo i have to add that i dont have put on the stickers	neutral
merci beaucoup for the great review alex  where did you get the sets  that set is called river chase this is a great set  i love the amphibious vehicle with all the darj green part  i agree with you that the the dark green croc is fantastic  im also happy to have a dark bley zodiac and a new marion torso that tree hut is a fun feature where the playability doesnt screw the design  i really love the commies  its fun how lego reuses those fleshie heads and i really dont mind at all so its evil for evil since one of the commie has the zazi face i also love the ptrol cans  ingenious  i still have rants on that set  why oh why another similar indy  arghhh i cant stand it   why oh why the same marion head  cant wait to have those sets 	positive

darthperson8 on apr 15 2008 0712 pm said what are those bricks with the guns attached supposed to be great review and set btw some people have obliquely mentioned this in their responses to the setreview but to specifically answer your question its supposed to be a jerrycan aka a gasoline petrol container	neutral
a very fine review of a really great set thanks alex this set has everything a croc very nice mfs a neat tree trap a cool zodiac and a marvelous and very detailed amphibious car in a beautiful color scheme the only thing i´m not colpletely sure is the design of that jerrycan thanks for the right word and the interesting link kingboy  although the use of the revolver´s pretty clever indeed and fits well too it´s still clearly well a revolver very unusual and interesting for an official tlc design	positive
this set looks good about the jerry cans i like how they give me more pistols this may be the only indy set i get from this batch ill just have to deal with the fleshie heads exchange them for yellow like stealth hunter said this will be good for army building silent help	positive

wow those trees look so weak compared to those enormous blades anyway a highpossibilityandappealtouscompulsivelegoshoppers set so ill try to get it which means ill obsesively look until i find deforestation of puny trees on	neutral
thanks for this fantastic review alex those trees are a neat add on to any jungle as is that sweet cave but the main part of this set the jungle cutter man that is wicked packed with that awesome dark green and with those wonderful treads not to mention the smoothly spinning buzz saws however this sets a tad overpriced in my opinion and looking through the instructions they have that crazy colour syndrome again using blue yellow and red parts in the internal build still thanks for this sweet review with neat pics thumbup peace	neutral
here some closeup pics of the russian soldiers and the general  and i know that you have seen that i dont have put the stickers on	neutral
ahhhhh now this swamp vehicle looks great to me when i first heard lego were making it i was worried that it would be a poor version however im pleased to see that its not even though im not a great fan of those treads the trees dont really add anything to the set which is a shame still the parts are welcome at least the entrance is good though it could do with being bigger but i guess we can moc that i really like the commie general he looks like a real bad megablocks	positive
great review again alex  same question in case you didnt se it in my reply to the other set where did you get those new sets  i really love that set  its called jungle cutter the trees are really cool and make a great adition to it imo that temple entrance or monument is really cool  those bionicle parts do make fantastic vegetation  i totally forgot about that green frog  thats cool  those are so cute  5 more ants is great  the vehicle look really sharp ah ah ah 2 more commies yeay  that officer is really freaky actually  could have been a high rank under pol pots regime in the s21 yeay looks more asian than russian imo now its time for my grips  same bloody rant about indy   i havent read the instructions before but once again there are so many parts in crap colours that need to be changed look at all the crap red and yellow in there  i will need to look for those parts before buying the set like i always do  mod while building on  i am really soimpressed with that indy line  i sincerely hope it will have a long and healthy life 	positive

this is the 3rd review that i had read its very tempting to fly over and get those sets from there because i may need to wait for some months before it arrived it seemed we will have a new small little creature to add into the ranks these red ants is cute and of course looks nasty too haha i love those trees foilage and plants very very much it can be used for my moc and is good for any green project related expansion i love it about the vehicle i find it abit wierd it seemed too big in the setup hehe but still i love this set mainly i will get it for the green parts	positive
heres a review of the second largest set in the dragon masters subtheme for castle month dark dragons den figs the set comes with 3 dragon knights two of which have the dragon wings on their helmetssad thing is one of my knights was missing the left wing on the helmet there are also the definitive dragon wiz the wizard or majisto if you prefertwo horses and a hawk try to find him in each picture the set theres a large spot under the mountain for the dragon to guard the treasure chest the chest has 2 red and green 1x1 circles in it another gate in the back along with a door for knights the right side of the mountain has a ladder and a removable rock face the left side has some stairs leading up to the top i love this tree design simple yet effective a shot of the top hey what are you doing no throw him in the dungeon overall this set when first released in 1993 was priced at 43usd although that might just be because of the juniorised pieces 6 burps its a fun set that provides excellent playability if you can find it at a 2030 price point pick it up overall grade 810 edited by kimt 10 august 2008  0133 pm	positive
this is around the time that many consider the decline of castle in which point i somewhat agree but admittedly it still looks like a very playable set and the tree is very well done thank you for the review	positive
ah the wonderful dragon knight or was it dragon masters sets i personally preferred the black knights but these guys still had some awesome sets thanks for this review this looks like a neat little set although those modern stairs look a little out of place that tree design is indeed a neat one i remember having that in one dark forestmen set i got the interior sure is roomy may i suggest for future review you photograph the set on a cleared table that way you wont get distracted by the clutter in the background and can focus on the main part of the image the set peace	neutral
yay go dragon masters i have to agree with iamded i do like the black knights sets better for their design  betrayal  however the dragon knights are just awesome cause they have dragons this is a nice set with some awesome minifigs and a nice overall design i wish i had it go masters	positive
agent rick youre definately the dragon master around these parts what a great little set i really like the classic dragon which reminds me of a similar style used for the lego crocodiles and the dungeon is pretty slick too i like the use of the large gates plus the doors plus the set contains the blue wizard awesome great review	positive
great classic dragon den i love the old green dragons very much there were my fave i love these theme very much after the black knights era this is a very very good set i wished i can have this too	positive
a very neat set with charming mfs and a great classic dragon a good use of burps and a really nice tree indeed thanks for the review agentrick57	positive
this was the last castle set i got before my dark age really liked it although the big rock parts looked really bad  i am kind of used to them now unfortunately i lost the little wand and i never understood who is good and who is bad does the wizard own the dragon well they dont seem to be enemies but isnt the dragon supposed to be evil	positive
the wizard somehow controls the dragons i think like for example the wizard of the new castle line does with the undead skeletons but i think it isnt sure that the dragon masters wizard is evil as it is still unclear which factions of the older castle series are good or bad	neutral

i think the green motocross bike looks great i like the use of fairings on this bike the only thing i really dont like about the technics bikes in general is the clumsy design of the chaindrive it sticks way to much out to the side if they made a really big bike model it would be more in place with this chain drive im not sure if it wouldnt be possible to design a shaft drive to the rear wheel ala bmw style but the green kawasaki look great with the front and rear suspension i have the street bike 8420 a somewhat larger and more complicated set and will probably add the motocross bike to my collection soon it would be great if lego could make a line of bikes like they do the ferrari line front	positive
a very good review thanks sinner that´s really a pretty cool model very detailed with useful parts too hmm perhaps that one´s gonna get the first technic set i´ll buy beside that 4481 hailfire droid um thank you sinner	positive
i have just finished building this set i was a bit disappointed with the amount of bricks when they were out on my table but the final model is really nice and totally makes up for that i like the small details like on the handles and fuel tank and the only real negative thing i can say is that the cog seems a bit oversized in the rear i dont know if the designer frequents this forum but im sure he will be happy about how much you like it  it took quite some timeprototypes to get to this design sorry about the size of the picture  it isnt mine	positive
best review of a lime green technic dirt bike ever really it is i just dont understand the allure of the bike very much where does the fabuland fig go anyway very insightful review thanks for taking the time and effort to review it for us im not really interested in the set but wanted to support my buddy since i know how much work you put into these now i shall go read the cherry picker one i look forward to it because theres a walrus in it lasse d on apr 22 2008 0455 pm said it must be cold in that room nice shirt but the vertical hold is broken	neutral

sinner on apr 23 2008 1037 am said ill try to take a photo this weekend well i took the photo but didnt get around to posting it here it is with a smaller gear i think it looks better the problem is that its too tight and it doesnt rotate as freely anymore adding another link makes it too loose thus the set is probably the way it is as its the gear that fit best	neutral
how did i manage to miss this review i must have overlooked it somehow thanks for making this one sinner its always nice to see reviews of technic sets im not so sure whether i like this set i am not that much into motorbikes but lego did a good job on this one it looks a lot like an upgraded version of one of the first bikes lego made namely the 8838 shock cycle i also believe the back gearwheel is somewhat oversized it looks better with the smaller one you attached it is good to see that lego is back to making the technic sets the way they were except for the green that is 	neutral

thanks for the review i think i am going to get this set for its many technic pieces i could really use those for a rig im going to build	neutral
looks like an interesting set i didnt realize the motor controlled two functions through a transmission switch thats always good to see ill probably pass it up though until the price falls a bit the overall design is a bit too studless for my liking i think the 8275 bulldozer has a much better balance of studded and studless pieces and the wheels somehow look too small to me i also have something of a backlog at the moment i still need to pick up that bulldozer along with the 8421 mobile crane on ebay	neutral

set 7627  indiana jones  temple of the crystal skull pieces 929 price aud14999 out of all the indy 4 sets this one seems to cop the most flak  which may account for the fact that the other 3 were reviewed weeks ago and this one has sat unloved and alone waiting for someone to turn their eye upon it or yknow buy it luckily im a sucker for spooky old temples filled with devilish traps and hidden treasures hissing fountains and overgrown foliage creepy skeletons and crumbling stonework so here it is indiana jones 7627 temple of the crystal skull part 1 the figs first off the figs  6 humans and 4 skellies or should that be skullies  indy mutt irina and that sneery russian guy thats in the 2 smaller sets nothing new here aha what have we here  two natives i wonder if hair is a sign of power in this culture since one guy is completely bald and the other one has the most extraordinarily luxurious black mullet somehow i doubt the movie will answer this question back view  as you can see the scalp tattoos are also popular in this tribe fashion conscious note in the background the paws of the fearsome black jungle panther ie my cat curious as to see what the tribe was up to also dont ask me why these guys are carrying axes rather than say spears and what everyones been waiting for the skullies  three of em and a conquistador skellie  very cute note the backs of the crystal head have a plumesized hole  or maybe thats just where they injected the blue brainplastic spooky i love these skulls i wasnt sold from the initial pics but they have a very creepy smile and the head shape is just weird with the large eyes its kind of homer simpsonesque and here we have the token vehicle in the set  a weird little tank thing with treads kind of looks like a cross between the amphibious boat and a minitank im sure theres a military expert around here who can tell us exactly what it is supposed to be the treads are nice but the rest of it is a bit thrown together you can tell they wanted to keep the dark green colour scheme but the budget only allowed them 5 parts to do so  all in all a mixed bag with the figs 4 repeats from the cheaper sets which means we have one new native figure and the crystal skullies there are heaps of the oldskool skele heads scattered around the sets so those that prefer can replace the skullies with ordinary skellies bizarrely the top of the box which has the line of 11 figs pic you know what i mean doesnt have names for any of the characters whereas all the smaller sets do part 2 box parts front of box back of box two instruction books parts this set has come under criticism for being overpriced  myself included  but the official piece count is 900 plus which is pretty good considering it also contains the baseplate 6 big bags and 2 of those 12x12 bricks in dark tan note set does not contain live black jungle panther™ the dss helpfully comes prescrunched thanks to tlc even in a aud150 set they cant get that right sigh the dark tan baseplate say what you like im in love i know some people dont like these but they were such a staple of castle pirates for so many years that i dont consider them a juniorised piece at all this one recycled from the 05 police hq and 06 hospital is much better in design than the king leos castle one as the different heights and asymmetry make it look much more like a natural piece of ground perfect for mocs and its dark tan  how could anyone not love such a huge slab of dark tan note this love doesnt extend to applying the stonework stickers which are frankly crap random instructions page part 3 temple of doom  or just a doomed temple the complete set front view isometricish view back view top view first impressions its very dark tan isnt it and green and bright green and dark green and dark red and normal tan and dark bley and pearl gold in fact its a bit of a mishmash of colours im of two minds about this i kind of prefer the palette to be a bit subtler but i can see that a playset designed for kids isnt going to sell bucketloads all tastefully done in shades of tan with lashings of darkgreen foliage theres a huge amount of dark red in this set which is always a welcome colour but im not convinced it quite works with the 2 shades of tan on offer here on the plus side theres also a huge amount of dark tan in ordinary 2x2 bricks tiles plates and 1x1 and 1x2x3 slopes which is great for anyone wanting to stock up lets take a closer look ill do this roughly in order of the build itself a the big scary face this is a simple fun build and very effective at projecting menace at the temple entrance it actually detaches very easily from the temple as pictured on the box art to allow easier access to the inside the eyes are flickfire missiles with scary faces hair conveniently providing ammo refills should you run out all in all from me b the back spin the skelly head and stone steps appear  we havent seen this feature in a while nice to get these pieces in dark bley a conquistador hides under the stairs  this is a bit useless as the stairs cant fully extend while hes there  moving right a trapdoor  what could possibly be behind it answer not much really a little red stair i really like these 2 stickers though  very intricate the staircase leads to what i like to think of as the crystal skull transmogrification chamber now i know nothing about the movie except that its supposed to be have a kind of 50s bmovie plot rumoured to feature look away spoilerhaters aliens these weird creepy gold chairs look made from the bones of aliens if you ask me with their strange vertebrae and silver claws it wouldnt surprise me if bringing these aliens back to life was part of the plot of the movie hence the crystal skull i guess well find out may 22 in any case transforming aliens clearly like a disco whirl as when you pull the handle the whole of this assembly spins giddily around a very clever and simple trick  its basically just a wheel under the platform but the effect is great also under here is a bottomless pit stickered i would very much expect a villian to be thrown down it at some point so do you come here often i dont know who designed this club these chairs are really uncomfortable nb i am really really over those pearl gold 1x2 roof corner slopes which started popping up in the 2006 castle range infected exoforce and have now spread here can we please have these in a different colour or a different pearl gold piece pretty please  c left tower looking from the front a small tower with a trans clear gem d right tower waterfall with booby trap i like the sticker its very cartoony which fits with the set somehow when you turn the wheel flick fire missiles spray out and hit whoever is on the stairs both towers have a trap where if you move the skull another one pops out from the dragon mouth e central turret thing this thing is kind of annoying and doesnt really sit or work well its kind of like a laser beam sending messages to space i guess as the central dome rises the two plates peel away i find it is a little bit tight to work smoothly and the two plates doesnt really sit well together at the top maybe i just need to rebuild it im sure this will also be explained in the movie f final trap  the stair that isnt there the final trap is at the front  as indy goes down the staircase you can push the red heads and all the 1x8 bley bricks come tumbling down simple and works well g alternate view heres how it looks as pictured on the box with the head removed as you can see this allows better access to the centre of the temple as you can see sadly there is nothing actually interesting there except a staircase to the turret and 2 dark tan slopes which are just stuck there and look a little out of place i mean come on everything else has a splash of dark red and gold your destination nowhere part 4 in conclusion so after all those endless pics what about the set itself consas a playset 7627 doesnt quite make sense admittedly the traps that are there are welldesigned and unobtrusive on the other hand theres a great big whopping entrance at the front  but i wasnt sure if the figs are supposed to sneak in through the backdoor and go up the spiral staircase and past the waterfall as shown in the box art or if they were meant to end up in the golden skull room the middle area doesnt really connect with anything nor does the giant space turret it may be that some of these questions are answered in the film but whereas with 7624 7625 and 7626 i could at least picture a story myself eg with river chase is fairly obvious whats happening  a chase down a river with a croc and a communist staking them out the temple set is a little all over the place the design feels a little off to me  not really bad but not really great either pros on the plus side the natives and crystal skulls themselves are great at 900 pieces this is also a great parts pack for dark tan dark red plant pieces gold oddments etc i especially love the baseplate in that shade i like the overall shape of the temple  a big staircase with secret nooks and crannies the build is reasonably interesting and there are some clever tricks with the traps but upon reflection i shouldnt have to sell this set  it should be able to sell itself as i said before im a huge fan of dark mysterious old temples so for that i have to give it some love it reminds me of the big old adventurers sets and the whiff of nostalgia is itself a powerful intoxicant however for the price lego is selling it in australia europe canada i couldnt recommend it as a mustbuy for full price when the smaller sets in this series are themselves so good review done  woo edited by imperialshadows 01 june 2008  1159 am	positive
thanks sveltecorps i was really hoping that the conquistador helmet would end up being silver in the final set but i suppose its good to know that the helmet is being porduced again anyway and is the armour the skellie is wearing pearl gold thanks again i look forward to the rest of the review edit the dark tan baseplate is in fact very nice although the fact that you have to put stickers on it is a real downer but i suppose it is good for those who want it plain edited by tinypiesrus 01 may 2008  0219 am	positive

thanks for the great review sveltecorps ive been wanting to see this set in detail since it debuted at the conventions i have to say that on the one hand i agree that the minifigures the crystal skulls and the colors are great i even like the waterfall but on the other i kind of think that the set itself is a disappointment it looks like they tried to accommodate design and playability needs but really didnt come through on either so as you pointed out the mid section doesnt really fit in with the other parts and the trap sequence doesnt really flow either but perhaps your right and all will be answered in the film i was surprised at just how empty the temple looked in the photo taken from above they really should have gone the extra mile and made the temple look more like a temple and not worry so much about the action features eh but so it goes but i too am a sucker for tombs and temples so i wont be able to pass it up archaeology on	negative
thanks sveltecorps for the great review if its out in aussie then it should hopefully be reaching nz soon i cant wait this looks like a great set for me at least i too am a great fan of spooky old temples they are such fun i love the look of the base plate but the stickers dont look all that great i wish they printed it like they always used too i have to get this set and the other ones too thanks again you have brightened this sad day	positive
outstanding review your efforts have totally convinced me to get this set no matter what it really looks very great and funz reading that review i will be looking forward to the new addition of those minifigs just love the layout of this temple a great addition indeed	positive

very good for a first review i bought this set and jungle duel at target the other day i was going to wait and buy them when i go to downtown disney this summer but how could i pass up saving four bucks that i can spend on storeexclusives  and i have to say i absolutely love them the amphibious vehicle dont they call it a duck in the movie is definitely my favorite lego vehicle ive ever built everything about it is wonderful the size the colour scheme and its accurate to the one in the movie and irina spalkos hair is to die for on a side note i dont get why they made marions arms white in the set the shirt underneath her vest in the movie is obviously blue i switched the arms out for light blue ones and it looks a lot better and it makes marions eyes look great ryan	positive

warning this reply may contain several minor movie spoilers if you havent yet seen the movie and want it to be a complete surprise do not read batbrick on may 10 2008 0605 am said but it is cruncher block his lady driver taejo that really shine look at those awesome suits the cool faces taejo has a ripped shirt i was originally skepitcal about the driver figure—i like the head but i was trying to figure out why they put in a female minifig with no hairpiece after having seen the movie i now understand why crunchers driver is a fairly manly looking woman and most of the lego hairpeices would make the minifig look too girly for the character  now that i know why taejos shirt is ripped up i dont mind the bits of fleshie color that are printed on it but i do wish they would make some of the new torsos a little more headcolour agnostictheres no real reason why cruncher and his driver couldnt have had ties that came all the way up to their necks instead of having those little wedges of flesh showing through loose collars yeah they are lowlevel mafioso type scum but they arent complete slobs batbrick on may 10 2008 0605 am said front view the new windshields are fantastic they are indeed very nice its the main reason i started looking at the speed racer sets in the first place batbrick on may 10 2008 0605 am said while a very cool car it is rather silly of tlc to give us the exact same one we got in the smaller set i didnt get the smaller set with this car so im still happy but it is a bad marketing move i think the error they made was in the smaller set though in the movie the only time we see crunchers semi is when hes being chased by racer x racer x and taejo do end up on the same team for a cross country rally race along with speed of course so i guess thats where they were going by putting those two together in the smaller set but it would have been much more interesting for them to have made up a set with taejo and one of the cars from the very goofy comic bookgimmicky teams they are racing against especially since one of the teams that is chasing taejo specifically is a bunch of armywannabee loonies—im sure more people would have loved some sort of darksand green racer with one of the ij soviets at the wheel than another racer x to summarize two racer xs is bad but it is the smaller set that should have been changed imho batbrick on may 10 2008 0605 am said annoyingly enough this part opens up to shoot a pointless rubber projectile thus blowing the front part open and launching itwell not far really as much as i normally dont like the stupid techic launcher thing and would rather not see it in a set ever again although one of these days i will make a giant multilauncer rig out of them just for fun at least there is a reason for it to be in this set as crunchers semi has a missile launcher in the front end of it in the movie i think youre supposed to lift the panel that hides the missile before launching it similar to the way that panels slide out of the way on the semi cab to allow for firing in the movie batbrick on may 10 2008 0605 am said and now for the most disappointing part  step three the trailer thats right almost the entire thing is open even the filled in side has holes id certainly be cared to be back there one bumpy hill and back you go im gonna chock this up to the standard lego philosophy of playset rather than model design for a lot of things the semi rig and raver xs car are the models the trailer is the playset seeing as how the trailer is crunchers mobile office rather finely appointed with lots of paintings and his pirahna babies in their tank behind his desk and the intent seems more or less to have a playest bit in order for kids to reenact the scene from the movie im not going to give them too much grief over this they tried to capture the basic bits of the movie set which we see mostly from the inside during the movie and translate it into a playset type environment that being said i do wish the back walls were more solid as i see no reason for there to be gaps in the back wall when the front wall or the fourth wall as the case may be here is already conspicously absent batbrick on may 10 2008 0605 am said there are some pluses too though like the ridiculously awesome minifig paintings ill be using for wayne manor also note the control on crunchers desk that when turned turns the gun at the bottom its an alright feature could have been a little better but its such a minor bit of this scene in the movie that i can see why they didnt spend too much time and effort on it it would have been nice to have more paintings though had the back wall been more complete and i like your idea of how to use them   batbrick on may 10 2008 0605 am said and though im not a massive fan of stickers this is just too cool the little aquarium is very simple but very clever using a printed piece between two clear windows to create the illusion of a tank definately a feature which is not showcased nearly well enough on the box art since it is one of the major features of this set in the movie its nice to see it translate rather well into brick batbrick on may 10 2008 0605 am said design 25  pretty poor considering the best part is available in a cheaper set and only the front part of the truck looks cool but still not truly awful that may be a bit harsh but not much given what ive said further up this post but it probably only deserves a 3 at best so im not realy going to quibble the point  i still think that racer x should be exclusive to this set and a different car should be in the smaller set with taejo which would have improved the cachet for this set overall batbrick on may 10 2008 0605 am said price 25  overpriced easily but rogue shadow is worse truethis should have ideally been about a 30 set especially given the general awesomeness of the ij race for the stolen treasure set unless they made the trailer a bit more detailed better back wall perhaps some drop down gun ports like in the movie or at put least one or more of crunchers goons in the set then maybe i could agree more with the msrp on that note if i remember correctly from my visit to my local tru yesterday in search of the new ij sets since local targets seem determined not to get them in stock yet they had this set on sale for around 35 along with an offer for a coupon good for 750 towards the purchase of a ticket to the movie with any speed racer toy purchase over 25 i may be wrong on the sale price but i know the ticket offer was there so if you havent seen the movie yet and are interested in this set tru may be the place to go right now to get both at a slightly cheaper price batbrick on may 10 2008 0605 am said fun 45  the mere concept of such an open truck kept me playing with this baby for hours so you did enjoy the playest aspect of the trailer even though you didnt care for the designlooks like they didnt do too badly then on what they wanted out of that bit  batbrick on may 10 2008 0605 am said overall im really glad i bought it as the minifigs are fantastic and the paintings and fish tank are cool its fun stupid and downright ridiculous but while not a great set by any means certainly isnt as bad in the brick as it looks in photos i was actually thinking about going and getting this set now that ive seen the movie and i understand what the heck is going on here more your review has definately added an additional impetus to that notion my pocketbook does not thank you	neutral
thanks for the great review it seems like the most awesome part of the set is the sticker sheet which is a reversal of the usual situation	positive
i bought this set a few days ago and agree with what you have said about it the trailer is fun to play with but just so plain overall great review	positive
i really like this set my favorite parts are the minifigs and xs car vrooom	positive
i enjoyed the review some cool fleshie heads and parts but it does seem a bit lamer even than i imagined from the box the airy truck is rather slyly disguised on the box art i would like to get it if it is ever on sale 50 off would be nice  speed racer lego doesnt seem to be selling too well in local shops here	neutral

great review as always although i know you dont take many pictures in your reviewsimho  but can we see a little more about the tumbler is that little windshield down near the bottom front a third seat what is in the framework of the back behind the cockpit i know theres a blunt shooter and flick fire missiles but is it all framework	neutral
trooperdavinfelth on may 16 2008 1111 pm said although i know you dont take many pictures in your reviewsimho  but can we see a little more about the tumbler ill get some set up tomorrow in better light to be honest there isnt a lot to see most of it is just basic technic blocks underneath with all the slopes built up on top	neutral
thanks a lot for the review brickbitz i really love this set sure the figs are annoyingly not new but the ice cream truck is fantastic and the tumbler is a marvel of black slopes i see now that it is far too huge though i reckon i will either keep it that way as a mega tumbler mod it to become another battank keep it as a model tumbler or pull it apart and use the bits to make a tumbler like wetwires awesome one love those popsicles though and those wheels are very nice so overall as a loyal batfan i love the set even though it couldve been better batbrick away	positive
a nice review of an interesting set thanks brickbitz a great new batman a funny ice cream truck and a pretty detailed tumbler and although i wish that vehicle would be just a bit smaller i almost wonder that it´s not even bigger compared to tlc´s other batvehicles and well the interior could be better too	positive
brickbitz on may 16 2008 1141 pm said ill get some set up tomorrow in better light to be honest there isnt a lot to see most of it is just basic technic blocks underneath with all the slopes built up on top some more pics of the tumbler	neutral
the tumbler is massive ill struggle to fit it into the cave but never mind the figs are nice the tumbler is pretty accurate or at least it will be after ive moded it and jokers tainted ice cream van is so very joker thanks for the review btw	positive
hey brickbitz i love how your review is not biased 10 ups in the end you said overall slightly disappointing most people post reviews only with praise but im glad you take both sides  enjoyed the review just like others have thanks so much	neutral
general grievous reviewed by dunamis set 10186 1085 pieces 8995 from lego shop  home build time 35 hours it is the start of summer here in california and along with the weekly deluge of new action films we start to see some of the next wave of star wars lego sets the latest offering from our favorite building toy company is none other than the infamous general grievous no doubt you all know the story of grievous two parts technic and one part human and his hatred of the jedi follow along as we get a closeup view of the mighty general no doubt the observant will wonder why i purchased this set from shop  home instead of my trusty lego store in glendale well it’s really as simple as two things i’ve been traveling a lot and didn’t have time to drive to the store to get it and gas is now 4gallon and i would likely spend more in gas than the 9 shipping cost to get it to me so there you have it the box a gigantic box much larger than expected held the mighty general we’re back to the perforated tabs on the side and two stickers on the front that let the box lift open inside we have 17 bags two manuals and three stickers on a relatively small sticker sheet the manuals the manuals are not terribly thick in fact the second manual is noticeably thinner than the first they come in at 75 and 31pages interesting to note on the back we see the next and more interesting wave of sets later this summer nothing new to report on the manuals as they provide the lego standard of high quality and features we expect  piece callouts  models divided into sections  large images  page numbers since there were links posted to the pdf files of the instructions online i’m sure you can all get an idea of the manual and the parts inventory however for those of you without access to the internet here are photos of the parts inventory pages random manual image features page the pieces the short answer is you get lots and lots of little pieces in white gray and black plus some big pieces in white gray and black mixed in the set is a fair amount of oddball pieces like minifig tools jedi hood and trans yellow dome fear not despite the eclectic collection of parts it all comes together in the end not unlike a typical day at work for me… it is probably worth noting again that there is a heavy amount of technic parts and pieces here the build the build starts off with a rather indepth build of the stand in which general grievous stands on once you think you are done you keep adding on to this rather solid base i bet there are 250 pieces just in the base alone it is quite nice when you get done with it though and really adds to the display i’m glad lego didn’t skimp on the base as it completes the model once you get through all that the rest of the build is a real thumbbruiser anyone who has built a decent size technic set knows the feeling of your thumbs being sore when you are done you get the same effect here it is actually a fun build and i really liked seeing how the designers used all the various pieces to recreate a fairly accurate model of grievous the model is built from the ground up as seen in a few of the progress shots here is what is left over the design the design is quite good and is very accurate some might be disappointed that since this is a technic set we don’t have more articulation in the shoulders and have the ability to separate two arms into four as seen in the movie however it would seem the real intent is for display and not functionality here is a shot of the torso and the detail involved here are grievous’ organs careful observers will note that my model is lacking two “arrow” stickers from the two white chest pieces i failed to see these on the sticker sheet and only grabbed the large grievous sticker so note that there are actually three stickers and not one chest protector and respirator head and arms i was a little disappointed that we got two yellow blades and no green blades on the lightsabers note how all the lightsabers have different hilts which is a nice touch here are some shots of the completed model with a few other sets shown for scale he is actually pretty tall you have the option to remove the top two arms and put in shoulder plates if you so desire detail on the back overall thoughts i’ve been saying for a few years that we should have a technic grievous set and we finally got one designed more as a model and not a fully functional swooshable figure grievous is a tad flimsy you won’t want him to veer too far off his massive and sturdy base it would have been nice to have is cape with him like the technic vader set i do like the size of the model and it is impressive to look at lego star wars system fans will likely want to think twice before purchasing but technic and ucs fans should be satisfied final rating 75 build 810 very good – fun relatively quick build technic fans will be more pleased than others design 810 very good – some nice snot and technic techniques a bit flimsy but the base is kind of cool parts 710 a mixed bag of stuff probably can’t get too many diverse builds from this except for other robot type models price 710 just ok – a bit stiff at 90 usd for a nice display model with limited functionality as always let’s hear your thoughts and feedback	positive
thanks so much dunamis for your awesome review  yeah i think tlc miss the cape it would be cool to own one but when we were talking of the 2008 sets around july of last year i can remember someone said it would come with cape finally is a little dissapoint tlc miss it  edited by darkrebellion 16 may 2008  0720 pm	negative
excellent review dunamis this set looks great the designers really though the kit out it seems the internal organs have got to be my favorite part but everything is good now all we need is a ucs obiwan with a laser pistol to finish off grievous in a totally anticlimatic way	positive
hey dunamis think you can get a straighton shot of the face the red pieces inside the eye sockets are topped with transgreenishyellow studs which make his face look eerily alive and very close to his screen appearance its a nice little detail that seems to not show through on pictures ive seen of the set the legs are a little wobbly im scared that hell be leaning too far forward in about 5 years	neutral
nice review dunamis  i built it two weeks ago on the legoworld speedbuild in oslo and didn´t have time to get the feel during that crazy race i agree with you that the base is nice  sturdy makes it stand real still  i´m looking forward on your next score four eyes arms on copmike	positive

thanks for that fine review dunamis i really like that set gg´s an interesting and well designed movie character and that lego version of him´s indeed well done and very detailed and although i would wish for a some more functional or playable  feature of move and even splitable arms i guess it´s an already very cool ucs version of that grumpy old kaleesh	positive

hi all again another one of todays special deliveries i think personally this set is great mars mission is really finding its feet 7646 etx alien infiltrator	positive
thanks very much for the review brickbitz i love this years mars mission line and though this is the weakest set it is still a major improvement the mech is very cool and well made and the commander is one of my favourite alien figs ever the alien ship is pretty good better than last years ones but not extremely good either but i still like the set batbrick away	positive
thanks for the sweet review brickbitz that really is a neat little set that walker is fantastic most likely the best part of the set though the alien craft does also look neat and its cool how it can fold down into aa walker or rather a sentry turret seeing as it cant really move while in that mode still its nice my favourite part is the mini mining robot though so cute peace	positive
thanks for that interesting review brickbitz the alien fighter looks pretty nice nothing special but streamlined and fast nevertheless that transforming feature´s a nice addition for sure and these new flicker missile with its launch apparatus hmm i hope i won´t spend quite some time in search of that little rocket piece however there´s still something i miss with these alien crafts i don´t know i like some more organic looking design and they even come in some nice and different shapes but still perhaps a real space fighter just needs a solid cockpit cool windscreens and controls to satisfy my odd likings that exo suit looks really good and i wonder why it´s a little underrepresented on the box art the jet packspace scooter´s a really good idea and the only thing i hate´re those darned studless technic beams it could look so much better with a studded version of these parts but of course that´s only due to my personal preferences	positive

my first impression upon seeing this set was no thanks but now im warming up to it still ill skip it if it interferes with my hypersonic operations aircraft fund p	neutral
thanks for the excellent review oky judging by this set the line is going to be promising i really like the figs and im glad to see that robot arm is actually a new arm mold awesome can a minifig hand fit in the end or just the chainsaw attachment could it fit an exoforce robot claw theres a lot of detail in the torsos and i like that the agents suit is like a motocross uniform i love that the snowmobile has a working tread copmike ras and i tried to build a snowmobile with working treads but we ended up using chainsaw blades in the end great work oky	positive
thats a great review for your first one i think the jet pack if far to bulky it could do with some minimising but that’s life i assume that you can’t fit a standard hand in the chainsaw arms are the hole would be to large but would you be so good as to confirm this for me overall i quite like the jet ski and the ability to lower the arms to much doesn’t both me how much was it just so i can get an idea of the price finally thanks for posting this review so quickly	neutral
this is much much much more promising than the 2008 batman set for 1000 the vehicle looks like someone took time to design it but the batman one looks like  lego dear lego where is the quality for batman i really like the new cyborg arm and the propellers on that thing   it is a really promising line although i would get rid of all those bionicle pieces	positive
huhm  i like the idea of the agentid  but offcourse all they want with that is that you buy all six sets  but it can be a good idea for children they wouldnt think of hey they get all money only because i have a little card with stars or something well not to rant i think its good also can you make that name yourself maybe set 5 comes with a extra stickersheed with all letters that would be nice agent rupee a very nice review oky wan kenobi rupee	neutral
thanks guys i really tried to make it a good first review now to answer your questions the robot arm can fit ef robot claws and anything that a minifig can hold in his hand or that would fit into a 1x1x1 cylinder so normal minifig hands are too small to fit tlg is using the robot claw idea for the main villain of the agents line do you still want me to try it out and take pics the price was 1099 usd at the tru i bought it at i bet itss be a dollar less on sh and im sorry but i probably wont get any more sets any time soon i have to save my money for all the other good set that are to come but if i would get another set it would just be the one with the helicopter and the allsilver car if anyone gets this set can heshe please review it thanks any other questions i can answer for you guys edited by oky wan kenobi 18 may 2008  0859 am	neutral
nice first review oky wan  i´d say this is better than we first thought the minifigs looks cool and the overall look is ok and the excaustpipe is a new peace also i think agents on copmike	positive
i kind of like the set as said it has a very cartoonish style to it so im guessing the kids are going to love it and as a parent ill love it if the construction isnt to fragile  ill probably be getting a few for myself but only as parts pack copmike on may 18 2008 1129 am said and the excaustpipe is a new peace also i think yeah and its all over this years releases from what ive seen so far its found in racers speed racers mars mission and exoforce sets i just wish that instead of a 2x1 plate with an exhaustpipe in each end they would have made it an 1x1 plate with a single exhaust that would have been a lot more useful	positive

ive copied another thing because i dont know how i must do a review and i cant do long reviews set ref 7884 name the buggy the escape of mr freeze number of minifigs 2 number of pieces 76 price 1395€ front of the box back of the box the comic very close whats in the box without the set the set with the box the time wow this is a funny set but its a little expensive and a little to small but i like some pieces like the fire and the mr freeze gun and the best of all here it comes no stickers thats one of the greatest things but i understand why lego has made this set some people want batman lego and they are most of the time expensive and the mr freeze set is also expensive but this set not if you want more pics you msut ask for exaple for the minifigs or the mr freeze and the blaster ask it and this is my first review and sorry for the great and blurry pics the final verdict 7510 figures 810 playability 610 build 710 pieces 7510	positive
thanks for the review ill probably get one copy of this set mr freeze and his cart look neat i dont like the huge wing on the back of batmans buggy so ill probably mod that out	neutral
quote but i have to say that these two small vehicles just look plain ugly imho without any inspiration nor orginality indead the only reason to get this set is if you couldnt afford the batcave back in 2006 and want a mr freeze fig for a cheap price and anyone who did get that kit really have no reason whatsoever to get this wait did i forget something oh yeah  thanks for the review riddler edited by grevious 22 may 2008  1154 pm	neutral
thanks for the review for such a high price that we need to fork out compared to a total pieces of 76 its is very expensive to pay for such poor design but then i will still considered to get them as what sinner had said this is a very good way to get mr freeze without getting the batcave and it so happened that i do not have the batcave too i believed that is the cheapest set among the four so for the minifigs only this set is recommended other than that i am sorry	neutral
like many others ill buy this just for mr f quickly recycle the parts and pretend this set never existed the flame detail is indeed terrible the bat is back  and hes flatulent this third batwave isnt really doing anything for me ill get the penguin set as well for pretty much the same reason  although the sub on that is pretty cool  but skip the others maybe batbrick can make us all nice altmocs to improve these sets thanks for the review though	negative
thanks for the review theriddler this is a neat little set a bit overpriced in my opinion but for a new suited batman and a mr freeze fig in a set other than one of the most expensive batsets released its worth my money peace	positive
wowie im glad you like it maby il do the tumbler also but soon the batcycle and the scuba also come	neutral
pretty nice review for a first time theriddler next time though if your camera has it use the macro function little flower icon and perhaps a tripod that should get rid of any blur and provide you with better pictures apart from that a good little review keep up the good work	neutral
neat little set i do like the parts a number of hard to find bits all in one pack depending on how much it costs in usd ill have to consider it and while the buggy designs kinda suck im a little happy to see them its been years since tlc made any small go kart style vehicles i guess tiny turbos have been overshadowing that market	positive
thanks for the reveiw the figs are bloody great but those cars are a bit well ill put it blantly retarded although they shall be good after some modding and whats with that grapple hook does it even have a rope so i guess batman will hokk it to mr freeze so his ride looks more ugle anyway can you pleese take some pics of the figs	neutral
thats a great set itd be even better if it were sold as two separate little cars they remind me of the dozens of little lego cart vehicles i got as a kid those were always fun quick builds that resulted in lots of cool play i think this set is aimed more at kids and in that respect its a pure winner it doesnt hurt that you can get freeze and the newly designed batman both in this set for a reasonable price	positive

thank you the riddler  for this highly informative review despite the fact that i still consider it to be one of the weakest sets in all batman line i guess that now i may even get more than one of these for the same reasons as batbrick  good day gentlemen 	neutral
thanks the penguin and more pics on monday	neutral
in actuality i think that this may be my favorite batman set of all time i know i know  its a small set with crappy tiny vehicles so it probably sucks for the fan who likes to display sets but look at the mocing side and you see this set has a ton of potential new batman fig well mainly the torso but it looks nice sleek and armored a definite plus whether youre a mocist or batfan mr freeze because nobody bought the batcave when they should haveand by nobody i mean me plus i love that head cheapest way to amass the lightning piece the other sets that have it are lolhueg well not really but i dont have 50 to toss around on a little skeleton tower and its a great piece two little blue gems i may be alone on this but those are my favorite parts the gems and thats my favorite color for them 3 3 3 several other useful parts including a o piece in black some lightmedium blue bits from mr freezes kart the oddly placed grappling hook and some cheap wheels now i dont know about you guys but this is as close to a batman battlepack as were going to get lol  im buying at least three maybe more once i get my summer job  oh and the fact that the us price is only 10 helps a little but this year you guys cant complain  you got practically every set first especially the new castle tt trexxen	positive
thanks for the review i dont know if i would get this set though the cars are not that great and the price is a little too high	negative
i got this yesterday and built it this morning apart from the figs it is very crappy mr freezes buggy is ok but the bat buggy is easily the worst vehicle ive seen for years colours are all over the place the grappling hook feels cheaply made the inclusion of those odd pearl silver parts which have been in the exoforce sets seem especially random here the terrible bionicle flame piece its the first lego vehicle ive built where ive immediately had the urge to disassemble it and pretend i never bought it really i only got it for mr freeze so i shouldnt complain but still its a real step backwards the comparable catwoman dragster set was heaps better the penguin sub is sweet though thanks for the review anyway	negative
coming in at around 50 us turbo car chase is one of the bigger of the new agents sets a big box with a helicopter car and gate in it seems like a winner but how good is it really and is it worth the cash lets start with the minifigs this set comes with a standard inferno henchman spy clops and agent chase the henchman is you basic lego criminal type with a gun and a jumpsuit nothing real groundbreaking here spy clops on the other hand is very cool for technically half of a minifig his head has a neat electronic goggle print and the rest of him is a torso mounted onto a set of six legs made from exoforce robot arms the whole thing is really well done and neat as hell agent chase turbo car chase  seems to have a standard agent body and a doubleprinted face with one side a sunglasses and headset print the other face is a determined agent look the set also includes a laptop with doctor inferno wallpaper the laptop is a new piece and works like the lego books that are in a lot of harry potter sets molding on the keyboard is really well done and the thing can be held by a minifig along either corner but not in the middle and not while closed the gate in the set is nothing revolutionary by itself and i sort of get the feeling that it was included to drive up the piece count and the set price point that being said there are some things to like here for instance the gate has four wheels of barbed wire attached to it the barbed wire is new and makes me want to start building some world war i trench mocs the rest of the gate is fairly big and it has a handy ramp attached so that vehicles can roll through it easily the main feature of the gate is a sound brick its much better then lego sound and light units of the past when the gate is opened it depresses a button and an alert klaxon blares that sounds every bit like a prisonbeak in progress the triggering action works surprisingly well and its pretty much for this feature alone that im not going to immediately break the gate back down and add it to my parts bin the designers did make an effort to create more then just a fence though a nice control panel connected to a big spotlight crowns the piece and a pair of cameras watch the opening its really hard to mess up a lego helicopter and this set is no exception the inferno chopper is a nicely proportioned and well built machine it looks properly menacing and has the uniform orange and black of other inferno property its armed with a set of four technic pegs cleverly used as guns on outriding mounts as well as a pair of the newerstyle flickfire missiles i personally dont care for flickfiring missiles but these look decent enough and seem to stay put so i really cant complain about them along the fuselage are a pair of intake pieces that ive never seen before and im guessing are new theyre pretty well designed and will come in handy for mocing down the road the action feature of the aircraft is the wench system this is very different then other lego wenches in that you build the entire mechanism and housing you can then use it to raise spy clops up and down from the bottom of the chopper using the rotor now this also keeps you from sitting there and just giving the rotor repeated spins to simulate flight im not too thrilled with that but there are a hundred other lego helicopters out there with fully rotating rotors so i guess i can let it by just this once as youd suspect the bottom of the cockpit is completely open which makes this a vehicle pretty much solely for spy clops sorry henchman but there is plenty of room beneath the body to attach a plate with some seats on it to accommodate another pilot without drastically altering the design or even removing existing pieces the turbo car is a slick little honey of a lego car and the silver pieces that make up the body work contribute a lot to that fact the front license plate appears to be an exofore code brick but it also hides the activation lever for the passenger ejector seat the seat works about as well as the spruce goose which is to say not well at all but here its the thought that counts the interior of the car is really well done theres even a radar screen for keeping track of pesky helicopters but the bondlike features dont end there a lever in the compartment raises pair of guns in the hood and a knob on the rear deploys a quad rocket system with more flickfire missiles this is a car that wont be stopped easily the rear has two cones sticking out id like to think theyre smoke nozzles or oilslick sprayers allinall this is a really good set the car is pure lego vehicle love and looks fantastic the silver pieces are very nice and its a shame lego doesnt use metallic colors in system sets more often there are however a lot of sticker for this set and i know how much that bugs a lot of people i personally like how much detail the stickers add to these sets and dont mind them so much the set also comes with an agents id card for chase which you can put little star stickers on from other sets as you get them its printed on a real nice piece of sturdy plastiboard and would be cooler if you could put your own picture and name on it instead of pretending to be chase sold by themselves the car and chopper would be musthaves all tossed together with the gate sort of makes the set a little less then the sum of its parts and with 498 parts most of them small thats not so hot its only slightly overpriced in my opinion but if you do shell out the money you wont regret it im very comfortable recommending this set to anyone close to perfect but the price and some minor flaws bring it back just a little id say 433 but out of 5 is close enough	positive
looks cool one of the best in this line cant wait for review	positive
chrome cant wait for the review deino	positive
cant wait for the review the car is ly	positive
great review deino man that car is just so beautiful and the helicopter is nice too unfortunately this seems pretty pricy and i hardly think ill be getting it any time soon what with my limited budget and all still its great to see how well agents is shaping up	positive
i love it  fun playable cool looking and killer minifigs sweet	positive
thanks for the review deino i love going back through the old agents thread just to see how wrong we were about these awesome sets i actually really like the gate those portcullis pieces people may know i always find nice uses for and i really really really want that awesome sound brick the figs are a bit disappointing in numbers but agent chase is very cool generic henchman are great and spy clops is one of my favourite minifigs ever the helicopter is wonderful too i love that it is customised for spy clops to winch him down the colours as usual for these sets are fantastic the dark blue orange and chrome silver the car is the best though i love all the functions how does the ejector seat work though batbrick away	positive
wow thanks for the great review deino this set is really a must have for me the sound brick seems great the helicopter looks very nice and the car is superb all of the james bond features are really cool though im very interested in how the ejector seat works or doesnt work the car itself is very sleek and full of beautiful silver and the inclusion of the new rims and windshield mean that i wont have to buy many speed racer sets as for the minifigs they all look great especially spyclops though it looks rather easy for him to fall off of his spider legs can you confirm this a great review of a great set thanks deinonychus	positive
thanks for the awesome review deinonychus this really is a sweet set a bit expensive a set for me as i only get the cheaper noncastle sets which is a shame because i love that head it would be great for some more cyborg troops the car is awesome i didnt expect it to have that many silver parts thats fantastic heaps of play features too that ejector seat mechanism sounds interesting thanks again for the sweet review peace	positive
deinonychus on may 23 2008 0912 pm said the rear has two cones sticking out id like to think theyre smoke nozzles or oilslick sprayers according to page 14 of my brickmaster magazine the left cone is for smoke screen and the right cone is for oil slick	neutral
thanks deinonychus for another great review i must say i do look forward to people uploading reviews of new sets it really helps me decide if i want it or not if its a good set imo then it adds to the excitement of picking up one myself this i must say is one of those sets the only concern for me like alot of others is the price i will just have to wait and see and continue to look at these photos deinonychus has provided for us so much for thinking the agent line was going to be weak i wonder if the exoforce style code brick number plate is a hint from tlc as to what will replace exoforce at the end of this year jb	positive
thanks for your great review it looks very nice indeed the gate have very interesting mechanism the car looks very slick and cool it looks like those typical kind of james bond car this review gives me very good insights	positive
great review and fantastic pics deinonychus and a big thank you to whoever pointed out that you could use the sound brick for arkham asylum my addled brain didnt make the connection the car is just beautiful and with a good use for the most expensive part of the gate this is on my wish list for sure just have to see how much cash is left over after buying the new death star in a month or two agents has to be the biggest surprise from lego for ages without any pics it sounded soso but theyve done a brilliant job with it love those metallic coloured pieces	positive
great w im totaly gonna buy this set	positive
hello all eurobricks members i will present to you a very short review on the recent castle battlepacks this time i will be reviewing skeleton battlepack and i hope everyone of you do enjoy viewing it this was a request that put up by hollisbrick in the castle thread initally i thought it was a very simple set to do a review however for the love of castle i decided to whip this up for every castle fan out there this is an image of how the skeleton battlepacks look like i have bought 12 last packs of these in total so far but none of the crown battlepacks yet there were snapped much faster that i imagined do pardon me for the poor lightning today is a bad weather its hard to get natural light the skeleton gang for a single battlepack like this with an attractive reasonable price you obtained a series of 5 skeleton minifigs with tons and tons of useful castle accessories to me its a very very great buy and its a must to stock up for my army building some addons however i was not very satisfied with my skeleton armies standards therefore i decided to make some slight modifications with some additional castle accessories that is stocked in my castle warehouse after the makeover ok this is what i called a real skeleton army this is mainly my opnion and it have to be aligned with my standards i felt this improved battlepack gives a punch to the exisitng battlepack the two soliders on the right is able to align with the rest of my castle chess sets armies while the one on the left it gives me a great archer back up with the quiver and helmet attached to him the ones on the center especially the armored guard which equipped with the black nose cone helmet is my fave it is able to illustrate the elite among the rest of the guards with its armor and helmet which was featured in my castle deep forest expansion moc promotion on in addition the one which was hastly done with a modify mace it looks rather simple in time to come i will change it and gives a better equipment and look these are the remains i can use the axe for my dwarf in my dwarf mine defender in that set there is no weapon for my dwarf and i have to get it from other sets the rest of the accessories makes a very good stock up for future upgrading overall 910 this is not a playset it is mainly bought for its abilty to mass recurit any armies and is a main love for all castle army builders such as me this set mainly have no major faults and i love it so much although i have done some slight modifciations but this set is a must for me to buy more and more meanwhile i will need to wait for the next shipment hope everyone have enjoying viewing this simple review of mine edited by whitefang 25 may 2008  1252 pm	positive
thanks for the review whitefang i love these sets and i wish they were available in nz so far it seems they may never come here but i can sit and hope i like the look of them after your makeover a real skeleton army there did you say youve bought 12 thts lots of skelies are you planning a big moc or something	positive

thanks for the review it wasnt really a request but more of an imply to do it anyway great review cant wait til these come to aus probably when the rest of the castle comes out in september though	positive
thanks for the review i wanted to see what was in this set looks good is it sold in stores edited by mammymarf 25 may 2008  0338 pm	positive
whitefang on may 25 2008 0614 am said for a single battlepack like this with an attractive reasonable price you obtained a series of 5 skeleton minifigs with tons and tons of useful castle accessories to me its a very very great buy and its a must to stock up for my army building i wish these battlepacks had a reasonable price click here to see the canadian price of these battlepacks 18 dollars thats 6 dollars more than the starwars battlepack yet you get the same amount of lego or less then a starwars battlepack how the megablok does lego price its items  im gonna have to skip this set and a few others that i wanted because of this bloody outrageous back on topic thanks for the detailed review whitefang i also like your little changes to the set they really make this set look better	negative
thanks whitefang i love this battlepack but can only really hope to get one still great accesories and a spider thats great batbrick away	positive
no offence make this 799 can too expensive to be coming with only a few figures 20 earns you the same amount of figs plus a catapult barricade two horses and a jousting divider	negative
sdpirate on may 26 2008 1040 am said no offence make this 799 can too expensive to be coming with only a few figures 20 earns you the same amount of figs plus a catapult barricade two horses and a jousting divider are you refering to these following sets both these sets adds up to 1800 cad and the skeleton pack have the same price of 1800 cad prices quoted from sh i understand that 7009 and 7090 offers more pieces horses and same amount of minifigs compared to a typical battlepack imo i feel that all 3 sets are all army building sets 7009 offer small catapult 3 minifigs a skeleton white horse 7090 offer a joust divider weapon rack good accessories 2 minifigs a horse with barding and a skeleton black horse these sets have different purpose for me buying multiples of 7009 is to build its catapult white skeleton calvaries while 7090 is to build on crown calvaries and black skeleton calvaries however battlepacks have a different agenda it offered some castle accessories that is not available commonly for a castle army builder like myself castle accessories are always in demand the black robe silver armor silver shortaxe are not very common castle accessories it can be used as a good stock up too i am not saying this battlepack is an one way solution to solve everything thats why different sets are released to target on different purposes	neutral
whitefang although i realize that the battle packs are great specifically for building armies and castle accessories which is why its such a shame that i wont be able to buy these things  while sdpirates sets are more for a catapult calvary whatever the fact to the matter is with the battle pack you get 5 minifigs with lots of accessories while with the sets that sdpirate showed us you get 5 minifigs with an okay amount of accessories 3 horses including two skeleton ones a ballista a weapons rack and a jousting barricade you cannot say that the battle pack contains the same amount of stuff that the other two sets have and therefore should be priced the same it just seems that lego is ripping off canadian army builders to me if the battle pack contained a small catapult or wall so that it contained about the same amount of stuff that the other sets had it would be fair it seems stupid that you will only get minifigs from one set while you can get about the same amount of minifigs plus a bunch of other stuff from two other equally priced sets that’s why to me these battle packs are a rip off because of what they contain imho the battle packs seem to be only worth about 10 dollars	neutral
thanks for the review whitefang your additions look great i like your mace much better than the use of a small technic cog your looks much sturdier and that helmet looks really great on skellie soldiers i never thought to use that before very cool indeed peace	positive
mack on may 26 2008 0130 pm said you cannot say that the battle pack contains the same amount of stuff that the other two sets have and therefore should be priced the same it just seems that lego is ripping off canadian army builders to me if the battle pack contained a small catapult or wall so that it contained about the same amount of stuff that the other sets had it would be fair it seems stupid that you will only get minifigs from one set while you can get about the same amount of minifigs plus a bunch of other stuff from two other equally priced sets that’s why to me these battle packs are a rip off because of what they contain imho the battle packs seem to be only worth about 10 dollars mack i can understand your concern when pricing is concerned pricing is always a big issue for us to determine whether to buy or not to buy a certain set in a particular country pricing varies differently across different countries such as us europe canada australia and etc this is something very hard for us to decide on we cant be sure why tlc placed their pricing strategies this way well i think we should appericate what tlc is trying to do for us by not using price as the only factor to judge whether to buy this set or not at least i am sure there are many of us trying to request for battlepacks to muster armies for their mocs armies collection and etc different people have different judgements towards different sets and different themes i respect your opnion imo lets dont let price be the only determined factor to decide whether to purchase a particular set or not instead consider an array of factors that is offered however i do know that consumers like me and you are always affected by price iamded on may 26 2008 0140 pm said thanks for the review whitefang your additions look great i like your mace much better than the use of a small technic cog your looks much sturdier and that helmet looks really great on skellie soldiers i never thought to use that before very cool indeed iamded i am glad you enjoyed the review and my slight modifications that mace was a much looking weapon it looks much firm than the orignal look the design was inspired from dwarf mine and dwarf mine defender i would not want to have so many troll flags hanging around the nose cone helmet was to give the soliders a whole new look to me it retains the classic look yet it belongs to present theme suitable for my skeleton elite guards	negative
thanks for sharing these closeup images of this battlepack whitefang i actually had this set in my hand at legoland cal and could not decide if i wanted it im currently out of castlemode with my large indy jungle set up on the table and creating ghost train mocs that are starting to line up on the bookshelves once i buy the troll ship ill want to start collecting these great fig sets thanks again for sharing	neutral

sorry to be going a little off topic here but personally i have just bought 40 crowny battle packs for the only reason that i am running out of space to store the left over blocks about 500 of my crownies came from sets mentioned above on sale which would have been cheaper than the battle packs thanks for the review whitefang but i dont think i will be buy any skeleton battle packs that army is large enough	neutral
for those of you who buy so many of this and the other battle pack with crownies what do you do with all of them is this simply to create a largescale army or do you plan to build large castle scenes with all the figs id love to see some pictures on the share your castle army thread	neutral

vhtf very hard to find to answer some earlier replies no there are no stickers in this set while some adventurers sets of the era had stickers the 5956 zeppelin had tons all of the interesting mesoamerican designs from this set are printed also simonwillems was correct my mechanic is missing his hat which should be a black kepi theyre extremely expensive on bl though proving once again that this set has some awesome parts so i ordered a replacement from lego its in the mail and should come soon	positive
the printed pieces are the real gems of this set beyond them there isnt much to this set though the boat hull is nice the model itself isnt all that great the new akator temple is definately a superior model at least in piece count but those printed pieces are hard to resist steve	negative
i absolutly love this set this is in my opinion the best adventurers set it has it all the falling bridge the falling skeleton the spear trap and the classic trapdoor it is a musthave set thanks for providing such a nice review	positive

i just rebuilt this entire set today and the nostalgia was totally worth taking bits and pieces from a few of my own mocs only now did i realize how rare some of those pieces are and im rather thankful that i have all of the printed pieces and achu the only pieces i am missing is a transparent orange headlight 3 out of 4 black minifigure hammer light gray chainreplaced it with a dark gray chain and one whole minifigure which is the mechanic guy i still have both the instructions and the box and both are in appalling conditions kudos to the pre2000s lego sets like this one love em	positive
wow good review i used to love this old sets as i was greatly fascinated by inca and aztec cultures and the mayans technological marvels astounded me i was thrilled to death when lego released little aztec figures so of course i jsut had to buy some your narration with the sig fig was hilarious and the review was all around wonderful keep up the good work mate	positive

welcome to cardinal bricks review of 7736 its a small set but as i bought it the other day i felt that it probably did merit a short review the box is ofcourse far larger than necessary theres plenty of air inside the contence is one bag and the instruction booklet you could proably build it inside the bag if the desire took you we have one new coastguard with the slightly stubly head found in the castle range and a transclear visor the build was challanging and arduious the final product is quite nice at one 300 its a good set only 50p more than an impulse set and with enough extra parts to justify the increase in the price a good set for a little gift or so on the buggy moves well theres not that much to say really for i cant really think of additional models to build with the parts but then what do you expect for the price edited by cardinal brick 26 may 2008  0647 pm	positive
thank you very much for the review cardinal brick thats indeed a very nice little set klausdieter	positive
i recommend this lil set its a nice small set and the vehicle does roll well im sure many young builders would love it	positive

great review 5150 lego the new camera was well worth it you´ve got everything well done i´m looking forward to your next review meschepers on may 27 2008 0622 am said wow i was skeptical of this coast guard line though getting to see some detailed pictures of this set i really want to get get it same here maybe in two days i can see it in real	positive
this has gotta be the coolest chopper ever i love it its so accurate plus your review is great because it shows all the inner details	positive
nice review a must have for my city collection	positive
thank you very much for the nice review 5150 lego the helicopter is  apart from that it is very very big and that it does not include any interior  a very nice set  the most i like the life raft becuase it is simply  nevertheless i dont know if i buy it probably not  but its very nice two questions  where can you fasten the stretcher on to haul it up and down is the motor working with batteries klausdieter edited by klausdieter 28 may 2008  0919 pm	neutral
great review 5150 although you might want to resize your pictures before posting them so they dont take forever to load quote wow i was skeptical of this coast guard line i was actually the complete opposite ever since i saw the first pictures i fell in love with the whole line the helicopter looks to be one of the two best in the line right up with the 4wd and jetski great job tlc and i do hope you have something equally as great planned for next year	neutral
great review i will get this but i will wait for a sale edited by vbbn 28 may 2008  1054 pm	positive
thank you for that fine review of a really excellent set 5150 lego i never saw a little juniorization done that good before	positive
nice review the helicopter reminds a sikorsky chopperisnt it	positive
all stickers im afraid though imnot a fan of stickers myself some sets like ferrari for example take longer to put on than building the actual set this one is not as sticker heavy as it seams though and the ones that areon there really give the set that extra touch printed would have been preffered of course but in this case i didnt mind it	negative
5150 lego on may 29 2008 0712 am said thanks everyone for the nice coments its nice to finaly have a camera that can take some decent photos makes doing reviews much more enjoyable there is no real way to lift up the stretcher due to the crane arm being in the way there really isnt any room for any kind oflifting straps the set does include a 1x2 plate with a hinge for the diver to stand on so at least he can hold on to someone the crane lifts them up and then he can put them in the strechter thats my guess at least as far as the motor i dont believe it uses bateries since you pull out the motor and all the button does is recoil the winch line back in i have to say it does a very good job of that and is very smooth as long as you dont have anything to heavy one detail i forgot to meation is the shark its nothing new just the basic shark lego has had around for nealy 2 decades but it was a detail nothing less thank you very much for that information 5150 lego	neutral
this is a very good review thank you but i have some questions about the grey new parts in the life raft are they 1x1 like their counterparts with the clips or 1x2 and can they be held by a minifig by the handle if so these could be very useful for brickbuild weapons  tools also im looking forward to some orange eta 2 jedi interceptor mocs now who wants to be the first to make one btw which jedi has an orange eta 2	positive

im rather fond of helicopters and have built many different types this doesnt really remind me of any particular model other than perhaps an eh 101 merlin and even that resemblance is very superficial just for the record this is a sikorsky sea king and this is a sikorsky mh53 a derivation of the ch53 the only resemblance i see with the former is the colour scheme and with the latter the fact that its got a fat rearend sponsons and six blades it doesnt matter though because i really like it the colour scheme is great the shape is nice its got quite a bit of detail and i just have to get my hands on the cockpit window and those new rotor blades when i first saw the large aircraft pieces a few years ago i figured they were very much singleuse parts but the tail end doesnt look too bad pretty clever i like the raft too it really does look like the real deal that the helicopter cant lift it really isnt an issue because in real life they wouldnt lift the raft either theyd use the rescue hoist to lift the occupants of the raft into the helicopter one by one or perhaps in pairs imagine a storm with a helicopter hovering over tall waves with a big fat raft strung from a cable underneath it the raft would catch a lot of wind and flop around quite a bit causing it to loose all its occupants and also yanking the helicopter around possibly causing the pilot to loose control and crash bad idea cheers ralph edited by ralphs 30 may 2008  1109 pm	negative

great looking set loved the review pictures were good sometimes blury but i think i will pick this up after i get the rest of the kotcs sets riddler a tip i learned in photoclass is to take a breath in and hold it while pushing the shutter so you dont accidentally move while breathing i thought it was silly but it does work again great review looking forward to more	positive

the stickers ruin the tumbler but the truck is very good if it was cheaper id get it	negative
looks like a nice set thanks for the review i cant get over how enormous the tumbler is they should have made it smaller the price too i fthey did that and threw in a dark knight joker and henchman i would totally buy it enjoy your new set darthperson	neutral

nice review m8 shame that most of the pictures are blurry but nonetheless just wanted to say that out of all my lego sets this one 7888 is the best the tumbler is so cool once it is put together those four huge wheels at the back make it quite unique if you do not have this set i highly recomend it edited by 4olic 30 august 2009  0259 pm	positive
orion123 on aug 29 2009 1217 am said please dont reply to year old topics it will get the admins annoyed and thats not good i see that your new though so welcome to eurobricks but i recommend not doing it again reviving old topic is fine if the member has something valid or constructive to add into the discussion that has not expired in any forms in this case he is commenting on the review and adding his views into it such actions doesnt really get the staff annoyed on the other hand please take a look at this topic for better explaination thanks whitefang	neutral
thank you for clearing that up i felt that it was ok to review an old topic as stated rather than just go ahead and start a new one a shame that this set as all other batman sets have gone up so highly in value but still all things considering general after market lego price hikes it is still a wonderfull set even with its market value today that is if you can ignore the mrsp	positive
i too thought the jokers van was the pleasant surprise of this set the tumbler looks good yes until you see it in person its grossly oversized they should have made it closer to a regular car size like the movie because this one is a monster	neutral
i bought this off ebay while not having been collecting space as a child it was mainly wild west and city i have decided upon reading kdogs mtron bar brawl mania strip in his space comic to buy as many mtron sets and figures i could find except i got distracted and bought some different sets as well to start off with heres a picture of the box heres a general shot showing the entire set a front view the buggy another shot of the buggy without the minifig the flyer the flyer without the minifig mtron crate with some equipment and hoses i dont know the use of the hoses though  the cockpit open the cockpit closed with the crew the magnetic crane another shot of the crane rear view with hatch open one of the side slots that can carry either the buggy or the flyer top view of this excellent vehicle excellent for getting spyrius or blacktron out of your way  final shot excellent set one of the biggest space ground vehicles and one of the best sets made by lego undoubtably better than its newer counterpart the mt101 armored drilling unit a great addition to any collection and has a lot of cool neat features that make it have a lot of playability simply excellent five out of five	positive
great review of a great set i always figured the hoses were welding torches attached to jetpacks yeah as the whole thing had the vibe of a mobile repair center much like many of my favorite sets this one has a base of simple bricks and plates and then from that solid foundation the rest is built out to be decorative or have the action features this gives sets a very solid feel as demonstrated in this set the first snowspeeder and galaxy explorer the mm armored drilling unit has a more technic base giving it a less solid appearance and though i like the set that jet that luanches from the back is horrible partially because of the useless orange containment things the mega core has a nifty crane instead of a big useless jet tohst	positive
sinner on may 28 2008 0235 pm said care to explain why the mcm has a pure weight of parts that i find hard to quantify but love it is just so dense when you build it full of nice surprises no technique required and a wonderful stearing mechanism that i rank as more important than the suspension of the mars version this thing was meant to crush anyway who needs suspension i also like the way you never felt that the mtrons deserved a base after building this it was that good the colour scheme was perfect its space and i like it enough said great review btw god bless nathan naturally youre entitled to your inferior opinion	positive
norro on may 29 2008 0130 am said its space and i like it enough said indeed norro standing up for a space set	neutral

fun review thanks kinda sad to think that with tlcs recent ban on magnets in their products well never see an mtron revival 	neutral
i love the design of the front canopy of this set but i always felt that they could have done more with the rest of the model this set is good candidate for customization though there is quite a bit on unused space inside especially in the middle section i want to try putting a technicstyle engine into mine at some point along with the necessary gearing i got my mcm brand new off ebay some years ago for a pretty good price but the box was very worn out and the big transneon panel which floats freely inside the box was a bit damaged as for the hosejetpack things i always assumed that they were either welding torches or flamethrowers take your pick quote kinda sad to think that with tlcs recent ban on magnets in their products first time ive heard of that what are they going to do for the train couplings	neutral
cp5670 on may 28 2008 0852 pm said first time ive heard of that what are they going to do for the train couplings new couplings are going to be available soon there is a thread with pictures of the new couplings here	neutral
joebot on may 28 2008 0731 pm said kinda sad to think that with tlcs recent ban on magnets in their products since when is that the new train couplings have magnets only with a special casing anyways mtron is one of the greatest space factions with mega core magnetiser as my favourite set of these guys even though i do not own it  the only thing that bothers me is the lack of reachable controls for the minifigs to drive their vehicles but iirc it is the same with a lot of other spacesets as well	positive
fluyt on may 28 2008 0156 pm said since when is that the new train couplings have magnets only with a special casing youre right i should have clarified  its the old loose magnets that apparently are being discontinued not all magnets altogether as you noted the new train couplings still have magnets but they appear to be permanently attached to a fairly large housing which i guess will prevent kids from eating them but the old mtron round magnet pieces are presumably discontinued	neutral
thanks for the review maybe i can pick one off ebay	neutral
it looks like youre right about the old magnets i got a few off pab two months ago but they no longer have them i guess i should grab some while theyre still widely available on bricklink as they can be useful in a number of situations on a side note one interesting thing about this set is that it seemingly had two uscanada names mega core magnetizer and multi core magnetizer brickset lugnet and all the other sites ive seen call it mega but i have some north american catalogs from that time period that call it multi and the box also says multi on it i actually didnt know the mega name at all until many years after the mtron line	neutral
this does look alot better than the new mm drilling tank great work	positive
inertia on may 29 2008 0844 am said i just thought that the mt101 was very skeletal and couldnt really steer that well although i do like it also the mcm has a better design in my view as the wheels are closer together making it look a lot more tankish than the mt101 also space in the rear isnt wasted on having a shuttle thanks for an answer ill shut up now so we can focus on your review	neutral

thanks for that fine review of a really classic and impressive mtron set inertia tohst on may 28 2008 0455 pm said the mm armored drilling unit has a more technic base giving it a less solid appearance  yeah it´s pretty sad some of these new sets just look very cool at the outside but appear to be hollow and blank at the inside especially with the annoying use of studless technic beams to mod these sets often means to change the whole inner frame leaving us with a bunch of imho not really very useful parts it´s not a very honorable marketing strategy to produce set designs that´re aimed to look impressive and cool on the box art but´re pretty useless in their inner structures of course i don´t want to offend some technic lovers and although i always was more the system kind of guy why can´t they just use some technic beams with studs at least i grew up with just imagine with pictures of alternative models on the box and i don´t think it´s that easy especially for younger kids to mod some of these terrific blownup sets like it once was with sets like this one here implosion off	positive
asuka on may 30 2008 0217 am said of course i don´t want to offend some technic lovers and although i always was more the system kind of guy why can´t they just use some technic beams with studs at least thats because of cost the older beams needed a four sided mold and the newer ones need only a two lego do seem to be using both types more as of late though asuka on may 30 2008 0217 am said i grew up with just imagine with pictures of alternative models on the box and i don´t think it´s that easy especially for younger kids to mod some of these terrific blownup sets like it once was with sets like this one here implosion off ive never heard an official word perhaps i should raise a topic but i think that they dont show them any more because it became a support nightmare what do i mean i bet tlg was tired of letters and calls saying timmy cant make this model shown on the box can you send instructions and the extra parts i know that for some recent models they were designed but not published how do i know this the creator said so	neutral

this super set contains many of the city sets you can get for your mini city hospital the smallest set is the 7902 car with a doctor i thought it looked a bit too slow here is a car you can build with the same bricks the instruction manual for the ambulance does contain a picture of an alternate model but it is actually quite hard to build something significantly different this sets lacks some snotbricks so i had to be a little more creative and came up with this ambulance it is more a hearse than an ambulance the helicopter has a lot of slopes so i built a speed boat for those special emergencies unlike the first two sets i used far from all the bricks in this this set does really have some great parts the brickshelf gallery with some more pictures is anyone up to the challenge and build some alternate models of the last set in the super pack  the hospital	positive

harley  mistah j i want to preface my review by admitting that i’m an unrepentant harley quinn fanboy i’ve been enamored with the character since she first appeared in batman the animated series back in the 90’s and i’ve since followed her misadventures through her introduction into the regular batman series during no man’s land into her own series and even on the shortlived and notsogood birds of prey tv show so please excuse any proharley bias so down to business the 267 piece set retails for 30 us 35 at toys r us and builds up very fast and easy it consists of batman’s bat cycle harley’s hammer truck and brand new batman and harley quinn minifigs there is also no lack of weapons in addition to the usual bag of bataccessories and guns the set also comes with a pair of gray revolvers batman in this set has the new “armor” torso print and the hips are the same color as the legs hinting that this is supposed to represent the movie style batsuits more so then the traditional comic book “underwear over tights” look harley quinn is a very cool looking minifig and i haven’t grinned so much at a new batman character figure since my first batman minifig a couple years ago the figure is very true to the character and the torso has been accented with a few shape lines to try and distinguish her as a female despite the boxy body harley’s jester cap is an interesting new piece it seems to me at least to be made of a slightly different grade of plastic then we’re used to it’s molded in red and painted with black and white and it comes packed in its own separate little baggie i expect that this piece may have cost lego a little more then usual to produce harley also has a buildable accessory a giant mallet sure she can’t stand up all that well unless it’s held in specific ways but it’s neat and most importantly it’s funny it’s especially fun for smacking the everloving crap out of other minifigs with the bat cycle is in bag number one and is a very fast build this isn’t some little japanese sport bike like nightwing’s cycle this monster is almost a car and seems to pack just the right amount of intimidation for the caped crusader to exploit thanks to the thick tires two in front one in back it stands up just fine on its own and rolls very well the huge exhaust pipes are a nice touch and give the thing a look of engine power the only real flaw is the inclusion of the flickfire missiles mounted on the sides but as with any lego model they can be easily left out without hurting the look of the vehicle the hammer truck is the bulk of this set and a lot more fun then it looks of the monster truck persuasion the vehicle is designed and built with a surprising level of solidity the axle mounts are particularly impressive the big wheels and tires just beg you to drive this thing right over the bat cycle or batman the megamallet gimmick is also a surprise not so much for its technical complexity there isn’t any really but for the fact that once you start turning the knob at the rear to swing the mallet back and forth it’s really a lot of fun there are some low points to the truck design again the flickfire missiles are tacked on and there’s a cargo cratebed set into the back for harley’s loot of jewels the crate would have looked a lot better molded in black in brown it breaks up the look of the truck a little speaking of which the look of the truck is very pleasing the red and black harley quinn color scheme works really well on the vehicle there are a few stickers here and unfortunately the diamond patterned ones are applied over multiple bricks the rest however are great not only does she have an “i love joker” bumper sticker but she has a joker playing card taped to her dash i guess serving as a picture of her beloved puddin’ there is also a sticker for activation of the hammer which boldly shouts hit me this is a fun set a neat new batman vehicle and a big truck with lots of playability the harley minifig is a musthave for any batfan and if you only get one of the batman sets this year i’d recommend this one the price versus piececount on this set is a little bit of a deterrent though this might not be the best set for collectors on a budget or people looking for something completely new and innovative but anyone buying this for a child can rest assured that the kid will get your money’s worth out of the set through its play value when added together and averaged out the pros and cons of this set combine to give it a score of out of 5 even if harley herself is a clean 6 out of 5	positive

the 08 batman sets look like a step up from the somewhat lackluster 07 sets this looks like a very fun set with a whimsical sense of style very fitting with harley quinns character the price isnt great but i guess you gotta pay for that batman logo on the downside  i am so over the good buy vehicle vs bad guy vehicle concept i really wish tlc would get over this you see it throughout the product line  batman castle mission to mars etc	neutral

hi all so i was at the walmart yesterday and had the munchies and was looking for something to eat somewhere along the line i stopped caring about food and decided to browse the toy department to see what they had legowise usually they have jack squat but on this particular day they had a lot of new sets i impulsively picked this set up along with harley quinns hammer truck and the new little campsite from the indy 4 line i must say when i first saw images of this set i wasnt exactly thrilled or anything i mean i didnt really see anything particularly special about it but after purchasing it i must admit that i would consider it a must buy for any lego fan but enough babbling about myself onward with the review my first of an official set in this picture you can see everything you get with the set i thought the boxart was pretty nice looking the manual on the other hand took somewhat of a beating within the box a common problem with most more recent sets i do have to say that i wish they would at least make some effort in fixing this they could just make a little thin cardboard folder to minimize bending and tears for batman minifig collectors the highlight of this set are the robin and penguin figs previously you could only get them in the pricey batcave set but this set provides a much cheaper alternative one thing you will notice however is that robins hairpiece is a new mold as it is actually a black version of mutts hair from the indy 4 line personally i think it actually looks better than the hairpiece used on the older version of robin as the batcave had before it this set comes with some bricks to make two cute but deadly penguins they help add more charm to an already charming set when youre finished building youll end up with a nice little assortment of extra parts 1 black cheese slope 3 1x1 tile black yellow and white a revolver a technic pin and a 1x1 red round plate heres robins scuba jet its nice and sleek looking notable parts of interest would probably be the green turbine engines my only complaint on this one would have to be the use of decals on the 2x2 round yellow tiles for that type of a part printing seems as though it would have been the best way to go now for in my opinion the best part of the setthe penguins sub this set has more decals than robins scuba jet but they seem more necessary in this case i actually wanted to put the decals on the sub as i think the it looks great with them obviously it looks like a penguin but wow does it ever do it with style it has a lot of interactive features the first of which i will mention being the periscope which raises up and down and for the collectors of parts in new colors it has a few parts in medium orange such as 2x2 tile heres a shot of the bottom of the sub another nifty little feature is how you can lift the top off and fit the penguin inside and there is enough room inside so that you can firmly place top on again and without interference to the movement of the periscope another little feature is the rear springloaded missile you just tilt the small lever toward the front of the sub and it fires and the last small feature are the flickmissiles on each side overall this is a great set with a lot to offer for a decent price a lot of fans might view the only drawback to it as being the use of decals but if you plan on keeping the kit together they make it look really fantastic buy it if you can matt edited by imperialshadows 01 june 2008  1142 am	positive

yay another technic shooter whew i need a spare one in case the 14348 other ones that i have all happen to break seriously do lego set designers get some sort of bonus for incorporating catapults technic shooters and  or flickfire missiles anyway thanks for the review looks like a cute set	positive
thanks for the review i love this set i didnt think it was much at first either but i really love it another cheaper robin and penguin is great and those nifty mini penguins are awesome the spare pieces are even nice i love robins little scuba jet those green engines are very nice and i love it compactness penguins sub is even better at first i was annoyed at getting two subs but now i realise it means i can have a fleet of them ill be sure to mod over those cannons though but the details are very slick thanks again batbrick away	positive
thanks  why isnt this set on sh who wants the second riddle	neutral
thanks for the great review brickadier general the sub looks very nice and i like the idea of a raising periscope did the batcave sub have that feature and the details on the sub look very nice the inclusion of the penguin robin and two of those great brickbuilt penguins really confirms that ill be getting this considering that i didnt purchase the batcave however i am rather dissapointed that this set is so similar to the vehicles of penguin and robinin repectively in the batcave set i feel that it only really caters to those who havnt bought the set and i wouldve much appreciated different vehicles overall a very nice set perhaps the best of the 2008 wave despite its lack of originality thank you very much for the review bg	positive

a fight can the agents stop the evil dr disco inferno fleeing will spy clops laser gun burn through the door in time or will dr inferno simply use the lovely agent traces enormous ponytail as an escape ladder to freedom more importantly will there be a riot in the streets of lego city as afols go apopletic at the thought of a 12 wide truck roaring through their ordered town layouts stay tuned part 1 the box instructions parts as the largest of the agents sets so far the box is easily the biggest trainee agents examine the following three pics and see if you notice anything odd box front box back box middle spot it thats right the printed cardboard which has supposed to be the bottom half of the fold out middle section is on the back slicing the ultralarge set image which would form the foldout in half  the way the cardboard is printed as one piece before its folded i think this would be very hard to do accidentally so suspect a major stuffup somewhere along the production line i bought this set off bricklink so would be very interested if anyone in the states who has seen these boxes actually on the shelves can tell me if this is common or rare basically i want to know if i should be annoyed that the bricklink seller didnt list this in the set description or are they all like this the instructions come in 4 booklets the parts list comes in at 5 pages which is a lot even at halfsize pages  large images of the parts inventory are in this folderwhen moderated for anyone interested heres also some cute agentstype artwork at the end of one of the books instructions show piece callouts and are divided into sections according to numbered bags as youd expect for a set with 1100 parts this baby comes with a lot of bags its a treasure trove of dark blue as well as the obvious large slopes and wall panels which make up the body and the roof there is a wealth of smaller navy blue pieces as well  small 1x1 bricks 2x2 bricks 1x1 plates 2x2 tiles heaps of 2x plates some slopes 22x cheese pieces basically anyone wanting a lot of dark blue should think about this set the roof panels alone for example could provide a dark blue sea for a modernised pirate moc 2 dsss dreaded sticker sheets quelle surprise  stickers the grey parts of the stickers here are metallic silver ink which is a nice touch actually as sticker sheets go theyre not too bad fairly subtle for the most part and the navy blue actually matches the bricks themselves however after looking at the sticker sheets i thought i was missing something what about the pieces used for the projection screens showing dr inferno and the sharks  why werent they on the sticker sheets there must be another one frantically i checked and rechecked the box and flipped through all the instruction manuals to find the elusive 3rd sheet where was it ten minutes later i noticed something which had honestly never occured to me  there were actual printed pieces in this set so obvious and yet so unthinkable its horrifying how years and years of exoforce and speed racer set releases can mentally condition peoples thought processes tut tut lego what have you reduced us to here they are folks  actual printed pieces yes i do believe this news deserves the caps i also noticed this nifty modification of the usual 2x3 cupboard  you can now fit drawers in it very clever this may have been around in belville sets for years for all i know but its new to me the drawers slide in and out very well and the top one sits on slight indentations in the middle of the cupboard part 2 the figs our trusty agents  charge chase trace and fuse high powered agents dont have time for names of more than one syllable  thats why the bad guys always lose  chase and fuse have the mutt hair in black and dark orange the lovely agent trace has an exquisite new hairpiece in dark brown perfect for rapunzel themed mocs as you can see her ponytail is loooong makes it hard to sit down the poor girl i feel sorry for all these female figs with such intricate hairstyles that they can never relax in an ordinary lego chair however at least she has two breasts unlike the recent harley quinn fig compensation indeed seriously though its great that theres a separate torso print for the female character and this attention to detail is typical of the set as a whole three of the agents have reversable heads  nice touch with the headsets and i like the id cards on their pants obviously the agents security system is based on some kind of crotch measuring device this would make sense considering the conspicuous bulges in the pants of dr infernos men see the other agents set reviews the villains  spy clops dr inferno gold tooth dr infernos hair in all its glory this is a great piece although the orange colouring is a little rough on the front its so 3d it deserves a back and side view and indeed eb thread all of its own as mentioned elsewhere this is different plastic to the normal minifig hair but it doesnt quite feel as soft as the exoforce hair it doesnt fall off as much anyway the figs get 1010 from me awesome hairpieces in great colours for the agents and a sleek navy blue neon green uniform the villains faces are great and they are all very distinctive the attention to detail is outstanding and its great to see a lego inhouse theme with characters as memorable and cool as figs from the licensed themes  part 3 the build the build is divided into three stages  the small vehicles the front of the truck and the massive command center section a small vehicles first up all the small vehicles we have a small flyer 2 buggies jet ski and a speed boat  all in glorious navy blue with little bits of silver detailing top view these vehicles are all simple small and welldesigned probably the weakest is the flyer only because the cockpit looks a little large in fact the small flyer is probably the weakest element of 8365 overall which tells you how good the set itself is in various threads here this set has been heavily criticised for being way out of proportion theres a reason for that as we shall come to however the existence of these small sets should appease some people with the new coast guard sets for example all of these save the flyer wouldnt look out of place on a city beach with a little modding heres an example  agents beach party spongebob couldnt help but crash the villains only have one small vehicle but theyve been wellserved in the smaller sets and this one is a unique and clever design i love the triangular shape and the simple but clever technique of making the arch slopes meet up around the propellers its sort of insectile in black and orange and looks very different from the usual assortment of helicopters etc b truck front this thing is a beast seriously look at it its chunky and mean looking you dont want to mess with this baby the build is really nice like a lot of star wars vehicles its all based on technic beams pinned together unlike a lot of mars mission sets underneath isnt all technic beams with some plates slapped on like a facade the majority is a lot of plates and bricks which all fit together solidly you can see from the detailing of cheese grater slopes and silver pieces on the front how effort has been made to give this vehicle a distinct feel different to other lego sets sure the silver slope mirrors might be a bit too much for some but this baby is all about attitude you can imagine it roaring down the road en route to dr infernos diabolical lair after all these sets are agents sets  nobody said they were secret agents c  command center  whole assembly heres a view of the whole thing assembled  inside and cool details to follow at the end its kind of hard to show here as it is extreeeeemely long this is indeed a big set the build for the trailer part of the command center is fun and very satisfying yes there are large pieces but there is also a huge amount of detail it is also solid as a rock i remember being annoyed building the big ferrari truck a few years ago  everytime you looked at it an 8 x 16 plate fell off the mobile command center is solid  even with the hinged roof and special features it is not delicate at all kudos to the designers again as it is mainly a brick build rather than a technic one i also like how the command center part connects to the cabin  its not a special piece at all just a technic axle going through two circle plates but it works and its solid please note ive been selective about which stickers ive applied during the build top view the rear heres an example of why i like the build a the designers have enough sense to put a ladder so a minifig can climb up to the interior when the command center is open b notice that although the ladder clips at the top there is an extra clip there in the middle purely to hold it in place so it doesnt flap around and holds firm i dont know if most designers would even think to put a ladder there let alone go the extra mile and put a mechanism to hold it in place pure class oh and notice the greebly detail stuff to the right there too the other side this is probably the other weak part of the build  the bricky gaps at the top where the hinge to open the roof sits its a little gappy but the set is so big you dont really notice d and now for the fun stuff  inside and neat details ok so weve built the thing its big its blue the top of the trailer itself would make a good warehouse moc for a harbour layout but what about inside is it any good what about all those small vehicles from the start of the review where do they go well im glad you asked because the solution is superb the small flyer folds slightly and slides into place here lift off the roof and youre away the large buggy and the speedboat go under here the jetski slides out of the rear here attached to its own little platform and the small buggy goes inside the main cabin theres even a crane so you can lift it down so now we know why this set is so large to fit everything in its amazing that this functionality doesnt affect the aesthetics of the set as a whole but we still havent finished on the details the front section has a very easytoswingopen roof section and missiles theres also a command section underneath the bit where the flyer lifts out and now for the interior i have to say i really like this space not only is it packed with great stuff theres also enough room for minifigs to move around i hate bases where the figs only have about 2 studs to actually stand and walk aquabase invasion is a nice set for example but the actual functional space inside the base is teensy claustrophobia you know within a week theyd be fighting to toss each other out of the airlock no such problems for these suave agents who have plenty of legroom and the ability to launch missiles from their ceiling the whole of the interior zooming in moving from left to right first off the medicine cabinet looks like someones been leaving secret mission dossiers lying around the projector area for mission briefings dr inferno recently changed his hair colour from purple to orange it seems why are all these minifigs so obsessed with their hair the projector folds down when the trailer is open push the button and the light glows on now dr infernos hair is orange again this is one of my favourite parts of the set it works a charm the batteries for these lightbricks can also be replaced  instructions are in the manual agent charge considers sharkfin soup for dinner did i mention these projection panels are printed the detail is very fine too the tool section laptops sit in the middle compartment you get some flippers yellow scuba tank and various implements im so impressed that the helmet is pearl silver with a different coloured visor too  theres so much variation in the parts in this set you dont get the sense the designers are using the same thing over and over to save money it all feels luxe and topoftheline just like the command center itself two laptops  yay the aforementioned rooftop missiles the dr inferno cage nasty electric shocks bzzt you can see my reviewing skills are burning out now  sentences truncated another example of detail  nowhere else in the set is a 1x1 transgreen tile used  they could have used a 1x1 trans green cheese wedge piece as there are others in the set but they didnt how does dr i get out flick that lever on the right hand exterior and the door pops open spy clops the loyal minion awaits his master on the other side and there we have it take a bow guys theres a lot of spare parts a suspicious amount of dark blue small slopes but i checked the instructions and didnt see anything missing i have to say i do like the new policy since speed racer i think of including these small slopes as extras part 4 overall rating if youve made it this far youve got more stamina than dr infernos army of cyborg animals themselves as i said earlier this set has drawn criticism for the size of the truck however large vehicles do exist  i grew up in a wheat farming area and as a kid the size of the lorries that thundered past carrying grain was probably intimidating to me as this monstrous espionage machine is to the good citizens of lego city on top of that it does contain a plethora of 4wide vehicles inside  criticism of this set on the basis of size to me also seems misguided as this is basically a playset  and it is a very good one to boot as you can probably tell i love it to pieces and wouldnt hesitate to recommend it to anyone whether for parts or for play value check out the parts list in this folderwhen moderated and you can see just how many excellent pieces it contains a lightup brick a flood of navy blue metallic silver bricks  were spoiled 8635 is also an enjoyable build with fantastic figs and topoftheline detailing in a year when ive found city a bit disappointing after the run of great sets in 20062007 the agents line has been one of the surprise hits for me and i cant wait to see what the designers come up with next edited by sveltecorps 02 june 2008  1246 am	positive
i see youve also learnt to call dibs looking forward to seeing your review edit oh i see i just arrived early a truely fantastic review you make me not want to pass this set up even though i cant possibly afford it without leaving my beloved castle collecting it really looks like a fun set so many neat vehicles and two laptops i cant wait to see what other sets well see them in thanks again great job peace edited by iamded 31 may 2008  0956 am	positive

man tohse mini vehicles and minifigs are sexy as all heck i love drinferno and the female pattern for agent trace is it just me or she almost busting out  i love the dr inferno hair and the reappearance of spyclops and gold tooth is simply gold yes yes pun intended i have to say this is shaping up to be one of my favourite sets well ever batbrick away	positive
me want this set	positive
you know i like many had doubts about these sets when they were first mentioned but ive decided i want the whole line now this set is the créme de la créme just beautifully stunning that is a great review sveltecorps you have gone into fantastic detail and description of all the elements really it is this review that has persuaded me to buy this set i blame you the minifigs are great the vehicles are better and the truck and interior is awesome the few minor draw backs are far outweighed by the attention to detail and the many unique and cool elements used in this set and printed pieces that is even better great job you have obviously put a tremendous effort in making this review and i for one definitely appreciate it i am looking forward to these sets being available in new zealand	positive
wow great review of what seems to be a great set i love that ponytail this looks to be a must have set it probably wont stay together for long though thanks very much i fixed the header for you thats two you owe me the other is for making me think that this set was in australia 	positive
omg thank you thank you thank you you made my day so that means dr infernos hair isnt rubber but one question is it like that weird funny soft plastic like the ants from indy 4 please answer	positive
wow this set looks so amazing amazing genius davinci art i say youve done an excellent job reviewing and really this is the review ive been waiting for so cool so classy i love the mission briefing feature to think that lego could go so high as to put something ingenious like that in there too bad lego figures dont have fingers to make shadow shows eh genius the jet lauching feature is pretty slick and they even put a control center in there too thats beast loving that the bottomi dont see how that big buggy can get out or in there but awesome too the back of the truck could use more detailing i think but the jail popopen feature is pretty cool as is the speed boat storage rack cabin its great that roof opening feature is a great part of this set also i think you can have multiple figures up theremaybe you can mod it to put a bed in there it certainly looks big enough inferno plane wow that think is smooth baby i love how the wings contain rotors inside of them thats awesome detail right there that is a sweet ship thingy so slick the rest of the command center is pretty awesome too we get a 4x4 wheeler and a crane and lots of room wow just wow great review great set you are well worthy of your custom title im gonna go buy this for only 90 woot	positive
great review thanks thats one hell of a set i think lego has reached a certain kind of peak with the design cleverness and fun of this one im so relieved that agents seems to be shaping up to be even better then i thought it was going to beand i thought it was going to be cool to begin with agent charge not only does he look like dash justice but he has the name of one of dashs alpha team squadmates i call shenanigans	positive
woah i got to have this set i shall buy it asap thanks for the review expertly done	positive
splendid review i love everything on this set no question bout it somehow i knew i should have saved up and buy that when come to trubut the sight of turbocar chase and jetpack pursuit was to tempting to pass up	positive
wonderful review  one of the best ive ever seen on this site man we thought this might be the weakest set in the line but it turns out it may be the strongest everything about this set  from the color scheme to all the details to the minifigures to the piece selection  is just wonderful i think this set has finally confirmed it agents is everything alpha team wasnt and is how they should have done a spy theme from the start kudos to tlc for finally getting it right  and i sure hope theres a second year	positive
wow excellent review thanks that set sure looks fantastic its incredible how much features theyve managed to pack in while keeping it roomy im really impressed by the quality of the design tlc is sure getting back on track with great design ow 2008 is going to be expensive	positive
wowi cant believe i thought this line was falseoh crapsweet i need to get this	positive
7645  mt61 crystal reaper piece count 600 price aud7995 4995 euros in most countries 3999 gbp usd 4999 its happened in the wider world and it had to happen to lego  yes the 80s are back space invaders holograms compulsory seatbelt wearing legislation and the return of classic space ok we dont have a fully fledged classic space theme back yet but if 7645 is the way of the future i think lego is ready to do it properly i wasnt a huge fan of last years mars mission sets and only picked up a few on clearance but this set is light years excuse the pun ahead of 2007s offerings this mining vehicle is solid compact and welldesigned it looks impressive and even better it has fantastic power functions operability behold 7645  mt61 crystal reaper ps i wasnt joking about the holograms or seat belts part 1 box instructions dsss dreaded sticker sheets parts front of box back of box 2 x instruction booklets dss numero uno  for the reaper dss number two  apologies for the blurry pic but i wanted to capture the sweet shimmy of the metallic holographic background on this sheet the way it catches the light really makes a difference to the small alien craft and makes it look much more interesting from the plain stickers of last year theres heaps of spare silvery stuff once the stickers are applied for those who use the leftover sticker material for customising parts bags  4 numbered with one extra with larger pieces parts everywhere  woo i know the lego instruction books scold me if i mix bags but im a devilmaycare kind of guy in your face tlc i love mixing all the parts together before i build it reminds me of my youth when the days were long anything was possible and i didnt need strict instructions not to build on grass or poke my eye out with a technic shooter interesting parts  these may or may not be new my technic knowledge is not that detailed the little scoop parts are so cute and have a heap of potential uses i love em theyre like smurf hats at miniland scale these technic wheel things in orange are also cute they kind of remind me of marigolds giant fabuland marigolds the track pieces  you get 70 of these  heres the section of track for one side  as you can see its about 52 studs long these hold together better than the small ones on the hailfire droid jungle cutter part 2 minifigs small mining transport alien ship i have to confess  i forgot to take an individual snap of the astronauts  its the usual bunch though  scaredy face guy sunglasses in space man and a third one i cant remember you dont really care though youre only interested in the alien commander and his matching arms legs combo deal as brickbitz noted in his review of the smaller set the glowy eye is just a 1x1 cylinder the set also comes with 2 normal jellies  one pictured here for size youll see what happened to the other one soon enough the alien craft is nothing exciting apart from the gorgeous glinting stickers heres the road safety angle the commander actually clips onto a 1x2 plate with handle so he cant fall out then the lime tentacle thing descends on top of him to keep him firmly there like a baby seat not very brave for an alien commander is he i mean did darth vader ever use a seatbelt tssk with cradle up this part of the build also includes the small astronaut mining buggy  small and effective please note in this build ive applied stickers to everything bar cockpit pieces this comes with radio and saw piece part 3 the reaper the first part of the build is the detachable shuttle i really like the retro aesthetic of this with the angled wings and the side hoverpod things it is much better than the comparable vehicle from 7699 the new flickfire piece is a waste of space  its fairly limp i prefer the simple flickfire technic pin to be honest theres also a very nice little side workshop as you can see i really like how the control unit is plugged into the wall via 5 1x1 round plates third pic its a bit dark great detail the technic pins on the back are there to connect the power functions battery box its odd theyre included at this stage of the instructions  maybe the intention was to release it originally with all the necessary motors etc but the price point was too high and they scaled it back the base the shuttle sits on that bley technic axle in the middle when the reaper is fully assembled the little vehicle scoots down the ramp at the rear which folds up to hold it in place when the reaper is in motion you can see theres a crystal container here as well  another nice small detail which i found the 2007 sets lacked theres also an alien here  thankfully not in those horrendous transorange tubes so prevalent last year the complete assembly isnt it snug its just the right size too  not massive but large enough to be a serious mining vehicle the ominous black treads contrast nicely with the white orange colour scheme of the vehicle itself the trans detailing  blue for weapons neon green for energy  is carried nicely through the whole set the blades and the scoops whirl nicely as the machine trundles along top down view tread detail whirling blades of death the buggy descends probably the most disturbing aspect of the whole set is this pic the jelly has an orange pump plugged into its heart which is connected to an energy supply on the left hand side this vehicle runs on alien jelly juice either that or its milking the jelly in some equally disturbing fashion how amoral is that i know theres been debate about this  the jellys arent innocent theyre evil energy crystal thieving maniacs etc  but i find it a bit odd that the humans respond by chaining the jelly up to the bowels of their mining vehcile and suck energy from its heart people debate about violence in lego as represented by realistic minifig weapons but i think the moral lesson here is even worse  its ok to exploit foreign life forms for our own gain if they treat us badly first whofans i think the ood should have a word with the jelly commander  that aside this set is welldesigned and fairly good value at aud7995 its definitely a notch above last years mars mission sets overall with improved detailing and more useful functions the holostickers are fab and its nice to have an alien commander even if he is a bit bulky and his fingers are identical to his toes however if all these reasons by themselves werent reason to recomend this set the following is part 4 power functions the best part of this set  and the reason i bought it really  is the integration of power functions bizarrely this isnt mentioned at all on the box and i only found out about it from the instructions when they were posted on eurobricks instructions for book 2 which has the power function stuff available here this is a great idea and hopefully we will see more new sets take this kind of approach especially with the new train sets luckily i got monster dino 4958 on sale for half price earlier this year so already had most of the necessary motors etc  the only one needed was an extra small one what you need is listed in the instructions below with redirections to shop  home to buy the motors note theres actually a mistake on this page the 2 small motors you need are both 8883 not 8882 which is the large xl motor way to confuse the kids there lego attaching them was a dream and only took a few minutes in contrast to 4958 where it was almost impossible to remove motor elements without dismantling the model basically the back platform and some plates and orange slopes come off you attach the motors and then the smaller plates go back on these parts are now left loose overall the look of the reaper isnt badly effected as youre mainly viewing from the front anyway sadly i cant show you how it moves youll just have to trust me that it does  the way it is steered is demonsrated in the instruction pages above basically each motor is controlled by a corresponding switch on the remote move them both forward to move forward move one right to turn right move both back to move back etc it zips along its a speedy little thing personally i wouldnt want to be in its path as it comes roaring down the martian canyon my cat was scared as it was it is oodles of fun and definitely worth trying if you have the motors or can get them cheaply and adds a whole new dimension to the play aspect of playset it is also as i said very quick to switch between modded and nonmodded reaper in contrast to the more fiddly dino creations the only problem i had is that if it moves too fast the weight of the battery box at the back tends to pull the whole thing back and it rears up it does correct itself though i only trialled this on carpet last night so it may behave differently on other surfaces  i will need to experiment part 5 summation this is a great set made even better with the addition of power functions at aud7995 its wellpriced buy it buy the motors as well kmart still has stock of 4958 at 89 wait for a 15 off sale you wont regret it buy 2 and make competing battle machines the only thing is just dont torture that poor jelly edited by sinner 24 june 2008  0325 am	positive
wonder full job but now my wallet aches in misery	positive
im not that into mars mission but this set reminds me of the jungle cutter	positive
you really are an awesome set reviewer sveltecorps thanks very much for this sweet review so indepth and detailed that is one sweet vehicle its got three of my favourite things treads orange and big slicey blades thanks again peace	positive
another great review im looking forward to getting this set sometime soon i wasnt aware of the power function aspect similar i suppose to the old technic sets which had an additional instructions for those with the relevant motors i knew those dinos i got at clearance would come in useful nice to see the recent bulldozer treads appearing in black grey seemed a slightly unusual colour choice	positive
these new sets are just totally offthewall radical d its the little details like the scoops on the blades and the alternate alien energy source lego didnt even have to include those but they did that show lego are really getting back into their groove this year the ability to add power functions is just so cool as well im going to pickup the creator monster dino set for the electronics when the sales hit as svelte has suggested a very entertaining review just like the agents mobile command center one d	positive
nice review the power functions is a nice idea and i ownder if it will appear in any other new sets regarless if i get this i decided to just to get what ever looks good in the shops from now on  im defianltey picking up some of the white visors off bricklink	neutral
i was going to buy this set anyway but now im even more excited d my favorite part of this set is the bay that holds the little cart vehicles	positive
thank you for that fine review sveltecorps that´s a pretty cool set much more solid than the armoured drilling unit with a nice little transporter and some for sure pretty interesting additional power functions a very smart idea indeed did i miss something or is there really only one and probably improved shooting device and there´re even some levers to control the vehicles wow a matured marsmission on indeed now let´s get rid of these poor utilized jellies and we´re right on the way	positive
isnt it a lovely set i too have one modded of course 	positive
asuka on jun 4 2008 0926 am said did i miss something or is there really only one and probably improved shooting device no you didnt miss anything theres only one and its the less obtrusive new piece the range is pretty poor though 	neutral
iron moose on jun 4 2008 1128 am said so is there some way to get all those motor bits at once or do you have to buy them on their own i dont think ive ever seen them in a store here only from sh so far or if you buy sets which they come in all the ones you need apart from one additional small motor are available in the 4958 monster dino set which i got half price i ordered the extra from sh at the same time i bought the set  but only because i had already looked at the instructions and knew what i needed if people have the ferris wheel set as well i think the small motor comes in that	neutral
well i guess its nice that theyre making the story background a little more clear with that jelly plugged into the power cable hmmh both jellies and crystals can be used as power sources think theres a connection both of them are transparent and greenish maybe jellies hatch from crystals like eggs or need them as food or something important like that yay for evil humans	positive
excellent review loving this set i mean come on its a flipping tank awesomeness is written all over this  from all those blades and scoops at the front to the mini rover and yes you can even turn it into a motorized battle tank reminds me of the old technic days when they advertised in the manuals how to hook up the kits with separately sold motors another day another review of an awesome set yes this is sure tlcs year	positive
sveltecorps on jun 3 2008 1209 pm said the only thing is just dont torture that poor jelly i smell another dont hurt the dragonsjellies or something group nice reveiw i dont realy like the mm sets we want more starjusticespace skulls but this one looks ok i guess suprised they dont say that it has power functions on the box	positive
	positive
no but this is one of the most anticipated sets of 08	neutral
well title says it the description youll understand later i ordered this off of sh last tuesday and oddly enough its listed on sh as mx81 hypersonic airplane id like to apologize for the random horrible faded pics i took the review outside and the clouds kept shifting changing the lighting and then i had to go inside because it started raining its been raining for a week its raining now as i type this so i foolishly went outside to take pics the front of the box not bad as far as boxes go it features a liftup tab which shows the various functions back of the box still not much to say two manuals i think this is just right not too thick but not too many manuals either oddly enough the box came with a little folded up piece of paper telling us not to mix the bags it comes sorted into 4 bags by the way minifigures the set features 3 normal mm figs 1 normal jellie and one of the new commanders i really like this guy he has a few issues like his hands being stuck sideways and still being hollow but still a great improvement hell make a lovely addition to any halloween moc stickers the set comes with a fairly big dss for the spacecraft pretty normal but i do like the dragon sticker then suprises of suprises a technicolor sticker sheet for the aliens how cool is this huh the tops of the actual stickers are shiny which is hard to see in the pic even the bottom is shiny who said stickers cant be cool the mining craft the little guy is pretty cute and well built my only gripe is that theres nowhere to spin the drill it seems so lifeless without a feature the alien craft youd think a commander would be important enough to have a seatbelt rather than be stabbed with a clip and stuck on the ship like those other grunt aliens i think this thing has some potential shiny stickers different body shape and when you look at those engines this thing could be an alien corvette but then you look at the back pretty bare no flares or anything its a cool little craft but it justlacks the modules these things have some potential as well with some modding they could be pretty cool unfortunetly its pretty boxy there are no engines and the wings are too small the top is pretty nice though the greebles are all right the controls as usual are a sticker pretty spacious mind you the cockpit doesnt stay flush with the body though the front plate underneath it can be easily replaced with a brick to fix that im not gonna comment on this the main body too bad the labratory isnt much of a lab a transred panel and some tray thing are all that compose the lab i was expecting more but true to form this mars mission set has no impressive interior to speak of there is a lot of space though so it shouldnt be hard to mod phew the lab folds up like so pretty simple and would allow access to the lab if there was one and then we have this thing what is it defense laser communications array satellite tv the modules connect like so sorry out of place too bad the pins stick out various pics as you can see this thing has more of those bars than an att commercial there you understand the topic description now  the rear it uses a white city plane wing for thewings when i first saw the prototype pics i thought they slanted downwards that wouldve been really cool ah now to the platform from the position of the drill i think this could be a really cool turret location when i mod it to more military space back to the bars if we had space monkeys theyd love this this set has more bars than a jungle gym  here we see the button that drops the platform pretty clever and its not in the way best of all it really works really well actually good job tlc 2 more bars and a shooter mechanism jeeze this is really setting itself up for a joke a shooter mechanism walks into a bar never mind here we have the handle that allows you to pick it up safely a good idea but its placed waaaay to far back way off the center of balance you have to hold on to it pretty well to keep it angled up though it does stop your hands from getting in the way of the platform ah the platform in action this is really a neat little feature not only can the ship land in a reduced footprint but it also prevents the nice white paint job from getting red dust all over it its centered pretty well too and you dont have to worry about knocking it over just dont shove it back at all here we have the latch when the button on top is pushed this gets pulled inward which pulls out of this hole and allows it to swing neatly down good luck and happy mining again sorry for the lack of inprogress review i wouldve liked to take pics of the mechanism and so on but typical of the mm sets you cant really take it apart well this is really a nice set which can hopefully be upgraded with a better lab with little difficulty some of my military mod plans include strip the lab and install a command center get rid of lots of bars the thing has more bars than alcatraz install some turrets this is a big command ship so why all the forwardfacing weapons itll need some aa defense mod the landing platform to be a troop dropper with installable aa turret mod the cockpit pods to be more aerodymic so thats all folks shall i include one last bar joke	neutral
thanks for the review i really like all the mars mission sets this year the usage of the big wing is a bit annoying but you cant blame lego for reusing the mold ive been considering doing the same with mine mr mandalorian on jun 4 2008 0219 pm said so thats all folks shall i include one last bar joke i wouldnt have a bar of it	neutral
thanks for the great and very detailed review i love the new holostickers im still not sold on this set though im not sure why i think its the big wing piece and the tootechnicy build from looking at the instructions the platform seems kind of out of place and for the size of the set the functionality doesnt seem as good as it could be it reminds me of 7699 armored drilling unit  looks impressive but doesnt seem to do that much i do think mars mission has improved this year though bar none this is the weakest of the new mm sets i think	negative

thanks for the review i have to concede this does appear to be the weakest set of the summer mm lineup ive noticed a trend that the larger sets have plenty of parts potential but when assembled the model is not more than the sum of the parts eagle base certainly didnt seem worth the asking price at least this is one large model on a positive note the lame aero tubes darts and martian carrier pods have disappeared dont get me wrong i love mm and most of the lineup is great this one just seems to fall a little short of the bar	neutral
i dont understand why theres so much negativity this is actually my favorite of the new mm sets the finished look is very sleek and not very gappy at all the deployable landing pad is great and itll make it easy to put on a shelf without taking too much room lots of greebles although i will concede that its just begging to be modded still though im definitely buying this one  it has a really great look to it	positive
sinner on jun 4 2008 0344 am said having a name like that is a good start my screen name largely sums up my interest in lego but is not soley limited to space thanks for the warm welcome	neutral
two more questions 1  how stable is the entire craft when balanced on the platform is there a chance that it will just collapse 2  what are the total wingspan height and depth measurements of the model	neutral

iron moose on jun 4 2008 0215 pm said do tell im being curious not confrontational  well first and foremost like many other people im no fan of those dreaded unprinted minifig torsos and stickers but also the cost to piece ratio of the set it just seems too expensive for everything that you get such as too many small parts and a lighter than usual piece count for the price though if it had included printed minifigs and other elements i maybe would of been able to swallow its 100 usd cost a little easier but star justice is still lego space in the most classic sense thats available today and i will probably pony it up just because anyway i hope were not breaking forum protocol by not discussing the 7644 review of the original poster or that particular set in general	neutral
thanks for the review i actually quite like this i cant afford it so im not getting too attached to it but in its own way its great its certainly reminiscent of space sets of the past as others have said and the dropdown ramp section is just really cool as an idea you understand sure the lab is a little crap but at least the effort was made sort of  the sheer fact that its so big though really makes me like this theres just something appealing about large spaceships not capital ships just big space ships with lots of guns spacefan on jun 4 2008 1034 pm said anyway i hope were not breaking forum protocol by not discussing the 7644 review of the original poster or that particular set in general hey its no worse than batbrick and i no really it isnt even in the same league	positive
thank you for that nice review mr mandalorian wow somehow it´s almost like classic space´s back indeed it´s a great star ship it looks stream lined original and impressive and even the huge plane wing part looks rather cool and smooth on it it´s equipped at least with some kind of engines on top of the wings and although they´re made with only two a little juniorized parts it´s better than nothing there´s a lab or some sort of engine room with enough space inside to allow one or two mfs to play scotty yeah the two cockpits´re nicely detailed with a cool use of these orange 1x1 round plates and to detach one or all two of them reminds a lot of the playability of the good old space sets it seems even like it´s easy to attach them to some kind of cloud city twinpod car thanks these hinged wings looks like some solid fun to me of course the cockpits aren´t airtight and even this reminds unfortunately of the post blue grey and trans yellow era of cs anyway there´s no real fun without some moding i guess another great advantage of the set´s that it´s not overpacked with shooting things one technic shooter cool in grey and only one trans orange prison pod too well i can surely live with that especially since it´s nicely asymmetrical the drill rover´s very charming a little like a rebuilt oldsmobile convertibe stranded on mars sweet and that platform feature´s plain nifty and well done too very playable and useable for a lot of things hmm recently i complained a lot about the dense use of studless technic beams for the inner structure of vehicles like these exoforce tanks par exemple which makes moding in an economical way pretty frustrating but the beams here´re used in a very proper way it should be fairly easy to mod let´s say the back of that lab section up to perhaps even the cockpits to create a larger airtight area that could be boarded from the platform just to fit this certain spacers need for um realism there´re many more nice details too like that satelite tv thingy and that cylinder with trans blue 2x2 dish for the knob or these cylinders with cones on that handle and that alien craft´s pretty nice and detailed as well like i said before i really feel like classic space´s back	positive
nice review just one little point since there is no sound transmission through space but there is an atmosphere on mars through which this this thing supposedly flies hypersonic airplane makes far more sense than hypersonic spacecraft 	positive
sorry mr mandalorian i guess i was just getting a bit defensive because when this set first appeared here there were literally 2 pages of people just bagging out the new mm sets but then the thread took a turn and people started to warm to them much like the agents i do agree that it definitely needs some mocing but with that work i think it has the potential to be a really amazing set in terms of what you could cram into it the lab is a little disappointing ive always wanted an enclosed cabin space in a vehicle this size because then all the little space guys can have a true meeting place the dropdown landing ramp is my favourite part it has lots of potential uses maybe its even possible to integrate pneumatics d	positive
hello shefols and afols as well as tfols welcome to eb news reviews i am your hostfor tonight anyway shadows will take over after this episode if we make more today we are reviewing mars impulse sets 5616 and 5617 starting with 5617 alien jet i must say it is a small and quick build the jellie is made of hard plastic which surprised me as i had expected jellies to be a soft plastic the jet is mainly 2x4 plates some swingy hinges the seatbelt and a thing which i cannot seem to name my one gripe about it is that the jelly cant see where he is flying it looks better with a mf in it there was a red 1x1 as a spare part we move on to the 5616 mini robot which is basically a safe brick with binoculars soem cheese slopes little arms and legs the best part i must say was the metal detector and safe brick as these seem to be quite rare in sets by my knowlage anyway the austronaut has a face shown in dr sinsters review the set also comes with a pickaxe and lime green gem extra peices where a cheese slope a green 1x1 and a white droid arm that concludes these minireviews i also will use this opportunity to show my photo setup both sets are reccomended if you either need a army or are just trying to get a variaty of figs like myself next weecamera fades edited by sinner 24 june 2008  0417 am	neutral

hello all eurobricks members i will be presenting my first review on one of the harry potters set firstly i must emphasize that i am not a very big harry potter fan or owned many harry potter sets for this review i will be highlighting what is the beauty of this small little set and the reasons to own multiple sets of it comments and critics are strongly welcomed this set is featured in the harry potter movie prisoner of azkaban this set is orignally released in 2004 align with the harry potters movie this was actually one of the movie scene where buckbeak the griffin is appeared in the movie the group of students are supposed to be having up close and personal with him however draco decided to disturb our lovely buckbeak enough of this movie synopsis i am sure fans of harry potter will know this better box art featured minifigcreature background scene the scene is a simple garden which had a very good mixture of spare parts for your mocs building on its own there is nothing outstanding about this set except for the griffin you can buy multiple sets for the griffin alone and for draco minifig well you dont need lots of draco but for castle lovers black cap are exceptionally useful at least from my view now i will point out the following why this sets is so great for other reasons hidden cover note that this is the only mechanism which you can find in this set it looks rather simple but quite useful there are some little things hide in it too greens foilage and brown parts needless to say much it offer 3 foilage a green plant 3 brown slopes 2 ideal bricks and 1x1 brown brick for building a tree great for jungle building forest building and etc i am sure there are many builders will look out for these interesting parts it comes with a wizard book owl 2 printed tiles with a spider and stone prints on it the far right seriously i dont find any good use for it can any eb members enlighten me on that gray thing on the right grey parts it comes with a good 10 x 4 green plate useful for adding as a platform some more grey slopes for your mocs there you have it draco encounter with buckbeak comparing with deep forest ambush as you may remembered recently there was an impulse set competition one of my entries which is under the history theme the deep forest ambush was firstly inspired by this set and made an improvement out of it look at the improved tree compared with the orignal summary review playability 410 not much to play with except swooshing around the griffin design 510 too simple and its defintely not related with the movie scene parts 1010 great for parts explained by the review a great deal of green and brown parts price 910 an inexpensive set based on the 2004 pricing overall 710 a must have for all harry potter fans and collectors whom needs a great use of green and brown parts hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine more pictures can be found in my brickshelf when moderated let the potter magic begans edited by whitefang 09 june 2008  0245 pm	neutral
a very nice little review of a pretty nice little set that i wish id bought between 1 and 10 of just for the griffin oh well your review has shown me that its useful for more than just that so maybe ill try to pick one up someday cant have too many black capes books or printed things speaking of which whitefang on jun 9 2008 0941 am said interesting parts it comes with a wizard book owl 2 printed tiles with a spider and stone prints on it the far right seriously i dont find any good use for it can any eb members enlighten me on that gray thing on the right the gray thing is technically a plume like any castle plume except in this case its a feather presumably from the griffin and made from the mold to the old indian feathers in the wild west sets its a case of an old part coming back for a slightly new use in a new colour beyond that the stone print tile is a bundle or rolled up blanket or package depending on where its used i dont think its ever meant to be a stone it was used as a rolled up pack on the back of the star wars speederbikes for example nice pics plenty of useful information id give this review an a thanks for doing it	neutral

ohhh great idea to review the old potter sets especially the line from prisoner of azkaban i was in my dark ages then luckily i was able to catch up on the missed figs with one internet order this draco is the best tlc has made if you ask me the new one also doubling for belloq and guards in the indy line doesnt look quite as hautain as this one buckbeak looks cool looks like his neckhead can be moved right rather similar to lego horses well designed the orange brick doesnt have a pumpkin face on it right unlike the one from philosophers stone in the set with the troll im looking forward to more reviews by you sir whitefang good work	positive
guys thanks for your comments glad you find this review useful and be sure to watch out for more old sets reviews mr spielbrick on jun 12 2008 1228 am said this draco is the best tlc has made if you ask me the new one also doubling for belloq and guards in the indy line doesnt look quite as hautain as this one buckbeak looks cool looks like his neckhead can be moved right rather similar to lego horses well designed mr spielbrick thanks for pointing out some important highlights for the review i have overlooked it earlier i strongly agreed with you that this draco is the best tlc made i pretty like the face compared to others furthermore i used my multiple dracos for my castle armor guards instead one could not have too many dracos buckbeak design is well made the head can be moved upwards and downwards the mechanism is similar to the horse design in addition buckbeak wings can be removed similar to the typical green or black dragon wings that we used to see in the past well the main reason for me to buy this set was in fact buckbeak you dont often find a griffin lying around except in harry potter sets mr spielbrick on jun 12 2008 1228 am said the orange brick doesnt have a pumpkin face on it right unlike the one from philosophers stone in the set with the troll sorry to said there is no print on that pumpkin face its pure orange	positive

hello eb yes im cranking out the reviews the other day i picked up this gem for an okay sales price at devonport tas while searching for the new batsets i informed iamded of this as he is a spideysuckup   and he informed me this was the only set he didnt have of the wave 2 of this theme so i ask you great eb members to please remind him of this when commenting here we go with the review of doctopus lair anyway unlike other reviews this stars more people the batbrickiamdeddragonatordaisy review daisy is the mouse that came in the set first up re the figs and i must say they are great i love fleshies and these are excellent to expand my batman world plus having a spiderman to beat up is good too doctopus is great though his tentacles are annoying to keep in order peter parker is a nice addition i love that torso eve though harry osborn was totally absent from this scene i welcome him as he is a good fig also best of all is mary jane fleshie females are hard to come by and i love that hair my very first one oh and even better is bley daisy on the far right another fantastic thing is that by mixing mj with doctopus you get a far more deadly and real villain than anyone couldve forseen  the hippy oh cmon tell me that aint cool anyhoo here is a pic of doctopus showing his might random fact did you know i influence both dragonator and iamded in their sigfigs dragonator adapts his from my ia series while iamded added mutt hair when i had him like that in a pic i posted now onto the box sorry about the lighting the art is good and the cartoon spidey in the corner may have beenthe inspiration for a similar style in the new batsets back of the box again sorry about the lighting and blur it was gtting late and these were the last pics finally we get to the first part of the set the catapult is that movie accurate or what i love the part in sm2 when he uses his homemade genetic spider powered catapult to launch himself to the scene oh well it does comes with a cool spider web an trans blue spider so it gets some points and it is really fun i launched spidey several metres once i dont think he ever recovered infact he almost certainly webbed himself slightly cooler extras are these two this awesome little boat is great for city as is the simple but nice bouy daisy approves naturally dragonator ruins everything when he found out the dragon that would be riding with him was our nickname for daisy now finally the main attraction  coctopus dock iamded and i threw dragonator in the water to see if he could swim he er couldnt one sweeney todd later we continue the overall construction of the building is very good i know a lot of people hated stickers and i hated applying these but they do look spectacular and perfect for any city setting like a bank a gotham bank as iamded has already noted below me the black lifesavers a very cool as are the web piece and log pieces the inside contains the neutron copperplate triple bypass humdrum holy hum 5000 which does does see movie anyhoo it is very cool and includes a little control thingy on the yellow brick next to it unfortunately the inside is plain but for that the other side has no wall too which is a bit of a letdown really but atleast it allows daisy easy access one gripe is those yellow 1x1 bricks they serve no purpose and break up the colour scheme better shot of the thingy thing i quite like it the use of technic parts actually works and the whole set is worth it for those purple flames and dishes alone it closes up pretty well too unable to hit the dish which is a nice feature me and iamded liked it so much we threw a revived dragonator into it unfortunately it disagreed with him but it was fun another shot of the dock i like how they have gaps in the jetty i know the movie version was pretty wack and although the set isnt very faithful to it looks more like a seaside library to be frank it still is very nice this is my first large blue baseplate too which is wonderful though funny how the set only uses about half of it the roof is a well designed and fun feature it uses some technic connections to render it flexible of any degree as you can see here by my opening of it better shot of the roof design it can lie flat or at any angle i might use the design myself in the future as much as i love the building this feature bugs me for in order for it to work this wall has to stick out which not only looks ugly but makes you be able to see through the corners still easily modded and log pieces are fantastic for mocing it also means that there are 7 windows all up for a good sizeable building by pulling out the piece in the center the walls both collapss sideways outwards which is actually pretty fun and works everytime overall view of the set including characters now for the story that makes no senseat all spiderman is dead after falling down the wall mechanism see above only daisy can save the day for dragonator is being held by the evil doctopus and iamded and dragonator are too busy not caring and brainbox is too busy complaining that this goes against all marvel continuity unfortunately daisy is on a lunchbreak so tough luck dragonator and daisy goes on a search for fortune and glory okay this is what i think of the set build 35  fun but those stickers ruin the experience somewhat and if you dont apply them the instructions are a bit hard to follow playability 45  great little gizmos and bits not the kind that keep you going like with the 2007 aquabase but good fun still design 45  not very movie faithful no but still a great little building and a smart design for certain aspects minifigs 55  great figs with all different faces and very useful bits price 25 far far overpriced even on sale sadly total 1825  a good set that couldve been better with a few minor changes nothing wrong with it but it doesnt really cross the line to greatness that said it has a lot going for it and definitely worth buying or atleast a look

lookin good so far though i must say its doc ock not dok ock the catapult is well ridiculous but the boat is very spiffy and the buoy is a nice addition i actually like the stickers on the window pieces perfect for this building and great for postapoc scenes black lifesaver rings are a nice addition tooanyway hurry up dragonator and batbrick and daisy i want to see the rest of the review iamded away	positive

thanks for the review even if it is a number of years late i picked this up whn it came out and thought it was a rather cool set besides the catapult plenty of cool pieces and the baseplate has found a use in the batcave although i think my dad managed to spill some beer on it at one point that was awful to clean off batbrick on jun 13 2008 1044 am said and brainbox is too busy complaining that this goes against all marvel continuity i wasnt expecting that there i was casually scrolling down when i stumbled onto a picture of me	positive
where is my soap haha anyway nice review as always batbrick i too have the set and hate the wall jutting out catapult and missing wall but hey review	negative
great review batbrick i was curious as to what the interior of the building looked like i still think that there should have been a few random chains or something lying around as they may add to the abandoned feeling that the ware house had though i have to admit that i really like the roof dock and minifigs as some of them make good average civilians that are somewhat hard to come by in todays sets  great comic as well it seemed to add a lot to your review hope you can review another spider man set soon  btw as adam mentioned i believe you owe me a bar of soap for reading your review  edited by mack 14 june 2008  1259 am	neutral

hi everyone please note that this review was done back in 2006 so do forgive me if you happened to notice any dated comments product 6205 vwing theme star wars no of pieces 118 release date feburary 2006 rrp sgd2990usd990 availability lego shophome target toys r us us  europe bricksworld sg legocom said rule the spaceways the sleek vwing fighter can adapt to any situation position the wings and flaps in attack mode to protect palpatines shuttle from enemies or position the wings in flight mode to survey the area for intruders either way the vwing is ready to strike for the republic includes clone pilot and r4 droid position wings in attack or flight mode sorry to all for the delay since this was supposed to be done 3 days ago anyway to get on with it quite a minimal amount of baggies for this set as noticed and the best thing is no sticker sheet yippee bounce the completed vwing though not really a complaint it would be nice if the entire astromech body was provided instead of only the head dome p of course then it wouldnt be movieaccurate since the q7 series astromech is integrated with the starfighter lol hes definitely wellpainted for a simple minifig since even the back is painted too i have to assumed this is the same minifig provided for 7259 arc170 starfighter too since i dont have that set anyway this minifig is much more accurate for this vwing since his suit is rated against vacuum while those in the arc170 arent  p one thing thats lacking is the instruments panel in the cockpit its totally nonexistent here i wonder what went wrong during the design stage personally this is the second most anticipated set for 2006 the first being the tie interceptor for me one thing is that theres no known release of the vwing starfighter by hasbro nor the other wellknown brands the other thing is that being a star wars vehicle collector i would really loved to see a replica toy of the vwing and the vwing by the lego group does not disappoint its nearly movieaccurate except for the cockpit transparisteel cover which could used some paint like the xwings also theres a permanent landing gear that quite neat since it allows you to land the craft on uniform surfaces the sfoils on the other hand can be quite a pain to pose into flight position very difficult for the sfoils to remain symmetrical during play the swooshable or play factor of this product is quite good just check out the pics for yourself d crackle general skywalker we have incoming to conclude the vwing starfighter would make a much better companion to the eta2 actis interceptor jedi starfighter than the arc170 coz the arc170 seems more like a longrange bomber to me than a snubfighter p and a final pic to show it at rest comments for 2008 just an updated pic to show my latest display on the clone wars hmm off the record i do understand that sometimes reviews by most tend to a certain set of guidelines like naming the set and showing the boxed and out of boxed pics and of course the grading portion regarding my review i prefer not to grade any of the lego sets at all as far as possible because to each hisher own my reasons to put up a review is not to belittle the efforts of tlg in coming out with these products nor to help them market them but to show my appreciation and enjoyment of these products i hope noone is offended by this and would like to apologise for any misunderstanding that this may caused for those who do not understand the above paragraph care not for it and play on like me	positive

heres the 3rd of the whole batch of complete reviews done back in 2006 hope you guys enjoy them so far product 6206 tie interceptor theme star wars no of pieces 212 release date february 2006 rrp sgd3990usd1990 availability lego shophome target toys r us us  europe bricksworld sg legocom said challenge the rebels blasting out of star wars episode vi return of the jedi the tie interceptor is the fastest fighter in the imperial fleet open the cockpit canopy and fold down the instrument panel to put the tie pilot inside and recreate your favorite classic star wars battles includes tie fighter pilot cockpit opens and instrument panel folds down it does seem to have more pieces than the average tie fighter but this is actually cheaper than the 7263 tie fighter of course theres no lightup feature in this set sweat yesh finally a tie interceptor this is probably the most anticipated for all set for all lego tie collectors worldwide since the fighter bomber advanced and even the expanded universe droid fighter had been released by the lego group this set is near movieaccurate since the bottom part of it aint p the cockpit and pylons uses the same design as that of the tie advanced piloted by darth vader except for one minor change that is the aft interior of the cockpit is strengthen this time and this is indeed good news since the older models had a problem of hard hinge and loose brick connection theres no landing gear for this set but it doesnt require it anyway this tie interceptor balances perfectly on its wings standard instruments panel and of course standard imperial pilot the swooshable or play factor of this set is definitely very high just take a look d camera view from own craft camera view from tieadvanced combat simulation of endors battle from the archives no bomber since i started late in recollecting p to conclude for a typical lego fan this set is a 6040 60 due to its good design and for a typical star wars fan this is a mustget the only flaw for this set is the same flaw for any lego set in sg the price doh commentcurrent in 2008 being a starwars fan no being a typical toy collector space is definitely a premium so much so that i turned to lego starwars to sate my appetite for more starwars products when i already have no more display space for the next few nonlego pictures they are the crown of my starfighter collection in 118 scale so just view them for fun eh and no i havent had the chance nor the time to do up a scene of my lego starfighters blowing up spectacularly since the pieces would be very hard to put back hmm then again isnt that what lego is about doh	positive
why have you uploaded this twice	neutral
skipper 24 on jun 15 2008 0802 pm said why have you uploaded this twice what do you mean twice the tie interceptor is one of the best ties that have been made so far though youre pushing it when doing a review that has already been done by a precious member of this site fine review for a great set kimt	positive
great set but i scrapped it since im not big on space nice set though and a good review jifel	positive
great review thanks for posting	neutral
raptor on jun 18 2008 0210 am said because this review is very good thanks for all the pics i want to buy that set too they are so big but why did lego made them in these strange blackdblue colors this set is very old i saw it one time in my local toyshop for 69 euro and now its gone pitty will look on ebay you saw it for 69 euro boy be happy you didnt buy it thats even for europeprincing a completely insane price edit almost forgot  very nice review thanks a lot havent gotten this set yet but now i might edited by vadersson 18 june 2008  1245 pm	neutral
yknow you can open the bag	neutral
why didnt you open the bags	neutral
its called challenging ones self p plus you can resell it as misb since its still sealed in the polybags lol	neutral
theres something called opening the bag do you do this with everything lego set theres something called opening the bag do you do this with everything lego set	neutral
now now dont judge people who do this there have been bigger sets that were done in the bag to each his own 	neutral
ahhh bag building that takes me back i suspect that if i didnt do my bag building topic my eb life would have turned out very differently for the negative nancies i suggest you try it i bought a set just so i could and i found it fun not fun enough to do it again though thanks for the interesting review	neutral
adiksalego on jun 17 2008 1002 am said now now dont judge people who do this there have been bigger sets that were done in the bag to each his own  you make it sound like i did something deeply socially deviating like being an adult playing with lego but back on topic open the bags if they were meant to be opened why did lego close them in the first place bag building is not for everybody some might become very frustrated with it and let their anger out on the set by lining it up on a mini golf course	neutral
nice review but i think bag building is a boring way to build	neutral
seeming as there were no reviews of this set in the index i have uploaded mine from jabbas hutt  here is my review for lego set 10178 motorized walking atat because i live in the uk i got this set with 6 free duracell batteries which was great its just twice as expensive as the us heres the basic set that is from the instructions this is the cockpit but please note after i took this photo i realised it was slightly built wrong heres one of the feet in proportion to a minifig to give you a general size this is luke skywalker swinging on a wire trying to destroy the atat i really wish lego didnt make so many lukes because i want differnt minifigs it would also be nice for a thermal detonator piece underneath the atat you can see the shaft that moves the back legs the motor and squeezed in on the righ t the massive battery box a load of cogs that move the legs these are the included figures snowtrooper general maximilian veers atat driverpilot or whatever you want to call him and luke all whithout there wepons please note veers should have a dark stone snowtroooper torso with 4 red and blue badge things not 3 these are the figures with weapons i gave them and the included ones snowtrooper has new style blaster veers has standard light grey pistol like the ones from the old adventure sets atat driver has old style blaster which i call heavy blaster and luke has shiny handle blue light sabre  the shiny blue light sabre was included with the set which is a bonus because i really dont like the grey ones httpwwwbrickshelsc00521jpgjpg this is the switch which is attached to the battery box on either side of the atat underneath the lift up side panels you push the forward to walk forward and backward to walk backwards simple eh  a front veiw with the the panels open here are the drivers controls which are simply a cotrol panel and 2 exoforce robot hands which are joystick things seen in the film if you look closley the almost useless carry handle this is the weird back piece looking down the atat from the back where you can see the the battery box and switch troops decending from ropes and cables and vader leading the assult for this i hadnt got any more imps so i used clones pilots i now have a whole load more snowtroopers solo and chewie sabotaging more troops to squash rebel scum huzahh a very bad picture of everyone packed up inside the size incomparison to its predecessor overall i would give this set 910 because it should come with more snowtroopers or it could be and endor version with loads of strormies and scout troopers aswell as this you can really sit any one down because of the battery box but i stilll find space to put all the shown figures on this review in the interior as you can see on the above image the chains and ropes are hanging down a bit tjis set is now limited to 5 per customer in the uk and now no longer comes with free batteries the walking on this is a bit wonky and dosent really walk like they do in the film as it moves two legs at a time i am currently attaching a motor to the head to make it move independently	negative
kimt on jun 19 2008 0342 pm said great review indexing it as i write this how come you think the ctt is the atats predecessor do you mean the motorized atat or atats in general i think this is a great set and i am very fond of mine its one of the few sw sets of mine that is on parade at all times most are packed away in the attic kimt btw its not alone the older version of the atat is keeping it company the body looks exactly like it	neutral
i mean by the clone turbo tank turned into the atat i think in the films when they changed all there technology and vehicles when they became the empire	neutral
as far as i know the atat was a invention by general veers himself benny	neutral
nice job with this review skipper	neutral
nice review i echo the sentiment that more snowies would have been better	negative
nice review  the driverpilot whatever you call him   s helmet looks kind of odd and why does have a long red pole instead of a kickbutt lightsaber	negative
smithboy on jun 20 2008 0601 pm said i doubt that the atat was used in the clone wars well you never know maby veers was around then just because it was used in the clone wars dosent mean that veers didnt design it to wookiepedia	neutral
vader had a red pole because i think it makes him look bigger and in the films i doubt it is but i think his saber might be bigger	neutral
i never got the set it looked way to skinny i came close to buying it for the figs but then decided not to if you compared this one to the later one there is a big difference this one just didnt seem proporshined with the legs and its body	negative
this is one of those sets that you just have to have i mean a motorised atat is a dream set for original trilogy fans and has an awesome set of minifigures	positive
thanks for the review kimt  it comes at a confusing time you can take off the top disk and lift it like the millennium falcon from the top now i actually dont like this set that much it takes about 5 hours and 15 minutes to build if you do it in one go but the repeating sections makes this built the most tedious i have experienced it has way too many holes from which you can see the colorful skeleton and is overpriced compared to the older 10030 isd i remember thinking it was too expensive when it was 50 off at sh even the snowspeeder was kewler to less than half the price	negative
thanks for the review eh honestly i though this was awful ever since i first saw the pictures to me an incomplete grey ball doesnt really work as a special ucs kit for the sole reason that its boring extremely so now the new death star playset is a whole different story they should have done that in the first place edited by grevious 24 june 2008  0912 pm	negative
even though i never liked ucs i absolutley hate this one sure its great on display but the build looks extremley boring to me just stacking plate after plate and as you said its going to break a little if you touch it the only intersting part for me is the firing laser although i do have to say the proce isnt too bad i still wouldt buy it and no minifigs so thanks for the review but ill pass on this one the new minifig scale ds looks awesome though and this might have hyped some up who are buying the new ds	negative
good job kimt it´s a really nice set it will be interesting to see the size of ds2 ucs compared with the new death star playset keep up the great regulator job you are doing morten	positive
darkrebellion on jun 25 2008 1239 am said great review kimt  i like this set even if i don´t own it because it looks simple fantastic to display i just have one question the mini executor can be moved around the death star ii or its attached to that place thanks for the review  its attached to the ds and cannot move as such though there is 4 spots where it can be attached to the ds reading your comments on this set i can see why tlg has been forced to put it on sale on the us sh i dont agree that the isd is better  imho theyre exactly them same  big and grey this is a question of personal liking  which is the coolest ds or isd not comparative id still call this an ok ucs when looking at it individually but there sure is a lot other ucs sets that would get a better score than 510 kimt	positive
mortensonne on jun 25 2008 0336 am said it will be interesting to see the size of ds2 ucs compared with the new death star playset i was thinking about the same as for the review  thanks	positive
i think its a very weird and boring ucs set but what a lot of grey plates you could build something much better out of them but it would be fairly flat it looks very fragile though  my ucs atst is edited by shoc 25 june 2008  1028 am	negative
thanks for the review kimt honestly like the others have said i dont find any appeal in ucs sets especially this one its just a big incomplete grey ball	negative
the build was a bit boring and i suppose a big grey ball isnt all that interesting but since the death star ii in the movie is a big grey ball too i dont see the problem i didnt think it was particularly fragile i dont care about minifigs or playability either a few plusses in my opinion it looked pretty damn impressive sitting in my lego room and the construction is really clever all in all i actually liked this one but perhaps i have a different expectation of sets than most of you sets are mainly parts packs and would you look at the quantity of grey plate in this thing its new grey btw i paid half price for it at shophome uk which is still a lot more than half price from the us and i didnt regret it for a second cheers ralph	negative
kimt on jun 25 2008 0834 am said i dont agree that the isd is better  imho theyre exactly them same  big and grey this is a question of personal liking  which is the coolest ds or isd not comparative here are some advantages that makes isd win for me  a lot more fun to build with less repetitions  it is easier to build alternate models from it how many alternate models of the ds2 have you seen  the bricks are more varied  you get magnets  it is a larger set if you look at the size	positive
wow what a letdown i recently picked up this set and i looked up this review to see what i was getting into not good news the silver lining is that it was a damaged box deal at brickworld so it only cost me 100 half off the already lowered price so it was definatley worth it as a parts pack if nothing else its the last unopenedunbuilt large kit in my collection so even if it is repetetive i am going to build it anyway it is likely however that i may substitute pieces to do away with the colored interior ive already determined that after it sits on display for a while i want to do a zepplin as an alternate build looking at the parts list it looks like its the perfect set for such an undertaking	negative
dang so much negativity on a such spectacular set this baby provides an amazing backdrop to any lego inspired star wars diorama and lets face it lego tends to be a rectangular brick and somehow we now have a sphere guys its a ucs it accurately depicts the on screen icon and put plain and simple is a wonderful sculptural piece of work in its own right i agree with kimt in that the removal of the laser and super star destroyer gives it more authenticity but to call it a gray golf ball or ignore its inherent accuracy is simply to miss the point it proved to be the best build to share with someone be it family or friend due to its repeated sections and impressive finish its a clever build and to criticize it for lack of playability or i suspect for many its absence of minifigs is just absurd and possibly why lego has not released a proper ucs in nearly two years i reckon many out there would love a ucs tyderium imperial walker or slave 1 with a spectacular piece count be it minifig scale or just darn impressive in its own right sadly for those who love these sculptural masterpieces were stuck with simple toys with play features and cute minifigs clever in their own right but lacking the clout and purity of the old ucs line lets hope some diversity of product is just around the corner else 10179 was the last of the truly brave financial gambles of the star wars line	positive
i decided to reread this review because i just got this set today i dont really have a concern over the design or repeating build process because owning this set was never an option for me as i collect ucs sets but i am surprised to see an almost total lack of positive posts i really hope that i enjoy this build	neutral

i bricklinked it too back in the day it was an interesting build  just thought building the unfinished hemisphere was kind of tedious	negative
ive just ordered the bits for this from bricklink im awaiting the final order now so im interested in these comments i can see that since ill be building it with the kids ill have to plan in plenty of breaks and do lots of parallel building to keep us all from getting bored	positive
7656 general greivouss starfighter release 2007 number of pieces 232 minifigs 1 brickset welcome this is my first review so contstructive critisism is very much appreciated on to the review first we start out with the box the box art is the same as always since 2006 nothing special then we start the build the build is fairly easy and will take the seasoned builder about 1520 min to complete here is the finished model and birds eye view as you can see this ship is very sleek the fins or wings each have an outer slope and an inner one with the guns in between there are also cones on the front of the fins which give the ship an even more sleek look in the middle of the wings there is the main body with a big slope and stripes decorating it this set has a very good playability factor as im about to show you now the guns on the ship are pretty cool looking to begin with a bley slope attaching a lightsaber hilt and a transneon green stud to the fin on each side but theres more than what meets the eye yes the guns flip up and they can flip all the way back to hide them for whatever case they need hiding lets have a look at the back there is a tail fin used as landing gear and some lightspeed boosters but wait the tail fin can flip up for flight thanks to a hinge attached to the back of the cockpit heres another playability factor the cockpit can slide open very smoothly and easily heres how this is possible a clever system under the hood allows the cockpit to open see those two bley pieces on the black ones those bley ones attach to the tan plates under the hood and the hood and windsheild attach to the black peices the black and bley pieces work together as a sliding system so the cockpit opens viola and then the cockpit snaps in place thanks to the red hook and clip its a very accurate system and works very well youll want to open and close it over and over again now finnaly to the fig the general himself a very impressive fig with a new head and torso mold in this set which is one of only two with greivous in it he comes with 2 green and two blue lightsabers all with bley hilts   i was hoping for chrome hilts but its a minor fault grievous also comes with a new mold pistol blaster not pictured heres the general in the cockpit sadly a weak cockpit no details he just half lays down on a small slope in this set he doesnt come with a cape beacuse with it on the cockpit doesnt close thats about it heres the final verdict build 710 fairly easy but fun a little bit weak playability 810 many playability factors but some are boring or pointless swooshability 810 very fun to fly around sometimes pieces break off minifigs 1010 one amazing fig with 4 lightsabers and a new blaster what more could you ask for design 910 very sleek but hardly any real texture i like it but others might want greebling price 1010 overall score 910 a very cool ship with a very cool minifig and accessories one of the best sw sets i have ever seen for its small price i highly recommend it to any kind of sw lego or sw lego fan hope you enjoyed my review please leave feedback edited by jimbutcher 15 september 2008  0301 am	positive
you should have posted the entire review up i am about to look at the gallery for the rest of the pics edit as soon as i post the images came thats weird nice review is there more it says ill be back good first review edited by skipper 24 26 june 2008  0911 pm	neutral
sorry about that skipper i added the topic after the first pic was uploaded just to make sure the pics would be in the post you probably posted while i was editing it and i had to go to visit my grandparents im at their house right now sorry if you got freaked out	neutral
the set no longer looks as ugly as ive always thought thanks for the review  i might have to pick one up now to go with the magnaguard fighter	neutral
thats a neat little set i like the design of the fighter thanks for the review  its been keep it up kimt	positive
hey thanks for all the feedback guys ill try to do the sith infiltrator this weekend	neutral
yesterday i buy this setand im waiting for a pack this review is very helpful jimbutcher on jun 27 2008 0834 pm said ill try to do the sith infiltrator this weekend i wait	neutral
does the sliding cockpit come off easily my friends brothers breaks everytime you touch it but he may have built it wrong it put me off the set	negative
jameseh on jun 28 2008 0824 pm said does the sliding cockpit come off easily my friends brothers breaks everytime you touch it but he may have built it wrong it put me off the set im very sad to say that sometimes it does but thats only if you hold it from the top and bottom with your fingers and thumb respectivly but if you hold it in your palm or from the sides it wont break emphasis on sometimes but dont try to mess around with it by removing its pieces or adding new one or modding it in any way because the sliding mechanism wont agree with the mods and break but this hardly takes away from anyone liking this set because imo its perfect just how it is	negative
yeah general grievous starfighter will land in my house greate set i love decals  brown and sandy pattern ingenious btw when you show sith infiltrator review i wait 	positive
nice review i bought a couple of these for parts the only thing i dont like about the ship itself not the lego version it does fine is why is the grand droid general flying around in in a small fighter like this i prefer the battlefront interpretation witch uses it as a bomber anyway great review york	neutral
great review i would get the set but im saving for the clone wars sets	positive
great set great review i have it too and i am very glad to own it it will probably be the cheapest and best way to get a grievous fig for a while even though it doesnt come with a cape  you guys know that you can use the new robotskeleton arms from the castle sets to make him hold his lightsabers horizontically right i always have him with two of each kind of arm	positive
hello all eurobricks members i will be doing the second wave of the 2008 impulse set series which had released recently i bought this set earlier ago and will like to share this comprehensive review with everyone of you name troll warrior theme lego system  castle year 2008 pieces 19 minifigs 1 an image of a 5618 troll warrior let the march begin the mighty brave troll warrior carrying a dangerous cart equipped with a flick fire missile marching into the lands of the crown kingdom crown knights must be ready for this new troll addition from what i see this set has a very minimum piece count since its an impulse set there is no unique parts found in this set however this set has a couple of useful accessories such as 2 spears and 2 wooden wheels and a grey mouse running around this set is another alternative for castle army builders to buy multiple sets to build a massive troll armies in addition the flick missile really works use a little bit of force from your finger and flick it the missile will fly well it certainly does not impress me at all with such playing feature base of the cart different angles there is one thing i dislike about this set the wooden wheels are too big and it is the same as the ones in the crossbow attack i prefer the smaller wheels that exist in old castle sets that produced smaller cart since this cart size is similar to the old cart size the old wizards cart is a very good example of the proposed wheel bits and pieces closeup on the warrior and the mouse summary review playability 5510 the playability feature is not fanastic design 6510 design is adequate if the wheels is much smaller and the flicking thing disappear the score will be much higher price 810 an inexpensive set to get a troll warrior and a mouse overall 610 to conclude this set is good only for army builders a new range of millitary vehicle to be added thats all hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine comments and critics are strongly welcomed pictures can be found in my brickshelf when moderated edited by kimt 10 august 2008  0129 pm	positive
its all good buti know you expected a but  its a rat	positive
trooperdavinfelth on jul 2 2008 0315 pm said its all good buti know you expected a but  its a rat or maybe a very large mouse	neutral
its a good review but you forgot another thing the troll needs a shiled like they used to in the 2007 castle line the sets always had shields for the minifigs and it could be better if it was 300 instead of 350 but yes it is a good impulse great army builder	positive
a more affordable troll warrior for those of us avoiding the large sets me is always nice thanks for the review god bless nathan	positive
very good nice to see how its all played out nice review	positive
guys thanks for your kind comments i am glad to know that you have enjoyed viewing this review trooperdavinfelth on jul 2 2008 1115 pm said its a rat i thought by calling it as a mouse it will be a little much friendly unlike calling it a rat brainbox on jul 2 2008 1120 pm said thanks for the review bearing in mind that the whole point of this set is to get a cheap troll warrior i actually quite like it the cart isnt brilliant but for 13 pieces its not that bad the troll fig is great as always and i guess the rats are always nice to get not so much in real life though the sets that contain the trolls have a fairly solid number each i mean tower raid has three but nevertheless i think i may have to pick up a few of these norro on jul 3 2008 0610 am said a more affordable troll warrior for those of us avoiding the large sets me is always nice thanks for the review i must agreed with the both of you that this is a much easier way to acquire these troll warriors at a much affordable price i am glad these trolls are available in impulse sets now will there will be a dwarf impulse set in the future i supposed that will be much interesting glman on jul 3 2008 1215 am said its a good review but you forgot another thing the troll needs a shiled like they used to in the 2007 castle line the sets always had shields for the minifigs and it could be better if it was 300 instead of 350 but yes it is a good impulse great army builder if this impulse set includes a troll shield my rating will defintely go higher this is a troll army builder set with minimum feature and limited weapons range if the troll comes with an armor or a shield i will think this set is worth it troll armor is hard to get by as it appeared only in troll warship and tower raid edited by whitefang 03 july 2008  0306 am	positive
grrr you beat me to it i got two of these in the mail today and was so eager to do a review of it thanks for saving me the work edited by wilhelm screamer 03 july 2008  0330 am	positive
hey your review is great as usual as for the set itself  well its an impulse set after all  small and cheap nothing special well the rat is special hehe for me the rat is the most interesting in the set cause i dont have a rat i dont have a troll warrior either but im not very interested	neutral
quote in addition the flick missile really works use a little bit of force from your finger and flick it the missile will fly well it certainly does not impress me at all with such playing feature something to toughen up kids fingers thanks for the review cant wait til i get this comes to oz	positive
whitefang on jul 3 2008 0406 am said i thought by calling it as a mouse it will be a little much friendly unlike calling it a rat why is mouse friendlier than rat	neutral
guys thanks for your kind comments it seemed most of us here love this impulse set mainly to build army guess i am a little bit too critic in my review i was expecting a little bit more nevertheless i intend to buy multiple sets of this and build on my orc armies and split them into different battalions this is indeed one of the better ways to acquire orcs wilhelm screamer on jul 3 2008 1130 am said i got two of these in the mail today and was so eager to do a review of it thanks for saving me the work opps i was eager to do a review as well when i bought these sets i hope you enjoyed reading this comprehensive review nikola bathory on jul 3 2008 0408 pm said hey your review is great as usual as for the set itself  well its an impulse set after all  small and cheap nothing special well the rat is special hehe for me the rat is the most interesting in the set cause i dont have a rat i dont have a troll warrior either but im not very interested give the new theme a chance i feel tlg have made an effort to revive certain elements that are present in past castle themes although it is not as good as the past but it is certainly better than the recent castle themes shoc on jul 4 2008 0100 am said why is mouse friendlier than rat well mouse sounded more friendly because it can associate with tom and jerry but calling it a rat equal calling it a pest its just a matter of putting it in different terms thats all edit instead of posting another post to explain why i used mouse i will write it here tom and jerry is reflected as a cartoon children associate jerry as a mouse since its supposed to be heartwarming and make us laugh in real life there are many different pets we raised one of the possible pets we considered is a mouse mouse are supposed to be shy and friendly creatures that live in harmony while rats lived in packs hunt food in the dark and is widely regarded as a pest in this review i am trying to illustrate rat and associate it with mouse by presenting it in a much friendly approach there is no right or wrong answer its just making use of different words to represent how i feel towards a particular thing edited by whitefang 04 july 2008  0808 am	positive
this is a nice way of building up orc armies but i do wish it was designed like the knight impulse set there you have a minifig enough weapons and armor for two figs and a weapons rack made out of basic pieces add a generic fig from your collection and you have two knights and the pieces from the rack can be easily used in mocs the pieces that make up the siege weapon in the orc impulse are not as easy to use in other creations id rather have seen a orcish weapons rack different from the knights rack but like it using basic elements with a second helmet another weapon the orc armor and a shield to put on it still although not as good as the knight impulse its a nice little set whitefang on jul 4 2008 0343 am said tom and jerry is reflected as a cartoon children associate jerry as a mouse since its supposed to be heartwarming and make us laugh in real life there are many different pets we raised one of the possible pets we considered is a mouse mouse are supposed to be shy and friendly creatures that live in harmony while rats lived in packs hunt food in the dark and is widely regarded as a pest where i come from people keep both as pets however if either are found in the house uninvited they are considered pests and if you look at the chinese zodiac rats are very well thought of and are symbols of prosperity the brick mouse rat	positive
hello all eurobricks members i will be doing a continuation of my impulse set reviews i was pretty excited when i laid my hands on these new impulse sets yesterday hope to give most of you a good insight for this set name street cleaner theme lego system  town  city year 2008 pieces 22 minifigs 1 an image of a 5620 street cleaner let the cleaning begin the street cleaner has a job to do it is to clean the rubbish on the streets after a new year countdown it seemed the cleaning agency have a new equipment to use its not as big as the previous street sweeper machine the cleaner will need to operate the equipment manually by pushing it look at the mess after sorting out look at the pieces offered its not a very complicated set since its an impulse set there are some pretty useful parts lying around such as the broom spade however i was quite surprised when i could not find the lid of the rubbish bin i cant used this rubbish bin to place it around my town without a lid on top of it i believed it is not a norm by not including the lid look at that bin well that rubbish bin seem to be containing his equipment in it instead of the rubbish the cleaners face looks pretty sad i think he wants to have a change of job front view i love that blue brush very much quite fun to play with especially pushing the rubbish aside thats why a spade is there to help him to dig out the litter and the broom to brush it away ok now i know why his face looks so sad where is that street sweeper machine summary review playability 6510 not bad to play with design 7510 the design is relatively interesting with the use of the technic part to be its foundation price 810 an inexpensive set to get another cleaner and some neat accessories overall 710 not a bad set after all pretty average but still quite good to buy if your towns required more cleaners hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine comments and critics are strongly welcomed pictures can be found in my brickshelfwhen moderated edited by whitefang 04 july 2008  0344 pm	positive

hello all eurobricks members this will be my last impulse set review for the second wave hope everyone of you will find my reviews useful and helpful in your purchase name crystal hawk theme lego system  mars mission year 2008 pieces 26 minifigs 1 an image of a 5619 crystal hawk alpha 3 in sector 5 reporting to base alpha 3 crystal hawk reporting for duty sir may i present mars mission latest scout craft code named crystal hawk this spacecraft looks very sleek and cool with its usual white and orange color combination i am not a fan of mars mission but these white minifigs simply attracted me for it in fact i only owned its impulse sets and none of its main sets nevertheless this set has the swoosh factor i was swooshing around in my home last night well i am not swooshing it like kimt though am i seeing double haha the answer is no it has double sided face i combined the pictures to illustrate the two facial expressions bits and pieces different angles love the way how the wings bend upwards and downwards the only thing i find it a little bit wierd for spacecraft normally i thought joystick is the typical navigation controls for a spacecraft instead of a steering wheel i am not complaining about a steering wheel in a spacecraft to me its quite an uncommon sight anyway the white steering wheel is an useful part for making vehicles mocs summary review playability 810 fun to play with when you bend the wings up and down design 8510 design is simple but creates a sleek and cool look price 810 an inexpensive set to get more scout craft and mars mission minifigs overall 8510 a very good set to have for any mars mission fans and for collectors like me whom cant afford all mars mission sets this set is a very great alternative hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine comments and critics are strongly welcomed pictures can be found in my brickshelf when moderated	positive
one of the better impulse sets imo	positive
thanks for pics the hawk it seems to me lacks a cockpit theres not even a seat to keep the pilot from falling off perhaps it theyd redesigned it to be a backpack jetpack sort of unit using similar pieces itd at least make some sense based on the other mm impluses can we assume this goes for 35usd at that price it seems to me that the astro fighter at 5usd was already a superior impluse set guess id buy one on clearance for the minifig	neutral
glad you enjoyed viewing the review xenologer on jul 3 2008 0112 pm said the hawk it seems to me lacks a cockpit theres not even a seat to keep the pilot from falling off perhaps it theyd redesigned it to be a backpack jetpack sort of unit using similar pieces itd at least make some sense these are some of the improvements which we can do it ourselves to mod it better i think these are great suggestions otherwise we can add in a white air tank to be included onto the minifig xenologer on jul 3 2008 0112 pm said based on the other mm impluses can we assume this goes for 35usd at that price it seems to me that the astro fighter at 5usd was already a superior impluse set guess id buy one on clearance for the minifig in sh crystal hawk is priced at usd 350 i bought mine at a much expensive price when you compared it with usd i never bought the astro fighter i am supposed that it comes with a little bit more parts and an additional alien fig with it	neutral
thanks for the great review now i just have to have that set	positive
i really like the look of this impulse set even though i sold off my mm sets to buy sw i kept my astro fighter and this impulse set really appealed from the moment i laid eyes on it i feel the swooshability and cool extras like the double sided face far outweigh the lack of cockpit thanks for another great review whitefang	positive
once again another outstanding review by sveltecorps i am not a very big fan of agents but this theme defintely offer plenty of useful parts this volcano base is simply fanastic for parts usage especially in doing up landscaping with mountains by making use of the brown burps i must admit that the exterior looks real cool but the interior looks rather empty these orange slopes certainly make a great illustration of the larva which gives the agents a hard time to infiltrate within its compound to save his comrade i am quite sure this set will defintely attracts lots of kids to coax their parents to buy it since the bright colors will defintely caught their attention with all those hitech sleek weaponary i am sure this is the next big thing for kids out there well i am not sure if this theme works for me as well but this set defintely works well for landscaping project	positive
droool must buy to sveltecorps how on this wonderful planet did you get that i thought it was coming in september	positive

excellent review sc thanks for sharing the figs are awesome i really like the female villain  an excellent face i also like the agent uniforms the laser gun is perfect it has that peter sellerspink panther dooms day device look that i envision when i think of laser destruction the volcano has some neat features as well like the trans redorange lava it is a bit heavy on stickers though as are many new setsthemes but overall i think this set will really appeal to the kids  a great review of a neat set	positive
thanks for the stepbystep set looks great mmmmm clawdette	positive
ah great review i have always wanted this set since it came out but with the price i think i will get the mobile command center first this will need serious interior mods like i did with my dino attack chopperpics soon	neutral
sveltecorps on jul 7 2008 1103 pm said thats the best pic i have at the moment apologies re blurriness cool he looks a lot meaner and more damagedterminatorsy that his brother	neutral
thanks for the review sveltecorps i have yet to purchase an agent set but i think that will change shortly i am not a big fan of the stickers but the huge laser gun the unique minifig design and beaucoup transorange pieces have me sold	positive

i didnt exactly know where this belongs the best but i think it fits the best in here cause its somewhat space related i got this nifty little set yesterday from an auction ebay new and sealed i think the rock raiders theme was a great theme and i wish they would have continues id back then but anyway lets see what we got here set nr 4910 name hover scout number of minifigs 1 number of pieces 39 release year 1999 first a picture of the little box  instructions a general overview of the set and here we have the lovely  miss jet yes the minifigures had odfficial names in this theme  the little vehicle and finally the crystal analysis station i like that very much even if its simple but it does a good job and the amount of equipment also is cool thats it little set little review but big fun i can recommend that to everybody its great for the parts and the minifig is lovely gets a 1010 from me	positive
excuse me butwhat	neutral
when i got this set my first rock raiders set i thought it was the best set i ever had maybe that was a little bit of an overstatement but i like a lot the pieces mainly and this is a nice little review are92 rowar on jul 10 2008 0822 pm said omg iamdeds torso  spoiler oh my god spoiler what would be more appropriate is commenting on iamdeds torso saying omg jets torso	positive
woo rock raiders only the best theme ever thats right possibly even better than castle 07 cheers for the review metalandi hopefully you can inspire others to see the greatness of rock raiders too i love how everything was so simple yet so effective it was loads of fun to play with and build the alternate models when i was younger as well and probably still is  do you plan of doing any other reviews or do you have any other sets rapid rider is another great small one adding a bit of diversity with a waterbased vehicle and you get the bandit minifig or you could get the rock raiders set and get all of our spelunking friends dont make me name them all  or if you want a slightly bigger set loader dozer could be the way to go axles a pretty cool minifig too and you get a rock monster sorry if the last comments were detracting from your review dont think i didnt like it becuase it was great i really hope you can do more oh and yes my torso does come from a female fig peace	positive
unfortunately i dont have any other sets yet i think i got one of the bigger vehicles back in the time but i dont have any sets from this time anymore but i certainly plan to get the loader dozer andor the chrome crusher soon i found an ebay auction where somebody is selling the sets 4940 4950 and 4970 new  sealed hopefully i have luck with that its only at 4 euros right now but its still running 6 days httpcgiebaydewtaitih005	neutral
sinner on jul 20 2008 0456 pm said i consider rock raiders space too i also consider many of the diver themes space as well me too the rock raiders are very scifi with the best lego space storyline the aquazonies would be inner space rather than outer space though but they look very spacey edited by shoc 20 july 2008  0745 pm	neutral
7663 sith infiltrator year 2007 number of pieces 310 number of minifigs 1 price 2999 usd brickset hello everyone and welcome to my second review on eurobricks the sith infiltrator lets start with a pic of the box shall we as you can see its a limited edition set meaning the fig and set could be worth a lot in the future this set takes about 20 minuets for the seasoned builder an overview of the infiltrator also know as the scimitar as seen in the picture this ship is very sleek with very few studs on top snot studs not on top basically its the cockpit with two wings with two fins on each wing attached to the hull heres a side view of the scimitar very cool looking it lands on two feet in the front while the cockpit rests on the ground rear view the back the outer cockpit is beautiful a printed piece on the back no dreaded sticker sheet dss and a large printed disc on top heres a look at the middle there is a flickfire missile transred cone attach to technic pin on the inner wing a transred lightsaber blade in the back of the hull and a transred lightsaber blade in between the fins on either side all of those lightsaber blades may come in handy hey look the fins open from the wings the fins open due to double hinges on each fin unfortunately you have to hold the ship up in order for the bottom fins to open now lets have a look inside the cockpit to open you lift the back printed part which is attached to the printed disc on top which is attached to a hinge it opens pretty smoothly but is somewhat loose so sometimes it closes on its own also the disc isnt secured well enough to the door and often breaks off even with the smallest movement to it inside there is an elevated control panel and two sliding pieces near the floor this ship also comes with a small speeder bike its very cleverly built and is a really neat addition see that clear disc on the bottom it fits perfectly into the sliding pieces in the cockpit hmm whats this a hidden compartment now this was a very cool idea by tlg a secret compartment found by taking off the top slope of the hull contains darth mauls weapons and tools which include a chrome lightsaber hilt a pair of electrobinouculars and three probe droids a closeup of a probe droid just a plain black minifig head with a black lever on top finally the fig darth maul in the flesh plastic a good fig altogether with a black hood and lightsaber blades taken from the ship he did come with a crisp new black cape packaged in a small white cardboard box but i am currently using it for another fig note that this is a limited edition fig so stock up a comparison pic of the two mauls the 2007 version is on the left and the 1999 version on the right note a few key differences between the two the new one has smaller red tattoos and a smoother torso also the new one has bigger eyes and a more cartoony look maul on the speeder bike of course he fits perfectly in the cockpit wile sitting on the bike and he can reach the controls well thats about it here is the final verdict build 810 easy and fun breaks every once in a while playability 710 this set has many features but is very fragile between the cockpit and hull and between the two cockpit pieces swooshability 110 too fragile to fly around plus the flick fire missiles fall out minifigs 910 a great fig with a chrome hilt and a double sided blade a little cartoony design 710 very clever techniques very sleek but very fragile price 810 fair enough could be a few dollars cheaper overall score 6510 a very sleek ship with clever building and play techniques but very very fragile and shouldnt be picked up off of the shelf too often and with that my review is over but all of yours are not comments and thoughts very welcome edited by jimbutcher 15 september 2008  0259 am indexed	neutral

jimbutcher on jul 10 2008 0944 pm said a hidden compartment now this was a very cool idea by tlg a secret compartment found by taking off the top slope of the hull youre supposed to slide the front of the hull off rather than lift the top piece off	neutral
ill be honest  i dont like this ship at all its one of my least favourite ships in the pt and i have to yet buy either one of those sets i also found it funny that this set was meant to be a walmart exclusive yet never appeared on the shelves at my walmart anyhow thanks for the review	negative
led zeppelin on jul 10 2008 0446 pm said youre supposed to slide the front of the hull off rather than lift the top piece off yeah i was looking at the construction booklet and it reminded me of that i forgot about it but that makes it more fragile	neutral
i got this set last year and i think you made a mistake when you have remove a piece to access the probe droids and equipment you just have to slide the entire main part and i have a question is this equipped with the new flickfire missiles that dont fall off	neutral

a very neatly designed sith infiltrator though i think it lacks the size of the older version a fine ship but not what i would call a sith infiltrator it should be bigger thanks for another fine sw review kimt	negative
hey all so i purchased the remaining three agents sets i needed and saw that there was no review up yet for this set heres the first batch of parts and the first instruction bits the mini figures the first small vehicles heres a mistake that i found in the instruction booklet there is no difference between steps 2 and 3 the team inferno boat this is a nice chunky boat that looks fairly heavy duty and evily its nice to see the smooth disks on the bottom that lego seemingly havnt done in recent boatplane sets and the agents submarine this is a nice build aswell nice and long with a few hidden compartments one for missiles a place to put the treasure some final shots of the completed set the spare bits another special mention has to go out to slime face i think he is my favourite ever lego character the detail on his unique torso is brilliant his head is fantastic and his costume just looks great with the black and green plus green is my favourite colour check out the back of his torso with the slime pouring down deep sea quest was £3499 price  910  this is a pretty reasonable price for a fairly substantial set parts  810  a lot of nice bits few nice boats bits and a lot of smooth disk things minifigures  1010 as i said slime face is my favourite lego character and the details brilliant vehicles  810 both very good with some interesting features build  810 a pretty fun build overall  910 its gotta be if just for slime face alone but this really is a great set	positive
im not real fond of slimeface he looks too much like the jokerbombs i was hoping for something newer the slime printing is a nice touch though steve	negative
thanks for reviewi hope svelt corps still reviews it  slime is pretty cool i knew about the torse for a while but its no less cool now	positive
nice review rezourceman i wanted to see one of this set it seems there isnt much to it other than what it looks like in the official pictures but i may well get it i like slime face	neutral
great review rezourceman your pics really show off the sub well and its good to see the build in progress i also have this set but i didnt apply stickers to the sub as i was planning to reuse the nice dark blue pieces however as shown in your review they do brighten it up a fair bit i cant say this is my favourite agents set the boat is a little oddly proportioned and the sub although retro looking has practically no interior and would be difficult to customise to put more in unlike say the clever job batbrick did with the penguin sub in his review the sub kind of looks like some jules verneish sea creature  i would have liked it if theyd gone all the way and made it some kind of giant robot jellyfish or squid i do agree with you about slime face  he has a fantastic torso with all the slime dripping down which is a bit obscured by the air tank its really encouraging that in the last 2 missions weve had great extra villains added in the only thing i would add about the octopus is that the glow in the dark plastic is mixed in unevenly with the aqua blue so it doesnt glow in the dark evenly  its kind of like the mars mission jellies in that respect though much cooler thanks again for the great review	negative
darthlegois on jul 11 2008 1028 am said color0000ff coughalphateamcough id forgotten about ogels mutant vehicles i guess i meant a bigger cross between the 8636 sub and the big squid from 7775 aquabase invasion  that is such a great design sort of keep the retro feel but make it bigger with the 8636 sub theres really only room for one agent to sit and despite its size theres just a few not amazingly great functions such as the hidden chest and missiles	positive
thanks for the review its great to see detailed pictures of slime face the set looks good but not as good as some of the others in this line great review	neutral
it was £3499 so usd its likely to be 4555 i would imagine	neutral
nice review thanks tlc is really going allout with the agents theme i wonder if it will last longer than one year unlike other recent oneanddone themes my only real criticism of the theme is those freaking stickers my god look at the size of that dss in this set	positive
great review this set totally owns alpha team deep sea the sub design actually looks like a sub the figures are way better the acessories are better  everything is better agents may have my vote for the best theme of the year quote i wonder if it will last longer than one year unlike other recent oneanddone themes oh dont worry  a second wave will be coming next year this was confirmed by both legomilk and in an interview with an agents designer	positive
aside from the price i love this set when i saw the prelim pics of agetns i did not like the theme but all the sets are starting to look more attractive now i can see the cool features and details as for this set i really like the badguy boat for some reason and the submarine looks good  i love the dark blue colour	positive
i forgot to comment on this review great job rezourceman like sveltecorps said your pics really show off the set and what there is to it i just ordered this and the volcano base off sh and i cant wait for them to come so ill comment on these reviews i forgot about i love the inferno boat as you say in your review it looks very heavy duty and ready to take on the agents the sub i quite like from the look of it though there is the problem of too little space i will try and correct that the dark blue is especially good and i love slime face his torso is very cool sveltecorps on jul 11 2008 0914 am said i cant say this is my favourite agents set the boat is a little oddly proportioned and the sub although retro looking has practically no interior and would be difficult to customise to put more in unlike say the clever job batbrick did with the penguin sub in his review wow thanks for that little mention is it impossible or just very hard to mod sveltecorps on jul 11 2008 0914 am said i do agree with you about slime face  he has a fantastic torso with all the slime dripping down which is a bit obscured by the air tank its really encouraging that in the last 2 missions weve had great extra villains added in the only thing i would add about the octopus is that the glow in the dark plastic is mixed in unevenly with the aqua blue so it doesnt glow in the dark evenly  its kind of like the mars mission jellies in that respect though much cooler the octopus sounds great thanks for that is he meant to be on any side im guessing hes a mutant inferno creature about slime face is his head much different to the joker bombs i know he has slime marks on his head are they very apparent thanks again for the review batbrick away	positive
wow thanks for the review that is one awesome set slime face is excellent i must add him to the collection i think we need some new agents theres so many inferno minifigures now maybe next year thanks again	positive
great looking set and that glowy blue octopus is really cute i might just get it for that be great in a space moc wondering from the pdf instructions i saw it wasnt clear what the agent in the sub is sitting on hows his seat work and it looks like theres a compartment below him	positive

6927 all terrain vehicle year released 1981 piece count 167 minifigs 2 list price 1450 a very unique vehicle in the classic space collection was this allterrain vehicle which i always considered more along the line of a mobile lab the set introducedinfused white and black bricks with classic blue space pieces the result was this great classic vehicle the set includes two figs still red and white heres a view of the vehicle which is really two components the vehicle itself and the lab section i absolutely loved the the blue windshield slopes 2 included and the unique upsidedown large blue slope in the back of the vehicle is the blue lab the back section of the vehicle has hinges that allow the jets sections to open the brick design fits perfectly into the lab and when opened the lab falls to the ground note the little round trans red 1x1s allow the lab to slide up and forward when the jet sections are closed i tried taking off the red 1x1s and the lab does not lift as easily with them the design is very clever esp for a classic set heres a shot of the standalone lab unlike earlier classic space windows this set has train window frames with yellow windows the top of the lab lifts up for playability inside the lab are several computers and a swivel chair back to the vehicle heres a shot of the cockpit with white steering wheel the left side has an upsidedown wrench and black antenna the right side a walkietalkie and another antenna the antennas can be used as breaks to keep the middle wheels from moving heres ashot of the under carriage and a final shot of the complete set for those of you following my classic space reviews this is review number 9 of 10 my final review of anall time favorite will be coming soon hope you enjoyed this review comments are always welcome	positive

this is a great little set i like how it combines two very different color schemes for different parts of the model i have made some slight modifications to mine adding a roof on the vehicle and a back wall on the outpost also those white 1x1 headlight plates at the front are thinner than the modern kind and seem to be quite weak i got this set off ebay a while ago and one of them was broken in shipping even though the set was otherwise in display model condition and the other one broke off while i was building the set i replaced them with the newer variety mutex on jul 10 2008 1137 pm said my only complain about this set was that i found that the wheels where too small  i had some trouble passing the rover over the little cratersmountains of the space plates the only bad thing about this set is the name it cant even roll over a single plates height not very all terrain at all edited by cp5670 11 july 2008  0743 am	positive

oh man this review takes me back i got this set when i was 8 years old and loved it i remember modding it to remove the lab in the back and i put in a giant laser cannon instead cause when youre 8 years old everything needs a giant laser cannon cp5670 on jul 11 2008 1243 am said the only bad thing about this set is the name it cant even roll over a single plates height not very all terrain at all ha very true the vehicle is built so low to the ground that the front end catches on everything	positive
ive always associated this set with 6929 the voyager theyre of the same timeframe and more or less the same style 6927 is without any doubt my favourite ground vehicle of space it was pretty simple but it was such a creative set the stories you could tell with this model g most defenitely in my top 5 of space sets	positive
this set never got me as a kid i suspect it was because of the wheels i had mostly basic sets so it would have been more of the same looking at it now i can see i have misjudged it and i love the lablift method im going to have to build this to see it in action thanks for another great review	positive
great review allterrain vehicle was one of my two favorite lego sets ever i have to include a shot of the back of the box because i love the ideas lego provided for this set hewman on jul 11 2008 0111 am said very nice blacktronthemed 6927 cp5670 on jul 11 2008 0139 pm said i just modified mine to make everything fully enclosed i love your modified 6927 with the enclosed front 2 weeks ago i modified my allterrain vehicle as well in a similar way but just slightly more modified from the original i call it 6927c allterrain vehicle improved class a few clues for anyone to easily build this themselves also a much more extensive modificationmoc that i call 6927w allterrain warrior quote 6927w allterrain warrior i wanted to make a combat variant of 6927 so i used the 6927c improved class as the starting point and went from there i added a completely new forwardcab close to the ground for a groundobserver to monitor the terrain i added even larger wheels allowing this variant to truly be all terrain besides what good is it having a combat vehicle if it gets stuck in the middle of a firefight the 6927w has a five man crew a driver a gunner who also serves as overallcommander a terrain observer in the very front in the lab are the weapons systems officer and computertech specialist the allterrain warrior vehicle portion is armed with lasers and blaster cannons with options for other weapons there are shortrange nuclear rockets on the lab guided by the rader control the lab now has blastproof shutters on the windows protecting the crew from rocket blast additional protection can be added to the lab ifneedbe such as more extensive blastshielding allinall the allterrain warrior is a beast of a machine two 6927s can protect an entire convoy of standard 6927 or 6927c these are my very first attempts at modification and doing a moc of classic space lego edited by parallaxscroll 29 august 2009  0303 am	neutral

yeah first time that i am getting a set before everyone first of all the package the european version has no limited edition button hooray sorry for the blurry backshot we see the hospital back a few bubbles with set functions and a little comic comic bubbles the figures are injured spongebob patrick and the new fish doctor spongebob has a headprint and a backprint other than the normal spongebob spongebob and injured bob the set comes with two litters the ambulance car is a bit extraordinary i don´t know how the car is like in the show and i saw a lot of episodes but it looks a bit strange mostly because the weehls are too small of course we get another ss not so d this time the litter fits in the back with help of this lid i wish it would be the hingelid from before 2004 now we come to the meanpart of the set the hospital the entrance has got babyblue traindoors and a hudge sign that shows emergency the tubes are nearly everywhere in this set i was getting insane when i came to the part where i must put the stickers on the tubes this parts are very usefull but i wanted that the set looks good because i will display it so i stickered just two of the parts and not all four now we come to the interroir the doctor has a desk with computer sadly it´s not very well placed and he must duck because of his fin next to the door we get this little case wash basin and two drawers again we get stickers not that i don´t like stickers it´s just everytime i get to the part where i must put the stickers on i think how i can reuse the model and if i rebuild the model later and and and i hate it to deside a few posters are in it too the set is a great addittion to your own bikino bottom but the playability is not very big for the kids they can just play that patrick steals the ambulance car like shown on the package and is hitting spongebob than the drive back the doctor gives spongebob two medicines and let him go i bought the set mostly because of the parts tubes in lightbley and a few woodpieces but i am thinking about let it stand in my little bikini bottom just consist of crusty crab and chum bucket playability 310 figures 1010 price 810 design 910 total 3040	positive

i never have buy a sponge bob set but this looks so cool so maybe just maybe i will buy it  i am curious of why tlc haven´t done the flying dutchman ship it was in the first rumor list of sponge bob sets that surely will be a must 	neutral
im not a huge fan of spongebob but this set i might want also have maybe i can combine it with the city hospital	positive
this set doesnt have much playability but the hospital is better than the one released by lego recently it has more detail i like it	neutral
thanks navy trooper fenson for the review  good one  i really like that sb is printed i will need to get this one when i go to the us in two weeks copmike	positive
nice review nft i´m not that much into spongebob but these two pieces just for themselves are interesting to get container cupboard 4532 and cupboard drawer 4536 the latter not being sold for the last 6 years both together are an excellent way to create detailed interiors 6 of those for me please	positive
theres a lot great pieces in this set i would be willing to get the set just for them thanks for the great review	positive
my fish doctor has the torso from 7902 doctors car which is unfortunate because the other torso is more stylized and cartoonish i think however i did have that mad scientist lab set so a bit of digging through my old collection will hopefully yield the better torso	neutral
yay its good to see your kids get to build some stuff too sinner  all through the review i was thinking this was a present  but who actually put it together so im glad the last pic cleared things up as for the set  it looks much bigger than i expected  i think it does make a good sized dollhouse there are a stack of nice pieces in there  cupboards oven transblue 2x5 bricks all the accessories plants flowers food the lightup brick the pink roof slopes  but not enough to justify the aud129 retail price maybe on sale id pick it up and resell the belville figs but david jones hasnt even had a regular 20 off lego sale for the whole of this year that ive seen i think the playful puppy set is a horrendous ripoff for aud20 though i agree with the baby catapult  the range is terrible lego just isnt trying any more is it at least theyve moved on from throwing cats off three storey buildings 2 questions though 1 was it a fun build 2 are those large figs anatomically correct under their froufrou finery if not what the hell are they doing in the second pic whilst baby sylvia explores the oven	neutral
baby catapult you say puts a basenet to shame top review by the way lego drink bottles for the win edited by mrs pegleg blockbeard 12 july 2008  0637 am	positive
great review and i note something like a bucket in the dog set shame its not blue as for the fire place piece i love it and i want one ever since finding it on mlcad i love the bbq it looks so good you know i might even buy this it it was not so pink now as for the kiddies in ovens make sure they are not over cooked they can be stringy  and as for the couple up stairs now we at least know what you do with your mini figs when no one is looking lego sets in public places  just following your name sake i guess and i must say lego shame shame that catapult needs reviwing hardly even make a dent in a castle wall regards cpt pb	positive
i was sort of hoping for a flickfire baby still this looks decent for what it is i guess obviously it really is all about the accessories and its got em but not enough to make me spend that kind of cash and i dont even mind having a pile of pink parts around if you throw in a complete turkey or some birthday cakes its a slam dunk but as it is eh thanks for the review though its very nicely presented and leaves no doubt in my mind as to just how easy this set would be to misuse for other purposes	neutral
nice review good to see your almost letting your kids play with your lego i like the functionality of the baby catapult its good that they include some working features in a build this big are you not showing the figures because its really hugh hefners playboybelville mansion i dont see the grotto though must be an add on set like the poor puppy its just so darn pink	positive

sinner you know i had never seen a belville set in any review with such great pictures before i just cant take my eyes off in the master bedroom the scene is quite a little hot enough of me peeping up there lets take a look at the interior i am very surprised by its construction of the house its quite big and is nice of you to buy a great sweet gift for your daughter i am very sure she will enjoyed playing with it somehow it reminded me of barbie doll products maybe its too pinkish for me the accessories is the plus factor in any belville sets it offered quite a handful of great accessories to add into any types of mocs construction to add in the plus factor in it sinner you are a very nice dad i like how parents buy educational toys for their children to expand their imaginations instead of sitting in a couch playing video games and etc	positive

im confused the finale of big brother australia was last week so why only now are we seeing pictures of housemates brigette and ben performing a striptease and where is rory in his signature gstring very odd	neutral
i bought this today mainly because it was 25 off but id been eyeing it for a long time the accessories truly are brilliant theres so much here to be pillaged for other uses as people have said i picked up heaps of new parts ive never had or rare ones in even rarer colours to be honest i was surprised and impressed by the range and versatility of the regular bricks as well when you look at the box art what jumps out at you are the giant pink walls and curved pieces but theres a nice amount of white arches and lime green bricks not to mention all the windows and the trans blue 1x2x5 bricks and plants its a good thing the target audience likes stickers though theres more here than ive seen on any set except the 7709 sentai fortress i think they were aiming for one sticker per page of instructions i hope belville returns in 2010 thanks for the review sieggy did your daughter ever go back to it	positive

7655 clone battle pack year 2007 number of pieces 58 number of minifigs 4 price 999 usd brickset welcome to my third review on eurobricks i hope you enjoy while at any store that sells lego target walmart tru etc you will notice that the clone battle packs on the shelf are way fewer in number than the droids battle pack as you might guess the clones are way more popular and finding them gets harder and harder as the release date of this set goes farther into the past so stock up alright heres a pic of the box a small box as expected for inexpensive sets like these note the build your army button on the front tlg obviously is encouraging customers to buy multiples and with good reason which will be explained later in this review well lets get straight to it the contents of this set you will notice a speeder bike a gun turret and some clones looking good so far lets have a look at the turret an excellent star wars element to have around especially for mocing it is very cleverly built using a tire guard from city sets for the general shape of the turret mount all you have to do is attach the new mold explained later gun to the 2x1 plate with the center stud and presto i wonder how the clones build these turrets to fast in the middle of battle a rear view with a clone mounted my only gripe about the turret is that you have to take off the gun in order for every clone to have a gun now we move on to the vehicle of the set the speeder bike a rather sleek and good looking bike with some useful pieces on it as well such as the blue cones the megaphones and the engines some say it looks bare without the figs mounted on it but i think it looks just fine the commander drives while a trooper shoots on the back a side view and a rear view my only gripe is the same as the turret you have to remove the back gun for all the clones to have weapons while on foot the back pistol attaches to a 2x2 round studded plate with a technic hole in the middle finnaly here are the new guns this set comes with 1 new blaster rifle and three new pistols it could have included one more rifle for the turret and of course the figs includes 1 yellow commander lovely fig 1 shocktrooper comes with a pair of elctrobinouculars and two regular troopers so clean and white the figs are excellent all that any sw or lego fan should want it could have maybe included one more regular trooper but that might be pushing it thats all for now folks here is the final verdict build 810 extremely easy should take the seasoned builder about 5 minutes to complete a fun build though playability 510 i guess you can get this with the droid battle pack and make them battle but this set has no real play features of its own but it is good for collecting troops and using them for mocs swooshability 910 i guess you can zoom the speeder bike around minifigs 1010 four great figs that should be bought in multiples a great army builder design 1010 a clever turret an awesome speeder and four great clones what more do you need in a 10 dollar set price 810 not bad i suppose but if you calculate a dime for each piece this set should come out to 56 dollars but still billions of these are being sold worldwide and tlg is making a ton of money off of them overall score 9510 a truly memorable set one that will be a favorite for ages to come and very popular a great army builder for a small price plus vehicle and turret with only a few very minor flaws this set is one of the best of star wars and this concludes my review and as always comments are most welcome	positive
i got like 5 of theses hope we get the new clone battlepack do you ever think we will we will only get 5 clones if you buy all the new republic sets	positive

7654 droids battle pack year 2007 number of pieces 102 number of minifigs 7 price 999 usd brickset hi everybody and welcome to my fourth review on eurobricks today i will review the droid bttle pack set note this set originally came with four megaphone blasters for each battle droid but i replaced them along with the crooked arms with the new blaster pistols and new twisted arms a picture of the box as it is on the shelves of majorretail stores a small box as expected for inexpensive sets like these note the build your army button on the front tlg obviously is encouraging customers to buy multiples and with good reason which will be explained later in this review an overview of the sets content you can see a droid carrying vehicle a stap and some battle super battle droids a look at the carrier a light tank note the guns on the front the guns and cockpit can turn a little bit left and right from the main body also the guns can move up and down free from the cockpit and check out the cockpit two 2x1 center studded plates side by side for the pilot to stand on now moving on to the stap a small very useful vehicle in the sw universe these are seen frequently in both the movies and games as well as other multimedia the design is very clever using vertical building and a clear stand rear view the guns handlebars can go this far back and finally the figs the figs are very good but very common we havent seen sbds in a while and now instead of metallic blue they are metallic dark grey the worst part of this set is that the battle droids have the old arms and guns while the droids in the mtt and clone pack both of the same year as this have the new ones i wonder why tlg decided to do that again this set originally came with four megaphone blasters for each battle droid but i replaced them along with the crooked arms with the new blaster pistols and new twisted arms so thats about it heres the final verdict build 810 very easy should take the seasoned builder about 510 minutes playability 610 has a few play feature but nothing exciting is good for mocs and army building swooshability 810 i suppose you could fly around the stap minifigs 710 the battle droids are good but very common and the dont come with new arms or guns the sbds are very nice and in a new color all figs are great for army building design 810 the stap was clever but the carrier was a little bulky price 1010 as fair as it gets overall 7510 the figs are great to have and make mocs and armies and the vehicles are pretty cool the carrier is a little lame the main problem with this set is that the bds dont get the new guns or arms so they dont fit in with all the new sets also droids arent as cool as clones but the price is very fair and now my review has ended unfortunately i believe this will be my last review for a long time for two reasons one the remaining sets that arent done according to kimts index i either dont have or are broken or have missing pieces and two my budget is low right now and i wont be able to get the clone wars sets right when they are released so someone will probably beat me to reviewing them too bad because i would love to do an rgs review well as always comments very welcome	positive

love this set nice review also i had the set in my hands a few times but never bought it though i drooled at it i remember i guess i didnt get pocket money at that time it was not that common around europe in the 80s i guess so better to say that no one bought it for me a few years later i got the safari truck which is also really sweet i like the colors of this model and the detail of it the minifig is really classic made only for this set appears in some later train sets as well and shows the exact image of the truck on the shirt including the motor piece one of the most detailed and loveliest little sets from a sweet era of legoland city ps voted o for outstanding edited by zzz 14 july 2008  0950 am	positive
hmmm i probably would not have bought this as a kid in 1987 unless i had money to spare or the shop had no other set from space or castle the two other big lines in 1987 and no better set in the town section i think its a great parts pack but the model itself does not look very attractive i never really liked those wheels honestly theyre from the basic sets mostly and they work pretty well in those but im just not a fan the roof on the other hand was very popular and the blue modified bricks at the front were quite rare in those days but generally speaking this was not the star of 1987 gave it a 3	negative

minibump wow id completely forgotten about this theme which is suprising since i absolutely loved this theme as a kid minus the sound n light brick which i thought was pretty big and ugly sure brings back memories of looking at those little catalogue booklets that came with the sets	positive
i had never seen this set or this theme before it was released during my dark age and i had missed it its nice to see such sets surface once again to educate members like me that there are some good sets we had missed during the dark age and i must admit that this is a very good set its comes with 3 minifigs and staudie with it geez i never thought he was an astronaunt back then the testing facility is great and i love to see it spin by putting staudie in it for a testrun the buggy is cute as well but somehow i dont really like the white frame at the back it looked a little odd to me the tools are simply wonderful to have furthermore these are grey tools the last time we had so many tools are the aeroplane mechanic the shuttle is nice but does the shuttle supposed to come with a cover as well i guess since this is a simulator they must have cut down the budget for it the control room is good and it will be even better with chairs included metalandi thanks for the wonderful review	neutral
thank you very much for the review now i remember i got mission control when i was only 5 and built it with the help of my older sister i loved it so much i never rebuilt it but now i just have to space simulation was one i never got but looks to be a great set	neutral

the base of the propeller it wobbles a bit but doesnt fall off very sturdy right side of the rear propeller and the left and better side the tail it uses construction similar to the xwings nose but on a larger scale definitely cool a very neat part of the copter the guns are constructed so that  they turn without turning the cockpit the interior is rather blase though	positive
another of my favorite parts  landing gear this is the front section  and it retracts unlike most ships with landing gear this does not retract without effort coughxwingcough very sleek the back landing gear  and again smooth retraction gotta love it final score 8410 parts 810 figs 1010 dinos 210 copter 910 value 710 dont buy if  you can wait for vikings  you dont like any set with stickers  youre not a space fan buy if  youre a space fan  you dont mind stickersdont apply them  youre like to create cool figures overall i think it was worth the price even at 605 pieces however id suggest buying vikings even considering this well hope this review unexpected as it was  helped someone out there until next time bloody jay	positive

yeah i picked up another one i really liked the chopper lets cut straight to the chase dinos first the worst of course these things are so horrible they dont deserve more than one photo theyre rubbery one piece and the only things that remotely indicate that theyre made by lego are the holes on the bottom of their feet theyre unrealistic to an extreme unmatched by even the previously reviewed dinos in that they are waaaaaaaay too thin one is pink and theyre all grinning fig one interesting thing to note is that this one has the same torso as the ironmasked dude in the chopper not his own barearms torso pic for the sake of comparison now i dont consider this fig as good as the others because the other heads are useful for vikings and assorted castletype people but this has sunglasses all in all youll probably find it useful but i dont still great torso for special ops stuff hummer those headlights  while stickers yes all prints are again stickers although there are much less than the chopper  are great pieces i can see using them as furnace covers or stove burners the windshieldhood area not much to say about this one drivers side my question when this is brought to europe will the steering wheel switch sides  seriously though i love that little steering wheel piece more than i love taffy and im a man who enjoys his taffy left side in its entirety  and the right side view through the right side  no seat here couldve done with another fig to fill the nonexistant seat as well	positive
the weapon whatever its called this uses the same mechanism as the longboat for those that dont have either you snap the little sports stand thing which hits the missile which fires and since theres nothing holding the technic beam up to that height any more it drops down so that the next missile drops into place pretty cool if unrealistic the two on the side do not fire i think theyre mainly there for extra ammo my biggest problem with this set open bed this could have easily been remedied with a few plates interior opened the fire hammer next to the t1 they look very cool together dont they you can also see my curio shelf final score 7410 dinos 110 fig 810 but thats just me hummer 8510 parts 910 im a harsh reviewer i still think that if spacevehicles are your thing you should buy this however if youre a bigger castle fan or just like to get all sorts of lego i would still suggest buying the viking catapult before this however i do think that these are some of the coolest sets of 2005 this is something you will eventually want to get until next time bloody jay	positive
mr legobildur on jul 25 2005 1053 pm said sorry for the double post but i just had another question in mind how longhighwide is this badass copter including rotors have have heard of as long as 25 inches for the length but is this true or is it just an exaggeration 25 long and the rotors are 10 long each making it 20 wide hope that helps	neutral
wow i think this is the first time im the first to have a new set at least here and review it got it 2 days ago thanks to a fast shipping from sh this time and i found time now to review it now enough of the babbling lets let the facts and pictures speak which actually turned out pretty well this time set nr 4210 name coast guard platform number of minifigs 4 number of pieces 469 release year 2008 a few shots of the box first 2 books of instructions we got here first one for the helicopter second one for the rest and the platform itself a general overview of the platform from above the 4 minifigs 3 rescue guys and one oil rig worker  the pilot seems not very happy that he has to work in the middle of nowhere at sea right beside the entry of the tower we have the diving equipment holder next the guy can jump in this little speedboat and another guy brings it down to water with the crane if somebody is rescued from the air he arrives here and is brought to the tower with the little moving platform than runs on rails down under we got a buoy and several life belts and extinguishers with the lift somebody who is rescued by the boat can be brought up i think it would been better if they would have made a mechanism there to bring it up but its okay a few floors higher the sea is being observated and watched on the ground level we have the medical stationwarmup room the helicopter as standalone all in all for me this is besides the police station the city set of this year its got great features and looks fantastic and also has many useful pieces you cant do anything wrong with buying it 1010 for me thats all for now hope you liked my review edit oh damn i forgot to write review in the topic title can a mod please add this thanks	positive
i love this set and i wish i thought of the bridge piece idea the only part i dont like is the lift thanks for the great review metalandi on jul 18 2008 0653 pm said edit oh damn i forgot to write review in the topic title can a mod please add this thanks done	positive
seeing the pictures in this review certainly reinforce my original thoughts on this set heres an oilrig mod waiting to happen	neutral
very nice review and nice set to boot lots of little features that increase the playability great pics too i remember you had trouble before with the tower raid castle set as i just got mine and was looking to review it but saw your review in archivesshakes fist at how slow aussies get sets  great reviews on	positive
excellent review metalandi its always great to see early pictures of new sets this set really reminds me of an oil rig and could probably be easily modified as one if one wanted an alternate model the two components that i like most are the boat crane and the control room but other sections are pretty slick as well are those printed pieces in the control room or stickers im really starting to gain an appreciation for these new coast guard sets theyve come a long way over the years 575 coast guard station released 1978 i picked up the control boat  tower 7739 a few weeks ago but havent opened it yet in any case thanks for taking the time to review this set and share it over eb	positive

thanks for the great review im loving this set a lot  it looks well designed and the helicopter is awesome plus i love the new worker figure with the beard quote i agree this is a great set  one of the best of the cg line for sure way better than the boat set with the tower on the bionicle baseplate i wouldnt say that at all  true this base is bigger but the other set was well designed as well  plus the included boat is wonderful	positive

sveltecorps on jul 18 2008 0822 pm said thanks for the awesome review metalandi your pics are very clear and you go into detail about all the functions of the set i agree this is a great set  one of the best of the cg line for sure way better than the boat set with the tower on the bionicle baseplate and cheaper too i even like the helicopter better than the oversized version lots of great parts and a really nice build by the looks of it too i cant wait for this to be released in oz yea great review metalandi but i fail too see how this will be in my budget as well as most of the agents sets  atte rgs  v19  i also agree with svelte i like this little chopper better then the big one and it actualy has a place to stay instead of the big one theres no landing pad for the big one too go on in any cg set so far and its only 80 ausd	neutral
i agree with both of you first i have to add that a few of the stickers were a bit annoying as it comes to put them on espacially the ones on the helicopter where you have to put them on round parts but i didnt really see this at a bad point i really can live with it second it was a very hard decision believe it or not on which new set to buy cause i got a huge 2008 setwantlist i guess itll take some time before i can get most of the other sets i want	neutral

tenorikuma on jul 19 2008 0826 pm said sorry i mean physical retail stores toysrus etc as opposed to online stores like shophome can you walk into a shop in brisbane and buy this set off the shelf if so ill get my wife to buy me one when she visits the land down under next month well some sets this cg platform is one of them a store exclusive to toys r us but most cg and all other lego can be found in shops like target bigw kmart myer mrtoys toy world  david jones  then there is toys r us of course but they are usualy abit more expensive then other retailers but they usualy have the exclusive sets like this one and its funny you are from japan because iam going there in september with my dad hes a missionary and i was wondering where i can find lego in japan since i have not been to japan since 2001 and i was not into lego much then im sure you guys have a toys r us right	neutral
thats a great review of a great city set thank you very much metalandi first of all i wanted to buy the 7999 cg petrol boat  tower but now i surely will buy this amazing platform instead of the 7999 if my local toy seller sells the 4210 reason 4210 is something very unusual set i think we wont get a set similar to that in the next 20 years and because of i dont like the petrol boat inside no backwalls  nearly no interior  klausdieter	positive
great review metalandi thanks for posting it with a number of pictures the only question is why lego decided to produce so many sets i want to buy in one year	neutral
paramedic unit set  6364 year released 1980 piece count 140 minifigs 2 list price unknown well let me first say that the english name paramedic unit is not really a good name for this set the function of a paramedic is to take a patient from an emergent situation and deliver them to a hospital for treatment generally an emergency room this is a rather small clinic that i would imagine is more for family care than an emergency room in addition the car looks more like a doctornurses car rather than an ambulance or emergency response vehicle i would call this a clinic rather than a paramedic unit in any case its a great set esp for table towns that need medical services what i like is that this set is small enough to place anywhere in your lego city or town starting with the instructions like all the classic town sets alternate models are pictured although i never tried building one i like the little medical busvan the set includes two minifigs that include a female doctore or nurse and what i presume is a patient based on the torsos i really like the vehicle its a 4stud wide two seater the colors work well and i like the use of the white bar between the seats and the 1x1 blue plates for lights unfortunately the emblems are stickers heres a shot of the neat little clinic i like the use of the blinds for the exam room it shows that lego considered patient privacy when making this set the interior includes an exam room desk and two blue swivel chairs and a neat little eye chart although the letters l e g o would have made a nice touch lastly a picture of the complete set i must admit that i remember buying this set back in the 80s and i regreted it after taking it home im not sure what i didnt like about it perhaps the girl back then but now i really think its a neat set well theres a line of patients waiting to have their eyes checked comments welcome	neutral
thanks a lot for the review brickster i never had the chance to get some classic town sets but i wish i couldve i just wonder why lego cant release sets like this anymore	neutral
thanks i own this set it was a good time as tlg released a lot of little buildings just look through the 63xxsetnumbers	neutral
paramedic unit does not seem to suit well for this sets name it should be named as clinic outpatient treatment family doctor and etc from what i understand parmedic unit is a standalone unit that is on standby 247 ready for any emergency rescue in lego town ambulance with a group of paramedics will be ideal for this kind of situation i love female doctors especially with that lovely hairpiece the cruiser is a neat 4studs wide design just love these small car designs back then i wonder what can be used at the back of its boot the clinic is neat maybe we can send holodoc for some medical audit to make sure that this clinic is up to standard what surprised me the most is the neat little eye chart you dont see such details in any regular lego set the red and white color combination for the building works well for me most of the hospital buildings and vehicles always revolved in red and white i gave this a 4 thanks you so much brickster	positive
i just cant believe someone would rate this set a 1 it appears to be a trend among these classic reviews never with a comment of why	neutral
thebrickster on jul 19 2008 0230 am said i just cant believe someone would rate this set a 1 it appears to be a trend among these classic reviews never with a comment of why maybe a tfol it is our destiny to show them that lego existed before 1997 and was imho way better than today we need more classic reviews i hope i can continue with technic sets	neutral
brickster strikes again with another awesome review ah one of the few hospital related kits lego made wasnt this the first hospital with modern minifigs because i seem to remember seeing an even older hospital online that had the armless faceless figs regardless this would be great as a little doctors office in someones town layout  although the vehicle is a little silly and that eye chart sticker has to be the coolest decal ever quote maybe a tfol well it sure isnt me i personally love older kits even though im only a teen i like a lot of the newer sets a bit more than some of the classic stuff but i have always agreed that the 70s and 80s were an extremely high point in legos time even though i dont really own any kits from the period edited by grevious 19 july 2008  0505 pm	positive

whitefang on jul 18 2008 0911 pm said paramedic unit does not seem to suit well for this sets name it should be named as clinic outpatient treatment family doctor and etc the definition of a paramedic is someone who assists physicians in providing medical care i think in more modern times a paramedic is generally thought of as a more qualified and experienced ambulance technician but the dictionary definition would seem to fit with the lego model quite well cheers rog	neutral

cool review ive always loved these hard looking tyres i never understood why they dont make them anymore they looked way more offroadish	neutral
4 stars the suspension wheel holder totally rocks yeah though the slope brick 45 2x3 x 1 13 double disappoints me a little btw the 6350 pizza to go van looks soooo cute thanks for the review and keeeeep them coming	positive
another great review whitefang this is a wonderful 80s vehicle  and i think it might be one of the first  if not the first  that had the spring suspension system i know of at least one other set that had that the biggest extreme team set from 1998 had a vehicle with those pieces quote this tow truck is pretty useful as you can see current city sets hardly have any tow trucks available to tow new cars design this tow truck is catered for 4studs vehicles for classic town can you imagine yourself this truck towing a speed racer car i think it looks really out of proportion firstly speed racer cars are out of scale even with city vehicles also i have hope that in the next few years we will get more octan sets to go with the wonderful gas station  and i suspect that a 6wide tow truck will be at the top of the list it wouldnt be a hard set to make and i bet it would sell well edited by grevious 19 july 2008  0531 pm	positive
oh never seen that set before fun and strange that wheel supension system has it ever been used in any other sets	neutral
indeed they have theyve appeared in 15 different sets in total they also have an identical width with the wide 2x2 wheels holder which is used on cars today they are still excellent today since retrofitting these suspension parts onto todays offroader trucks wont give them weird proportions or any problems and it looks perfect plus they are useful if youre lazy and dont feel like constructing the pinsuspension used in the early 90s for trucktrailers altough stability probably will suffer	neutral
45 ive had this set since i was young never understood why a tow truck needed to be an offroader maybe it was used to tow the other offroad vehicles the suspension made the truck too tall to tow some cars so i often took the hook out and use the truck as just an great offroad truck like 6672 which also had the suspension wheels other tow truck sets better filled their roles better but that doesnt diminish this set at all whitefang on jul 18 2008 0919 am said i think it looks really out of proportion no for 25odd years this vehicle was perfectly proportioned with all others in the towncity line its all these new 6 and 8 and 20 wide vehicles that are ignoring convention and making it look out of proportion granted speed racer sets are more of their own line but 6660 is smaller than most of the cars produced in the last few years	positive
superb review of a great setthis is one of my favourite classic sets becouse of all these functionsenginesuspensionand its great design with less than 100 pieces used only 52 congratulations for the reviewi think that its an outstanding set and surely worth 5 stars	positive
cheers for taking the time to put together this review whitefang considering the year of release of this set i love it would still fit in nicely in any city	positive

cool set i really loved the classic town sets this set has lots of detail great reveiw do you know what is exxon	positive
i think we only got shell stations in europe in the 80s never got this one but it looks like a typical lego gas station  once again i just dont know how you were able to keep stickers and prints in such a great condition i am sooooo jealous the tires of the cars are a problem though it was difficult and painful to put them off the wheel and back on later the black hat g i would have looooooved to have that when i was a boy	negative
i much prefer the shell version of that station which had the full awning over the roadway and the special road plate with the extra lane to pull into to fill er up	neutral
skipper 24 on jul 19 2008 0820 am said nice its like an alternative to the shell petrol company sets we had over here in the uk or did you have them to we have shell as well snefroe on jul 19 2008 0823 am said once again i just dont know how you were able to keep stickers and prints in such a great condition i am sooooo jealous thanks but these stickers are in pretty bad shape esp those on the fuel pumps the tires were hard to remove in regard to the cowboy hat i think my avatar is still wearing it welcomestranger on jul 19 2008 0824 am said i much prefer the shell version of that station which had the full awning over the roadway and the special road plate with the extra lane to pull into to fill er up i have another gas station but i think its an octan	negative
i love this set its nice and simple maybe its because i build this set by myself by ordering all parts and buildinginstruction and i made one extra tanktransporter 	positive
excellent review its nice to see review of old sets that i dont own i hope to see many more was this released under the esso name int the uk	positive
thanks for the fantastic review of the esso petrol  station i like this set a nice contrast to the shell ones it adds a bit of variety to a lego town the cowboy hat is a nice addition too	positive
brickster you need your own sticky review section i love looking at all of these old sets as i have said before you take me back to a much simpler time thank you and on to the set i love this gas station lego really needs to look to its past on some of these sets for the time the level of detail is great i wish i still had this one in one piece as well	positive
brickster once again this is another excellent gas station awaiting to be in the limelight i dont understand why i always loved these classic gas station such as shell exxon and octan they just look so lovely no city or town could ever survive without these important key installations around to pump gaspetroleum for all vehicles that depend it for fuel consumption as always all gas station will always inculde a road plate and i am glad i am still seeing roads included in such sets such as the recent 7993 service station however town plans gas station did not include a baseplate though nevertheless let me continue with this review 3 lovely minifigs included in this set its not common to see exxon torsos these days i just love that lady staff very much especially with its classic hairdo 4studs car just simply rocks with such fabulous simple design furthermore it gave you 2 cars instead of one what more can you ask you dont see tlg giving more cars in recent sets these days what surprise me about this cars is the ability of opening the front engine column i remembered vividly that only trucks or massive vehicles does have this playing feature nevertheless its an excellent addition for a 1980 gas station set this is a perfect set even when its going to fit into my current town buildings i am sure it wont have a hard time to match with the rest of the facade i can use this gas station and stationed it near the country side this set is so hard to resist with such elegant design of its fuel pump there are a total of 4 pumping stations the vehicles wont be fighting against each other for slots then the reparing area is very nice it will be even better if it include a shelter on top of it the office is simple and nice i had never expect an office to exist in gas station most of the time there are groceries stores for the consumers to get off buy off some stores and load it in the car no major complains from me i am not trying to be selection bias i had demostrated key points which is good enough to justify my score and i gave it a 5 outstanding classic gas station set	positive
again great topicpoll thebrickster i gave this set a 3 which is on the one hand negative is that its really oldfashioned for today  which is on the other hand positive is that it includes very nice and authentic details like e g doors in the cars  which is imo for that time a feat  klausdieter	neutral
okay guys i have built the set so lets review set name 7649 mt201 ultra drill walker price 6999 pieces 759 bought from tor r us in michigan us the box first we have the front it shows the set its functuns and the limited edition sign the box is huge about the size of the dino attack chopper set or the mars mission base nowadays most set that are 5000 or more have a flap displaying the sets functions opening theflap on this box reveals a gigantic picture of the set and the back the bags numbered next the manuals they have piece call outs page numbers etc there are 2 manuals with this set sticker sheets they actually arent all that bad random manual image build first we open bag 1 this will build the alien craft and the minifigures now here we have some interesting parts a green spine from exoforce and a black rim for the set container stacker next we start the build on the alien craft it is pretty sturbdy but has no cockpit for the alien the alien stickers are really cool they are rainbowish and has a silver back next come the build on the wings and the finished craft it is pretty good and has a nice sleek design however i think i will use the large ship for the commander out this year to fight the driller instead next is bag 2 which builds the rover and astro ship first is the ship it starts off with doctor infernos colors it builds up very nice and the detail is absolutley amazing next the roof is built it has some speed racer slopes the hinge piee now has a hole through it sorry for the blurry pic more is added then comes the bottom piece the detail is very nice and the hinge piece has a use later on then you build the crates each one holds two crystals added to the ship also a pic of the finished ship here we start the rover it sports anice detail the orange studs get coveded by the grill to look more like an engine the detail in this thing is pretty good it has a gun and shovel here is how it fits into the ship it slides in and is secured thanks to the hinge okay so next we open the number 3 bag which builds the body here are some interesting pieces then we start the build it begins nice and study i just love these stickers with the bulldogs on them more of the build with the stickers added next we add in the front part the detail is again outstanding with the turntable added it can move down as well the next step is to build the water tank it utilizes the bionicle boostersbig white things and added to the walker then we build that drill it uses a lot of rims and such with the gears added the front part uses a lot of those new droideka 3prong things and bionicle eyes the drill can spin thanks to the gears and added to the vehical next is the cockpit it has a nice space for the astros bckpack added the final stage is the legs thank god they arent like striking venoms they are all the same however see those two rubber parts those keep it in place when on surfaces like glass next come the large part of the legs these are similar to the assault tigers legs the final result is very sturdy thanks too notice the amazing classic space sticker so we finally come down to this the final result is amazing it is sturdy and has great detail it is very realistic and when the ship is removed the drill goes down and the turret is aimed up hope you all enjoyed the review	positive

looks like a great set i may consider making this the first mars mission set i buy nice review also but quote lol thanks i just wanted to claim my place for the review personally i dont think you had a place to claim somebody else could have also gotten this set and had a proper review ready before yours but felt it was wrong to post because you had posted a placeholder  clubninja in this case i think placeholders should be banned and if you are not ready to post a full review you should not post anything simple really either that or what is the policy on here regarding more than one review of a set being posted  then you could have both posted reviews and it wont really matter i guess just my 2 cents worth thanks for the review though	positive
today im gonna review the bigger of the 2 castles from the fright knigh theme i got this one last week at a pretty fair prive at ebay new and still sealed i love opening boxes that had been lying arounf for years and being the first to build an old set since i know this castle theme is not liked so much by the general public ill try here and change their minds cause i really think this is a great set this time i have to say my pictures turned out pretty amazing even if i am still using just my cellphone cam but im really pleased now with the quality here we go set nr 6097 name night lords castle number of minifigs 7 number of pieces 598 release year 1997 lets start with a few box  instructions pictures the inside od the box with a few alternate models the back with another possibility how to assemble the 3 main parts instructions next the 6 minifigs starting with the witch on her black dragon all 5 figures of the fright section and the poor royal knight we go on with the set itself first a general overview its really high on the first floor theres a trap with which you can drop stones or other things down on unliked guests the pot comes originally from fabuland i think i love this thing in the same floor there is a second trap if you pull the bar the door opens we move on to the tower itself did i mention its really high on the ground level theres the place for the witch to do her spells the wall is a secret door which reveals a skeleton when turned over on the next level there is this little thingy first it only seems like a barrel but when you pull the two 1x4 tiles on the back a skull is being revealed scary huh  i dont really understand what this is for but i assume its a telescope to watch and observate the dragons i do find that a bit senseless since there havent been telescopes in medieval times or have there been the back of the tower with the prison and the room for the treasure chest the prison opened its secured with a chain which i like very much cause you really can lock it with that treasure chest from the highest peak we now go down to the very ground level at the back of the castle there is another secret walldoor flanked by two shields at the back half of the inside there is the throne hall for the bat lord with a nice warm fireplace in the back this is where the secret door is placed the second half is pretty empty except for these two baskets i dont know exactly what they are for but i ike the idea for using them as water places for the horses one thing that might be a bit stupid is that 2 of the 4 side entrances do not have doors so they are open and a guard would have to stand there the whole day you can see it in his face he isnt very happy with that  that was my last review of the sets i got the last weeks but im looking forward to make much more in the future overall this is a pretty good set i dont know any other one with so much details and playability the minus point is as already said that it is too open on the sides but that can be solved easily with a bit of modding also i must say this set isnt that much juniorized as many might have thought though the design is a bit unconventional but exactly thats what i like most about it all in all it gets a 910 for me hope you enjoyed the reading and the pictures cant wait to see your response edit oops i forgot to put one figure of the fright knight faction on the photo but its the one in the last picture edited by kimt 10 august 2008  0128 pm	positive
nice review good closeups and a good unconventional choice of a set as for the set itself it has its pros and cons in my eyes i like all the minifigs but especially the witch the fright knights are probably the closest you can get for an evil human castle faction as for the building itself on the other hand i like the fact that it can be modified but some of the design choices are just stupid the holes in the wall the one huge tower as opposed to several smaller ones the huge empty space in the center and the excessive usage of bright yellow i guess for a smaller kid the play value is great its easily accessible and it looks sturdy enough but to an afol its not much else than a source for bricks and figs in my opinion oh and they did have telescopes in the medieval times the witch most probably uses it for astrology and even if they didnt were talking about a castle with a dragon and a wicked witch in it so its not exactly a good example of accurate history	negative
sweet review metalandi this set always looked a bit too busy for my liking i guess i just didnt expect to see a set so tall after seeing your review though it is growing on me i like all the play features and at the very least its a great parts pack two things im confused about though in this pic is that dragon being used as a swing set and i dont get why the area where the witch casts her spells on the second floor is green green in castle means grass or forestmen  and having grass on the second floor of a building is just weird i understand that its modular and thus it would make sense if it were placed on the ground but dark grey would make just as much sense and would look much better than the green there imo anyway im just fussy thanks again for the cool review will we be seeing any more peace	negative
i love the reviews of older sets that i never had also tiny thing but you said it has 7 minifigs but the group shots only include 6 the last guy isnt shown until the very end	neutral
iamded yes it seems the dragon is used as such in the picture of the alternate model but i guess bad and evil knights also wanna have some fun sometimes you are right with the green plate on the second floor it does look a bit disturbing but that can	negative
metalandi on jul 20 2008 1223 pm said i actually got one set left i would like to review but im off tomorrow to italy until thursday so i wont be able to do it until then you wont be off till tomorrow thats still a day away theres still time no but still ill be looking forward to the review when you get back peace	neutral

i have this set and ilike it 6097 have many usefull parts greate review	positive
i read this review not long after you posted it but im not sure why i didnt comment if dragonator is the one to post everytime he sees a dragon related topic i would be the one to post if i see a fright knights topic fright knights is one of my favourite lego themes and this review is really good i got both of the castles in the theme and loved them and your review presents basil the batlords castle well i too thought it was a bit weird that there is a green base when it could be grey but i guess its a useful piece to use in other things fright knights on	positive
ah this brings back memories i have this set and i loved the playabilaty factor opposing to older castle sets i have in medieval times there actually were primitive telescopes you can read about it here thanks for this review great storie great pics	positive
wow what a cool castle and set in general i had no idea that this set existed long dark ages thanks to you metalandi for such a great review the figures look really nice and the set is full of lots of little trinkets  details traps etc i have already had a look on ebay for this set looks like a great set for parts too i give the review 455 evil witches cheers isc	positive
my first post in this topic looks foolish now that i bought this set from ebay i just really wanted the minifigs although i already had the batlord and the black dragon and the parts they will help me greatly in building the impenetrable fortress of the dragonwarriors for my princess quest comic by the end of this week this set will be in my clutches	positive

good review  the photo from above shows off the scale of the castle much better than the box photo i was one of those who always thought this set looked lame ever since first seeing it in the catalogue a couple of my siblings had smaller bat lordfright knight sets and enjoyed the accessories and style of the minifigs etc so last year having not only ended my dark ages but done so for some of the rest of my family i got this set off ebay for my sister for christmas i of course had to build it to make sure all parts were there before leaving ebay feedback and ending the transaction first impressions were of how much brick there was to the set as well as really useful large structural elements and to be honest while perhaps a bit childish theres no doubt the style of the minifigs is kinda cute and useful for customs it was really enjoyable building this set and the scale is impressive when built empty spaces notwithstanding but hey lego has always had buildings with no back etc  just use your imagination and enjoy the access to playspace offered the traps etc are neat and more like the kind of action features modern sets come with i for one am in favour of these for kids they are fun and i think for builders they give ideas cause they are often done with minimal parts or impact on the set design anyways needless to say my sister loved the set indeed shes currently rebuilding it for the second time if i see it as cheap again i will pick up one for myself i got the first one at €30 incl postage i believe	positive
ahh i remember how badly i wanted that set when it was new oh well definitely one of the most original castles if not the most i actually liked how the 1st floor was made into a throne room the tower looks pretty impressive too of course the castle has a flagrant flaw  the walls on the sides are open i also think it lacks in the minifig count though that is understandable for a castle with a dragon quote the fright knights are probably the closest you can get for an evil human castle faction totally agreed	positive
i got a couple of the small sets from this line when it came out recently i acquired several more from bricklink because i just really love the way they look this theme really had good intentions but the execution was flawed i hope one day lego returns to a darker tone but maybe next time it could be more castlevania inspired that would really turn some heads plus vampires and gothic aesthetics are really popular now it will probably have run its course by the time lego would be able to develop a theme around them though	negative
fire station set  6382 year released 19801981 piece count 368 minifigs 4 list price approx 20 legos third fire station was this little gem 6382 the set offered new design elements not previously offered in previous sets what really stands out for me is 1x3 car doors and torsos with printed designs a decal was used for the large sign on the building and the 1 on the hood of one of the vehicles i think this was also the first set to offer the sliding garage mechanism a feature that added a great amount of realism and playability the set also included two blue doors and the new fire hose with preconnected faucetspicket getting on to the pictures i saved the cover of the box for this set but lost the instructions over the years i was able to download some instructions from the web heres a shot of the box cover and the back of the box the set includes four figs three of which are fireman and a lady who can serve as a dispatcher as mentioned above the torsos are printed on my favorite of the two vehicles included i love the design of fire engine 1 i always loved the fire hoses included in this set no string to have to tie or freyed ends engine 2 is this much larger engine with ladder i like how it contains an oxygen tank and fire axe on the other side of the engine are two shutter doors that reveal the hose and ladder controls these are stickers the ladder is much wider than previous lego ladders and extends a good length i like the baseplate of this set which has the numbers one and two marking each garage the building is simple but has a nice design i love the sliding garage doors note notice the two windows of the 2nd floor the actual set should have blinds on these windows ive lost one of the stickered windows so placed the single blinded window on the 1st floor each of the two sides of the garages are the same heres a shot of the right side on the first floor is the dispatch area and a classic blue space computer the 2nd floor has a bed and a chair heres a shot of the entire backside and lastly a shot of the entire station this set is one of my favorite fire stations that offers a great amount of playability hope you enjoyed the review	positive
great review again its nice to see old sets reviewed i love the control stickers theres a great level of detail this is really the second best fire station in my opinion	positive
lovely i cant stop making comparisons between this fire station and last years which is also very well detailed with great features and awesome playability the concept design of the second one its very much like the one reviewed here this is good as tlg is taking back those great values to make the new excellent sets we all are enjoying by now	positive

a great small set i remember this set most of all because of the inverted window screen loooooved the chopper but never got it another 5 please	positive
good but i like the heli of set 6571 better another 4 from me	positive
a nice little model with some neat features for its age plus the allyime classic fireman as a bonus however this design of chopper the police station around the same time was the same design i think dated very quickly while is was good to use the hinged car roof  which was relatively new at the time  together with the inverted screen it was superceded very quickly by designs that stood the test of time far better for example 6657 also i dont think i could everbuy a lego fire helicopter because it is not something we have in the ukeire police coast guard ambulance military etc etc but no fire helicopters not something i would therefore want in my lego town great review though many thanks again for doing these cheers rog	negative
well its ok but its not great voted 3 seems the classic town hater has voted a 1 again will the madness ever stop	neutral
i vote outstanding because it makes excellent use of the pieces that were available at the time that cockpit makes excellent use of an inverted windshield	positive

hello all eurobricks members and town lovers today i will be doing up a review on snorkel squad one of the most important and basic vehicle in any fire department snorkel squad in simple english terms it refers to fire engine fighting fire always on standby ready to save the citizens from crisis trust me you will understand why this snorkel squad is superb impressive by the end of this review on a side note there is only part that is replaced by another color can you find the difference name snorkel squad theme lego system  town year 1987 pieces 151 minifigs 2 price usd1350 an image of a 6358 snorkel squad looking smart on their standby this snorkel squad is a fanastic fire engine that is ready to save people from the fires its primary color red is used in all fire emergency department and vehicles in case of any emergency this snorkel squad will be activated and arrived at the scene as soon as possible no time to waste personally this is the best fire engine that i had ever seen meet the fire fighters it comes with two brave fire fighters both of them wear the standard fire fighter outfit that is present in almost all fire station sets in classic town the torso is very nice and formal and looks real impressive onto them i love the buttons on them furthermore these white helmets are a symbol to the world of fire fighting these are the people whom save lives by risking their own lives in dangerous situations water hose compartment the water hose is a string that is stored in the front it can be rolled out and the fire fighters are able to use it without much difficulty they will just pull out the hose and spray onto the fire the next picture shows a much clearer look in its interior in addition the fire logo that is on the compartment is actually printed yes its not a sticker and that is great news for us interesting features these clamps on both sides is supposed to stablise the fire engine when the ladder is heading upwards it is a simple mechanism which illustrate clearly what it does this feature is recently seen in construction vehicle such as the mobile crane of course it is not a complicated feature it just made use of three quite common white parts swivel mechanism these swivel mechanism in my opnion are very fun to play with these connectors on the front and the back enable the long fire engine to make sharp turns on any junctions arriving at the scene fast enough this is not a fire engine that only travel straight roads try it onto your base plates and you will be surprised how well it can turn best playable mechanism in 6358 the driver will be activating the ladder at the back of the vehicle in order to adjust the height and making sure that the ladder do not fall short the tiles on the plates are acting like a stoppage the ladder are able to rotate 360 degree without much problem if you removed the driver out of the control panel it goes up as tall as 30cm look at that amazing height too bad i have not constructed my cafe corner yet otherwise i can give you a better feel of how amazing this baby can go i used the old road baseplate as a guide and roughly it can goes as tall as 30 to 35cm look at the black hinges below by shifting it to the last that was the maximum height it can move this is a very good way to adjust the height oh and i forget to mention that there are 2 storage compartments for the fighters to place their equipments behind quite easy to access no doors apart from the standard roof top on the drivers seat there is no doors present at both side i am quite sad to see that there are no doors maybe these fighters are supposed to jump off the seat instead of opening the doors well i guess this is the only major flaws that i had found in this set heading off got you meet the model 6358 fire engine summary review playability 1010 superb fun the ladder and swivel mechanism is really very fun to play with design 9510 excellent design it got an almost full 10 the lack of doors dropped my ratings slightly price 810 a very mid range price i dont think it cost very expensive but i am not sure how much it cost now overall 9210 best fire engine ever and one of the great looking one too get this model now i gave it a 5 based on my review score card what about yours hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine comments and critics are strongly welcomed pictures can be found in my brickshelf when moderated	positive
thanks for another great review i can remember the 6358 very vividly my parents bought the 6340 for me and a girl friend got the 6358 im quiet sure its my envy because until now i want to believe that the 6340 is better my reasons were these i own the 6340 and on the instructions of the 6358 stood legoland which i thought of as old but this review induced me to get over this humiliation from my childhood   and check ebay for the 6358 edited by bernddasbrot 21 july 2008  0407 pm	neutral
a truly great set i always loved the mobile crane and was gobsmacked when this popped up using some of the great features from the crane but also making it an emergency vehicle too great classic firemen and  in your version  a suspiciously blue fire extinguisher great review of a great set  just a pity i no longer have it so many sets i used to have got lost during the period at the end of my childhood before i rescued what was left from my dads house once i realised what i had left behind hindsight is a great thing cheers again rog	positive
guys thanks for all of your wonderful and encouraging comments towards this set this was one of my most favourite set in the late 1980s and i am glad to restore it somehow with a small little part missing which could not be that hard to replace bernddasbrot on jul 22 2008 1206 am said but this review induced me to get over this humiliation from my childhood   and check ebay for the 6358 bernd i am glad reviews like these mananged to change your perception towards this set honestly this is a very good set to pass by and i hope i had highlight the key features in this set hope you will have an easy time getting it from ebay or bricklink rriggs on jul 22 2008 1231 am said great classic firemen and  in your version  a suspiciously blue fire extinguisher good job by spotting the replacement part which is hiding among them thats why i show the orignal image lord of pies on jul 22 2008 1234 am said i cant help but feel thought that these reviews are being churned out to quickly you should leave a gap i am being flooded with all these great reviews you should really take some time off and sit in front of the town and trains forum looking through at your childhood memories where classic reviews like this are released in this forum i am leaving some gaps in between my reviews now i supposed brickster will slow down soon captain green hair on jul 22 2008 0207 am said this definitly is a nice set i think this was also the first set to use that white basket cgh you are absolutely right this is the first set that made use of the white basket component in fact there is only 2 sets in the entire lego theme which have make used of the white basket it is the 6477 which is released in 2000 i am quite surprised after 13 years they are able to produced it again thebrickster on jul 22 2008 1010 am said what an awesome little set i really like this engine but dont remember seeing it during the late 80s it must have been out during my dark ages i love the basketsection for the firemen equally nice is the fire hose which extends a good length the color combination of red with white and the trans blue windshield looks goos as well this is a great engine and one that would look perfect in a classic tabletown  and its 4studs wide very nice review whitefang i look forward to seeing more of your classic town reviews you shared the same sentiments as i do its a pity that set was released during the dark age of yours on the other hand these sets are my childhood sets which i grew up with more classic town reviews all the way edit this is my 1000th eurobricks post since i joined it has been another great milestone for me in eurobricks edited by whitefang 22 july 2008  0646 am	neutral

quote i am not against with the newer sets it just that part of the reasons which reflected in the review had fufill the basic key factors of a typical fire engine in addition it was my alltime favourite under the firefighting theme yes i agree this set is wonderful even today and is one of the best fire kits ever release and actually realistic scale is not really a necessity in lego  its just my personal taste for example ive never liked the tiny planes in the old airports that much but i can see why a lot of people like them better than the new ones edited by grevious 28 july 2008  0317 pm	neutral

just picked this set up and just took a break from building to go to football practice i have just finished building all of the legs and so far it looks like it is going to be a great set i would have like it if more clones were included but whatever i find it interesting how many clone accessories they give you i dont like it only because i cant decide what i want to use i find it interesting that at lease 2 people are missing pieces i have had multiple times where i thought i was missing pieces only to find that they were in the bag somewhere other than the fact that there is a lack of minifigures i love this set and cant wait to finish it later tonight edited by swman 04 august 2008  0833 pm	positive
i just got this set sunday and its so huge that i cant put it anywhere it is pretty sturdy and heavy thats where the handle comes in im pissed that you only get 2 clones rex has to fight on the ground while you need more clones to man the gunscockpit the legs were the most annoying and time consuming part of the build and yea i agree that if tlg had made numbered bags it would have taken only 2 hours rather than 4 edited by ih master 13uilder17 14 october 2008  1138 pm	negative
i bought this a few weeks ago and absolutely loved making it its amazing how the paneling comes together to make such a tight fit but can easily open up the legs could have been a bit more poseable and the guns dont launch easily unless you push hard and fast id like the firing mechanism to launch more smoothly but it looks absolutely amazing about price it was ¥13000 where i am but im used to lego being expensive in japan so it was good value	positive

7676 republic attack gunship number of pieces 1034 number of minifigs 5 price 11999 usd brickset hey everyone i just got the rgs yesterday at tru after i came home from camp i saw all of the topics that i missed and noticed a minireview and a review with one pic so i thought id make a huge shiny new review that has lots of pictures and all of the requirements of kimts index note i did not apply any stickers to it as a personal liking so lets start by looking at the box a shiny clean and futuristic box quite different from the other star wars box designs before this there was so much clone wars merchandise with this font and design in the huge display at the front of my local toys r us store and not just lego it so beautiful with the white and sky blue anyways for some reason the boxes of the new clone wars sets seemed more shiny than usual maybe its because they were just shipped but once you pick up the boxes they will feel really good in your hands despite the fact that only about half of the space in the boxes are used the back of the box the back shows all of the main features of the set plus pictures of the three other clone wars sets meant to be released alongside this one although i did spot the twilight and homing spider droid which were supposed to be released in september or october so on to the gunship built straight from the bags it took me about 4 12 hours with breaks it has an overall great design but somewhat fragile especially when building it the cockpits always fall apart when opened as well as the bubbles on the wings which i will get into more later the color scheme is very well done you can always find the piece youre looking for thanks to the color diversity red dark red lime green ooh blue black tan light bley dark grey yellow and white also split down the middle vertically the ship is almost all symmetrical front side now lets start with the many features that this set is hiding the front has lots of lime green a rare color but more importantly a rotating gun is found on each side they rotate in a pretty wide range although fragile cockpits there are two main cockpits right next to each other not very detailed and are the same and for some reason the whole cockpit element flips up to reveal nothing just the skeleton of the ship probe droid storage above the cockpit lies a plate that can be flipped up to reveal a storage area that holds two of these probe droids at least thats what i think they are hull in this pic two features are hidden mobile command center the first of the two is a mobile command center but essentially just a hover chair it is found by flipping up the two panels on either side of the hull bacta tank the second is the bacta tank found by just sliding it out of the storage area behind the mcc one half of the tank opens so a minifigure can go inside and heal hisher wounds obtained in battle cargo hold now this is probably the main feature for this set the two sliding doors two on each side slide open thanks to a clever technic mechanism not much in here just a gun holder and a place where the passengers wait to be dropped off in battle speeder bike i guess you guys saw it the speeder bike it is found by opening the rear flap the bike is very cleverly designed by using a brown trike body its only a few centimeters shorter than the bike found in the clone battle pack rear gun just a gun similar to the front ones engines huge engines or are they cannons that are really fun to build they really give that cartoon feel to this set missiles in between the engines are two sets of four flickfire missiles bubble cockpits there is one bubble cockpit on each wing that supposedly control the turrets at the front very fragile storage containers two storage containers on each side hold the clone accessories but i wouldnt recommend putting them in there because the antennae can fall out or you might forget about them sticker sheet the dreaded sticker sheet dss has all of the stickers you need for this set unfortunately mine was crunched up i dont like stickers much anyways but i might still apply some note the republic symbol stickers why couldnt tlg just use that printed piece from a few years back also you get to choose between a birdrat thing or a sleeping twielk as your hull decal what theyre for i dont know looks like the movie or show will explain it though minifigs finally the five minifigs of this set they are all great figs including commander cody amazing especially with the gear the orange is nice but i thought he was yellow clone trooper again amazing the gear is great and the new helmet and torso are great all of the clones in the clone wars line have the same heads also you can see the flesh beneath the helmet asaaj ventress not so happy about this one the torso and dark blue legs are cool but the dress is pretty ugly the head is alright but could do without the cartoony face yeah i know its from a cartoon also has purple markings on back of head obiwan kenobi pretty cool besides the face cool hair and torso though plo koon beautiful the true gem of this set in my opinion the head is the same material as kit fistos and the tosro is awesome good for making a custom kiadi mundi well thats about it here is the final verdict build 810 very fun and easy should take the seasoned builder about 4 hours somewhat fragile playability 9510 lots of fun features although some can break easily swooshability 310 i wouldnt recommend flying it around much as you can barely pick it up safely but with two hands gripping the bottom firmly it can be moved around but not spun or swooshed etc minifigs 810 all very great figs especially plo koon but could have included more clone troopers design 7510 some excellent ideas included in here although some spots are very fragile price 710 should have been only 100 usd if not for the new molds plus at tru it was 130 usd overall score 8510 a great set to have for your star wars clone wars collection with some flaws save up for this one so how did you like my review your feedback is much appreciated jimbutcher out edited by jimbutcher 15 september 2008  0306 am

okay if this were the first review of the set id understand your want to reserve a thread for your review but seriously there are already reviews out there couldnt you have just waited at least until you had actually built the thing or even better until the review was actually done sorry if im being to harsh but im quite sick of these blablabla set review  will be up soon its getting quite annoying peace	neutral
jimbutcher on jul 28 2008 1256 am said thank you oky wan and apologies to the rest of you guys i guess i was rushing a bit and didnt think this through it was wrong of me to reserve a review if someone does an indepth review before me someone please close this topic otherwise i guess i will do it again many apologies for opening this topic before i actually had a review bad example from me very sorry its ok just remember you dont have to reserve them	neutral

very good review i just checked my ep ii vehicle encyclopedia yes im a total sw geek and tlg got it pretty accurately with the rgs	positive
i really like the new gunship different enough from the old one to be better but similar enough that they dont look totally weird together really like the new minifigs didnt think i would like the new clone troopers at all the accessories are fine i would never use them on the regular clones but to each their own	positive

jimbutcher finally i had seen something that is worth reading and viewing imho this is your best star wars review i had ever read most importantly it is a complete review which has substance you have my thanks keep up the good job back to the rgs this is the next star wars set i will be getting i cant wait to lay my hands on this set and start building basically how bad this set can be it cant be worse republic gunship is one of the alltime favourites in star wars prequel and ot i cant find any faults except being too expensive due to the licence cost in addition the minifigs are the next big thing seriously i am quite impressed with it on the down side my rating will go up if there is an additional clone trooper instead of one nevertheless this is a must get set no matter what	positive

i got this set in the spring during my buy every new castle set availableseason granted i couldnt afford all of them but i do have most of them now anyway i love the action elements to this set and the siege tower really does look wicked id like to attach the crownie tower to the kings castle to see how it fits but i unfortunately dont own that set yet i also love the turning head of the soldier and ive used it in my princess questcomic as well along with the turning head of the princess the troll leader brings good variety to the army of trolls but they still could use another face type and more torso options its a nice review in any case although the set pretty much speaks for itself	positive
hey good review and good photos i also got this set just recently and i wasnt very enthusiastic about it at the beginning but after i built it i could appreciate it the siege engine is very nice but my complaint has do with the proportions of the knights tower in respect to the trolls machine  its a bit smaller and less bulkier that complaint has to go with some other sets too for example the troll warship is really humongous  it feels like it can load the evil wizards tower and sail off other than that  a good set i like it 45 from me	positive
very nice review pedro you beat me to it there was a review done about january but i wanted to have a go just havent opened the box yet great pics and well demonstrated action elements too i rate this as one of the coolest castle sets just for its playability and 5 figures this will def add to my orc army and i may purchase more of this set if they dont release a orc bp keep up the good work	positive
thanks for the positive comments everyone i’d noticed that although much discussed noone on eurobricks had written a comprehensive review for it i thought this set more than deserved one i’ve just posted my newest review of the dwarves mine defender here httpwwweurobrickshowtopic19931	neutral

when i first saw this topic i thought oh great another review of this set however im glad you posted it now your pics are great and well it was just a generally good review im looking forward to seeing more peace	positive
thanks for the review from this set i prefer the crown knights tower  its a very goodlooking structure	positive
pedro for your first review you have amaze me with your photo session and the strucutre of your review i am very impressed by your high quality pictures you have done an excellent job i love the tower raid very much as it offers high playability with the wall and flooring falling down when the ram hits the wall its quite interesting to play with the mechanism of the ram is very fun to play with as well i will try and pull back and released it to knock a row of soldiers this is one of my favourite sets in castle 2008 well done	positive
whitefang on jul 30 2008 1256 am said pedro for your first review you have amaze me with your photo session and the strucutre of your review i am very impressed by your high quality pictures you have done an excellent job i completely agree this is an amazing review  bits of humor great photography and detailed descriptionsphotos based upon this review ive placed an order for this set along with some convincing from amazons 20 sale  the only drawbacks in this set that i can see concerns the tower with it being 1 small compared to the seige tower and 2 missing a few walls however this is also the joy of lego as one can simply purchase a few bricks and build their own walls andor expand the towers size or even attach it to a castle of course this increases the price of the set but considering how cheap bricks are on bricklink tower raid is still a very good value i hope you continue doing reviews pedro	positive
th set was fantastic becuase it was cheap and supplied a very good amount of pecies and had rather good minifigures	positive
i have one of these and must say that this is the best castle set in the theme and the most useful parts pack for its size yet	positive
nice short review although a little hard to read i agree that this set is a really great one	positive
jimbutcher on jul 29 2008 0102 am said nice short review although a little hard to read i agree that this set is a really great one how is it hard to read but thanks for the review great little set but i do agree that it could have used a russian or two maybe oxley too darthperson	positive
i give it a 1010 for the parts thats the reason i got mine	positive
a great price point for a nice bunch of figs and accesories pity about the fleshies though god bless nathan	positive
fleshies sometimes come in handy great review and good set but as said by other another russian soldier or two would be fine tlc is being a bit too much of a cheapskate regarding minifigs lately	positive

 that was a weird race anyway i love the look of both sets but ill have to go for the dino attack quad for a couple of reasons it is postapoc which i love features tan and dark red colours which are far more useful than yellow you get more bang for your buck with the dino set you get a little dino sure you can hate it but better than not having one right and the fig has much more useful pieces and a better face thanks for the face off thebrickster batbrick away	positive
that was an intresting race and i was split between the two until i saw whitefangs reply and the fact you can use the sprinter as a militery thingwhich you could do for both but sprinter just pulls it off better and i like the radar on the back of it so ill have to go with the street sprinter thanks for the nice topic brickster	positive
i vote for the dino quadbike definately i wish i had that but ill have to make do with the much less violent european version dino 2010 not attack heres a comaprison european version usa etc version theres a subtle difference but i prefer the us one as for the coast guard quad i think its ok but not as good as the new one	positive
i like the dino thingy because of the pieces and the dino is a lot of fun on its own i know thats akward	positive
the rancor on aug 2 2008 0939 am said i wish i had that but ill have to make do with the much less violent european version dino 2010 not attack heres a comaprison european version usa etc version theres a subtle difference but i prefer the us one i did not know that europe had a different quad or at least one without the bazooka interesting that the gun was removed from the european sets or added to the us sets i sort of like the chain i also notice a big difference in the boxart destroyed city to prehistoric volcano i wonder if the story was different as well thanks for sharing a good picture  well it does look like the dino quad has the upper hand almost double the votes	positive
price 569 kr minifigs 2 pieces 592 stickers 9 my sticker sheet wasn’t curled up overview before i start i will apologize for the bad quality of the pictures it is getting dark here right now so some of the pictures are a bit dark 1 minifigs the set comes with two of the new clone wars clone troopers which in my opinion are pretty cool it also comes with two short blasters and a bag of clone accessories figs with helmets figs without helmets 2 the tank this thing is huge 25cm long and 22cm wide and far oversized in my opinion but looks great nonetheless i very much like the white and dark red color scheme mixed with a bit of lime green even though there is no lime green bricks   left side right side back side both of the wings contain a hidden compartment to store the blasters and a part that rotates to reveal three flickfire missiles the front opens up as well to reveal the engine the side guns and the gun on the top rotate inside the cockpit is space for two figs one seated in front of two computer screens and one placed in a moveable seat which moves up and down allowing the fig to pop up the top hatch and staying hidden while the hatch is closed this function is triggered by opening the backdoor hidden compartment and missiles engine top hatch openclosed interior 3 rating build 910 not much to say here minifigs 710 an extra fig or two would have been great eventually a jedi or a commando design 810 this only looses a couple of points for being oversized but it’s a great looking model parts 1010 at 592 parts this is one of the cw sets with the best partsprice ratio price 810 sure this thing is great but i think its overpriced at 569 kr approx 120 when build it feels more like a 450 kr set final verdict 910 despite some flaws this thing is definitely recommended and it looks great on your shelf too 	positive
i know it would really go well with the rgs but it is not enough for £50 ill wait for the sales at christmas	negative
nice review  for portugal it costs 60€ i also consider it oversized it shold be the third of that size portugal and spain may have good prices but 90€ for the v19 must be a tippo	negative
finally a review of this thanks 120 bucks this tank looks tiny and though its amazingly detailed it should have been smaller and only 4050 bucks at most it just doesnt play that big a part man good pieces and mechanisms but no ones going to both buying a 120 buck tank no offence not unless it its the atte	negative

thanks for the review i think this is my favourite clone wars set behind the republic gunship	positive
one question do the top panels on the rotating rocket assembly mounted in the skids pop off regularly when you flip them back and forth the ones on the version i built from the instructions posted online seem to eject with the slightest provocation	neutral
you lucky turd seriously good job with the review	neutral
thanks for the review christian i was hoping for one soon  this set really looks good but as you said rather big the figs are good and i agree that kiadi mundi should be included i like the hidden compartments for the blasters and missiles and the cockpit is really cool considering it seats two i thought only one i will surely pick this up sometime	positive
nice review thanks for taking the time to share your thoughts looks like a really nice set and ill be picking it up eventually when it makes it to the us	positive
do you have any pics of the wheels i wanna see what those are like	neutral
this is my favorite set in the clone wars wave and ill be picking it up without a doubt that is whenever the folks at lego decide that its okay for us to buy their sets in us	positive
great review i really like the look of this set and having played a lot of battlefront i am quite keen to pick one up in australia when it comes out after the ds is paid off looks like some nice greebling and cool colour scheme too	positive
must buy now totally sweet not available in canada yet well designed and cheap for clone wars im going to mod it so that it looks like the imperial version	positive
i am 100 going to get this set it should be about 55 and if it is ill get it without a doubt i just hope that this set is 5060 if it isnt then we have a problem	positive
this and the atte and the spider tank and maybe the droid gunship are the few clone wars sets ill buy i loved playing as this tank in the clone wars video game even better with cheat codes for extra missile spam  so this is a must get	positive
thanks for posting the review i’ve been wondering about this set to me it does feel a bit fig light for £50 i’d expect maybe one or two more clones i’m not to sure about the oversized issue it seems to me it’s better to have something a bit to large and have a better level or features than something smaller will less	negative
christian thanks for this outstanding review i have been waiting for this moment for someone to do up an excellent review like this republic fighter tank is my 2nd favourite set in my clone wars list the 2 clone troopers could be easily add up to your rgs since it offer only more trooper however i felt that this set is quite overpriced in fact all clone war sets are very expensive the fighter tank has a very great color combination of red and white to represent the republic the wheels below is the most impressive feature which enable the hovering feel the hatch is a neat feature as well however i noticed there is a rubber band within the control panel may i know what is it for i really enjoy viewing this review you had given the insight which will eventually determined whether to get it any sooner or later pr0visorak on aug 2 2008 0535 pm said this set costs a s100 in singaporei went to hng kong too see lego and the shops there are more expensive by a few dollarshoweveri went to australia before and everything there is the same price but when there is a sale it becomes very cheap hello pr0visorak you are from singapore as well welcome to eurobricks i hope you will do an introduction to the rest of the members in this forum in singapore it cost sgd10000 in fact that was the promotional price therefore there is no further discount for it	positive
im definatly gonna get the atte im thinking about getting the spider droid and fighter tank i alredy own the older version of the republic gunship but i still want it agentrick57 on aug 1 2008 0844 pm said i loved playing as this tank in the clone wars video game even better with cheat codes for extra missile spam  sorry to get off topic but i own that game i liked playing as the republic gunship the best	positive
good review i would get this set but sadly they dont have it anymore i wish they did to get those sweet figs the battle droid colors are sweet the only set with geonosians	neutral
nice review sadly my dark ages came right before this set was released	neutral
thanks for the review i love these affordable little sets not so affordable now because of the cool figs but im going to have a look on ebay and bricklink right now just in case an army of tan red droids would look great maybe well see some if geonosia appears in the new seires somehow unlikely since the confederacy was defeated at the battle of geonosis i wish i could have bought this set when it came out but id just left university so i was super skint and had to miss all the epii sets now they all cost loads even in used condition at least now there has been a redesign of the gunship and atte from the clone wars series that i can buy	neutral
vbbn the pics were 12 mega pixles which is quite a lot i think although i had to scale them down to 800x600 i used to dream that tlg would bring out these sets of the geonosis arena and you could join them together to make a massive arena but i doubt they would ever do that also look out for my forth coming reviews of 4500 snow speeder some tie fighter with a lul dv and gg wheel bike chase i have taken all the pics all i need to do is upload them also i would review the jango fetts slave 1 but i have customized it so much i dont really want to revert it back to its original state edited by skipper 24 02 august 2008  0718 pm	neutral
thanks for the review skipper this is one of my favourite sets i really like the colour scheme and the geonosians are awesome keep up the good work kimt	positive
i always thought this looked liek a cool set with lots of nice and sadly unique pieces unfortunately the only attack of the clones sets i got were the jedi starfighter and yoda vs dooku amazing sets but i would love to have owned them all id never really looked into this set very much so thanks for the review	positive
this is actually one of my favorite star wars sets awesome rare pieces and excellent construction geo figs are a plus too best of all its nice and cheap	positive
good review i really liked the detailed geonosians and i hope theyre in a later set so i can get more knowing lego theyll release a huge arena playset with a few geos and sand red droids so people will buy the set just for them jifel	positive
i am fairly confident that something involoving geonosis will be released in 2010 but any way i had this set  one of my first ones but i droped the ship and it blew up i found all the pieces but in never rebuilt the ship although i still have the figs ant the canon overall this set was above average in my opinion great review	positive
great review really shows off the main aspects of the set wish i had picked up a tie when they were around dsr	positive
and now for something completely different tiny turbos belonging to the racers line when i saw 8147 bullet run on sh for half the price i couldn´t resist buying it we had a lot of fun celebrating a bagbuild at our event using the 8150 zx turbo of that theme so i knew what would expect me with this extended set price normal 4999€ now 2499€ well i paid 3499€ in a lego store but that´s another story bricks 796 minifigs  hey this is tiny turbos stupid stickers don´t ask or read further the open box reveals seven polybags some with more smaller polybags inside the instruction booklet 2 ramps and the sticker sheet of course i put all of the bags on the table and not on the floor hey tlc didn´t print this on the first page of the building instructions and you won´t see any piece callouts as well on the other hand this is not adifficult build so why show them still there is an inventory list of all bricks at the end of the instructions note the giant sticker sheet we all now the dss but that is a new kind of extra super large sticker sheet it holds 82 stickers more to that later on the build is quite basic the only nonconventional parts of the build were the two slammers and the most annoying part was fiddling the rubber band of the holder without destroying it bag 1 easy beginning building the lime car the limo and the two slammers nothing exciting about the lime car but the limo was neat it´s an 18 studs long car the normal racers are abot 10 studs long nice way to put the horns on the back the slammers mmmmh nice invention if they would actually do something they are supposed to give the tubros a kick in the butt to speed them up but the result is a 80 cm long run and that´s it i had expected more acceleration from the slammers but it´s also fun to play with the cars without slamming them bag 2 convoy time the tow truck and the fuel truck the tow truck is a great idea and a good addition to the set the cars are supposed to crash  how do they get back home well here´s the answer quite american layout of the truck and it´s very well done horns 5 flashing lights and a right color choice you can move the arm up and down and pull out the hook note the metallic silver antennae the fuel tank has got a secret function it may break on the middle of the trailer therefore it has a hinge build in the bottom city fire mayhem and there´s no fire engine bag 3 long longer how long can a tiny truck be the pipe truck an unexpected buggy and the red racer 36 studs long the pipe truck breaks every convention the cabin is almost the same like the tow truck and the fuel truck and that is the good part of it the trailer has to carry pipes and is functional as well as it can commute sidewarts it looks quite unrealistic as well and you cannot drive this beast on tiny roads good for another crash but there are more cars in this bag now this was a surprise a buggy this is the only 6wide car but just because the wheels are large monster truck madness i don´t care for those cars personally a disappointment i would have preferred another racer  for variety though did i say another racer here we are the red devil great looking a real fast shape and red the best racer in this set vrooommm this is the most played with car of the set not only from me  as you may have noticed i didn´t put any stickers so far i don´t like stickers especially when placed over two or more bricks and here you are supposed to do it several times of course the cars look better with stickers on but they are also great without stickers only the fuel truck looks boring without my sons didn´t know there were supposed to be stickers and they didn´t ask for them so everything is allright here´s a closeup of the sticker sheet did i already mention it was 82 stickers  the only exception i made using sticker was for bag 4 bag 4 you go here you pay the highway toll booth the only immobile part of the set but great to brake though the barriers that is fun i only put on stickers on 2x2 plates where i had the idea to use those plates further on on different other mocs this looks a bit boring without the other stickers i admit but still no cut off to the playability there are also two ramps belonging to the set these only make sense if you are able to speed up the racers with the slammers and hit the ramps correctly i had problems with that so they are on the shelves now could be a lot fun making a contest though like this picture of the inventories frontpage all cars put together the usual leftovers all in all this is a great set to call ones own i did not regret buying it especially when it was 50 off even normal price would not have been too much build great for smaller children boring to afols 510 special brickscolors none all basics 310 design i love the tiny turbos´ size and design 910 playability 1 because of the slammers another 1 because no minifigscale but that is not the intention of the set still 910 pricepiece ratio dang it´s not on sale any more but if you hurry you could still grab one in the lego stores 1010 all in all 8510 and a clear recommendation it was and still is a set to play with your children the size fits perfectly to matchbox cars and that was exactly what my younger son did can you find all of the cars included in the set ps after buying this set i won an ebay auction with another tiny turbos set  8135 bridge chase this is even more fun i will soon care for a review with some never seen phototricks as well stay tuned edited by whitefang 23 may 2009  0702 pm indexed	neutral
this set was on my wanted list for a long time and the sales at sh came just in time i also loved the set and like you only put the stickers on the toll both it looks great on a town layout with almost no modifications the racers are great the trucks and the limo are the best in my oppinion the sticker sheet is huge but ive seen bigger stickers over multiple pieces are the worst the slammers are ok but not great i played with my 4 years old son and we tryed to do what shows in the box the cars passing the toll jumping the ramps and crashing the trucks but it is very difficult to get it right but the crashes are very fun	positive
tiny turbos are good for parts but im not so keen on them as they have no minifig drivers so i wasnt sure about this set but your review has made me like them more i probably wont buy the set but i appreciate it more thanks for the review	positive
kimt on aug 3 2008 0106 pm said thanks for the review ill definately get this set sooner or later you better hurry they are not at sh any longer quote a fine set carwise dump the slammers and buildings into the spare bag and keep the cars that´s exactly what i did the slammers are already seperated to our color boxes	positive
thanks for the review i have quite a few ttstiny turbos i never got this one but if its on sale	positive
as my summer holiday was kinda wet for 2 weeks i decided to shop some sets i crossed the german border and bought me this one mainly for the parts to get time going i built the models and made this small review for you to enjoy or hate high resolution pics can be found here when public set 4994 title fierce creatures price 999 euro  1299 usd pieces 193 minifigs 0 the box the box looks awesome it has some great animations of the 3 models in the instruction the rear of the box shows some nice upcloseandpersonal drawings of each model i think it works better having the models drawn instead of a mere photo of them somehow it allows the great colourscheme to really show the instructions the instruction is easy to follow and shows which pieces are used in each building step that makes it all a lot easier especially with so many small pieces as in this set the bricks are divided into 3 polybags and the instruction is a fine small book which can be easily stored along the rest of your evergrowing amount of booklets and pamphlets printed by tlg the models model 1 is a spider and it’s nasty the 2x2 modified brick with the hole would allow one to hang it from a string this beast is sure to give you several nightmares were it hanging from a string in your bedroom – so i wouldn’t do that plus the fact that my wife threw away the box and ordered me to take the spider apart when she saw it – she’s an arachnophobian and does not take spiders lightly it looks real in a brickishnonrealway model 2 is a snake there’s not much to say other than the head is awesomely designed and the rest is bad the body is poorly designed and does not live up to the coolness of the head build the head ignore the rest model 3 is a flying scorpion or something not as realistic as the spider but still a great model with a cool head the tail is a bit poorly designed but it’ll do and it does offer some good ideas on how to use bricks all in all verdicts this is an ok creator set it holds a lot of fine pieces and the models are an ok inspiration given its size it’s an ok set but it’s nothing more than that i’ll give it an average score i enjoyed building the models and fumbling with the bricks in the shade during a “siesta” on my vacation and that’s what it is an enjoyable build and a little inspiration on a hot day with a erdinger dunkel weissbier in my other hand kimt edited by whitefang 23 may 2009  0629 pm indexed	positive
thanks for the review kim kimt on aug 3 2008 0101 pm said i crossed the german border and bought me this one mainly for the parts what parts were you looking for or just for all of the parts i like the story with your wife the spider is really cool nice photo shots on the grass kim too bad the other alternative builds are kinda odd always creators on	positive
thanks for the review this is another good sw set a true classic i especially like the colourscheme of this set the rebel gun is crappy though but overall the set rocks kimt	positive
i once bought a entire lego collection including this set however i never have build it seeing this fine review has given me new motivation to do so nice work again skipper	positive
there isnt much difference apart form it has stickers on and is grey also the guns and tow cable gun are different as well as the engines but if you look at pictures of the hoth base speeder not to much is noticeable	neutral
great review i bought this set when it came out but sold it a couple years later for some extra cash i have no regrets selling this one as i was never really impressed with it different story for the 4483 atat  oh how i wish i still had that one the snowspeeder was alright just didnt have any sort of wow factor to it the best part of the set is probably the rebel trooper looking at the last photo in your review looks like youre about to have a major battle in your hallway apart from the snowspeeder  motorized atat i see the arc170 fighter grievouss starfighter and is that a podracer i see  and what is the set with the treads its not star wars but looks like a pretty cool set maybe a mission mars vehicle	positive
podracer not sure where you got that from i didnt have them out the set with treads is a dino 2010 thing which fits in well after a bit of modding also there are some of the old exoforce sets out there like the fire vulture because i always saw them fitting well with star wars	neutral
skipper 24 on aug 4 2008 1252 pm said podracer not sure where you got that from i didnt have them out i noticed the minifig between the grievous starfighter  the moddino2010 vehicle and it looked like a little person sitting in the pod of his podracer guess my eyes are playing tricks on me  my eyesight is shot  my wife keeps pushing me to go visit the optometrist	neutral

7255 general greivous wheel bike chase review parts 111 figs 2 price £1000 the first set to include gg 1 general set and minifigs not manual because i dont have it the contents of the box after being built both minifigs the set includes 5 lightsabers my own design gg ggs cape on the outside ggs cape on the inside 2 the wheel bike front view standing on legs side view gg cant hold the controls because of his arms roller mode the legs are a bit to chunky so to roll it has to be tilted forward 3 boga the lizard grey tip to the tail the front back and saddle split in to three sections 4 overall build 410 there isnt really much to build minifigs 910 it comes with gg with the special cape and obiwan in rots gear which is hard to find i think design 510 not really to scale but otherwise okay apart from boga which just looks like any old dinosaur also the controls on the wheel bike arent really right parts 610 comes with some dark green bricks and lots of rods  the guns on the wheel bike the boga feet are also nice price 810 £10 for 2 figs isnt bad it could have a few more parts though playability 1010 you can easily recreate the movie scenes with this set overall 710 it would be better if the bike and boga were more to scale and more accurate as well as the set having more parts	neutral
not one of my favourite sw sets kinda boring and the set is poorly designed imho we do get the general but thats not nearly enough thanks for the reivew and fine pics kimt	negative

7153 jango fetts slave 1 review parts 358 figs 2 price £2000 i got it on offer i think the rrp was £40 the only set to include jango fett and young boba also the decals on jango are from fine clonier im trying to say they dont came with the set 1 manual worn manual random page another random page looking at this page you can that this set has numbered bags back cover look how old yodas computer looks  2 general set and minifigs the sets contents jango with his hair on jango with helmet on with front view of face twist jangos head to initiate super bounty hunter mode jangos doubled sided head boba nothing to special although i think the torso and head are exclusive to the set 3 the ship not really scaled up right as you can see the guns can rotate the central sections interior not sure what this is is it a hyperdrive or a bomb or something there are these side panels on both sides behind the panels a secret compartment trans orange minifig heads in the compartment i think theyre supposed to be saturnic charges side storage compartment the back of the ship how those trans orange minifig heads fallout there is a magnet on the inside of the ship but for what the secret prison which also has a magnet on the top so it can stay on but easily come out the doors on it can lift up to put prisoners inside 1 of 2 identical wing things they can fold for flight mode the controls bottom jet thing let me out of here the prison is great for capturing small children 4 overall build 710 impossible to build without a hard stable surface minifigs 1010 2 exclusive figs design 710 nowhere near to scale but has some nice features parts 810 good parts like that big cockpit canopy price 910 for the price i got it was pretty good especially with the figs it comes with playability 710 lots of features but it would be better if it came with a jsf overall 910 lots of features and comes with exclusive minifigs edited by kimt 04 august 2008  1144 am indexed	positive
thanks again skipper for producing yet another review to go into the index i like this slave1 but sadly i must admit that i like the really old version better boba fetts slave1 that is even though is grossly undersized i think its better than this one belonging to his father jango kimt	neutral
i have all three of the slave i ships and i agree with kimtalthough it is a very small compact ship the first slave i boba fett is still the sturdiest the newest slave i boba fett is not bad and is of much better construction than this slave i from jango fett even though i like the size and scale of the jango slave i and the newest boba fett slave iwhen you pick that very first one up it had the feeling ofyou can throw me against the wall drop me off the roof of your house or let 4 two year olds play with meim not gonna break at least thatss my opinion good review	positive
i never got the original boba fetts slave 1 i wish they would make one to scale with the minifigures i would be so cool i am also putting up a review of the clone turbo tank probably tomorrow it is a different variation to the one in the index edited by skipper 24 03 august 2008  0712 pm	neutral

very good review theres only one thing you did wrong quote nameskipper 24 post337180 dateaug 3 2008 0846 amthe controls i got this set for a very low price as well and for that its a very nice parts pack with 2 neat exclusive figs	neutral
nice review i will say i like the latest slave i the best as it is longer than jangos i havent seen the first one so i cant really comment	neutral
that was indeed a set that never appealed to me its build was just plain wrong and awful i only bought it because i found it on clearance at around 15€ and they had 4 of them if i had known better then id have bought all 4 seeing how much that jango fett minifig is worth now  but i ended up heavily modifying it in its propoions and now it looks ok next to the new slave one which is the best one of its 3 incarnations i think	negative
i got the original jsf for christmas which i might buy and review wonderful set the obi in this one is really awesome and its really just a great ship sticker free probably my favourite id fly it if any ship from star wars maybe i should get it and the slave i from episode ii after all i like jango despite having a crap story	positive
very good review i have he newest slave i and i like it more than this one dsr	neutral
you added some decals to the jango figure right  they seem to be suffering a little i remember buying this set from the discount tent after my first visit to legoland windsor i wasnt sure whether to buy it even in their sale  but i was glad i did once id built it 	neutral
yep those decals are suffering i am going to apply some new ones now with proper paper	neutral
i really want one of these if only it wasnt expensive i probably wont buy it because itd be scraped for parts too quick great review though	neutral
good review i always wanted to know how it was different to the boba fett slave i i would probably only get this though for jango fett the newer one looks sturdier and proportioned better imo	neutral
a very nicely done review i remember getting this slave i  it was my first large star wars set	positive
i remember having this set actually i even still have it at least the pars are somewhere  when i was a child and i used it for making races as it is there for all these many reviews let me think again at that i also planned to make some reviews for the town section i got your message thebrickster dont worry i got a lot to do at the moment but i should find some time this upcoming week	neutral

this little set really makes my point small playable inspiration to build the set into a few other models great set i wish i had it my town is going to need more vehicles i really miss main model instructions with alternate build ideas	neutral
nein you rejected lul luls are awesome thanks for the review i like the set a lot mace is only featured here great fig of him too i like the grey jedi robes torso cody is great as with the other figs the tanks probably a second favourite next to the mighty atat of course	positive
i hate how the original release had the lightup windu which was really lame and one less clone trooper i bought it when it first came out so missed out on a good windu and another clone trooper	neutral
i got the original version of this set with the luls mace windu figure when tlc released the nonluls version i managed to swap  they sent me the new version and a clone trooper iirc and i mailed them back the old version this was a great set the suspension worked great and it rolled magnificently nice review with good photos but again your price is a little off £6999 is the rrp unless the price you paid was £80 tk	positive
hanks for the price i got the set a while ago and couldnt remember correctly i have now changed it	neutral
skipper 24 on aug 4 2008 0404 pm said did your version without the lul mace have trans blue grill things like the ones on the back of the speeder  or was my set a one off i bought mine online thinking it was the new version but i ended up with that very lame lul fig i just hate that fig its completely useless we cant use any part of it for anything although i only discovered yesterday that the lightsaber blade was a standard one and not glued as i always believed so all isnt completely lost in the end i still was rather disappointed by the set its too full of holes  hum i think theres kind of a paradox in that sentence but the barc speeder and green clone are indeed fantastic oh and yes mine came with sand blue grill parts instead of the transyellow ones didnt realise it at first and i spent half an hour cursing thinking they forgot to put them in the box but in the end i dont know if the replacements are any better  since theyre supposed to represent some kind of thruster light or something all in all i think its my worst set not necessarily for the set itself which is ok but psychologically theres too many things that went wrong with it	neutral
good set but its flimsy as sin but that may have been my rush job building it mine got shoved off a bed oh and i lost my light up mace  propably somewhere within the blue bin o doom™ aka the brick bucket™ or blocknull™  edited by maiq the liar 04 august 2008  1015 pm	neutral
nice review again skipper i passed on this one because of the price but its a nice set good for you for getting the newer version with nonlul mace and an extra clone that purple blade sure is a beauty the tank itself is alright just an atat on wheels in my opinion the turret is great though and so is the speeder bike i didnt realize that the jet pack had two nailguns harpoon guns on it i thought that the nailgun was a new piece but the jetpack is very cool	positive

i voted above average as well but back in 1983 i would have probably gone much lower sadly i wasnt as interested in minifigs at the time i appreciated the ones i had but i really just wanted ships or bases and would have gladly passed this by for something with one or two figures and a small moon rover i skipped all of the classic minifig sets space castle and town it was only upon coming out of my dark ages that i went minifig crazy for me this is above average because of the accessories without them its an average set with a small brick built droid or a rover it would be outstanding that said id buy at least 10 copies now though id rather have a 4 figure set with one of each colour including blue i never had blue back then i think castle lured me away thanks for an interesting review it gives me a chance to further explore why i changed from shipset to minifig fan and bore all of eb with it	neutral
i wonder why this set had no blue or black astronauts whatever the case i always loved the small minifig sets that lego released as i could never get enough astronauts my favorite was the set of futuron astronauts why would the yellow astronauts freak you out sinner is it because they look nekkid 	neutral

thanks for the review simonjedi this just reaffirms that the v19 is my highest priority this fall behind the rgs of course is that new printed piece a 2 x 2 tile it looks like an excellent detail part for mocing those black pieces used on the landing gear look very bioniclelike if they havent been used before id suspect they will be not that im a bionicle expert or anything it is a shame that this set only includes one clone that seems to be the only drawback to the set everything else looks spot on	positive
first thanks simonjedi for a great review im interested in what you think of the hydrolics i could spend hours just deploying and undeploying the wings and landing gear im a little worried the very first batch of the hydrolic piece for umm i think it was the offroad 4x4 technic set was very fragile and broke after a few uses these seem to be holding up but im anxious to see if they hold up after 100200 uses quote namewalter kovacs dateaug 4 2008 1147 am post337841 those black pieces used on the landing gear look very bioniclelike if they havent been used before id suspect they will be not that im a bionicle expert or anything quote right you are they are bionicle bohrok head pieces so pretty old in bionicle terms and fairly useless in my opinion but they do make interesting looking landing gear as i deploy and redeploy the wings and landing gear hopefully well get a pilot in the battle pack to help mitigate the fact we only get one here tohst	positive
the printed part isnt new it came with 10178 motorized atat walker also nice review i would get the set if it was a little cheaper or came with more than 1 fig whyhas it got 2 instruction books the set isnt particularly big	neutral
thanks for the review ive added it to the index and added a poll in which members can vote their opinion on this set i think this is a very good set i like the colours and the very playable feature that allows the wings to lock in attack formation now all i need is to buy this baby edit i gave it an above average rating since its well designed looks sturdy and fits the sw theme sets perfectly	positive
nice review simon jedi the v19 has been one of my favourite ships since the release of cwa and this is one of the sets ive been considering most about buying its great to see tlgs treatment of it it looks like no expense was spared making it as aesthetically and functionally accurate as possible  though i think the cockpit windshield could maybe have been slightly bigger but thats just me im sure it looks pretty big compared to other starfighters too did it take a long time to build	positive
great review simonjedi  i really like that you included lots of photos of your build i put together my v19 torrent last night and i was surprised by how heavy the completed ship is it has some real heft once its finished wow it is a really cool ship i was disappointed that the central wing doesnt really lock into place once it flips down it just kind of droops there so i attached a technic pin to the locking arm so it could plug into the 2x4 brick thats on the underside of the starfighter this brick can be seen in your photo of the bottom of the ship overall the build is one of the more confusing that ive seen i had to dismantle and rebuild the first engine after i realized id left out a piece and i kept thinking of the poor 7yearold that gets this set as hisher very first lego set ever	negative
the v19 was my first tcw set i buyed it when i was visiting my father i just wanted to build it there and i do so but how do you will get sthbig like this with in the train so i had to destroy him when i was still home again i had to build it 3 times because the mechanic dont works i only can say that the v19 is one of the best tcw sets thanks to you for the review simonjedi  i just wanted to make one in german but now i neednt to make it	positive
pedro on aug 5 2008 1229 pm said it looks pretty big compared to other starfighters too did it take a long time to build it took me 3 and a bit hours to build it although i had some problems with the technic and i had to take pictures during the build	neutral

the ability for it to fold in and out of attack position has wowed me this is my top priority now thanks for making up my mind	positive
rayman on oct 4 2008 1111 pm said hydraulic wings i am very impressed and am now considering getting this set purely because of this funciton i am just curious as to know why are there sand green parts on the bottom of the v19 is it visible when the model is completed i am also pleased to see tlc giving us a printed cockpit computer this time around while i do like the functions and they way it is built i cannot get into this model first the price is a bit steep i know all the cw sets are expensive but this one just seems more so to me i mean there is only 1 fig in here second to me there is no playability or displayability i gave below average	neutral

i love this set and i gave it outstanding i might note though that the cylinder is just there as a dampener when disenegaged the wing function still works just not as smoothly interestingly though the cylinder is an old piece i have a few others its just that this is the first time its been used without a spring i had no problems assembling this set	positive
i voted outstanding this is simply an amazingly good looking train and comes with indeed 11 minifigs i sold this one because i need a budget to build my ship but i kept one because i love it not bad for a first review ruben	positive
oh ruben you lucky so and so this set is one of the most beautful i have ever seen splendid looking build and 11 figures all the same faces like but still you get that old woman pigtail head piece which is just great i thought you meant the monorail set when you told me about this but guess i was wrong dont laugh ive been away from lego for quite some time and for 80 euros it was a real bargain from a great friend really nice review hope this sets brings you years of joy	positive
cool review i actually have two of these i got one for christmas when it was rereleased in 2003 and another one in a charity shop a few months later for €5 i love the minifigs even if they all have smileys and having two sets of them can really fill up a town	positive
its great to see someone reviewing a train this set is definately a five lego hasnt made a complete train set like this in a long time the metroliner is really a legend among classic trains the great level of playability and detailing makes it a terrific model specifically i was just noticing the details of the passenger car it has a sink  how cool is that and 11 minifigs  when was the last time lego included 11 figs in a single set a truly outstanding train set thanks for sharing images as ive always wanted to see it upclose it would be awesome if you could share some single side shots of the cars	positive
outstanding train set the legend of the entire train series is the metroliner this is a super 5 set the color design minifigs is just so perfect and lovely it resemble the trains which we see on our rails in our daily life i cant find any flaws on this at all the only flaw i noticed is my mistake of not able to buy this set at all in fact i had never seen this set in the shops before in my entire life thebrickster on aug 5 2008 0923 am said how cool is that and 11 minifigs  when was the last time lego included 11 figs in a single set there is another set fufil the criteria above which is also a well known legend it has 12 minifigs which is the 10159 city airport aka century skyway airport	positive
nice review i collect all metroliner i can i have 3 metroliner and when i can i buy a other  my aim  have the more big metroliner collect in france  in first time  its my favorite set	positive
really nice train i always wished tlg would have made the passenger ir train longer and maybe used some of the nice features of this train i still love that faucet piece	positive
i also voted outstanding for the simple reason that ive owned this set for a long time but for most of the time its been an anonymous heap of bricks mixed with all the other bricks i have so about a year ago i started rebuilding it and it now sits proudly next to also rebuilt 2150 on my shelf imo its an excellent set best of the 9v passenger trains no doubt and it combines the best of the 80s trains with that of the 90s  its not some futuristic panoramaglassed lowslung train but an honest realisticlooking train that captures many of the features that passenger trains used to and in some cases still have	positive
hairy ruben on aug 5 2008 1200 am said the interior of the two however is laid out a bit differently the space in the front carriage is occupied by a cockpit or whatever it is called in trains and some space to store your cable connecting the front lights with the engine i can imagine it must get quite cramped and dangerous for the minifig driver with all the cabling further back we have a quite random weird looking engine one part reminded me rather of a jet engine on a commercial airplane the engine is accessible by means of the two side cargo doors at the end of our first carriage we hit what looks like the trains restaurant two tables and no chairs there shouldnt be so much of the light cable in the front section or cockpit most of the cable should be in the central part of the train then it is not so crowded for the engine driver i have never had a problem with the cable and the space available for it the only problem i had was that the cable had a loose contact after some time when the train went into a curve cant remember if it was a left or right curve the light went off i have now got the same problem with the cable that i put into my santa fe super chief always when the engine turns into a right curve the light goes off my dad could repair the cable for the metroliner even though he is quite skilled at repairing electronic things he found it very difficult to repair since there were no screws to open the electronic plate it annoyed him a lot so ive been asking myself if i should really bother him with a second cable with the same problem the train set itself is outstanding and thats what i voted for i only have the legend 10001 but its 99 identical to 4558 i also have club car 4547 i dont have the legend club car 10002 the reason for this is i always had the choice between one big lego set or several small ones for christmas when i was a child i always went for several small ones metroliner 4558 would have been a big train set but i really wanted a passenger car so i bought 4547 with my savings without having the metroliner i was quite happy when the metroliner was rereleased i bought it with my own money then i could finally use the club car with the train it was created for edited by legotrainfan 15 august 2008  0755 pm	neutral
i dont like the set and i do like the set the reason why i like it it looks good the reason why i hate it this train was the first train for the new 9v system and it means to me the end of the beautiful 12v series for this last reason i own this set i voted average only strange they named it metroliner in holland when we speak of a metro i need to think at short distance trains only used in big cities like rotterdam and your minifigs at pic aint right according the instruction 	neutral

i never got this set i spent a long time after one christmas trying to get and failed miserably admittedly i was much younger then it has however remained one of my most sought after items but i’ve still never got around to getting one the set generally makes me rather nostalgic for a time when the trains were painted in simple liveries like that one anyway it seems an excellent set from what i’ve seen and the figure selection is amazing i hope lego produce something as good as this when the new trains are released next year	positive
i got my indy exclusive in the mail today packaging front back instructions minifigs this set comes with 1 minifig the standard indy with hat and whipno satchel the build i am really happy with the amount of frown headlight bricks that come with this set 12 in all the mudguards are cleverly built with 1 x 2 panels and 1 x 1 panel corners in dark green in the first 2 pages of the instructions there are a lot of great pieces this set would sell like mad if it were released for sale parts monkeys alone would go insane buying these up for the dark green and frown pieces the body of the car consists of black plates brackets and modified bricks with curved tops that allow the dark green mudguards to just peak out cool technique the grill looks cool using only six pieces i wish all small sets were this unique and cool heres the completed jeep it looks a little small for an actual jeep but for a brickmaster set its awesome imo some more detail shots of the set with indy in the drivers seat i hope they take brickmaster exclusives overseas because itd be awesome if everybody could get these my buddy copmike would probably love to be the first to review this set so ive dedicated my review comic to him my rating playability 810 you need to add some other sets and characters to really play with this set design 910 great techniques and inclusion of rare parts but loses a point for being an unrealistic size for a jeep price 1010 part of the brickmaster package it is a reasonable prize for an exclusive set and everything else that comes with the subscription overall 910 great but not perfect and definitely needs to be offered overseas lego would make a ton of money releasing this for sale imo as it really is a terrific small set	positive
super review thanks simply put id have to admit this is one of the best indy sets and in such a small package its a very detailed lil jeep and thats why i like it i have this too but i dont want to open it since its exclusive wait i thought we were calling it rown and not frown	positive
thanks for the review hinckley i love this set i still havent renewed my bm subscription but im sure i can find this on ebay or bricklink and what an addition this would be to my army edited by vbbn 05 august 2008  0132 am	positive
nice review hinckley i just got mine as well by paying quite a high price for it since its exclusive to us however i had not opened it yet and i left it in my friends car i gave it for an above average for that cool little jeep for an exclusive brickmaster set this is certainly one of the best vehicles i had ever seen i like its construction built if this is ever released in the main stream i am sure it will be a hit to get a small sized indiana jones set	positive
outstanding set and review thanks for presenting it ive had this since it first came out but didnt think it would be that impressive so i didnt bother opening it now im tempted aside from the slight size issue i cant find anything here to gripe about except for the limited availability i want 5 i think that makes me a parts monkey eek eek youre exactly right about this selling like mad its another one of those missed opportunities for tlg sure its nice to get people to subscribe by offering it as part of brickmaster but in the long run put it in the stores for 6 and sell a million just give us indys manbag we need it for postal employees and such as is the running joke whenever i comment on one of your reviews id give this a solid 985 not out of anything just 985 or in clearer terms  12 though i voted 5	positive
nice review i would like to get this set unfortunately i dont get brickmaster mag and the prices on bl ebay will most likely be ridiculous i wonder why indy doesnt come with his murse man purse in this set thats the best part of the fig the jeep itself is very nice especially with the dark green by the way what is frown brownish something i guess oh yeah and funny comic	positive
looks really nice if they keep making bm sets like this i might actually subscribe nice comic too remind me not to run into copmike and his gloveless hand	positive

thanks for the good review  i can´t wait for mine to arrive and just think how close paulc was in his reverse building of this which turned into a event exclusive in billund  he was just wrong on the color of the headlight bricks black instead of frown and the rear bumper stuff which couldn´t be seen on the bag picture kudos paulc as for my badass patrol car and the sop standard operation procedure of cavity searches there´s more to see here over at brickzone  here´s a teaser copmike	positive

outback amazon crossing gday mates another fine review from the legolands desert down under this set makes for an excellent addition to your jungles deserts outbacks or other wild and untamed places set  6490 theme outback year released 1997 piece count 117 minifigs 1 list price 15 usd starting with an image of the box one can conclude that this doesnt look like the amazon at all but rather the outback on the back of the box are some great alternate models including a creative idea for a crocodile zoo scene the instructions have the same images on the front and back the set comes with one outback fig a man dressed in green with a bright red cap  i call him the crocodile hunter also included in this set is a crocodile some bones a skull backpack pan and a few extra trans round 1x1s the tools are pictured on the truck now heres a great desertrugged terrain truck ready for some 4wheeln fun i love the liftable top windowsun roof and the windshield i like the use of these colored trans blue pieces that contrast against the yellow rather than hide like regular clear pieces the truck has a few hooksclips to attach a pick rifle antena and camera also attached is a wateroil can and an extra tire that just rests in the back section the front end of the truck has a great winch and hook to help the truck out of hard places working suspension helps the vehicle travel on rough terrain the truck is just half the fun this set also offers a nice bridgecreek bed for the truck to drive across i like the use of six fenceladder pieces for the bridge the two in the center have double open sides heres the left side and the right side with a single burp as a mountainhill i really like the use of the tan and brown baseplates representing desert and water the complete set as the crocodile hunter tries to climb back into the truck after attaching the winch final thoughts ive always liked this little set it offers a great amount of playability with the wonderful little 4stud wide truck and bridge scene a few years ago playmobil offered a desert racing theme and had this set as my favorite of the collection desert racing and adventures through dry creeks and rough terrain make for a great theme hope you enjoy this review and consider picking up an outback set or two if you can still buy at a reasonable price happy outbacking the complete outback theme 6444 outback airstrip 6487 mountain rescue 6490 amazon crossing 6550 outback desert racer 6553 crisis news crew edit i dedicate this review to the memory of steve irwin 1962  2006 tribute	neutral
thanks for this review if youd only know what memories you brought back i think i remember this set better than any other i had when i was a child some time after i got it i decided to disassemble it and combine it with the jeep from 6552 rocky river retreat it came out pretty good though as it became the main attraction point of my town beeing the car of my favourite minifig back then and and and looong story  i kept it assembled that way from this day on until earlier this year when i finally disassembled it because i needed the parts edited by metalandi 06 august 2008  0357 am	positive
a nice set to go with the outback theme i am kind of dissapointed they they didint continue the theme as i only managed to grab 6487 and 6550 none the less this set is very interesting as its one of the few to feature working suspention stauder	positive
stauder on aug 7 2008 0617 am said the great thing about the copter was it had 2 suitcases which as far as i can tell aint a common part not rare but still nice to have and it had the guy with the green jacket the winch wasnt bad either the only flaw was it was a standard lego copter meaning similar ones where avalible in quite a few sets do you plan to review it oh i wish i had it i dont recall seeing 6487 in the stores back when i purchased the other outback sets id love to see a review	positive

oh i loved this set when i was young i think i got it for my birthday and it was one of my favourite sets at the time funnily enough i was thinking about it the other day and how i really should build it again thanks for the nostalgic review	positive
very interesting indeed i especially like the folding ladder i never thought of making such a clever function i might have to use it in my future lego models another great reveiw bloody jay 	positive
tks for the review once more jay  i totally agree with you jay  this set has very nice details suche as the mini gun movable ladder green barrels and great figs  however it is very expensive for what it is and i dont think there are that many very usefall parts in there  well i could use those treads  if i ever buy this set its really not for the design which i totally dislike	positive

nice review cobra thanks for sharing i think arctic was one of those neat themes that never really took off i like these little polybag sets as they make great startersintroduction sets for themes or serve as a nice supplement or addon to an existing collection ive always liked the thick green hood piece used in the arctic theme and have thought about using it in a sw hoth scene in any case nice review ive got an arctic set that i built recently and will share a review soon	positive
here we are my first clone wars set and my first star wars review here we have the wonderful droid gunship one of the cheaper of the clone wars sets this set is exclusive to walmart and its one of the better exclusives out there im looking at you twilight  first off we have a shot of the entire set with the box a random page shot along with pics of the parts list the build is split up into three sections the back the cockpit and the missles the back has a lot of nice dark blue plates and is the only part of the set which uses stickers the bottoms shows various technic systems which ill get to later the cockpit has many details mostly guns and the rotating guns are a nice touch the cockpit can fit a battle droid but not a minifig im not sure why a droid would want leather though the last part is loading this baby with the missles there are four blacksmall and two dark bley large missles which are loaded in groups of three as sls the middle mechanism is for the missiles and the back part with the bionicle teeth are used ad landing gear the knob on top turns to release the missiles on the clones  leftover bits and the used ssnot so d this time around the gunship versus a time traveling agent charge  overall build 810 a basic build but at some points repetitive minifigs 1010 just your basic droids you cant go wrong design 710 a basic design with some interesting techniques pieces 910 a mix of old and new pieces along with the return of this lovely piece which hasnt been seen for almost 10 years price 810 30 for a gunship ill take it final verdict 810 a great price for a small set like this and it has a great bit of swooshability	positive
nice review agentrick30 is a good price but tlc think thats €40 so ill have to pass btw i thought this ship was supposed to hold many droids like in sw battlefront oh well its good for show edited by skinny boy 09 august 2008  0931 pm	positive

i dont really like this set because it isnt my idea of the droid gunship which is from sw battlefront which can hold as many droids as a rgs can hold clones if i buy this itd be for the dark blue pieces which is the signature color of one of my castle nations  dark red and dark blue 	negative

i got this yesterday on sale only 5500 yen60 american and was a little disappointed id avoided it but all the new sets are at least a month away here it looks a little weird in photo and the actual build is worse just a flat little disc with a cockpit only special points for the color which will probably just look better with those 2009 sets	negative
wow and people complain that a military type line would be to violent here we have half dead soilders and a space shuttle bombing people with severed skeleton heads i have to say this is the first time ive heard of this theme i like the colors as most have pointed out the base plate is preety cool two could use it to moc up some garages	positive
i am a proud owner of this set like others i got it discounted and couldnt resit the parts pack this is the type of lego sets that bothers me when you look at it now youd be tempted to say hey not bad but at the same time some years ago it wasnt good enough to buy it full price i was kinda disappointed because usually sets using that kinda baseplates are excellent castle paradisa and this one is just ok one really minus point would be the lack of any opponent faction in the set	negative
thats it thanks for the review but now you make me want to build my own one thanks a lot on a more serious note i really like this set and have always wished to aquire it i have two broken tie interceptors so this should be a easy build and as someone in the pirate forum i think said it would be a great baseplate for building cave to hide the booty thanks pmg and welcome	positive
another outstanding review by the awesome set reviewer i enjoyed reading this review very much and i felt that you have redress twilight in an approriate manner i have very mixed feeling about this set especially with its design it seemed i will need to watch the clone wars movie in the theatre before i compared with it most of the time when this lego set is used in a movie you will tend to compare it and what is the actual purpose for twilight same as the rest of the sw vehicles and aircraft for a high price like this i can actually top up a little more and get the atte with the same batch of minifigs plus commander rex if there is a special figure such as the v19 torrent clone pliot it will be a much ideal scenario at the moment i have not bring in any clone war sets into my collection and i am quite sure twilight is not in my priority list especially when i am not a fullpledged star war collectors or i have strong intentions to complete the entire range in this recent release therefore i need to prioritise my purchase and likely to get two rgs since that is my favourite ship in clone war era i am not comparing it with rgs both sets defintely have their pros and cons oh i love that postcard you made certainly looks very nice sveltecorps thanks for doing up this superb detailed review which had given twilight the neccessary attention it should have	neutral
really awesome review sveltecorps  you did a really complete and indepth review of this beast and with your nice pics is really enjoyable reading your review so congrats  i like this ship even if it looks so bulky but i need to buy first other sets so maybe this beast will be landing in my collection the next year or this one if i am lucky  i can just ask for something can you post a pic of all your clone wars sets together with this one all the sets in one pic not many pics with this an each set  please  edited by darkrebellion 12 august 2008  0220 am	positive

wow certainly much bigger than i would have thought thanks for the great review and pictures  well for some reason i was drawn to this set but with the lack of interior and quite a bit of technics i think ill pass or at least get the atte first thanks again	neutral
i read the visual guide recently and learned a bit more about the twilight i wont get into spoilers but it seems that the ship becomes a sort of endearing family van for the characters which is neat big bulky uncool but it gets you from one place to another if it factors into more than just the 90 minute film i may pick this up it seems that theres room for a lot of personality in this ship once you see the film it is a corellian freighter smuggling spice for the hutts thats cool right	neutral

this is probably the best review ive ever seen why it put the set in context with peoples changing thoughts about it it commented on the box why do such expensive sets have such ordinary boxes the photography was outstanding every issue that a builder could have with it was discussed in a calm and rational manner i have the same issues with technic structured sets and sveltecorps summed up my feelings on this beautifully this was an even handed review so thoughtful finally you gotta love a bit of humour in a review that gardenis brilliant i was probably never going to get this set anyway but it sets a new worlds best standard for reviews i strongly encourage anyone thats going to review a set to have a good look at this to see how well it can be done thanks for the magnificent review	positive
zzz on aug 12 2008 0900 pm said and i simply love that there is space inside you said there is not really some cause of the landing gear mechanism but it seems it should be easily fixed do you think there is enough space to put some plates over the landing gear and add some beds kitchen und tv i think this set is so perfect to mod it into a clone wars mobile home your back garden ist just perfect for this it does have that homely feel there is room inside with technic beams to lay plates etc on the only issue is that its kind of fiddly to access you could do it from either the side door or rear door though maybe move that tow line at the back i have to say it is a set that grows on you	positive
thank you sveltecorps for the review i like the inside nice and cosey i also like your little garden for me this put the twilight different in a better perspective than my first perspective of the twilight i voted outstanding greets theforce	neutral
seems like tlc has done a pretty accurate representation of the ship the real fault for the ships messy design has to go to lucasfilm not tlc my guess is lucasfilm is trying to recapture that what a piece of junk magic of the millennium falcon i guess well have to wait to see the movie to see if they succeeded or not the idea of a space mobile home reminds me of the winnebago from spaceballs great review informative entertaining and opinionated so many people shy away from stating an actual opinion in their review for fear of offending anyone whats the point of making a review if you dont state what you think about it	neutral
sveltecorps on aug 12 2008 0219 am said hmm dior i can smell it now the ship doesnt look too swooshable but then again more than the heavy rgs i really like that review svelte corps so much detail unfortunately i would only get this if it was a very low price like in a sale	neutral
thanks for yet another awesome review quote seems like tlc has done a pretty accurate representation of the ship the real fault for the ships messy design has to go to lucasfilm not tlc my guess is lucasfilm is trying to recapture that what a piece of junk magic of the millennium falcon i guess well have to wait to see the movie to see if they succeeded or not this sums up my opinion exactly i can easily admit that the design of the kit is spot on  but unfortunately the actual design of the ship in the new movie is garbage actually despite the millennium falcons odd design i really think its a pretty appealing ship  and its really cool i cant say the same for the twilight though	negative
i think some people agree that this ship is better than when we first saw those pictures at least i do it looks like it has some nice accessories that come with the ship as well my favorite of you custom things has got to be the octopus its so funny and a great use for the headdress thing great review edited by skipper 24 13 august 2008  1124 am	positive

dovchenko on aug 13 2008 1229 pm said looks fine but still that designs quite a downer but look at that wing design its lovely looks exactly like the b29 bombers wings look like	negative
thanks for the review i for one will get this set i collect and therefore i need it i vision something like this a i buy the set b i built the set c pics for my bs account d set taken apart sad but true its not much but super for parts i agree from what your review showed me that this set is a little too much technic a thing thats been invading our beloved brick built sets in the past years i really have no need for a retractable front or functioning landing gear what i need is a kickass ship with neat design and cool interior the twilight does not offer that look at the size of that thing	negative
good review there my daughter loves the backyard garden of the twilight my opinion of the ship has changed after reading this thanks	positive

having plenty of time on my hands this summer i did some reviews yes im aware this has already been done but ill just do it once more no harm there set 5615 set title the knight price 299 euro  349 usd pieces 21 yes a whole 21 bricks release 2007 the box a neat little box that has a great size for dropping into your shopping cart for once tlg didnt shove the bricks into an oversized cardboard box  the knight this is a great minifig though he looks a little unsatisfiedmight be because his head isnt put on all the way a great army builder fig the only thing that i find a little annoying is that the collar isnt completely rounded it looks too much like an animation and lefthand work the weapon rack yes thumbs up for this plate mail sword shield and jousting helmet plus the spear and open helmet on the fig so many great additions to put into use bring it on pesky skeleton army the all in all verdict a great set a little too expensive compared to the crossbow attack in which one gets 2 knights and a skeleton plus bricks for 549 euro  599 usd but still a great army builder set and the 7090 set does not have the same knight fig kimt	positive
i bought four of these sets i guess this was the best selling impulse set so far great idea to have weapons and helmet choice as for the price id say 7090 is surprisingly cheap	positive
very good set indeed the possibility to alter the knights appearance hugely boosts the value very smart thinking of tlc got one of these so far but if i ever do a castlerelated comic or animation this will be the set i buy tons of	positive
argh what i was typing kept getting deleted by my stupid keyboard on topic this looks like a great little set i could use a few of these but i havent seen any at a local store too bad for me i suspose  great review and i like the green plate on the bottom never can have too many greens for my small but expanding swamp im building hope i can pick some of these up eventualy	positive
time for another of the great castle sets and yes this one is a great army builder set as well d set 7090 set title crossbow attack price 529 euro  599 usd pieces 54 release 2007 the box and as the other two sets reviewd so far 7009 and 5615 this one has a fitting box that is too easily snatched from the shelf and put into your shopping cart  not sure its a great thingtoo expensive in the end d the crossbow attack cart the cart is a neat little build that actually works and for once were not given that awful technic launcher but a buildit launcher it actually works just fine for its purpose the addition of two crossbows makes it worth buying never can get enought weapons for the evergrowing crownie army the figs oddly ive not taken any pics of the figs and therefore ill illustrate using the sh pic the figs are great i love the silver helmets and in this set you get 2 crownies and a skeleton plus a white skeleton horse thats a lot of figs for a set this size a true army builder thumbs up for that the all in all verdict another small yet super set in the castle theme i bought several of these to make a fine little army its cheap and often found on sale i can hardly resist buying it when i see it kimt	positive
hard to find in italian shops i had a friend buying one for meas soon as the set was available i always wanted another one so while in switzerland see kimts 7009 review for the full story i bought two for 5 €uros you get two knights a skeleton and a skeleton horse some hand weapons and a shooting device please remember dont aim at the eyes just great	positive
this little bugger brought me back from my dark ages as a movie fan i just couldnt resist the thought of making an animation with living lego skeletons im referring to ray harryhausens work on the classic jason and the argonauts here buying the indy sets stopped me from getting a lot more castle sets though in time i added the final joust the wizard and the impulse knight to my collection as well as buying more unique figs king princess from expensive castle sets off bricklink so yeah great little set two crownies a skeleton and a skeletal horse you just cannot resist that even if you hadnt been buying lego for 5 years as far as im concerned this set is one for the ages i love it	positive
and another set enters the scene set 7009 set title the final joust price 829 euro  799 usd pieces 62 release 2007 the box and yet again tlg has put the bricks in a box that somehow corresponds with the amount of bricks in it the castle theme has got well designed boxes  the whole set build 2 knights jousting fence and weapon rack the weapons rack another great addition of weapons flail halberd and skeleton scimitar super weapons for those close encounter melee battles fought when tipped off the horse  grinp the jousting fence not much to say its a fence simple yet it serves its purpose very well the crown knight gotta love that guy he looks like nothing can hurt him he even got a selfsufficient smile on his face im sure hes convinced that no skeleton can defeat him also the horse its barding and the headcover looks awesome a great old school sword and the ever cool normannic shield what could possibly go wrong for this knight the helmet i really love imo its a lot better than the old knight helmets see review of 5615 the knight for a pic of one of those the skeleton knight the black skeleton horse rocks i love that design and in black its even badder than than the white version the shield reeks of dread and the knight is one bad skeleton on the rampage i do find that the helmet is a little off id rather have a black knights helmet instead the kk helmet doesnt really do it for me the all in all verdict this is another great army builder set it holds a lot of great weapons some cool minifigs and great pieces the only thing that puzzles me is why would a crown knight joust a skeleton doesnt really make sense kimt	positive
ive been waiting to hold this set in my hands for about a year and a half thanks to a silly tlc decision 7009 was not available in italian stores i finally decided to buy it on the net 2x  plus some other sets and those morons at the custom charged me quite a lot after i bought it while waiting for it to arrive i found out it was available in a store in switzerland not far away from home thats for the storytelling as for the set i thought it was great and still think so a good army builder as quite a few sets in the 20072008 castle line and a time traveller 6021 being my first lego castle set ever rating 55 edited by the cobra 13 august 2008  0904 pm	positive
another small set my local target doesnt have they dont have the best castle selection they only really have dwarven mines and castle seiges ill buy this if i see it there though because it looks like a great little set i could use the awesome knight and a skeleton that has a regular body so he looks like he is in armor	positive
im not a huge fan of this set but it is a great way to nab a fully mounted knight complete with a very attractive barding given that in prior years it wasnt possible to get a barded horse in such a small set this set is actually a decent way to build a mounted cavalry for your kingdom looking at bricklink it would probably cost as much to buy the knight horse and weapons separately and that doesnt take into account the skeleton or the extra bricks despite my indifference to this set i actually have purchased four of them in the past year simply because there isnt a cheaper way to acquire a mounted knight a quick question about the poll are we voting on the quality of the set or the quality of the review later edited by blueandwhite 13 august 2008  0550 am	neutral

this set is a great little bundle the kitted out knight skellie knight weapons and the few bricks for the fence and weapon rack the castle 07 barding here is very nice indeed the colour scheme of the new castle guys is great imo the light blue and blue work nicely together and against the grey background i dont really like the pearl grey helmet  it would be nicer in metallic silver like the visor i think interesting comment re the skellie helmet  i guess black normal knights helmet with visor would be quite nice for him i got this set as part of the complete castle collection from sh however i have extras of all the smaller sets and skeleton tower except i dont have another one of this set its on my list of sets to buy unfortunately it wasnt on sh for ireland when i was making later orders  quite an odd omission also last year castle 07 was exclusive to argos uk catalogue retailer who only had three sets not the joust i should see if the local toy store has it now though as they did stock some 07 castle in addition to 08 at the start of the year i think small sets like this should be well stocked in shops for a year or two  it surely doesnt do their sales much good to be so sporadically available sorry turned into a bit of a ramble anyways the point is that this set is good enough id pick up another the cobra that sucks about customs i try to keep my orders to within the €23 dutyfree limit for here in ireland if your imports are waylaid you pay 20 import duty 21 sales tax and a postage fee for the diversion to customs nasty edited by brickzone 13 august 2008  1115 am	positive
kimt on aug 13 2008 0500 am said the quality of the set feel free to comment on the review andor set also thanks  the set is average its useful for picking up a few knights but im not really partial to the skeleton the idea of a knight and a skeleton tilting just strikes me as being odd my biggest issue with the current castle line is that most sets force you to purchase a mixture of skeletonsknights orcsknights orcsdwarves etc this is fine for those of you who love your fantasy however it makes the line a bit underwhelming for the rest of us still as mentioned earlier the set does have an upside so it is worth a purchase the review on the other hand is aces with great photos and a detailed description of the set and its contents nice work	neutral
you know what i think this set has charm lots of it im not a big fan of castle having very few sets all of them spanning different nationsarmies but i couldnt resist this set and while not obvious at first it really is backwards compatible with every castle set with a horse in it nonetheless i think this set is great its simple cheap and has charm thats good enough for me plus it has that fantastic grinning knight and the black skeleton horse those just made it better	positive
perhaps he meant the pearl light grey lance which is not that common	neutral
dj2005 on aug 29 2008 1126 am said im a bit curious does the knights helm have a hole for plume i can answer on behalf for kimt if memories served me right yes there is a hole for placing the knights plume do correct me wrong if i had answered wrongly its been awhile since i last touched my castle sets thanks kimt for this fine review this is one of the castle sets which i had bought high volume mainly for its horses barding and the weapons a great army builder and accessories for your castle armies this is an instant 5	positive
first things first the knights helm does have a spot for a plume now i really like this set and it was the first one i dug into when i got my collection in the mail it has a great selection of equipment for good or evil figures and the barding for the horse is outstanding my only wish was for one of the long chrome swords for the knights i think the new knights with the tall shield and chrome sword look excellent on foot and on horseback it would definitely be neat to revisit this set with another human knight instead of the skeleton make that change and add a lady to joust for and itd be bang on	positive
indexed name holiday villa theme lego system  town year 1988 pieces 197 minifigs 2 price usd  there were quite a few sets in the 1980s that werent sold in the us i remember reading once that it was because they contained wine glasses and tlg felt they wouldnt be able to market a toy that encourage the drinking of alcohol this set was one of them i remember seeing this in a catalog that came with a fabuland set and wondering what it was and where i could get one i wrote to lego and got an overseas catalog which had the futuron 6990 monorail transport system in it before it was available in the us i was amazed i ended up buying 6349 holiday villa from that catalog but for some reason gave it to my best friend for his birthday ive always wanted this set and finally bought it from bricklink this year my purchase included everything except the box i really like the boxes but in lieu of a boxshot here is the instruction manual i imagine this was the image on the front of the box the parts one of the things that appealed to me about this set is its abundance of rare parts this base plate is an excellent piece and was only available in two sets classic lego telephone technically these blue windows 1 x 4 x 5 windows are only available in this set according to bricklink it was available in different form with and without fixed glass trans blue glass in other sets regardless this size and color window is rare and the blue door was only available in 4 sets this was a huge selling point for me as im a window monkey never heard that term its like a parts monkey a collector who buys mulitples of sets just for parts or large lots of bulk from bl and sorts them into bins but just for windows tell your friends i coined the term these sloped windows have endless possibilities in many themes maybe not with the curtain decals applied but are another great rare part that appears in this set the build remember this piece id like to see a badass agents car built on this car base  i am a fan of the sixwide car but i see the appeal of the four wide it has a very nostalgic feel to it theres no denying that this is a beauty of classic lego 4wide cars this set comes with two minifigures one of which appears to be a painter classic vintage lego figs onto the house which begins with the basic floorplan a kitchen thats open to the rest of the house and a little oven and hood vent is one of my favorite touches its one thing to throw an oven into a house set but the designer of this set made it a cool part of the architecture of the house which gives it a unique feel the completed first floor and carport i do wish the sides of the roof were white with a little overhang like an actual roof this method of white on bottom red on top looks more like a childs drawing than a real house this is easily fixed with some modifying still you get a lot of roof pieces in this set here we have the completed set the husband cleans the yard while the wife gets plastered on wine dont tell the american kids another angle working in the kitchen getting smashed before dinner i think she may have a serious problem the bedroom a little stark but the bed looks comfy overall shot of the interior rating playability 910 the possibilities are endless with drunky mcwinewine and husband really playability is up to the imagination of the player its a house not really very actionpacked design 9510 great design with plenty of rare parts love the classic car too loses half a point for the all red roof price na i believe this was inexpensive but since i have no proof i will have to leave this factor out of the overall rating overall 92510 classic sets like this all deserve 10s in my book but looking at it with an objective eye its excellent but not perfect	positive
this looks like a really great set i wasnt around in 88 to get it but i like it it actually has things inside the interior thanks for the review hinckley on aug 13 2008 0611 pm said there were quite a few sets in the 1980s that werent sold in the us hooray sort of in england we dont get in normal shops batman and spongebob sets and not at all  avatar sets and brickmaster but america gets all of these maybe its revenge for americas lego neglect in the 80s hinckley on aug 13 2008 0611 pm said i remember reading once that it was because they contained wine glasses and tlg felt they wouldnt be able to market a toy that encourage the drinking of alcohol this set was one of them they didnt want to encourage the drinking of alcohol in america but were fine encouraging it in other places maybe thats why my country has such a big problem with binge drinking or maybe not	positive
thats a great review of a great set hinckley i voted for outstanding  this set is simply amazing i regrettably dont own this set since its very hard to find on ebay andor the stickers are missing but nevertheless i hope that i one day will be able to get this awesome set  or even better  see tlg releasing a new city villa in a style similar to that brilliant set  klausdieter edited by klausdieter 13 august 2008  0630 pm	positive
nice set what a great find this is one thing i think the tlg has forgotten about the creator houses are nice but they are not really geared toward a town them no mini figs cars etc these sets were and that adds so much to a town layout it cant be overlooked i really like this i may have to start my ebay searching thanks hinckley	positive
hinckley on aug 13 2008 0949 pm said i think this was an early sign of american parents being hypersensitive to things wont somebody think of the children guarded inn was another set only sold in the shopathome and not in stores for the same reason and to think that this is the same place that got dino sets with guns when we europeans got them without well that is a couple of decades later	neutral

great review and great set i just wanted to comment on the beauty of the car included in this set it gets no better than a fourwide car and hinged roof with sunroof	positive
great review id give this set an 8 at the least its just a tad too simple for my liking but other than that it looks great while im a 4 wide car man i actually think this car looks rather horrendous the main body seems way too low in comparison with the windows the rare parts however do make up for it hinckley on aug 13 2008 1123 pm said yes yes in the states horrifying and deplorable violence is fine but drinking and swearing sends kids directly to hell somehow i feel like watching south park now  that was such a good episode	neutral

thanks for the wonderful review this is really a beautiful set  i love the old lego houses from the 80s and 90s  they were always very quaint and well designed actually i like the old car designs too but only for their nostalgic value in reality they are very unrealistic and look more like go carts that said not all four wide cars are silly looking  the 4wide cars in these city sets are awesome and fit in with the modern city style great	positive
cool review i never knew that those wineglasses could be the reason for this not being sold in the us	neutral
i wish i could find this set some day including the right baseplate some of my house mocs are styled after the classic 6349 and sometimes ive rebuilt it after instruction scans exchanging the baseplate i dont own one of these with 2 at 16x32 each and this city house out of an older thread of mine its offensive that ive used styling elements of 6349s just enlarged in terms of interior details not much but still enough for classic town i voted outstanding mfg widdi edited by widdi 09 october 2008  0122 am	positive
this is an awesome set man and a great review just too bad it is so rare i voted 5 by the way does anyone know if there is a review for this or other sets that come with a camper perhaps also i was wondering if the creator houses are in scale and could be used with minifigs and such	positive

this would be great for any pirate fan the extraback pack for the soldiers some spare owes for the row boats a female face for a wench and a rather simple raft for that unlucky pirate lost at sea over all a nice set i am a little confused by the dynamite though perhaps an easy way to go fishing or perhaps to clear a rock in the forseen future or is it that she is just a suicide bomber attacking the white house water joke not ment to be tasteless or offensive to those lost in the act of terrosim greatest respect to those who have lost loved ones great review regards cpt pb	positive
aerial recovery set  6462 theme town resq year released 1998 piece count 201 minifigs 3 list price 25 usd my personal favorite of the resq theme released in 1998 was this helicopter 6462 aerial recovery the set offered a pretty modern helicopter raft threewheeler rescue gurney and net and three figs including a diver the set is actionpacked and offers a high degree of play value starting with the box front side and back front back i always liked the rough oceansea water pictured in the boxart the same image from the front of the box appears on the cover of the instructions but the back of the instructions picture a plain view of the copter one sticker sheet with a few resq stickers is included mainly for the tail section of the helicopter interestingly the set includes three figures one being a diver what i always found strange is the inclusion of an xtreme team diver who has the logo on his torso although its a very nice fig back shot i think this was my first set with a lego threewheeler i always liked it a lot the set includes a yellow raft also found in the divers sets and some scuba gear note the raft has a black piece in its center for lifting up by the helicopter for sea and emergent rescue a gurney can also be lifted by the helicopter the set also includes a net with hook to lift the threewheeler and other items an extra string pulls the net closed heres a shot of the helicopter the front section has a large trans blue piece enclosing the cockpit inside is a printed radar slope a smaller trans blue piece appears a bit higher for access to the middle section of the helicopter andor a small storage area in the middle section is an place for the gurney and a box for storing some of the adventure gear heres a picture showing the gurney on the side is a pulley mechanism that swings to the right when not in use on the opposite side is the winch to raise and lower the grappling hook heres a picture of an open storage box i like the tail section with propeller decal is not shown heres another shot of the copter from a different angle and the final image the entire set final thoughts personally i think this is pretty nice set i like the thought of using the helicopter to rescue people at sea using the working winch extras like the trikethreewheeler and the rescue net make the set even more fun hope you enjoy this resq review	positive
metalandi on aug 15 2008 0716 am said do you have any other resq sets left to review it would be an honour for me to also do a review of one or more sets which are left thanks metalandi this and the emergency evac set are the only req sets i have i would encourage you to share a review as you have done some very nice reviews	neutral
i got this set as well as a resq hovercraft this set is cool because of all the accessories and it come with a x team guy your set is also in much better condition than mine you have made me decide to rebuild it another great review thebrickster keep up the good work	positive
the helicopter looks nice and the resq minifigs were nice the diver minifig had once been a personal favorite of mine	positive
a neat set with lots of accessories but i never liked any of the lego helicopters with long streamlined canopies as they are obviously more influenced by military helicopters and space ships than by real civilian transport helicopters id give it a 3 at best very good and thourough pictorial review though	positive
ive always wanted this set and the hovercraft too bad i never did great set	positive
i think the set is too unrealistic i like the new resq sets better and im somewhat a lifeboat freak so im always following such a sets with interest i would like to see some rigit inflatable boats some day  but about the chopper i like the accessoiries	negative
what exactly makes you feel this set isnt realistic it has got nothing what wouldnt be on a real helicopter imo and for the futuristic design yes it looks modern but it works and actually most of todays real helicopters also dont look like in the 70s anymore	positive
metalandi on aug 24 2008 0417 pm said what exactly makes you feel this set isnt realistic since the question was asked 1 tiny rotors 2 dual cockpits only seen on a few military copters 3 stretcher extends beyone edges of fuselage when inside the vehicle 4 extra long canopy really only seen on military helicopters and military design 5 black colorscheme for rescue vehicle the the stretcher minifig designs and rescue logo are the only things about this copter that really suggest that it is a civilian rescue aircraft its a toy set with alot of play value but i agree with karto that these kind of desgins really turned me off to alot of the town and city sets of the 90s on the positive side the new city sets with thier realistic nonfuturistic designs have really tempted me to buy more vehicles	neutral
this set was my first set ever from the resq series and i loved it entirely ofcourse i modded it slightly here and there after hours and hours of fun and excitement it has great play value even for a set in this size	positive
this is one of my favourite sets i remember getting it in tesco soon after it was released those were the days the resq line was good and this set made it better	positive
wow i loved this set i still have it actually in pieces though i took it apart quite soon after i got it then managed to lose the instruction manual	positive
if you still have all the parts try to rebuild it youll see that its a great feeling	positive

looks great and the figures up there are old and kinda rare i dont really like fright knights though so i probably wont get this set	neutral
thanks for the review ive added it to the index im not a fan of this theme but i have to say that this is a neat little set that does hold some good things figs and weapons are always welcome and one can never have to many wheels so i rate this average	neutral
this is a pretty nice set i really like the torso and its genericness so it can be used for other factions and at least this set has 2 shields althought i prefer the triangular ones instead of just 1 shield you get from crossbow attack from the wrong fraction id have liked a crown knights shield 100x better some improvements for this set would be a normal bow and a sword instead of 2 of the 3 crossbows smaller wheels and triangular shields 45 from me actually 35 but ill round it up	positive
i gave it above average it was a nice set and included some nice pieces but it is only an impulse set after all edited by newright 19 august 2008  0106 pm	neutral
great review this set has cool features i just wish that lego would release this as a lego legend and release it to australia too since this is a set about australia i wouldve bought two if this were a lego legend that is how good it is i like the building with latticed window and windmill i also like the cargo airplane windsock and radios plus it looks like its got great minifigs	positive
this is really an ideal small set in spite of its size it has nearly everything • three minifigs • a vehicle • a building • numerous minifig accessories • numerous rare and useful parts • nice model design especially for the time period too bad outback came out during my dark years	positive
this is probably my alltime favorite lego set it was originally given to me for my birthday by a close friend of mine back in the release year of 1997 the cargo plane was by far my favorite vehicle ever unfortunately someone stole the plane from me when our families went on vacation and the rest of the set was given to my cousins oldest son when i was no longer interested in my lego collection now that im back into lego i use that buildings construction for various projects especially as a dr inferno lookout shack using parts from extra mission 3 swamp raid the shack compliments the original set greatly edited by skorpius47 19 august 2008  0144 am	positive
this was a cool set i thoght of it as i was building the post plane	positive
one of the best in my humble opinion as far as i know it was never released in the uk so the only reason i managed to get my hands on it was on a family holiday to the us i think they’d only recently opened the lego store in disney arguable the best feature is that it seems to fit into a wide selection of themes is it a airstrip in the middle of nowhere is it next to a only mining town that’s not deserted the possibilities are rather open and that’s truly great	positive
legoman132 on aug 18 2008 0936 pm said this was a cool set i thoght of it as i was building the post plane interesting thought i have the post plane but i havent opened it yet i suppose its the yellow the plane in this set is much different than most of the other classic town airplanes in that it has the double tail section heres a shot of the new 7732 air mail set  definately a nice set	positive
i have had this on my bricklink wanted list for ages and yet noone with my criteria has it nice review and brilliant set	positive
whats wrong with another yoda and some nice light blue bricks i probably would destroy this set and keep the minifigs intack tough chrome lightsabers on	neutral
you think its not a great thing that we get a yoda fig in an affordable set like this that was the main reason why i got this set and what do you mean by another wasnt this the only one that was ever released except for the one in the dagobahxwing set sure he is not the best fig with the unmovable legs and all but still its yoda besides he doesnt move his legs a lot in real life either nice review though and thanks for telling me what that liftarmthingy was meant to be for i never got that and thought it was supposed to lift up the speeder for some reason i got two of this set and the printing on those blue parts were off in the second one i got edited by oky wan kenobi 18 august 2008  0845 pm	positive
no yoda was released in no less than 34 sets ok so i remembered wrong i just have plenty yodas and one is more than enough for the set list click here thanks for pointing that out	neutral
nice review i realy like this set two nice minifigs in an affordable set and i do like the speeder but that lift thing is strange but now at least i know what it is thanks for letting me know	positive
oky wan kenobi on aug 18 2008 0241 pm said wasnt this the only yoda that was ever released except for the one in the dagobahxwing set sure he is not the best fig with the unmovable legs and all but still its yoda edit im pretty sure we got a yoda in the wookiee catamaran set from revenge of the sith runs to check brickset yep theres a yoda in that set as well but the jedi duel is the only reasonably priced set with the green forceguru nevermind looks like a couple of other members already covered yodas availability in other sets back on topic great review and a real blast from the past i never did get this set just didnt care for the speederbike or the weird piece of equipment thanks for explaining that its supposed to be used to forcejump  spin yoda all over the place i never knew thats what it was for anyway wish i had known yoda and dooku were going to be impossible to get later i mayve picked this set up just for the minifigs edited by bamaker 18 august 2008  1039 pm	neutral
i think this is a pretty lame set it came with dooku who i think only came in this set plus a unique lightsaber still they could have made it much bigger added anikan and obiwan and added structures and made it more like the scene from the movie also the speeder doesnt seem very accurate	negative
i wonder how expensive this set would be on ebay shop victoriously	neutral
i missed this setbut i reallly like the yoda and count dookui especially like count dookus lightsaberone thing thoughis it me oris yodas lightsaber blue in the picture edited by pr0visorak 20 august 2008  1221 pm	positive
i got this set a long time ago the review pretty much says all there is to say about it never knew what the redbrown thing was anyway i used it as a canon isnt this also the only set up until now that had count dooku in it	neutral
great review kimt at that time it was still in my dark age and i hated myself not to get this set earlier this is quite inexpensive and you are able to get two greatest characters especially count dooku the minifigs are excellent especially the unique design of count dookus lightsaber i have no problem with the speedbike as it looks quite alright to me as for the elevation of yodas jump adds some playabilty but that does not work well for me nevertheless the main attractive factor is count dooku and i have to rate it a 5 i never own a yoda except for the magnet version	positive
cheers for the review kimt of the initial episode ii lego releases this set was the least inspiring but the minifigs were musthaves you cant go wrong with count dooku and yoda i like the design of dookus speeder in the movie but lego missed the mark a bit with it here and gave him a dodgy flying boat instead the speeder cradleyoda jumping mechanism was just a waste of parts unfortunately id like to see dookus speeder reimagined by lego theyve come a long way in the way they design a lot of the new star wars sets	neutral
i know we have another review of this set but since i just got it i thought i would share my comments on it set name droid gunship platform number 7678 pieces 329 price 2999 before we begin i will say that i like having a droid gunship but i still hope we get a maf hmp droid gunship maf droid gunship on to the review here we have the box it is really shiny and smooth and fits the sets size okay it has a clean bright look and is truley outstanding the back of the box which has the features of the set as well as the other three cw sets the contents the siticker sheet no to bad and the stickers have clear backs which is always nice instructions here we have the figstwo new droids and one older armed droid for the cockpit and the extra parts the build starts with the flat base pretty simple the bottom the side lasers next is the head it starts pretty soild the side buble laser turrets loveing the detail on the ship the lid and eyes the finished cockpit cozy interior would have had more room if it were the maf though the front landing gear simple and effective the back landing gear the rockets the clips are annoying but it make the rockets work so i guess it was nessecary mounted on the bottom not very secure but thats why they are meant to be dropped on the clones the finished ship  let me say that the droid gunship is a nice set indeed final rating 86 hope you enjoyed the review please if you have a ny questions pic requests etc then by all means ask best regards vbbn	neutral

very nice review one thing you have to consider when lego sees pics of the star wars universe they have to decide which would be the easiest set to make with the most playibility therefore they chose the hmp quote thanks for the review its always good to have a 2nd opinion on a set ive added the usual poll and ill index it tomorrow must sleep super pics and great to have inbuild pics defaultthumbupgif a fine set which ill surely buy when i find it defaulthmpfbadgif where edited by lt col thok 18 august 2008  1007 pm	positive

excellent review metalandi i really think this looks like a fun set i esp love the mountain bridge and baseplate it has adventure fun written all over it thanks for taking the time to review this set ive always seen it in pictures but never closeup	positive
metalandi thanks for doing up this review this is a chance for me to gain some insight for extreme team theme this is a very interesting set that can be used for so many purposes 3 different vehicles wide range of accessories and nice minifigs what i love the most is the mountain bridge and tent it provided so much playability i am very impressed with it thanks for sharing	positive
cool set i like the tent and monster truck the most	positive
thank you for that very interesting review metalandi a cool set with a lot of features and some nifty vehicles very playable and well designed indeed perhaps a bit too colorful for my likings but pretty impressive in its conception for sure i wish we could see some more landscaping coming along with todays vehicle sets as well	positive
when i first saw this review title i thought it said rapid river review thinking it was an indian set 6766 nice review though i never got into rock raiders i would have loved the large drill bit piece for set s 4970 and 4940 this set looks like a little boulder hawler and a nice set to introduce someone unfamilar with the theme i esp like the fig and the little 2x2 drill bit tile the overall set looks like it has some very useful miningtype pieces nice review and thanks for sharing	neutral
rock raiders was the shit back in the day awesome theme i had this set as well as the tunnel transporter which was amazing	positive
thanks for the review rock raiders was one of the last new themes i knew as a kid before my dark ages came unfortunately i never managed to get any sets from it beside a few months ago the 4910 the hover scout which i review a while ago wish i can get some of the bigger sets in the future	neutral
i always thought that this set was underrated it contains a really interesting collection of parts a decent fig and introduces an odd theme in only one set very well designed for one of the not greats god bless nathan	positive
hello all eurobricks members and classic town lovers  editors note to mark the celebration of classic town this set which is released in 1994 and rereleased as a legend in 2002 pizza to go review is dedicated to classic towns opening cermony and members such as hinckley brickster imperialshadows sinner and many others whom have contributed to the final success of classic town thank you so much for inviting me to be part of this wonderful project and i wish all the best to the success of classic town i urge everyone of you to check out classic town and take alook at the cool stuff we have done  today i will be doing up a review on pizza to go set this outlet is one of the most favourite eatery for any lego citizens living in their town when they are driving on the road they are sure to look out pizzeria signage they offer the best pizza in town no one in town can resist the delicious aroma of pizza coming out from the red chimney let us find out why is this shop so popular among so many lego citizens and was one of the famous sets that is rereleased under the legend theme pizza to go is my favourite set of all time i believed there is no other pizza outlet lying around in any lego city apart pizzeria it seemed there are the sole outlet that is selling pizza for many years this set was rereleased in 2002 and it is part of the legend theme this is one of the few sets that are highly demanded to be brought back by many fans of lego around the world i owned the 6350 any members whom had owned both sets before is there any difference between these two because when i searched through peeron it shown 144 pieces instead of 194 pieces for the 1994 set name pizza to go theme lego system  town year 1994 rerelease 2002 pieces 194 minifigs 3 an image of a 6350 pizza to go let the delivery begins pizza to go is the regular pizza outlet that sells nothing but pizza they deliever pizza to every household in town with their trusty delivery van walkin are welcomed too there is a stand for customers to dine in their pizza quickly before making their way to their next destination in my opnon no town can ever survive without the pizza tradition devoted pizzeria staff every outlet comes with 3 dedicated staff making sure that operations will run smoothly on the left we will have the pizza boy whom is wearing the regular blue dungarees and its white cap i wonder who is that boy on the middle we will have the pizza girl she looks like any typical sweet girl in town that the boys will look at she is wearing a suntop strapless on her she reminded me of one person though i think her name is called alice taking a careful look i wonder if imperialshadows is the pizza boy back then without that black patch on its left eye on another note this minifigure was my favourite female minifigures are very uncommon back then i am glad i have this figure adding to my town population on the right we will have the hardworking chef preparing the pizzas in the oven he wears the regular white chef outfit but he wear a grey pants instead of the usual fullwhite outfit in most resturants such as breezeway cafe 6376 lets take a closer look at the pizza boys van this van is very very small looking and very fuel efficient it is able to cut lanes very fast due to its small size the pizza van is made up of 4studs wide design no doors by the side however in this vehicle i think the doors is not a must to be included in this design our pizza boy will need to leave vehicle pretty fast and ensuring that the pizza delivery is on time common mechanism this van has the regular rooftop that can be lifted up to place the pizza boy into the driver seat there is a sun roof on its top which enable him to let him have some sunlight from above the logo on the side of it is actually a transparent sticker which have the pizzeria itallian logo and a tasty looking pizza on both sides of its van i like that sticker very much mine looks quite worn out over time if its a printed piece it will be a terrific bonus nevertheless i can still accept the sticker our pizza van can deliever up to 2 pizza at a go at every trip 2 piping hot pizza will be stored at the back of the van the pizza is fitted in perfectly in each compartment furthermore the white window shutter is terrific in this design you dont see this kind of design anymore i think i have not seen much delivery vans on the street anymore too base of the van from the base you can see that it is using of the regular red car base that is common in most 4studs vehicle design in fact this car base served as a foundation for its vehicle design back of pizzeria alice and the chef will be showing you around at the back of the kitchen there is an oven on the left a water tap and a holder for the oar stick looks pretty empty right look below for a surprise my favourite feature this oven can be used to heat up 2 pizzas at a go now i understand why this set is named pizza to go i have been using their slogan unknowingly this feature is superb nice now we know that the pizza is prepared from the outlet instead of using delivery van to collect it from a factory alice what are you waiting for help the chef quickly pizzeria the signage sure looks big from far and catches their attention easily too with its pleasnt looking design as you have already noticed this is made up of sticker i dont mind for this set it contains sticker sometimes i do hope they can give us spare sticker for us to change after a long period of time distinct red chimney this is the front of the oven and that is where the smoke comes out using only bricks to construct this is simply wonderful i like the use of their white bricks to construct the wall layout and a combination of red parts especially on the top i like the look of this very much another picture on its side printed parts in this set you will get a total of 5 pizzas and i believed no other sets offer so many pizza you can placed up to 4 pizzas in the van and oven alice will be carrying the last pizza around the green and red round dish is a printed part most exclusive part in 635010036 the most unique and important printed parts that is only exclusive in this set its at the front of the pizza van it is none other but the pizzeria logo standing at the front of the delivery van forgotten to take a picture of this piece took it from peeron different views of pizza to go outlet another bright sunday day in pizza to go summary review playability 1010 a lot of playing by doing up the pizza process from preparing to delivery design 9510 outstanding design with great use of bricks i like the structure of it very much price 9510 an inexpensive set based on the 1994 pricing it comes with 3 minifigs shop a van and a exclusive printed piece overall 9710 i am not trying to be bias in fact this set is absoultely filled with minimum flaws look at my review again if you are not satisfied with it or tell me what you dont like i gave it a 5 based on my review score card what about yours hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine comments and critics are strongly welcomed pictures can be found in my brickshelfwhen moderated	positive
easily one of the best town sets ever and pretty expensive for its size too iswas it that rare i hope i still have all the pieces from mine unfortunately my stickers are in pretty bad shape took them off because i needed the bricks stupid stickers covering multiple parts  only downside to this set the design is simple yet so detailed and the pizza van looks great 55	positive

i used to want this set so badly and i almost got it when it was rereleased i still wonder why i didnt because with a building van 5 pizzas and a then very rare female fig this set would have been perfect for someone with a smaller collection like i had then what surprised me the most is how well this set still holds up to others today off to bricklink	positive
definitely one of my favorite sets from my childhood i still remember my sister getting it for me for my birthday and me building it that same day too bad i had it displayed all these years on my windowsill so the pizza delivery van and pizzeria have become yellowed	positive

indexed allright hi everybody again today im gonna review the biggest set of the resq subtheme 6479 emergency response center with this one i think the reviews of all the resq sets are complete now and while im in a reviewing mode right now i thought id bring that up this set hast got many nice aspects and also some very rare pieces and comes with a wonderful amount of vehicles including a speedboat a tow truck a helicopter and a trike which can pull a little boat so sit down get your popcorn and beer were off to stormy weather at the coast subtheme resq set nr 6479 name emergency response center number of minifigs 5 number of pieces 420 release year 1998 unfortunately i dont have many of the boxes of my resq sets anymore so ill start right off with the instructions this time on the backside there is no alternate model as usual this time but only a different shot of the whole set next a general overview sorry about the slightly bad picture quality on some pics this time originally this set has 5 minfigs which all are really nice but the guy who drives the tow truck has been lost in the flood heres a picture of the missing fig lets move on to the vehicles we have something for the water the ground and the air in this set first the great tow truck i love the mechanism with the hooks in the back next on da speedboat at the rear its got a stretcher and a wench which adds a lot of playability if theres a a little accident near the coast the trike comes to appearance for more complicated stuff we have a little helicopter i broke the rotating piece at the top yesterday ouch   no space for a victim you say well not really but the helicopter also got a wench with a hook in the back now it comes to the station itself at the docks a neat life belt sign is mounted remember at this time there werent real ones as today a little more right an equipment holder is placed with various tools on the front and fire fighter equip at the back at the very front a little lighttower secures the shelter i havent quite found out what this thing is supposed to be maybe somebody knows another equipment holder this time with all the stuff you need for diving more equipment and even more we come to the hear piece of the station the control room with lots of buttons and scrrens last but not least a quick shot of all the accesoires and tools that you get which really is an amazing amount this set might have a few junioriced pieces as the big window in the front or the briedge on the roof but that doesnt matter because there is nearly one other set in which you get so much rare pieces and such an overwhelming amount of accesoires so i can recommend that for everybody who is a piecesfanatic not to forget the playability the great figs and the in my opinion very good color scheme once again thanks for taking the time reading and looking at my review i hope you liked it edited by thebrickster 31 december 2009  0919 pm	positive
i own this set and its one of my favourites simply because of the cool colour scheme which you mention plus all the vehicles and accessories the resq theme is one of my faves of all time actually i own nearly all of them missing a small set that was only available in the us or japan i think dr s	positive
do you mean this one httpwwwbricksetaspxset29621  i would also like to get that alone for the fact that its the only resq set with a female fig	neutral
i have this set and its pretty nice i love the resq theme in general i think that tow truck is easily the highlight of this set and is probably the best such vehicle ive seen in any city set the other vehicles are also great the base itself is lacking though as it basically consists of one room that doesnt even have side walls it does include a cool 3x6 computer sticker and a vast array of minifig tools and equipment though i have some plans to modify the building and make it larger but have never gotten around to doing it	positive
there are very few late 90s or early 00s sets worth ever having and i wish i had this one with its futuristic look and yes that tow truck too oh yeah heaps of equipment  its not over junorised there is still plenty of building in it thanks and have a happy new year metalandi 	positive
hi everyone this is my first review on lego sets here hope you guys like it and i would like to apologise for the bad quality pictures hope you guys dont mind first i will start with the box art box art i guess this is the first time that lego star wars sets use white and blue colour for their box i like the new colour scheme a nice blend though heres the front the back not to waste space on the box lego do some advertisement to attract us to buy more sets grinthe more the side at the top side there is this minifigs scale picture it is great as we get to know the real size of a minifigs contents the contents consist of a sticker sheet instruction book and 8 packet of bricks the packer are not numbered but it is ok as there is not much pieces instruction book and random page as usual the instruction book have brick checklist other sets pictures and tutorial on how you should assemble your set i mean the very first page sticker sheet there is not much sticker sheet and is a great news that the republic logo on the round plate is printed unlike republic gunship anyway i didnt apply the stickers the commander gear this is a new thing to minifigs as well well is like batman accessories they pack it in one small packet however you only get one commander gear pack in this set anyway i didnt use them the minifigs well we get the the new minifigs the ugly face clone new printed torso and new mold of helmet however i not really like the new head stud i prefer a black one or at least the one like jango fett black colour with face the helmet everything is printed no holes at the visor there but there are hole on the both side this new helmet mold also made the headgear turn 360 degree freely without helmet with helmet you can see the flesh tone at the hole beside the blasters  short blasters were given instead of long one is great at least they give us two blasters instead of one the tank here is the pics of the tank it was not badly design nor nicely design but it looks great if you didnt saw the beneath or under the tank view from front view from side view from back whats beneath under it was 4 wheels to make it move fluently it is made by the thread supporter like the one we fet from tie crawler or battank the functions well firstly you can open up the hood i guess to see the engine secondly the side cannon that can move upwards the thing is quite tight see random instruction page and there is barrier to block the cannon from going downwards the cockpit well the cockpit is small and the space is limited the monitor stuff is printed brick and is another great news you have to remove the piece pic below to reveal the cockpit and put your clone to pilot it popup gunner mechanism well the backdoor have a thing to attack to the seat of the gunner the top hatch is very loose so it there is a clone as a gunner and you open the back door the clone will popup and automatically open the hatch on top this is how the top looks like without a clone there is this movable cannon upwards left and right and a little keyboard thing with it but the cannon fall off quite easily the flick launching missile mechanism the mechanism is on both side and you need to turn the thing inwards to reveal the flick fire mechanism below are the pic of how it is turned you can keep you blaster at the front of the side there are place for you to store them it close nicely completion this is how it looks like extra parts there quite a number of them overall this set is not bad the price is quite expensive but you will like it the popup mechanism is something new to me but this set have more function and 2 clone trooper with a pack of commander gear pros 2x clone troopers high playability nice design cons a little expensive sticker sheet cannon on top falls off quite easy edited by kimt 27 august 2008  1216 pm	positive
thanks for that very elaborate review nice to have several pics from different angels amazingly well done if this is your first ive added a poll and will index this review within this week along with all the other topics i am to index 	neutral
yes the review is great indeed i love indepth reviews with tons of photos as for the set  im not planning to buy it but it looks ok i think its a good tank	neutral
thanks for this great review baby i like the clarity of your photos and the description is well written ill try and see if i can gather the money for this one fingers crossed luxorv	neutral
thank you kimt for adding the poll hehe this is my first review so im not so confident about the pictures thank you guys for viewing and commenting	neutral

splendid photos and well written review i love it ive owned and built mine and must say its a good set and the tank dont disappointment in terms of design and playability i got mine stickered well been a perfectionist i am p thanks again for the review that it should deserved d	positive
mattzitron on aug 13 2005 1130 pm said the strange thing is for the first time i can remember the minifigs came decapitated and theres no neckwear i recall jake saying something about it being new lego policy to supply the minifig heads and torsos separately what with the expensestrimming and all its apparently one of the many little quirky things theyve discovered in the manufacturing and packaging process that people have done for years without thinking in this case putting the heads on the torsos but that turns out to be a surprisingly significant expense timewise i suppose think it was in one of his blog posts but not sure too tired ie lazy to go hunting for it now sorry 	neutral
mattzitron you have done well to display images of the dung stain hull its a darn shame that it cant be extended however i see no reason why lego couldnt produce a special middle hull piece that is compatible although the way theyve made the hull is a bit stupid the old system was a lot more flexible better still why cant lego design a hull that can be extended in length and width then they could be as made as long or wide as desired and that would be great	negative
they have made a special middle piece in this 4 set httpwwwbricksetaspxset70751 the only problem is that its red	negative
good work samsta no wonder i wasnt aware 4 pirates and all	positive
yoda601 on aug 17 2005 0253 pm said its a shame it only comes with two figs it would be great for my ancient middleeast project if you ever get a moment id love some pics of that ive been tooling around with something along those lines in my ever expanding fantasy setting akkh	positive
sam89 on aug 17 2005 0308 pm said thanks for the pics so far will you have highres pics of the other sets in the instructions theres just the back page ad but ill scan it	neutral
im interested in the scan of the back i have an idea for a new avatar 	positive
woohoo thanks for these pics im probably more excited about the dark red 1x4 arch than anything else i have a large project that im doing in dark red but there has only been the 1x6 arch made in that coloruntil now now to figure out how to score about a hundred of them  jeramy	positive
right so heres my review finally the whole gallery of box parts minifigs and finished model is here over 2 pages so on with the show minifigs httpwwwbrickshelycgii1340864 in the set you get krakaroff i dunno how to spell it and victor krum the figs are exactly the same bar their heads these are two fantastic figures the expression on krakaroffs face is priceless judging by the design i think we might get a yellow krakaroff cropping up somewhere which would make me a happy bunny hed make a fantastic viking ideally id have liked more than 2 figures for my money three would have done it i think 2 is too few piece count httpwwwbrickshelycgii1344573 httpwwwbrickshelycgii1344571 httpwwwbrickshelycgii1344572 for a 40 set the piece count is quiet good i dont know the exact number but when building it i didnt feel short changed bar the exception of the hull now i dont hate the hull my problem is that is doesnt connect with bricks like the old pirate ships there are pros and cons to this on the plus side its more secure and your whole ship doesnt need to be taken up with support structure the negative side being you cant really make it bigger as theyve only released a megablocking 4 set with the right piece and its the wrong color i also like how its wide meaning you can fit loads of minifigs on the main deck overall though i liked the pieces of note are gold studs httpwwwbrickshelycgii1344510 5 in total you get one spare the return of the black falcon shields httpwwwbrickshelycgii1340835 and the new drumstrang shields the construction a simple fun build nothing too fiddly the finished model httpwwwbrickshelycgii1344474 big picture i really like this set theres no bones about it it seems lego with the latter half of 2005 have given people who loved their original pirate ships hope for the future with this and the fantastic viking longboat even with the two 4 pieces the hull and front of the ship i wasnt put off httpwwwbrickshelycgii1340841 httpwwwbrickshelycgii1344461 the front of the ship is a nice piece and can be used for stuff like castles httpwwwbrickshelycgii1344490 httpwwwbrickshelycgii1344491 httpwwwbrickshelycgii1344492 httpwwwbrickshelycgii1344494 and the hull isnt all bad what i really liked was the little cargo hold at the moment i have a treasure chest in there but there space for about eight of them i reckon playability wise it does make alot of sense and as you can see you can imprision minifigs below deck httpwwwbrickshelycgii1344484 httpwwwbrickshelycgii1344488 httpwwwbrickshelycgii1344506 httpwwwbrickshelycgii1344500 the quarters are great as well you can comfortably fit about six minifigs in the main gally three by the steering wheel and a couple up above the top cabin you could fit more but itd look strange my only gripe is the design of the top cabin when you want to open it up you have to remove the mast i know its simple enough but i think that it wouldnt have taken much for tlc to design it better but saying that its easily done and i like how the cabin can be lifted with ease from the steering deck httpwwwbrickshelycgii1344540 the final play feature is the plank you can while away the hours murdering hapless minifigs whove displeased the cabin a really nice addition for pirate fans the final verdictb playability 9510  lots to do for all the kids piece count 910 a great selection loses one for the hull figures 810  just needs one more construction 910  nice and simple value 8510  let down a bit by lack of minifigs and the cons of the hull boverall 8810 overall this is a set worth getting especially if you miss proper pirates it wouldnt take much to turn this into an amazing pirate ship moc hope you liked my review matt	positive
burnsexcellentburns i love those parts shots great stuff in there this really is a good sign for the new line hopefully therell be the same level of usefulness in the others thanks for taking the time to finish it up did you scan the back of the instructions	positive
joebot on aug 27 2008 0315 pm said very nice review of a set that ive been dying to get but my friendly neighborhood lego store never seems to have in stock the yellow seat is most definitely not a new piece i had two of those in my old beta1 command base almost 30 years ago it is interesting however	positive
thanksfor this review i also got this set recently and im very happy about it i live the design of these new trucks and the forklift is also great not to forget the good amount of cargo btw i think the mysterious cargo only are normal fuel barrels	positive

a very fine set indeed and something at least a little different to the more usual city sets sweet and it could even be a little sweeter to me with car doors well nevermind thanks for that very nice review vbbn	positive
great review i dig this set it could have only been better if it had been a 6wide version of the old 6367 semitruck still i ask whats so special about the special edition	neutral
kimt on aug 27 2008 0500 pm said hmmgood question lets hope our reviewer can help us out here and i can the set is exclusive to lego brand retail stores lego sh and toys r us only	neutral
that explains why it isnt in our local stores i also got it from sh but my box hasnt got the special edition printing on it surprisingly	neutral
nice review vbbn i stumbled upon your yellow seat as well didn´t you have one already or what made you think it´s new the big letdown on this set is the big canopy i would have preferred single bricks for that and for this truck there is no real need for a hollow canopy  it could as well have been made of solid bricks maybe we get another set with different use of the canopy this is one of the reasons i didn´t buy it so far and i´m especially not interested in another forklift i have plenty of those i agree it´s the best one we have seen so far though	positive

that´s really a sweet and charming little technic set thanks for that fine review	positive
as ive told you before this is a great set and now it has a great review thanks for this	positive
a very original and perhaps even a little weird design indeed but nice and creative for sure thanks for that good review	positive
i loved all of these walker sets it was such a smart technique i made one myself with what i had ahhh good times thanks for the great review	positive
thanks for the review ill add it to the index the ywing is one of my favourite rebel fighters and this set justifies the coolest fighter	positive
a wonderful set and a really charming design well detailed and pretty smooth at the same time perhaps that small gap at the cockpit´s an a little weak point but we can always mod a little thanks for that very neat review cardinal brick	positive
great review the ywing is an awesome starfighter and the detail in this set is superb funnily enough i was just swooshing mine today edited by pedro 27 august 2008  0825 pm	positive

i like the model it is one of the best rebel sets out there but i dont like it that there is no landing gear when you set this one on the floor your rebel base it looks like it crashed or something and looses its look of superiority actually quite fast it needs to be at least 2 studs high if not more from the ground tlc is in these days afraid of flimsy landing gear as they gave to us in the early sw time now they want something sturdy for playability but i think there should have been some details on the bottom especially a landing gear that unfolds i also dont like the mistake of tlc that they changed this year with the release of indy hopefully to give the pilot a usual smile face the old yellow version of gold leader even had a headgear i hope tlc realised this year that we want more detailed faces well the licenced sets we got proved that but who knows the upsides of this set are the amount of pieces and detail especially the engines were fun to build and perhaps the most interesting construction i have seen in years also it is big bulky and looks sleek at the same time just wonderful and next to the 4502 xwing it looks in the perfect size i gave this the highest rating even if the underside disappoints but whatever it is lego you can add some landing gear on your own thanks for the review your pics were really really good next time make more of them please	positive
stauder on aug 29 2008 1237 pm said dont aregue with him when it comes to ywings he offerd to swoosh one in the nude stauder indeed	positive
the ywing is a truly beautifull ship and lego has done a great job on this one lacking landing gear is a minus point though and nice review by the way	positive
is it worth the money since the new ywing comes out next year	neutral
etav8r on 19 september 2011  0155 am said i think it is a fair to ask questions here with the expectation of a new ywing in the coming year i came here to look at the review even though it is a few years old no images to go with the review bummer id like to see a more friendly tolerance on dated threads being bumped again we know next to nothing about the new ywing it wouldnt be possible to say whether 7658 is worth the money relative to the new one until we know what the new one looks like what its minifigures look like how much it will cost etc also note that yodalikespie has been banned	negative
fallenangel309 on 19 september 2011  0201 am said again we know next to nothing about the new ywing it wouldnt be possible to say whether 7658 is worth the money relative to the new one until we know what the new one looks like what its minifigures look like how much it will cost etc also note that yodalikespie has been banned is that a threat is it fair to ban someone on the forum because they revived an old thread and made inquiries thought this was a forum to discuss lego and that is what he was prompting i dont really care why he was banned but this isnt the only time ive seen this type of behavior and discourse here on eb	negative
fallenangel309 on 19 september 2011  0343 am said not a threat at all  i was simply pointing out that yodalikespie made the mistake of inquiring about the new ywing before we had any information on it to my understanding its not so much the fact that he bumped the thread as the fact that he bumped it for no good reason im not certain where the moderators stand on this issue but i feel that yodalikespies question would have been better received had he posed it after a substantial amount of information had been gathered on 9495  as ive said there simply isnt much one can go off of at this point to determine its value relative to 7658 roger that sad that the original review pics arent available any longer would be nice once the new set is released for comparisons	neutral
and lo it came from the east denmark the set which had been foretold the cheap army builder and there was much rejoicing amongst the castle fans the cardinal then asked was all the rejoicing justified… set name the knight set number 5615 number of pieces 21 figures1 released 2008 list price £200 lets us begin with the box the front shows us are knight and his rack of arms the back shows us two sets from the castle range moving inside the box now the contents of the box it doesn’t look like much the instructions to help you through the build now the reason you probably bought the set well at least why i did the knight this features the new torso for 2008 and is the height of fashion this brings the number of printed torsos from the crown knights to three which allows for a greater variety in building your armies a new fashion sensation and all the must have accessories for this season with a more heavily armoured look he’s ready for anything the rest of the set is a weapons rack i assume that once you’ve got a few of these set you’ll probably like me give up building them and part them out but anyway here are some pictures of what the rest of the elements are spent on a long and complex build begins after 360 hour finally it’s finished sadly five minfigs were hurt in the construction of this rack now the money shot where we can see it all come together it looks great even the rack doesn’t look to bad sadly are hero wasn’t ready for other themes just yet in total we have a good army builder which castle fans have wanted however there remains a question in my mind as to if this set is good enough on it’s own without any other castle sets i can’t see it being to much fun so it’s not a good present the rating system figures 910 great new fashion for this season  parts 810 shield sword spear helmet and armour what more could i want well two shields fun fun fun 310 sadly it’s rather dull on it’s own i can’t think or to much else to do design 710 yes it’s the army builder i’ve wanted design well apart from that pirate one price 910 at £200 what more can i say grand total 3650 let down by being to small to stand alone conclusion so let’s answer the question is it the army all castle fans have wanted well yes and no is the answer while it is a great set and at the now reduced uk price of £200 amazing value i still think it’s inferior compared with the army building capability of cross bow attack i much prefer army building both factions at once	positive
thanks for sharing this review with us ill add it to the index one of my favourite impulse sets along with the troll warrior or is that orc warrior	positive
nice review and i especially enjoyed the ending i personally think it is quite a good set for the price considering it comes with a fully armed minifig along with enough stuff to suit up another i just wish amazon carried this set	positive
do we really need more construction works legoland is just one huge building site theme city set name mini digger set number 7246 number of pieces 36 figures1 released 2005 list price 350 usd 7426 peeroncom 7246 bricklink catalog diving right in let get some photos of the box the digger at work the back just has more of the same not to inspiring once we open the box we find two poly bags and some instructions the total contents of the box well minus the air instruction booklet short and simple now the single minfig of the set nothing new of special that i can see …got a job working construction for the johnstown company moving onto the digger itself it’s one of those builds where all you really need is a quick glance at the instructions and off you go side view of the finished product alternative view it doesn’t look to bad now lets add our construction worker looks rather good though the lifting action isn’t smooth it’s nothing special it’s not the greatest construction set that lego have ever produced but i think it is worth the money the arm action really does bug me though the rating system figures 510 just another construction peon parts 410 nothing novel and i dislike the new digger arm system fun fun fun 710 i think the playability is high and you can get a good load of bricks in the bucket design 610 not the best designed digger but not the worst price 710 a reasonable price for what you get grand total 2950 still halfway decent but nothing to write home about conclusion this set is yet another in a long line of lego digger and to be honest it’s not the best in my opinion i still hold nostalgic memories for 6504 which i still think is a great digger from my point of view the set sits to high off the ground and make me wonder how the worker gets in i really don’t like the digging arm action it will never be smooth and while it poses better i just think it’s inferior despite this i still think it’s not a bad set i’d just like it to be so much more	negative
cardinal brick on aug 27 2008 1002 pm said …got a job working construction for the johnstown company one of the greatest songs ever written but now onto the review i really like your pictures the quality and lighting is amazing i never gave this set much attention but now it looks pretty good to me also cant wait for your next review i have never seen this bus before	positive
thanks for the review vbbn i have to say ef has never really caught my attention but this set seems alright to be honest when i saw the topic title i was expecting a tiger looking mech the mech itself is cool except for the huge leg pieces i think the minifigs are great in ef sets with the dark colored outfits like dark red or dark green	positive
thanks for that good review vbbn that´s really a fine and pretty solid looking mecha i think that the designers did a good job on this last wave of ef sets and the inclusion of these mini robots was also a pretty smart idea	positive
nice to see a well done review this set is one of the few exoforce sets i havent built myself yet but i will get it on sale guess soon im do not like the use of slizerstyle balljoints in exoforce even though they are modified to 2x2 bricks in this particular set i think the arms look weak and they lack elbow joint like the green 2008 mech set forgot name of this years green mech quite a shame i find it really hurts the functionality of that green set and could imagine the same with the tiger i guess with the new pyramide brick as cockpit the cockpit is still open from the sides and the back i modified my green 2008 mech which use the same cockpit design with a few green bricks and it is now completely closed from all sides i rate the tiger at average but i may change my mind when i get to build it myself front	positive
this was my first exo force set and i was quite skeptical towards the mecha theme so i got it because it seemed to have nice parts it turned out however that the mechas are quite nice  i really like the poseability of it and since then i got another ef set	positive
thanks for the review one of the best sets in the entire line	positive
since my last post ive had the chance to build the tiger and i was surprised in a good way a much better set than i actually thougth front	positive
i just bought 2 of them since they were 5 each from lego i really wish they did not cancel this series	positive
i voted average i think this is the least attractive among the 2008 exoforce sets i saved my money to buy some of the 2006 mechas	negative
i think this is almost the best set in the exo force line i really like the orange cockpit peice	positive
what do you mean the troll’s should outnumber the crown knight how are you going to manage that well here’s the answer theme castle set name troll warrior set number 5618 number of pieces 19 figures1 released 2008 list price £250 gbp 350 usd 299 euro 5618 peeroncom 5618 bricklink catalog 5618 shop at home lets us begin with the box the troll warrior and his might cart set sets for children to pester for at christmas now for what’s inside the contents of the box it doesn’t look like much now for the troll himself i’m glad they selected this troll torso rather than the other one for the impulse set i think this one is the superior one also he comes well armed with a spear and sword but no shield sadly someone really needs to look at the rodent problem in the castle sets now the cart nice easy construction as with all impulse sets i’m still not convinced by the flicking missiles a line of those would do some damage what an oncoming army can expect to see all together now and it looks rather good so there we have it a cheap way of bolstering the troll army and outfitting them with some more weapons also for anyone planning a pied piper moc another set with a rat in it the rating system figures 810 preferred troll torso and helmet style  parts 710 two spears and a sword but sadly lacking that all important shield fun fun fun 410 somewhat more to do on it’s own that other impulse at least the troll can fight the rat design 710 well designed even the flicker missile doesn’t look bad price 810 at £250 more than the other castle impulse grand total 3450 lack of a shield and to small to stand alone for my rating system conclusion castle fans got a great army builder with the knight and they’ve been lucky enough to receive another one with this set i’m glad we’ve got a troll impulse as it allow for enlarging the armies of evil some the crown knight don’t totally outnumber all their opponents	positive
best impulse set so far thanks for sharing your thoughts and yes someone should look into that rodent issue ill add this to the index within long	positive
good review i got 2 of those wheels are very useful especially if you dont have any  as for shields  i dont imagine trolls use them too much i think that they fight berserk style  all out assault one complaint is the piece that the wheels are attached to  its a single piece with smaller than the standard pin connection so you cant change the width of the cart for your mocs using the wheels i dont know if a piece with such a connection only on one side exists though 	positive
kimt on aug 29 2008 0655 am said best impulse set so far agreed i love this little sets i cant wait for it to hit shops here the rodent problem is funny but i lov always getting more animals so that is a plus the cart is a nicely formidable machine that i will keep together so i can maximise their fire power the troll figure is one of my favourite ever too i love that torso and helmet and i want that sword in grey i only have it in bronze thanks for the review batbrick away	positive
wow i like this set but have no money to get it guess i need to be fast and get it before it was sold out	positive
im not really impressed by this set as much as other impulse sets the knight impulse set 5615 offers more in my opinion since it gives two helmets two weapons a shield and an armor piece along with the weapon rack im not a fan in the slightest of flickfire missles and projectiles like on the cart and the previously mentioned one piece axle limits the wheel usage in other mocs i wouldve liked to see an added chest armor piece at the very least and a shield wouldve made this great those things are so rare and it wouldve bumped the piece count up to 21 to match the knight set since both are showing the same price on shin us dollars at least it wouldve made sense	negative
more firefighter there must be a pyromaniac in legoland somewhere theme city set name firefighter set number 5613 number of pieces 25 figures1 released 2008 list price £200 gbp 350 usd 299 euro 5613 peeroncom 5613 bricklink catalog 5613 shop at home starting as always with the box i didn’t know red cylinders were flammable interestingly an action shot and not other sets you might like to buy the contents of the box looks much like every other impulse set firefighter not sure there’s much else to say apart from i wish they’d included breathing equipment looking pretty pleased with himself if you ask me the equipment rack is fairly standard and easy to build it does however include a fire hydrant inbuild shot will i be able to finish this complex build unsurprisingly i did i nice selection of kit is provided all together i think the fire is a bit odd but it does add playability if you want to increase the number of your firefighter and their equipment this is a great way though there is something missing in my mind the rating system figures 510 fairly standard i already have a fair few parts 610 good selection of tools but lacks the breathing apparatus i’d expect in a set like this fun fun fun 510 there’s clearly something to do even if you just own this set design 510 not going to win any awards but it’s robust price 810 nothing to complain about you get a lot of accessories for the price grand total 2950 reasonable design and good accessories a good set to improve any fire department conclusion this isn’t a set i’d necessarily buy but while i was at bluewater today i decided i should try to review every impulse set myself so that why i bought it still i think it has some good playability and a good set of accessories if you need more firefighting kit i just can’t get passed the lack of breaking apparatus that would have made it a better set in my view	negative
that’s the problem i couldn’t quite tell what it’s a bit of a problem in a reviewer maybe a hose to clip to the fire hydrant i don’t know	neutral
brick built robot surely we€™re getting near classic space now theme space mission mars set name minirobot set number 5616 number of pieces 24 figures1 released 2008 list price £250 gbp 350 usd 299 euro 5616 peeroncom 5616 bricklink catalog 5616 shop at home let look at the box first space man approaching the robot from behind i€™m not sure you can still buy the base easily anymore the contents of the box the contents of the box it€™s rather white fairly standard mission mars spaceman he€™s got printing front and back but sadly no air tank how does he breath as has been pointed out he does have a printed tank but id rather a physical one note the megaphone is in flashlight mode not weapon mode that€™s important the robot itself feels a bit clumsy the metal detector is never going to touch the ground and it feel a bit wide i don€™t like the look of him something in the eyes the reason why so we can have a box to put crystals in both together and ready to explore new worlds etc sadly the robot was homicidal remember in space no one can hear you scream it€™s not a bad impulse set and if it marks the return of brick built robots to space then it€™s a good thing i just feel the robot could have been better built the rating system figures 610 not to bad but nothing wonderful parts 610 lots of white and not much orange but where€™s the air tank fun fun fun 610 probably the best impulse set as a stand alon toy lots to do with a robot and his human boss design 510 the robot feels clumsily put together i think it needs work price 810 can€™t fault the impulse price grand total 3150 not well designed but does have more play value than other impulse sets conclusion i was surprised that mission mars got impulse sets as it didn€™t seem to sell as well as other lines last year however i think this is a fairly good set it has more playability than other sets and does come with a metal detector been a while since i€™ve seen one though i could be wrong sadly the robot isn€™t as good as it could be edited by sinner 01 september 2008  0130 am	positive

kimt on aug 28 2008 0952 pm said id rather get another impulse set than this except the other life on mars mars mission impulse sets actually i kinda like the crystal hawk impulse the default model isnt that great but you get a few nice wing plates to work with after rearranging it looks pretty good i guess this one though is good for some nice parts tho its pretty limited in what you can rebuild it into and it seems less value because the astronaut has no vehicle best impulse set has to be the troll warrior feels very complete and space orcs are always nice to have	positive
this here was a set that i new i had to get a beautiful minfig amazing minfigs what more could you want so was this set worth it i guess you will just have to read the review to find out set name the batcycle harley quinns hammer truck number 7886 pieces 267 theme batman year 2008 price 3500 usd 4496 euro 1box the new box art for batman is pretty stunning its clean and really sells the set for this set harley quinns truck is pictured attacking batman with the set information the back of the box shows a nice little comic the other sets as well as the set functions 2contents the instructions the instructions for the set are as always clear and straightforward they display the colors well and have what we expect in an instruction book 3build minifigs the stars of the set batman is back with a new torso much more metalic than before harley had all new printed torso legs a new head and that sweet new hat batcycle the bottom part is very sturdy thanks to a small bit of technic the red throws it off a bit but it isnt seen once the top part is put on it has a nice use of the smoke stacks and looks very nice in the end the top part is simple but suits the purpose well it has handle bars and a nice motor the blue is a little strange though hammer truck the hammer truck begins with a very sturdy base it has lots of detail and really looks cool rims added lego did a very nice job at giving it a checker board appearence the only problem here is that you stick a sticker over two bricks multiple times jewels inside of the crate are these shining jewels look how they illuminate the darkness in gotham more added then we add on a spoiler and the crate looking very nice now the detail is again outstanding and it has a good amount of smoothness to it the infamous hammer okay i havent said this yet but the square pieces need to stop first on those sw backta tanks now on the hammer it creates a sloppy look for the hammer still this is the ultimate wacking weapon added to the truck on the truck it works pretty well but the handle is to short and its near impossible to smash batman the finished truck the finished truck is really nice the big wheels give it the monster truck feel and the way that lego alternated the colors works well the cockpit is a little palin but thats not a major issue the i love joker sticker is one of the best stickers ive seen its simply a classic the finished set  parts 910 lots of good mocing pieces and red and black are always usefull minifigs 1010 awesome playability 910 the hammer is a little short priceperpart 810 its a liscensed theme so meh set 7886 is a very nice set and has some great details in it the minifigs are very cool as well however their are some flaws first the hammer is two short and is kind of square the batcycle has a few awkward colors in it which throws it off a bit this set is definatly worth the money batman fans will love it and also wacking fans will like it for that hammer and if you would like to buy this set here are a few useful links sh link peeron link please let me know your comments and pic requests and questions are welcome	positive

i discovered this review a month ago and since that point in time i could not get the image of the sparkling golden chest out of my mind i finally just purchased the chest for myself i suppose this is a testament to how well honed your picture taking skills are this set is definitely a nice one im not a lego indy collector but i was tempted to purchase this set several times the vehicles are very nicely detailed and have some cool building techniques such as the wheel guards	positive

welcome to another sunny day in legovilletoday we will be joining the mailman on his daily route delivering the days mail when i first saw this set i immiediately liked iti think tlg should make more of these everyday life type sets such as delivering mail going to the grocery store things like that anyway enough blabbering on to the review 7731 mail van set name 7731 mail van year 2008 theme city pieces 66 price 799 pounds 499 euros 595 price per piece about 12 cents well start with the box shots the box is an interesting shape that i have never seen before very rectangular the box art is pretty nice the back shows the mailman delivering some mail the picture on the front is the same as on the box random manual shot the manual does not have the piece call outs but on a small set like this i dont feel its needed parts list decent selection of parts i really like the mail pieces image at the back of the manual showing all of the cargo sets together in a little scene i like it when the manuals have images like these because its nice to see all of the sets together all of the parts spread out the parts in this set are pretty good unfortunatly the car base is one large piece however we do get 2 printed mail pieces which are always nice our trusty mailman this torso i think is very nice the little envelope is a nice touch extra parts not much to say here the finished set i really like the design of the van it looks very smooth and somehow looks very lego to me the colors are my favorite part the red and yellow look nice together a nice mailbox however i wish the letter on the front was printed the front of the van is nice i think the textured brick on the front gives it a different look on the front which is nice the back of the van the doors open to store mail although it doesnt have much room i like that they included this feature delivery the mail bricks slide right into the hole at the front this adds nice playability the vans all loaded up we are ready to deliver  parts 710 pretty good piece selection but for 8 should have included a few more playability810 its fun to deliver the mail to all of your towns residents design 910 the design is very nice except i feel that some of the stickered parts could have been printed overall 2430 after a long hard day of delivering mail theres nothing like enjoying a nice pizza and letting your hair out why do they make us wear those silly hats anyway this is a nice set that i can definitely recommend and i think tlg should certainly release a post office to go with this and the air mail set i really like these everyday life sets rather than always fighting crime or putting out fires those guys have normal lives too brickshelf folder httpwwwbrickshelrycgif338718	positive

good review thanks for the mail van while it certainly adds interaction and fun to a lego town it alone lacks details and playability and thus not a good set especailly taking its price into consideration its value is pretty much just like if not less than some impulse sets in my opinion	negative
its an ok set i just dont really like the look of the van much too rounded for my liking what happened to the box like cars	negative
i do like the set also ive bought 2 of them one to build it up and one to keep it misb i dunno for how long  only poor things is that the wheels are too wide car is 5nops wide instead of 4 afterall a good design i wonder if theres a post office coming soon by the way great review	positive

i am not a fan of citytowntrainstuff but this is a very good review that almost makes me wish i had the time read money to purchase some of the coastguard sets	positive
thanks for this review i was thinking of getting this set and having read your review went out today and got it what a great little set what i particularly like very sturdy build feels very solid as you build the pickup compared to the fire pickup  trailer i also have the orange pieces my first pieces in this colour the tyres which give the smoothest ride of any lego towncity vehicle ive ever built the raised suspension and side runners the coast guard dude again a first for me and his megacool flippers and aqualung the jetski controls  the handlebars actually move left to right which is a great detail little details that lego didnt have to do the grey handle by the ball joint moving handlebars the new tyres as you can probably guess i have voted outstanding for this set erdbeereis1 on aug 29 2008 0602 am said color separation is not a problem here and since it is a small set the piece call out is not a necessity you do get a piece call out with this set i did anyway its on the back of the small poster that is included in the set thanks again cheers rog edited by rriggs 02 september 2008  0253 pm	positive
thanls for the review i was looking at this set last time i went to the lego store but in the end decided not to get it now you’ve made me really doubt my decision one question though do you think the jet ski is as good as previous ones	positive
rriggs on sep 2 2008 0850 am said you do get a piece call out with this set i did anyway its on the back of the small poster that is included in the set i meant the piece call outs during the build that show which pieces you need for that step and cardinal brick im not quite sure what you mean but i cetainly think that this jetski is wonderful	positive
i agree that this is a very good looking set i just finished building mine yesterday and i love it but here is one suggestion trim the large sticker that goes on the roof of the vehicle by cutting along the angles at the front of the sticker if you use it as it is it will extend beyond the flat surface of the roof and will overlap the lower sections past experience with stickers has suggested that this sticker will lift at the front corners lego stickers are probably the best that there are but sometimes modifications must be made now i want that large coast guard helicopter 7738	positive

arrgh me hearties lets join the pirates as they try to steal the sacred treasure from the islanders hands it wont be easy king kahuka and his loyal warriors closely guard the treasure 24 hours a day will the pirates with their trusty pistols and cutlasses be able to defeat the islanders spears pet alligator and powerful leafy skirts we will find out 6262 king kahukas throne set info set name 6262 king kahukas throne theme piratesislanders released 1994 price  i dont know the original price i got it from bricklink with no box for 17 unfortunately i was not able to locate the euro or pounds price pieces 123 minifigs 5 off we go unfortunately i dont have the box because i didnt like the idea of spending over 50 for a set with under 200 pieces so sorry no box pics instructions i think the image on the front is very good it seems less setup somehow than the instructions these days it looks more like someone snuck up on them while they were going about their duties and snapped away rather than something that was planned the parts a nice selection here there is a pretty good amount of printed pieces in this set which is always nice for example the zebra print tile as well as the pirate flag nowadays would almost certainly be stickered the set also comes with a nice dark grey burp and a red boat for the pirates the minifigs the main buying point of this set for me were the minifigs this set comes with 5 of them which is quite good for a small set like this especially when compared to the sets of today the set comes with 1 alligator 2 pirates 2 islander warriors and king kahuka himself i really like the islanders torso and leg prints the leafy skirts are a nice touch and the makeup on the faces is superb some parts i liked these shields have a nice design on them and i always like the treasure chests a picture inside the manual this is a feature that i liked in the manual it shows an overhead view of the baseplate so its much easier to find where to put the piece i certainly could have used this feature in last years aquabase invasion set a closeup of the king the face print is nice i wonder who kahukas makeup artist is the finished set first the pirates boat the boat is really nice the sail is made out of a nice cloth and connects simply to the mast and now the main part of the set the throne this is a really nice model i think the colors and the design make it really feel like a different part of the lego world the rock sculpture looks fantastic as well the throne which is sort of a stretcher thing attaches here it connects on a 1x2 tile with a stud in the middle for easy removal here is the treasure that the pirates seek the treasure rests on tiles inside of the rock the zebra print tribal drum this is simple but nice one thing thats great about this which i mentioned earlier is that this and all of the other pieces with designs on them are printed thats right no stickers to be found here i have used these zebraprint tiles many times for mocs as they make a great exotic detail piece the lovely rock head i think this is wonderful it really adds a lot to the set it is well built with grey slopes curved pieces for the mouth and nose headlight bricks for the eyes and feathers and horns for detail the backside the complete set overall this looks great in my opinion with great landscaping and some fun parts well it looks like the pirates walked all over the islanders and stole their treasure in fact it looks like it was pretty brutal brickshelf folder now for the the ratings price 810 for 17 not a great price per piece value but when you add 5 figs in it makes it a decent price plus this set hasnt been in stores for 14 years so that adds some cost parts 910 the set has some really nice printed parts as well as a baseplate which in my opinion is great design 910 no flaws that i can think of right away the rock face is very well built playability 810 not really anything to play with although you can sail the ship and steal the treasure build 910 rock face uses nice techniques and the rest of the set is simple but looks good minifigs 1010 the minifigs are just fantastic great prints and just overall fun overall 5360 bricklink entry peeron brickset it looks like the pirates have picked up a new recruit from the island summary the older lego sets have a really different look to them than the new sets and i think its nice to have a mix of new and old this is definitely a great set with a nice build and great minifigs add to this the great printed pieces and that old pirate charm and you get a very nice set that i can certainly recommend thanks and happy building edited by erdbeereis 17 august 2009  0239 am	positive
erdbeereis1 ive had a quick look your review and i must say its quite superb im dead tired so im going to take a nap but ill be back later to read it more thoroughly	neutral
i had to vote outstanding on this set because it simply is great minifigs a cool head sculpture and a nice little boat means unlimited playability great review though man	positive
as ive already said somewhere on this forum this is the largest islander set i own and therefore my favourite thankyou for your great review i picked mine up for only 5 pounds along with crocodile cage and king kahuka but i cant help you with the original price i would search the web but im too tired right now	positive
what a great review of an excellent set i love the islanders and that drum outstanding i think these islander sets never got the credit they dserved i really like this set and its a great addition to the pirate collection	positive
i feel the same way about the islanders sets brickster they are a nice change from the regular pirate versus soldiers that is the norm i think it would be interesting to see some new islanders sets released in the new pirate line to see how tlc would make them	neutral
what a wonderful review with smart showing the right parts and clear pictures fantastic job erdbeereis1 this set is interesting for several reasons first of all it contains a large amount of very useful minifigs not many sets of this size contain so much figs secondly the throne itself can be easily combined with the other islander sets or even with other pirate and nonpirate sets im going to see if i can get this one for a reasonable price on ebay	positive
great review well done for sure i love these reviews of old set and this one is especially unique i must agree with you the color scheme is magnificent makes me want to go to ebay and buy it now to bad for spongebob though he got in with a real bad crowd	positive
excellent review i want this set now	positive
thanks for the great review this set is pretty standard as islanders go but it is such a cool subtheme that i dont care a bit i totally agree with your comment about old and new sets i dont think i would enjoy lego as much if i didnt have a decent amount of kits from pre 1999	negative
another very nice review and im glad to see it has some nice pieces as well as characters too looks to me that no one on bl has it in australia for sale so i may pass on this beauty though i did pick up king kahuka recently he makes an appearance in my medium entry	neutral

very solid set 5 minifigs and plenty of weapons to go around adding up to great playability what more could you want aspecially from a set this size only i would have liked another cutlass a musket instead of 1 of the pistols and for 1 of the pirates to have another head but those things are no big deal it is still a lot better than sets nowadays edited by fluyt 23 december 2008  0950 pm	positive
well this is a not so old set and i bet most of you already have it so here is another review from me as usual let us start off with the box art box art i like the box art they put a nice background for the atap at the side we have the minifigs scale and at the back there is the function shown and advertisement for other set the content the content is consist of 6 packets of bricks and a instruction book yeap no sticker sheet instruction book the instruction books not only show us the steps but also show us all a clear pictures of the january release sets and some sets show with their function well this includes the atap functions as well besides there are bricks checklist as well and the how do you start off before assemble your sets and a little poster where the clones with their atap battling the droids heres a random page new pieces to me i never see both of this piece before so i assume it is a new pieces anyone have any idea is there any other sets that contains this piece the blasters we are given a 2 long blasters which is great which i it is more accurate as most of the clone troopers use a long blaster the minifigs the minifigs is 2 shock trooper but is different with 7655 clone troopers battle packss shock trooper the leg is different in colour we are given white hip while the one in the battle pack are given a black hip furthermore we get a new printed headgear which i think they have improve it check out the mouth printing the colour is brighter so here is the headgear the headgear limit itself from turning to the side this is because the front part it is too low until it block by the torso the shock troopers without helmet on we are given a black stud no face printed how i wish that i have extra with helmet on comparison with shock troopers from battle pack the atap heres the atap it looks ugly at a certain angle and looks great in a certain angle anyway i still like the set i like the walker vehicle below are the pictures taken randomly top view side view without stabilizer leg with stabilizer leg rear view the functions well the functions are not so impressive just something turning around open here and there the only function that is say as special is the retractable stabilizer leg the cockpit the cockpit can fit two clone troopers but too bad we are only given two and is not enough as there is no gunner on top inside it there is a guns holders which can hold two guns but fall off easily when you are trying to remove the guns well the other side have some speedometre thing and a controller to reveal the cockpit you have to open the top hatch look below so you can see whats inside oops the side hatch and back hatch as well open and close i think this pieces is use not to let you open the hatch but to make some design i mean make it able to move inside with clones beneath so this is the pieces that hold the stabilizer leg when is not in use this is how the stabilizer leg move at last and of course the revealing cockpit from below and at the back guess the droids have alternative way to take this things down faster the leg there are pieces blocking the leg to go to the front i mean overhead and lose balance the base in not movable the side armor the side armor has door and this is how it is attach it is very flimsy when you want to adjust it to be a little steep to creat the shape they might just fall off so it is connected to the body with just a technic pin and to hold it properly here is the support the side hatch it open and close easily very loose nothing to hold it tight heres some view when the side hatch is open the cannon the cannon on top is movable and adjustable the big cannon can move up and down while the smaller one can cove sideways but the smaller one tend to lose balance when it is without minifigs means the one on top and below will not b align this is the pieces that only enable it to move up and down to prevent it from moving freely lego put two pieces to block it completion i try to make the sets looks great i think this angle is right spare parts it is so few compare with 7673 magna guard starfighter and it is more expensive overall this set is not really a good set the hatch is quite flimsy top and the side since there is nothing to hold them tight besides it is lack of one clone but to complete your walker collection you must have it pros no sticker needed new improved headgear long balsters cons lack of clone flimsy expensive as few pieces are given hope you guys like it edited by kimt 30 august 2008  1201 pm	neutral
swman on aug 29 2008 0835 pm said i do not like the fact that the clones have pure white legs it looks weird to me it was also weird that they included shock troopers but it was probably a way to get people to buy it this set also seems like one of those that was kind of thrown in with a mix of other sets like the tie crawler i never picked it up and with the new clone wars sets out i wont me too i dont like the the shock to have white legs because i am very fussy and i dont mix them i also expect other clone to be in this set but it came with 2 shocks i buy it because i like the walker vehicle	negative
i agree the pure white legs are odd as is the inclusion of shocks instead of pilots or regulars or maybe even kashykk troopers that might have been better	negative

technic rotation joint disc set list its used in 10 different sets so far not exactly a new piece a nice review with many good comments i really like this set its one of the walkers with really good design and a lot of playability its the usual issue of using too many technic pieces to make a moveable feature versus minifigscaled design the same issue concerns for example the atat the twilight and the atte plus more sets what annoys me in this set is the use of the 2 tan 4x8 plates they stick out and it would have been better if they the designers had used dark grey or light grey plates also ill add this to the inventory  now	positive
swman on aug 29 2008 0835 pm said i do not like the fact that the clones have pure white legs it looks weird to me it was also weird that they included shock troopers but it was probably a way to get people to buy it this set also seems like one of those that was kind of thrown in with a mix of other sets like the tie crawler i never picked it up and with the new clone wars sets out i wont i just found out atap appear in kashykk battle they should have given us kashykk trooper damn tlg so this vehicle is in the original trilogy	neutral
i like this set but i dont like the pure white legs for the shock troopers it looked better with the black leg joint piece i also think the set looks like half an atte	negative
i could have gotten this set if i wanted to but it seemed like a waste of money to me i dont like the shock troopers helmets that much i feel they should have printed visors instead of cut out ones like they have in my opinion it would make it look a lot better the at ap itself sounds like it has a lot of holes in its cockpit which drags the set down and make it seem like they havent exactly put a lot of effort into it great review	negative
wow talk about a bumper nice review baby this set is quite nice i would have goten it if i had had the money but didnt back then so didnt get it it has a nice parts selection why did lego do the shock troopers with white hips and the bp ones have black hips confusers me commanderfox	positive
i did enjoy it thanks for sharing your thoughts in this set and reviewing it ill add it to the index maybe you should consider joining the reviewers academy and rule the galaxy or something 	positive
so thats what all those miscellaneous parts are foranyway great review and i like that you took pictures of everything from different angles	positive

alakazam the good wizard is the wisest minifig in all of legoland he is a master of the wand and can see the future with these abilities he helps the knights predict where the trolls will strike next because this set is not in stores in the us i was luckily able to buy this set on my vacation to germany it is interesting that it is a euro exclusive 5614 the good wizard set info set name 5614 the good wizard theme castle released 2008 price eur 295gbp 199 pieces 16 minifigs 1 the review unfortunately i dont have the box because in got smushed in my suitcase on the plane so needless to say it was not in top condition the manual the manual is an extremely small foldout but the image on the front is nice on the back of the manual there is a picture of some of the 2008 impulse sets this is a nice feature the parts for an impulse set this has a pretty good selection a very nice owl and an interesting clear ball piece all built this set took me forever to build i had to take numerous breaks as it was the toughest longest build i have ever faced for an impulse set this actually looks pretty good the owl perch is nice also the crystal ball table the wizard is a very nice fig with great printing on the legs and hat and i love his beard brickshelf gallery the ratings price 810 not bad but i feel that impulse sets are slightly overpriced parts 710 impulse sets are focused around the minifig but the parts in this set are pretty good design 710 the crystal ball is a good idea and the owl perch is simple but nice playability 610 there is not much to play with here build 810 as i said before it took forever really it took all of 1 minute minifig 1010 the wizard is fantastic overall 4660 bricklink lego sh brickset abracadabra blades of four you are now a dinosaur summary for an impulse set this is very nice the wizard is an excellent fig and getting an animal in a cheap set is always great i would definitely recommend this set thanks and happy building	neutral

the next in my attempt to review every impulse set single handed theme space mission mars set name alien jet set number 5617 number of pieces 21 figures1 released 2008 list price £199 gbp 350 usd 299 euro 5617 peeroncom 5617 bricklink catalog 5617 shop at home as always we begin outside of the box it looks rather exciting at first glance set that cost a lot more than this one now for what€™s inside the contents of the box the impulse sets never look that inspiring now for the alien i have to say i€™m not impressed i€™m not a big space fan and i only bought this due to my impulse review challenge but as the main point of the impulse sets is the alien is a little hard to build a good set round something with one point or articulation it lacks what make lego minfigs so great their articulation now for the space vehicle as always with impulse a short and easy build ensues took maybe 2 mins at the most time to mount the alien in his craft the craft looks a little wide for him slightly better from this angle but still not winning any awards i€™m disappointed of the impulse sets i€™ve reviewed so far this is clearly the weakest of them but what really disappointing is the other seem so good and useful the rating system figures 310 the alien is not a good minfig parts 610 some interesting parts but nothing that special fun fun fun 210 i can€™t think of anything to do with this set to be honest design 410 poorly designed the box makes it look much better price 610 despite the impulse price tag i€™m still unhappy about the price grand total 2150 less than half marks the lowest i€™ve given so far conclusion in many ways i€™m annoyed from the outside of the box this set looks quite interesting and certainly appears to be well designed the idea of a small alien fighterflying craft is in my opinion a good one but sadly when you€™ve got the finished product in your hand it looks nothing like the box art while i think mission mars had some interesting sets and i might still get some of them this one will not be a repeat purchase for me	negative
thanks for this review as for the set well i am not to crazy about this set but i want some sort of small alien fleet vehicals and this would work well but i would rather ave my money to buy classic town edited by vbbn 01 september 2008  0248 am	negative
impluse sets are made good by using parts well and minifigs this has either i give a low score i really dislike the alien figs worst lego fig ever	negative
you you got it mint in sealed box it indeed is a nice set i am not into space but nevertheless this set is a good addition if you need to get your space environment a little bit more crowded lego however is planning to release a minifig set again next year city and of course the advent calendars are also quite nice to get some figs with accessories	positive
cardinal brick on aug 30 2008 0623 pm said the question is what could you do with this set i mean it’s just spacemen in a line what could you do the possibilities are endless 1 you can stand them in a line 2 stand them in a circle 3 stand them in a square 4 sit them all down 5 sit some of them down and leave some standing up adult supervision may be necessary for tfols attempting this one 6 take them all apart and scatter the pieces like some kind of huge space mine has gone off 7 yeah ok thats probably enough for now seriously i love all the sets of minifigs from all the different themes and this is a great one i always wanted them when i was a kid but never did my focus always was on town sets petrol stations and police sets please stand up and there was never enough pocket money left over for space sigh you are so lucky to have this great set thanks for sharing cheers rog	positive
thanks for the review the latter space minifig sets were great as they gave a nice variety of men id love this one	positive
fantastic review this is one of the classic minifigs pack which is so great for gathering massive number of minifigs i miss those days where they sell 5 minifigs together in a set thanks for this lovely review	positive
nice set lucky you the only reason i buy the mm impulse sets is lack of good space minifig packs like this nowadays 	positive
7670 hailfire tank and spider droid number of pieces 249 number of minifigs 4 price 1999 usd 2599 eur 1999 gbp brickset hello everyone today i will review the extremely underrated hailfire tank and spider droid set i hope this review does it justice so lets start with the box note this picture is not mine standard box for star wars in that time the background on the box looks like its from geonosis indicating that this set is from episode ii and not iii or the clone wars the back of the box not shown shows the playability functions and some other sets that were released at the same time as this overview here is an overview of the whole set it comes with one construction manual and no sticker sheets   this is a very simple set but with not much to it it is still a very important part of the cis army especially if you are interested in army building i like to call this set a super battle pack and youll find out why soon lets get right to it and look at the feature of the set the hailfire tank front a front view of the very cool tank here you can see two triangular shields on the hull the main body is very simple but altogether very effective and clever and making it really look like a hailfire tank although a little bit sized down from its movie version the transred stud used as the eye makes the tank look more menacing side the side view the wheels are very easy to make but its a real pain to connect all of those chain links together i dont see what you could use the links for except for another tank but maybe someone creative will find something for these the dark tan is nice though the wheels are held on by technic poles and the tank rolls on the wheels fairly well on carpet or a hard surface back this is the back of the tank here you can see eight flickfire missiles four on each side of the new type so they dont easily fall out also note the modified 2x2 with extended hole piece sticking out of the back this may be used to easily push around the tank i just wish you could fit a droid in the body for the cockpit now we move on to the spider droid or what i like to call the dwarf spider the front this one is also simple but very cleverly built the main body is two semispheres connected together for rotation and an antenna a cannon four legs and eyes made out of a useful telephone piece the picture speaks for itself as far as how the gun and eyes are built side a side view you can now see the legs better which are more sturdy then you would think each one is made out of two pearl bronze exoforce robot arms a useful bley handgun piece and a dark bley battle droid body all connected to the under body a big knoblike piece back the back not much to say here i like this spider droid because it is very sturdy and the legs are easy to adjust finally we look at the minifigs there are four minifigs in this set which is quite generous for a set of this size it comes with a yellow battle droid commander i really like this one two battle droids and a super battle droid all three battle droids have the new blaster pistols and one twisted arm thats about it for the review so here is the final verdict build 810 very fun and easy besides the chain links should take the seasoned builder less than 20 minutes playability 710 the flickfire missiles are fun as well as just zooming around the tank could use some clones for a battle swooshability 810 you can roll around the hailfire fairly well minifigs 910 a generous amount of figs and all are pretty good design 9510 a really simple and clever set although a little too small for the movie version price 1010 a very fair price considering the priceperparts ratio and the coolness of the set overall score 8510 a very neat set to have a great army builder and great for display next to all of the other cis sets the price is fair the figs are good and the build is very clever thats all for now folks please feel free to give some feedback edited by jimbutcher 15 september 2008  0308 am	positive
thanks for sharing this review with us i think this one of the sets in europe this thing is waaaay overpriced and thus makes it a crappy set we pay nearly double the us price so i rated it poor also because the figs included does not make it great the hailfire is well designed and looks great but thats just about all there is worthy of a positive mentioning sorry on a side note as a bronzeawarded student wheres the price in eur and gbp and wheres the poll nevermind the poll ive added that one for you 	negative

thanks for the review jimbutcher i really like that set it combines interesting and good design with some awesome cool parts and a neat amount of charm	positive
great review i agree that this set is underrated the hailfire is supposed to be a little taller than two battle droids so scalewise its nice the dwarf spider droid is amazing in my opinion i just wish it wasnt brown it makes me feel like its on geonosis we never saw a grey varient of the hailfire so its fine with me that its brown	positive
this is a great set i have 2 of them now and i plan to get more it is much better than the droid battle pack for 10 bucks more you get better battle droid arms and some canon vehicles good enough for me	positive
thanks for the review is a great one this set is not really a good set but i like the spider droid the hailfire droid scale is not right i think it is suppose to be even bigger anyway this is the first set that rerelease the commander droid so i grab it	negative
this is a must have set for aotc fans and i really love the hailfire droid but it costs like 80 or more now that its discontinued	neutral
7681 homing spider droid limited edition number of pieces 206 number of minifigs 5 price 3499 usd 2999 eur 1999 gbp theme star wars episode ii year released 2008 brickset folder bricklink catalog welcome to my sixth review on these boards of the mighty homing spider droid at first glance this ball on legs may not seem like much but hopefully this review will change your mind the box this box is the standard for all of the new clone wars sets sleek shiny and a rightoutofthefactory look the blueandwhite color scheme is fantastic and portrays that the sets are based off of a cartoon well this box has a limited edition in spanish too  seal slapped on the front although you wont have trouble finding this in your local toys r us because of the big clone wars display in the front of the store that you cant miss overview in this picture you can see the contents of the whole set minus the instruction booklet built you can spot five minifigures which ill get to later and a very tall cis weapon known as the homing spider droid this weapon of destruction is a musthave for your cis army although the color scheme mostly dark bley and light bley is a change up from the regular colors brown or blue of the cis this may have something to do with the blended armies of the trade federation and corporate alliance but i dont know for sure the instruction manual is very thin only about twenty pages homing spider droid this is the main part of the set four huge legs two mounted guns and a red sensor eye are the highlights of this artillery unit theres not many playability factors to this one but sometimes its just fun to squash the little clones a changeup of the contrary it also looks good next to all of the other cis sets but you might want to clear some room in your display area the legs take up a lot of room this thing is also massively tall about the same height as the republic cruiser main body this is the main body of the spider which has no cockpit and is remote controlled this spherical body not in that sort of way is a very quick build and features a big red eye connected by a red stud and hinge top gun here is the top gun not with tom cruise which is connected to the body using a clever technic system pun not intended as you can see from this picture you can see that it can rotate a full 360 degrees but only if you remove the eye also the gun can be pulled back and if you let go it will snap back like the a gun does when fired due to the force of the shot im not sure this was intended by tlg because it wasnt showed anywhere on the box or in the manual lower gun here is the gun attached to the under body of the main part it is attached using a hinge which allows it to move up and down i also like the cord that presumably transfers power included on both guns hips here is one of the hips attaching the legs to the body there is one on each side with two legs each the are attached to the body and legs with technic pieces legs you can see the tall legs in this pic they are basically just technic poles and connectors feet this is one of the feet the essential to balancing the whole vehicle these and the legs are repetitive so i suggest doing them all at the same time to avoid flipping back in the manual and repeating the process three more times the picture speaks for itself for the design of the feet all are connected to the legs using a doubleholed technic piece one massive son of a gun this thing is so tall it frightens the skin off of even the toughest most experienced soldiers run for your lives look at how much havoc and fear it causes family photo enough of the battle scenes here is a shot of this spider with its smaller cousin the dwarf spider droid minifigs finally here are the minifigs that come with this set there are five in all which include battle droid nothing special but still an addition to your army commander battle droid i love that yellow torso super battle droid again nothing special clone trooper im glad they gave us one in this set i can add it to to my other phase 1 clones commander fox i love it everything from the dark red markings to the accessories are fantastic the head is just the regular anime style clone wars face this set comes with two flashlights two antennae one visor one pauldron and one kama closeup of fox here is a closeup of fox so you can see the detailed insignia of the republic guard that wraps it up for the review here is the final verdict build 810 very easy and straightforward a little repetitive with the legs should take the seosoned builder around 20 minutes playability 610 not many play factors but its fun to just squash puny clones with this giant arachnid swooshability na minifigs 1010 you really cant ask for more in this sort of set design 810 not very sturdy but it is altogether clever price 510 yes it is limited edition but pumping up the price fifteen dollars more than it should be is a little ridiculous overall score 8510 an excellent set for display although not very sturdy minifigs are superb but the price could be better in the end i would highly recommend this to any prequel trilogy fan looking to build up his her army well thats about it for this review please feel free to leave your opinions edited by jimbutcher 15 september 2008  0309 am	positive
i just bought this set the other day and i must admit that it gets a below average from me the price is not corresponding with what you get which would be implied had jim added the eur or gbp price in the infohint hint  the spider droid is flimsy at best making it stand or even move without tumbling over is hard also why the brown cylinders on the legs keep the colourscheme clean please the figs are fine except that i dislike the clone headgear and the fact that the helmets now have holes in the sides allowing the flesh head to show within  goofy looking i am soo replacing the clone heads with black ones great review of an acceptable set	negative

asuka on aug 30 2008 1037 pm said thank you for that good review jimbutcher i think that this is really a pretty interesting and original looking set maybe it´s not very stable but it owns some special war of the worlds charm for sure yes thats it i couldnt remember what the spider reminded me of but thats it	positive
i love the look of this set its the closest to getting a walking eye from the venture bros as well as the droids and troopers 	positive
thanks for the review i really do like the first year of ef nowadays they mecha are perhaps more cleverly designed and use ball joints for playability but i really love the blocky bulky look of the first drones machines and somehow the older ones seem a better value of parts im more inclined to buy duplicates of them than the newer models	neutral
thanks for the review this is one of the few first wave sets that i didnt get im not really sure why as it wasnt too expensive	neutral
i like the theme very much but sadly i dont own any sets of it it brings such a great feeling its fresh and has great parts and sets and it brought the polar bear your review is very good and informative thanks i voted wrong i meant above average but i clicked below average 	positive
thank you for that fine review thebrickster i really like how this two small sets create an intense and adventurous atmosphere against the backdrop of a pretty exotic region the sets´re well designed and very nice with a fine amount of rather unique and well fitting gear the whole theme offers a lot of playability in a setup that´s a little different to tlc´s standard sceneries for sure and it always reminded me of who goes there too	positive
i find it amusing that the numbers on the decal for the flag were chosen so that it wouldnt look stupid if you put it on upsidedown by accident	neutral

thank you very much for this review thebrickster i voted both times for outstanding because i really the arctic theme i only bought the ice sailor but otherwise no sets because of money and place reasons and because i already collect four themes city older castle western and star wars old triology but a comeback of the arctic theme  perhaps as addition to a winter sports and winter rescue theme would be very welcome i really all sets  the little and the big ones in my opinion they all were very well designed not too big vehicles not too little and not minimalitic great minifigs and very nice and lovely details and accessory klausdieter	positive
wasnt there some years back a film based on aliens in the arctic cant remember the name and i think it was really old but there certainly was going on something with strange creatures and a polar base	neutral

2872 witch and fireplace review theme fright knights parts 18 figs 1 price unknown bricklink 500 year 1997 brickset peeron brickshelf bricklink ever wanted to turn into a animal wanted to curse your enemy or just wanted to be rich beyond your wildest dreams you should go visit the witch and her fireplace she can brew you up a potion for any occasion or purpose so head down to see the witch right now although this set is from the fright knights theme it can easily fit in with any other castle theme due to the lack of specialised fright knight parts and printings the set comes with no astounding parts but looks like the source for our good magician impulse set from the current castle theme i think i got this as a promo set official pic the box art for the set has the standard fright knight background and lego system logo followed by the set number down the left hand side of the box a cat is attempting a head stand also i think this box display the contents of the set in an attractive set up as usual 1 the whole set minifigs and all here is the witch on the torso there is a spider amulet which is a little hard to make out due to the low res of the image the witches wand is the same as the bellville fairy wands except in trans red like a lightsaber blade although it is completely useful as a lightsaber as you have probably noticed the witch has no legs instead she has a slope brick with the dress pattern printed on witch get it witchwhich looks better than asajj ventress from the new clone wars sets in my opinon for this anyway the fairysaber new word duel this is the old run down fireplace of the witch at the base there are two smouldering coals instead of fire witch its not funny any more is it doesnt make that much sense seeming as it is a fireplace the little triangular brick on top doesnt really do anything i also accidentally put the wrong one on while building it should be a sloping brick here are the coals the old trans orange studs are less translucent than the new ones i like how they have places them above the main baseplate on a 1x2 plate so they are in line with the rest of the fire place other wise it would look wrong here is everything else i havent covered yet the crystal ball the pets and the magical potion vial the crystal ball is identical to the one included with the good wizard impulse form the current castle theme i like the molds for the cat and the bat although if the cat had some yellow printing for the eyes like the white cat had black for the eyes it would be much better i think the trans green tube things are a little uncommon but im not worried about that 2 overall build 610 extremely puzzling and difficult do not attempt alone  its pretty simple but seeming as it has a load of stuff you can move around it is good minifigs 910 i really like the witch and it couldnt have really come with anyone else also it came with the wand which is really good too design 810 it should have come with some fire and maybe some more orange bricks to put at the base parts 810 the minifigure isnt bad nor are the animals or the trans green part price 1010 i am guessing this was pretty good seeming as i think i got this as a promo i gave it 10 because it was free playability 710 as wth all impulse sets there isnt much here but at least it comes with some animals to have a fight with or give the witch rabies overall 810 if it came with some more stuff for the fire place and the cat was more detailed it would have scored higher but because this set can easily be intergrated with other castle sets it got a mighty 8 3 mini comic  hocus pocus magic shocus turn my pets into dinosaurs not to catchy is it poof oh know i think i might drink my magical potion glug glug glug oh my	positive
thank you very much for this review skipper 24 i voted for outstanding since this set is a little but very lovely set i really it although i dont own it yet  since its very similar to todays impulse sets a minifig and some nice additional stuff and i like the black cat which gives the set a more gloomy atmosphere hopefully tlg will include a black cat and a chimney like in this set in the new advent calendar too klausdieter	positive
i chose above average it has a great minifigure i wish i had itsomeday i will	positive
this is a very good review no doubt about it about this set this is a cheap way to buy this set with a witch and some nifty accessories such as the black cat in fact i think this is the first time i had ever seen a black cat its simple but not very useful in my collection because other fright knight sets also offer the witches too i dont need many witches overall i feel that this is an average set	neutral

6205 vwing fighter number of pieces 118 number of minifigs 1 price 999 usd 1399 eur 899 gbp theme star wars episode iii year released 2006 brickset folder bricklink catalog welcome to this review of the vwing fighter this will be my eighth review on the boards strangely enough there was another set called the vwing fighter that came out in 1997 for the space theme note that i am missing several small pieces to this set but they are mostly insignificant to the overall look the box this is the standard box type for all 20052006 star wars sets i cant say that i like it as much as the 2007 or 2008 box types but itll do it features a profile view of darth vader and silver text overview this is the whole set this ship is meant to protect the chancellor at all costs they are usually found in groups of three or four front this ship is very sleek and youll notice that its colors are dark red light bley and dark bley with a touch of black it starts at the nose very narrow but as the body progresses to the back it gets wider like a v hence the name back here is a view of the rear note the transneon green discs used to represent the boosters also notice the dark red r4 astro droid and the hinges used as aromor flight all four wings two on each side can open up for flight attack mode they can open even farther then the pic shows but its not an intended function the wings a great but its a real pain to position them correctly and the bottom wings close when you set the ship down tail fins this is what the tail fins look like on each side with two flaps attached to the top and bottom if you look closely the tail fins and wings look a little bit like a mini ship themselves maybe controlled by remote no this is not an intended function either guns side the guns are very simple but very clever using a double technic hole piece two black bars and two technic pins also note the landing gear minifig finally here is the minifig a clone pilot it has light blue arms and legs white hands a helmet with black markings and republic insignia on it and a doublesided torso the front of the torso is great featuring shoulder straps armor plating and a life support system while this minifig is not altogether accurate to the movie it has still been one of my favorite star wars figs back the back of the fig that can double as the front of clone marines this side features shoulder straps and armor plating cockpit lastly here is the pilot seated in the cockpit he fits perfectly although it is not airtight we wouldnt want the poor guy to suffocate now would we that wraps up the review here is the final verdict build 810 a nice easy build and the last of the small sw ships 10 or less playability 610 pretty fun to swoosh around but thats about it could use a vulture droid but that would take away the small factor swooshability 1010 very fun and easy to swoosh around endlessly without fear of it breaking minifigs 910 there really is no need to have more although a palpy fig would be outstanding the pilot is a great figure though design 910 extremely accurate to the movie but the cockpit is not airtight price 1010 you couldnt ask for a better deal overall score 86 an excellent set unfortunately this is the last of the small sw ships currently the fig is great and the sleek design is accurate that just about sums it all up feel free to leave your comments edited by jimbutcher 15 september 2008  0311 am	positive

very good review i enjoyed reading this i want to buy these battlepacks until now my country has not restocked these battlepacks i wonder will they ever arrived again i want to build massive armies with this outstanding battlepack set hope it will arrived soon	positive
i love this battlepack i bought two last time i went to legoland california and it certainly gave the knights a good variety of new troops however i have one complaint and that is the guy with the lance i am wondering why he has a lance while fighting on foot if tlg really wanted to give him a lance they should have given him a horse	positive
great review of a neat way to bulk up your castle guards and their associated weapons and shields i hope we continue to see sets like this in the future they have to be a good money maker for tlg and they always please the fans francis marion on sep 2 2008 1039 am said they should have given him a horse  with that lovely new barding nobody would complain about the price then even if it was 15	positive
great set but with two huge cons  availabilty only on sh well surely not in italian stores  why are the figures already built are todays kids so dumb lets go back to those old minifig packs	neutral

the cobra on sep 2 2008 1133 am said  why are the figures already built are todays kids so dumb lets go back to those old minifig packs probably to reduce the sizecomplexity of the package thus saving tlc money i dont see it being a big deal as customization is always an option concerning the set not much to say other than it does what its suppose to do build up ones army of knights the variance of faces and accessories are great i especially love the chrome sword the price isnt bad either since the package comes with five nice figs and some great equipment edited by dj2005 03 september 2008  0646 am	neutral
how were you able to get three small shields i only got two in mine i am going to check the trash just in case	neutral
swman on oct 6 2008 0727 am said how were you able to get three small shields i only got two in mine i am going to check the trash just in case i think it only comes with two the extra one probably slipped in from another set sorry for any confusion	neutral
and another great review from one of our academy teachers i always look forward reading them  i think the battlepacks for castle are a great initiative from tlc i like this one but also the one with the skellies you get some different looking soldiers and a few weapons and shields so thats cool the low prices make it so that most people could build a large armybattle if they want to a big for your review and another for tlc for making these edited by zorro3999 06 october 2008  0540 pm	positive

i love this set i bought one when i went to the lego store at downtown disney and went home and bought another online i love that it gives you a variety of weapons and figures i like using the bowl helmet guy to man my catapults and crossbows	positive

i like your review on this battle pack but i think that this battle pack was over priced 12 for this i am not paying that much for 5 knights	negative
dear all i found this to be a very usefull army building set at 2 euro per minifig it is relatively cheap in my book so i bought 4 battle packs recently although it could be difficult to integrate all of them in your army personally i reshuffled some of the weapons as to integrate them better but that is a personal preference ofcourse kind regards teddy	neutral

i really love these impulse sets at a low price point for lots of minifigs this police one doesnt appeal too much to me at the moment but who knows with your reference i may need it with a future project hmm its actually a good way of getting those dogs cheaply	positive
i bought this set for 214€ yesterday and i have to admit that for that price im veerryy satisfied  i bought it especially for the dog my first one and for the road sign during the construction short of the set i was wondering something does the speed limit has a signification in every country or some variant exists in my country france the speed limit in town is 50 kmh so i understand the road sign in this set but in other country and especially the country were the speed limit is not in kmh does this set had another road sign	positive

i agree that this set is worth the price considering the amount of minifigs and even a skeletal horse it also comes with a lot of blue 1x1 slopes that are always useful and quite rare to obtain another weapon for the soldier operating the catapult or a shield for the other soldier would have been great but that is pushing it the crossbow itself is quite nice and is better than what most 6 sets come with imo overall a good set indeed thank you for the review and the other review concerning the knight of which i hope to buy in the near future as it looks like it comes with a great deal of goodies the weapon rack is useful too	neutral
thanks for the input	positive
nice review  i still thing sets like this are the reason castle has done so well it allows you to collect a large number of minfig for not very much cash which i certainly indulged in my only complaint is that you end up with the evil skeletons out numbered however heard of the good guys winning with the numbers in their favour	neutral

nice review it seems that you really covered all aspects of this fantastic set my favorite part about it is probably the fact that you can give almost every included minifig a mount except for one poor knight  however another part i like is that the horse includes a plain saddle which is a nice relief after the overabundance of the goldplate barding which is nice but overused in the early sets also the sw jokes are hilarious i particularly the running gag with the walker but i like this one too reason for edit i made a mistake due to a loss of internet and an accidental post edited by francis marion 03 september 2008  0332 am	positive
one of the best sets from the new castle theme we havent seen a carriage in a long long time and it looks so spooky and sceary lots of minifigs new skeleton horses 3 this was the first set i got from the new castle theme outstanding	positive
that’s a nice review though i do feel the price was a little high but as you said you get so much in it last year argos in the uk reduced it to £799 which was a true bargain and sent me all over london looking for a store with more in stock again as with all the lego castle sets i think what makes it work so well is that lego are now providing a much larger number of minfigs and that’s often what makes a set	neutral
this was one of the first sets i bought from the new castle theme and i love it so many figs and awesome skeleton horses in just one set at the same time you get quite a few usefull black bricks for castle mocs another perfect set in the new world of castle review added to the index	positive

thats a super review erdbeereis1 as usual and as we can expect from one of the academy teachers i gave the set a 4 above average because i think there are quite some minifigs included for its price which is i think not that expensive at all i also like the parts that are included like the sceleton horses and weapons wheels imho this set is a great armybuilder  btw in belgium i have seen this set being sold for 1599 euros	positive

7040 dwarves mine defender theme castle released 2008 price 10 usd pieces 73 3 minifigures introduction here i am with one of the newest castle sets realeased in early 2008 its a small battle wagon with blades on the front probably to demolish rocks in mines but in this case our hero dwarf has to use his machine against the evil trolls who want to destroy his happy kingdom there is only one small booklet for instructions no alternate model parts come in two bags one for small pieces and one for bigger ones apart from the lovely figures the brown parts will be quite useful for any castle builder extra parts are not even worth mentioning there are no stickers figures are detailed enough dwarf is lovely with his beard but his legs wont move because he is short figures are the main attraction for adult players we havent seen castle army builder sets for a long while and this is closest weve got in recent years the dwarf is a little taller than it should have been but its not possible to do so without creating a completely new mould for figures and that would be expensive its beard is oversized as well but that gives him a legoish look which i like a lot the trolls  thats what everybody calls them but i say they are orcs  are obviously evil but they are friendly enough not to scare our munchkins but i wish they had different torsos or at least different faces like crownies there are not enough weapons to arm everyone but the flag pole is really nice unlike the star wars army builders this set has very little weaponry only one sword and one pike creates scarcity for 3 figures  star wars sets had 4 figures for same price so i hope our middle age warriors dont come across any stormtroopers  building in progress when you pull the chain the catapult fires a round brick the set has quite good playability moving blades and firing catapult should be fun for little children i wouldnt expect more functions for such a small sized model it hardly covers my hand the blades move with the front wheel on the right there is only one little downside there is too much friction for the wheel and blades wont move synchronized you may come over this problem by adjusting the blade height and lining them with the wheels mow the little buggers you can adjust the blade height there isnt enough room for the dwarf folder when public httpwwwbrickshelrycgif338578 rating figures 810 dwarf is amazing trolls are great too but i wish they had different faces parts 710 brown slopes are new rest is ok too price 710 acceptable but we have seen sets with more figures for less design 610 it looks kind of steampunkish but could be better with a little detail building 610 not repeating itself still nothing exciting total 3450 castle fans will definetely order this one but average lego player may not be interested conclusion overall its a nice set and id recommend it if you like the castle theme youll find some good use for the figures and this is the cheapest figure set of the year  at 333 usd each it could have more armory and weaponry but otherwise its quite alright skip lunch today and order this little set links brickset reviews bricklink entry peeron inventory	positive

a great review of a very good set i must echo kimt though i seem to be doing it an awful lot it would be improved by the addition of one more fig to the set as it’s the same price band as last years catapult	positive
indexed going through the boards i was amazed to find out that no one ever attempted to review one of the best lego classics the 6399 airport shuttle while i was studying for exams a few weeks back i decided to take a break built the monorail and take some pictures of it resulting in the present review along with this i made my first ever poll here we go first some data setnumber 6399 setname airport shuttle released in 1990 in holland though bricklink says 1991 number of parts 731 number of figs 9 price unknown prices on bricklink vary from 261 up to 2300  but this was an expensive set even in the nineties the box mine is a bit battered by the owner before me but theres still plenty to see this is one of the largest boxes i have look at the minifig in the downright corner for the comparision and it is a really neat storing facility for many sets the box shows the set and in the background the silhouet of the set that is to accompany this one the airport from 1990 i like the angle of the box showing the two stations track and train in one picture the back of the box shows some really nice ideas for other setups why oh why has lego abandonned this kind of showing whats possible with one set inside flap of the box showing details of the set and the functions detail on the front of the box displaying the dimensions it really is a huge track layout for one set the instructions there is a nice little booklet showing the same picture as the box art with the figures lined up underneath the last page nicely folds out to show the entire setup of the tracks the figures a brilliant selection of minifigs including airport people and a cook all figures that are supposed to go on the shuttle carry a ticket and there are also some suitcases tickets fit inside of course station  1 the set includes two stations here is the first depicting the airport there are lots of details a phonebooth two seats some flowers a map luggagelockers and of course the streetlights a detailed shot of the station showing the luggagelockers and ticketvalidating machine part of the beauty of this set is the fact that it is so extremely detailed just look at the signs to show where to go next stickers and the scenery opposite the street the station has the same shape as the airport shuttle logo how sweet is that the station pictured as part of the layout the stations ends are made with airplane wings to smoothen the arrival of the shuttle station  2 here is the second station my personal favorite an elevated stop with a little snackbar underneath and stairs leading to the platform some chairs and streetlights here as well plus two old fashioned trees the part of the set that can be used in any layout the snackbar with hamburger sign sticker yes those hamburgers look tasty indeed also notice the lights hanging from the platform overhead and the ticketvalidating machine at the bottom of the stairs here we have the platform with information panels and seats also notice the two trafficlights for the train heres how it works the train will travel in the direction the arrow is pointing when turning the knob the two grey blocks will move towards or away from the trackcenter activating a button on the centerpiece of the train the motor which makes the train start its journey around the track there is only one speed and the train can only be put to a stop or change direction at stations the station as part of the layout the shuttle now on with the train there are two carrriages connected to a centered motor the power is provided by means of a batterybox containing a 9v battery the batterybox is in one of the carriages and displays airport shuttle a total of five passengers can be seated inside leaving room for their luggage and two drivers the front carriage with the button for the batterybox showing the underside showing the gearwheel metal that brings the power from the motor onto the geared track the black pointy things alongside the gearwheel react with the direction knobs at stations this is how the shuttle negociates with height differences everything hinges and rotates making the shuttle capable of performing steep climbs the motor is powerful enough to not slow down at such a climb detailed shot showing the first set of covered wheels in hinged position the shuttle on the layout the full layout this layout is quite huge involving lots of track pieces ramps ten large stanchionpoles and the two stations to show the movement of the shuttle i have made a 20 second movie which can be seen in my brickshelf gallery of this set conclusion well to conclude the review some final thoughts this truly is one of the more detailed sets around at least from the nineties and one of the largest in dimensions the monorail system is cleverly thought out and works excellent track extensions are hard to get however and very expensive nowdays especially the switchpoints and long straight track pieces the tracks included with this set will provide you with hours of fun though because there are a lot of them it can be quite hard to incorporate the monorail in your town without having a clearlybasedonthemonorailalone town i tried to incorporate it some years ago link here posing a real challenge the ratings price 810 this is an expensive set if you can get it for under 200 get it this set is rare in any condition parts 1010 lots of rare pieces cool minifigs 9v system roadplates lots of minifigseats en red trainwindows originality 1010 there are very few monorails released this one being the only town set compatibility 810 can be a bit hard to incorporate in a town but hey you got the monorail so no complaining here total 3640 i can only reccommend this set to anyone it is my personal favorite set upto this present time if there are any questions ask them all comments are welcome of course	positive
i got this set last month and i can definitely say that even if you think it is one of the best sets ever you wont fully appreciate it until you build it yourself the elevated city station is much more complex than it looks and the whole set is extremely detailed the good  as stated in the review theres a lot of track roughly twice as much as the last monorail made 6991 5 long straights too  the designers didnt need to put in the hamburger stand or the ticket readers but they did and made it even better  great figure selection airport workers as well as civilians the bad if you can call it that in such a great set  hard to incorporate into an existing town if using the default track layout the center loop would be inaccessible to vehicles and the layout is very large  the monorail needs nearly a full straight section on either side of the city station or it will impact the corner of the station and stall if a curve is too close  as far as i know the only town set with road plates that doesnt have a wheeled vehicle a car would have been nice a bus would have been incredible but these small things in no way diminish from the fact that this is one of the best sets ever edited by section8 05 september 2008  0117 pm	positive
this is an outstanding review which deserved to be featured here after seeing this set it prompts me to own this set and match with my 10159 legend city airport its very nice to see such outstanding set being reviewed and presented to our very screens everything about this set is simply outstanding i cant imagine that such incredible set actually released before why dont they ever continue with this anymore sigh its nice to see so much detailed from its shuttle snack bar stairs waiting platform validating machine and etc this is an instant 5 set if given a chance to own a misb set i will defintely seriously consider about it	positive
best set ever i got my copy years ago from a guy on the old rectoyslego newsgroup anybody here still remember that newsgroup i traded him a guarded inn a black falcons fortress and a couple other small castle sets for it no regrets on that trade it is hard to incorporate a monorail into a town especially if you have a bunch of trains too i ended up making my entire monorail system elevated theres just no easy way to make a monorail  road crossing i also gave up on having it run in a loop instead it runs back and forth between two endpoints	positive
an excellent review of one of the jewels in the crown of the lego town range to answer one of your question i think the lack of people owning this set is one of the reasons that its yet to have a review personally i’ve only seen this set in the flesh once in my life when i was a child just before it was withdrawn from sale it is a lovely set well made and well produced though i think there is a flaw and that’s when the passages get of the other end of their train ride what picks them up a bus set for the airport would have been a good addition apart from that i can’t really fault it and that fact it comes with three female minifigs is just stellar as for incorporation keeping it elevated seems the most sensible suggestion i’ve always thought it i have it and wanted to integrate the set to a town to use it in the style of the dlr in london but that’s just a thought	positive

sets like this just dont come around too often do they i didnt realize exactly how much detail really was in this set tlc should bring back the monorail great review of an amazing classic town set	positive
holodoc on sep 6 2008 0345 am said who was the one who rated it above average i agreed with you who is the person whom rated it above average it will be best to justify why that person felt this way vbbn on sep 6 2008 0511 am said an aweome review of an outstanding set erdbeereis1 on sep 6 2008 0132 pm said great review of an amazing classic town set are the both of you doing grading out of the academy when he is not a student there i cant help it but to notice that both of you placed thumbs up and immediately it struck me with that thought	positive
this remains the definitive city set in my eyes i never managed to get one but from the instructions it seems to be perfect in just about every way i got the two space monorails a while ago but the much higher prices on this one have kept it out my reach this set is a lot bigger than either of those though i always liked the monorail system a bit better than the trains because you could easily incorporate height into the tracks and spread them out in all three dimensions quote edit and bricklink is wrong giving 1991 as the release date youre right it was 1990 it was apparently released in 1990 in europe and 1991 in north america going by some us and german catalogs i have from that time period edited by cp5670 06 september 2008  0606 am	positive
thanks for all the nice comments holodoc on sep 5 2008 1105 am said i had to laugh when reading your comment on the minifig seats dont you own many of those i dont know where to put mine well of course i do have quite some seats a drawer full actually but this was my first set that had them in black when i was young however long time ago you know  i always had a short supply of seats so thats why i noticed and mentioned it whitefang on sep 5 2008 0218 pm said this is an outstanding review which deserved to be featured here thank you for drawing attention to this review through classictownnet i have not been a frequent user of the boards lately and the release has mostly passed me by but i must say that it looks like a great site whitefang on sep 6 2008 0645 am said are the both of you doing grading out of the academy when he is not a student there indeed i am no student of the academy i have another academy university to attend to leaving little time to venture around eurobricks latlely a shame i know i hope my review is in accepted here despite my lack of grades concerning the art form	neutral

norro on sep 6 2008 0934 am said thanks for the in depth review of a set miles out of my price range i thought it was out of my price range too then i realized that i had probably spent enough since coming out of my dark ages to buy a misb 6399 so i bought it and i am going to cut back on buying other sets for the next year or so to offset the one big purchase those glimpses of the 2009 sets havent made me regret the cutback edited by section8 06 september 2008  0907 pm	neutral

good review who voted this below average i own one and managed to pick it up off ebay a few years ago now with the track expansion pack for £150 in very good condition so glad i did an all time classic	positive
judging from videos ive seen it seems that the monorail does very well on slopes i wonder why there havent been more or at least an updated set i also wonder why the trains cant incorporate some slopes like the monorail	negative
it would be cool to see a review comparing this set with the newer orange garbage truck	neutral
definitely the best garbage truck ever the color scheme is great and the design is awesome outstanding without a doubt i must have it sometime	positive
tenorikuma on sep 7 2008 0830 am said it would be cool to see a review comparing this set with the newer orange garbage truck well i might want to do that but then in a different way as the railroad maintenance i will then review the orange one and make comments on it compared to this one	neutral
yeah its very nice along with all the older sets ive got the cement mixer that was released around about the same time as this	positive
thanks so much for the great review i love that truck i hadnt realized there was a real 4wide recycle truck out there i must get it one day to replace this abomination currently doing garbage duty in my town i think that truck has seven pieces total in it i do like the blue color though 	positive
great to find this review of a classic set and its far better than any yuk set from 1997 omg what were they thinking  i prefer the six wide for trucks but for the 80s it was perfect and even today still holds its own 	positive
great review and i love the soft yellow effect to the pics imo the most recent garbage truck shouldve used the same piece for lifting the cans into the big bin instead of the droid arms	positive
6206 tie interceptor number of pieces 212 number of minifigs 1 price 1999 usd 1799 eur theme star wars episode vi year released 2006 brickset folder bricklink catalog welcome to my ninth review the boards todays review is the long awaited tie interceptor but does it live up to expectations well lets find out i believe this is the first and only time tlg made this set so lets begin the review the box the box is standard for its time with silver font the background on the front has some planets and the death star ii clarifying that this set is from episode vi overview this set comes with the interceptor model and one fig the interceptor has a very sleek futuristic design with four wings and a ballshaped cockpit the tie interceptor is a stealthy speedy vehicle in the imperial fleet it is used for scouting missions and not meant for attacking due to its weak structure and low arsenal front this version of the tie group is very attractive and coollooking it has an aerodynamic shape giving it looks and speed while not accurate to the movies grey and black colored ties the blue in place of the grey is just fine and does not alter the coolness of the design thankfully there are no stickers in this set cockpit here you can see the ballshaped cockpit be very very careful when opening it its very flimsy and breaks off almost every time fortunately both the windshield and the dish on top are printed and not stickers please dont mind the dust cockpit interior this is the inside of the cockpit it is very roomy airtight and one of the few cockpits in sw sets that are this good it makes up for lack of detail by giving the pilot plenty of room so you should have no trouble there it is also very smooth in the back and where the windshield folds down this is by far the best sw cockpit i have ever seen done by tlg good job the only bad thing is the two tan bricks that clash with the rest of the color wing attachment this is how the wings are attached to the cockpit on each side unfortunately the design on this part is not so good and sometimes the wings break off plus this part is very blocky and there is a big juniorized piece on the base of the wings wings here is what each wing looks like there are three parts on each wing a middle and two fins the wings are very aerodynamic with a diamondlike design note the imperial insignias and the blue tiles lining the wings wing attachments contd here again you see how the middle wing part is attached to the base juniorized piece and the fins attached to the base by hinges the hinges allow the fins to fold in and out a bit but again this is very fragile and the fins often break off gun placements this is an example of four guns on the ship one on the tip of each fin the guns consist of a tile with a tenic tunnel hole on the bottom attached to a technic pin which is attached to a black bar a good design altogether back here you see the rear of the cockpit you can see why the opening mechanism is so flimsy the whole top and front is connected to the body only by a weak hinge system as seen in the picture also note the small transblue dish and the four transred studs minifigure finally here is the single figure that comes in this set a tie pilot it is an all black figure with a life support system decal on the front and a helmet with silver imperial insignias an overall good minifig with a different helmet mold than the stormtrooper or shadowtrooper well i suppose thats about all lets get to the final verdict build 610 a little difficult due the flimsiness of the ship but should only take the average builder no more than 30 minutes playability 710 its fun to fly around   but has no real functions swooshability 710 you can swoosh it around fairly well just be careful not to accidentally break it minifigs 810 a good fig although having only one leaves something more to be desired design 410 very very flimsy with the wings windshield and fins but good for display price 710 i think it was actually 30 usd when i got it but im not sure overall score 65 an average set very delicate so much that you can hardly pick it up but good for display the minifig is okay and having no stickers is good i would recommend this to a hardcore ot fan that wraps it all up please vote your opinion on this set in the poll and ill see you next review edited by jimbutcher 15 september 2008  0310 am	neutral
a nice set my brother used to have this i wish the pilots helmet had a little printing on it looks messed up to me	positive
the interceptor is my favorite tie ship so i wish i picked it up thanks for the review i agree about the helmet needs some silver printing on the mouth piece and the ends	positive

name jetport fire squad set no 6440 theme lego system  town year 1991 pieces 84 minifigs 2 price usd 2750 which equals about eur 1926€ and gbp 1557£ introduction one of the sets that especially my cousin likes is this one one time at the dutch legoworld event we had three of those there with flashing lights and loud sirens trying to put out the fire that was caused by the crash of again some lego aircraft we never had this set before our drak ages and the sets probably came from ebay or so in my opinion the newest airport rescue is nice too but in the conclusion i will make some additional remarks about that just imagine what it would be like for your lego town if the pilot of one of your smaller planes just couldnt stop before the end of the runway here you see the disaster that happened some day in our town fortunately all passengers got out safely thanks to our brave fire fighters this magnificent truck was used to help putting out the fierce fire caused by the aviation gas from the small plane the set includes two firefighters in distinguishable airport uniforms in order to be able to safe the passengers and go for a quick intervention our brave firemen have an axe for each of them airtanks and a portable fire extinguisher here you see the truck on the right side the large spout on the roof really makes it a remarkable truck as you can see behind the red door there is space for the airtank of our brave firemen at the right there is also place for the small hand held extinguisher the left side of the truck has a water hose instead for a truck from 1991 there is quite some room inside actually both firemen fit inside unfortunately there is only one seat at the back there are two clips for the axes there you can also find the main switch for the light and sound system as you can see the red flashing lights do their job quite well the sirene is just behind the bar with the flashing lights the main spout just seems to begin emitting water the front of the truck for some reason there are two hidden spouts there as well what their purpose is seems unclear but they look nice kimt suggests that it is for foaming the runway and that is a real option of course this set can be found on peeron lugnet brickset bricklink entries playability 810 very nice set details that are movable and of course the light and sound design 810 nice sets with nice details but could have even been better seat for 2nd fireman missing no oxigen masks and only one airtank price 710 for a light and sound set and two firefighters the price is reasonable i would say overall 810 nice sets some details could even be better too bad that there is only a five to choose from a sticker when you have more than one truck last but not least an overview of the complete set including instructions fire mastered as the dutch firefighters will say when they have completed their job we have also bought the newer airport rescue truck 7891 however we think this 6440 one is much better the light and sound all the nice features and the nice details are much better than the new truck edited by jopiek 11 september 2008  1025 am	positive

i remember my cousins having this set both are in their permanent dark ages now but are not willing to give their lego to me if you have one of those old airports then this set is what you need to have even more fun since it makes a great addition to the airport excellent review 1010	positive

information name fire control center set no 4953  peeroncom theme lego legoland year 1991 pieces 516 minifigs 4 price usd 8500  gbp unknown  eur unknown bricklink search results brickset lugnet introduction this week i got the flu so since i have to stay home and get better i might as well make a review its one of the most amazing older city sets thus making it a really valuable review this is the story about four handsome firemen living in one of the most amazing city structures out there the 6389 fire control center the box i actually didnt remember the box to be that small borrowed from peeron the four hunky firemen oh jeah what women doesnt like a man in a uniform the manual even the manual is aging but then again its 17 years old review as you all know a city must have some standard civil services like a hospital and a police station a fire house also is a must for any lego city this particular fire house is one of the most amazing sets ever to be released in this cool set you get 4 minifigs all fire fighters two verhicles and a helicopter firefighters have to move around the futuristic fire truck is definately my favourite chiefs car the smallest verhicle of the set its a small allterrain jeep for the fire chief pretty much a standard car in those days a real simple layout and a trunk which holds a small fire hose its lucky to be in this set because it complements the whole thing the car luckily its red and it has de cool signs on the side helicopter another great addition to the whole set is the helicopter again in a basic setup for that kind of verhicle at the time this one has the nice addition of two hoses to put out the fires raging in lego city the chopper no it doesnt really fly really cool fire truck thingy this fire truck is definately the best of the verhicles in this set its actually a futuristic model of fire trucks i havent seen any other fire truck like this i saw a police truck like it though but were talking fire fighters right actually the whole thing han open up to reveal a number of fire fighting appliances such as a hose a computer and a oxygen tank the fire truck click for bigger version the main building actually looks kinda empty when the trucks and chopper are gone however this still is realistic compared to a real fire house also the front has those amazing sliding doors which make this thing really look cool and clean off to fight a fire main structure with the slinding doors pulled down actually those sliding doors are also the hard part of the model since all the bricks must be perfectly aligned or else the doors will stutter but if youre a little familiar with lego then you dont need to worry from the back enough room to play with im going to give my perspectives on each of the sides on the left we have the garage for the bigger fire truck the only real flaw about this set is that this garage isnt long enough for the fire truck this could have been solved by making it two or three studs longer notice the cool sunroof in the middle we have the chiefs office complete with coffee machine a diversity of computers and a tape recorder most likely to tape any incoming calls a lot of details are crammed up in there just like in the rest of the set to the right is the helicopter platform i really like the greyblueyellow of the platform because it doesnt look so red anymore dont get me wrong red is a cool color but not too much red and the helicopter actually fits and stays in place during playtime the baseplate filled up this picture says it all again the four lego hunks are greeting all the ladies the minifigs are from a classic series this happens with more of my lego sets bottom line is that this set is one of the best fire houses lego created verdict the build is pretty easy but takes a while to really see where you are with your building its nice to have a hospital from the same era this create a more uniform look to your city once you completed the model your baseplate is pretty filled up but still has a lot of opportunities playability 1010 cool trucks a chopper and sliding doors nuff said design 910 insanely good design price 1010 couldnt get better than this overall 9610 with a score like that one can only say get one now time to go home the trucks and chopper back on their rightful spots	positive
i have this one the newer 6571 station is better in some ways but i always liked the big airportstyle fire engine in this and the windows covering the garages one mod project i have in mind is to expand the base adding a second room in the area beneath the control center interestingly this set had two different box pictures there was the original 1989 yellow legoland box and a 1991 blue system box and the blue box has the vehicles in different places quote price usd 8500  gbp unknown  eur unknown if this is referring to the original price it wasnt that much 50 is more like it	neutral

big supie on sep 7 2008 0846 pm said i think the 6382 fire station is the better one from the 80ies i have 6382 and agree that it is a great set it doesnt have a chopper like this set and the fire engine is not as flash it does have a downstairs in the building though at least a door and a front wall anyway its nice to see a review of this set as its one that i often looked at in the catalogue and thought of getting but never did its great to see the details that i otherwise would not have seen i dont like the firemen with hair though they should have helmets or caps imho thanks for the review cheers rog	positive
found this set on a flea market in munich yesterday just 25 years after its release the instructions for a total of five models two of them printed the other 3 are just photo instructions in the book it still has the box in good shape despite some wear from the age sadly five little pieces were missing and 5 wrong pieces inside instead 2 complete wheels and a classic 80s90s plane wing dumped into my bricks but i was able to replace the missing minifig torch and the 4 missing plates with identical pieces from my collection the box and contents the set still has the original box inside the pieces plastic insert instructions and a 1987 technic catalogue imagine that set livespan today four years and the 8841 is still in the catalogue classic technic design from early 80s showing a function drawing of the steering and the main model a small set but with a flap shoeing the contents all pieces in the inner box and the papers included 5th model soapbox racer this is more or less a soapbox racer with working steering but no engine its got a rather blocky design but still looks sleek enough and is a simple build little over 100 pcs out of 180 the soapbox at step 2 just included the steering at step 6 completed and ready to race downhill total 710 simple but effective 4th model simple chassis very simple and boring alternate using just 13 of the 180 pieces in the set it even hasnt got a seat construction its just a plain steering mechanism attached on wheels with a spartan chassis of just a few pieces this is the whole model at step 5 just attach the steering mechanism and wheels and youre done total the worst alternate model of the complete set just a boring 410 3rd model balance very original small model its a small model of a working classic balance and it works with small parts laid on the scales altough theyve got just a 4x4 footprint its a fast build just 15 minutes and youve done it the model as it looks at step 3 finished easy build with just 63pcs out of 180 total very original model it actually works with small weights but a very simple build still a 710 alternate model tractor with equipment this is the second model its a simple but boxy design featuring a harrow and a plough the tractor has a similar design to the very first tractor set but much smaller the plough is about 24wide and the harrow is completely snotted even back in 1983 has two functions working steering and the coupler for the equipment uses almost all pieces of the set the tractor at step 8 the steering isnt completely attached now this is the completed tractor the complete harrow finished alternate with the plough attached total nice but quite ugly and boxy design for a tractor with 4 wheels of the same size takes me to a 610 main model desert racer this is the main model with a nice for early 80s but boxy design it has two functions steering and a working 1cylinder rear engine which is of the old 2x2 piston type since the small piston design wasnt invented back then this is the only model of the set which has piece callouts in the instructions the printed alternate model has no callouts they werent invented on both models back in 1983 the three smaller photo instruction alternates have a piece callout at the beginning showing all needed pieces the seat is a nice but blocky design and use a primitive snot technique this is the model at step five the piston is already attached imagine this state on step 5 in modern sets back then lego had challenging instructions not the step madness like today this is the engine just made of plates with a hole in the middle for the piston step 9 the piston engine is completed on step 12 the roll bar and the seat are installed only the steering isnt completed yet front view of the finished model just 15 steps needed back then birds eye view of the whole set displayed on the box model verdict nice design especially the colorful seat in snot technique but quite boxy especially the engine since there were only the huge pistons still a 910 set verdict design and models 710 very boxy designs due to the age the chassis alternate sucks build 910 classic 80s technic building quite challenging but fun sturdyness 710 rear section damaged after the table fall but rather easily fixed fun 910 blast from the past overall 810 mfg widdi edited by widdi 07 september 2008  0411 pm	positive
cp5670 on sep 7 2008 0525 pm said nice classic set are those hoses around the engine pneumatic tubes that technic catalog looks interesting too i have the catalogs for the next several years but not that one the most extreme example of this was the engine step in the 8865 set which uses over 120 pieces by itself the pneumatic tubes are listed seperately under x188 the classic hose is x467 i think theyre just the same with just a single difference the x467 seemed to be already cut in lenght instead of x188 which must be cut in lenght mfg widdi	positive
great review i really love the seat and the great possibilities with the alternate models also congratulations for getting that set in perfect condition	positive
a very nice review jopiek you know i was wondering how lego could justify having two 12vpowered passenger trains at the same time but after reading the review and seeing the lack of figures and accessories i guess i understand why plus the train is rather compact oh and i cant help but think that the chairs in the middle carriage are somewhat oddly placed because those placed next to the door are unusable because the door takes up room needed for figs arms also it appears that your set also has the newer couplers ie theres no hooks for the decoupling rail to grab hold of with the light assembly it really wont matter playwise or if you dont have any decouplers but its still a bit of a bummer	positive

jopiek on sep 7 2008 1120 pm said the chair was just loose so it should be placed on the 2x2 plate that is also visible in the picture of the middle car thats not the one i was thinking of it was the other two chairs towards the middle of the wagon that i was thinking of if you try to seat a minifig in either of them youll quickly find that its impossible beacuse the door interferes with the figs required personal space if you move both of them one stud forward so that the back of the seat lines up with the edge of the window itll solve the problem and still leave space for a figs to be seated in the other chairs	neutral

a great review for a great set thanks for sharing it with us a like the older lego trains btw i think you need to fix this quote name jetport fire squad light and sound series	positive
a set from the golden age of lego it brings back a lot childhood memories seeing this review i was 5 and just starting to play with lego around that time i could look for hours the lego catalogs dreaming of sets like this one thanks for this wonderful review	positive
the best 12v legotrain is for me the 7740 the 7725 is still a goodlooking train and the only one with short wagons in a electric version before i started to with bricklink i started to build this train in blue ive build 4 trains of it and sold 2 of them still one for sale  you can also build this in other colors like a yellow one or you can build a black version which i made a death train of it driven by a skeleton  edited by panda9001100 17 may 2009  0801 am	positive

beach cruisers set  6445 theme island xtreme stunts year released 2002 piece count 97 minifigs 2 list price 7 usd during a trip to legoland california in 2002 their big store had a neat little display of some new sets and themes including island xtreme stunts the new theme offered great colors including orange tan and light blue which immediately caught my eye the theme focussed on island fun with some adventure and included some great figs like the brickster i had to buy at least one set choosing truck  stunts trike review coming soon at the time the theme was short lived and many of the sets were on sale at discount toy stores not too long after their initial release i picked up this set 6445 beach cruisers for 333 usd which will be my first of three island xtreme stunt reviews starting with the box a race between the street surfer and skate boarder the back shows some alternate models including a sail boat and jet ski same image on the instructions as the box but the backside shows the island xtreme stunts video game for different platforms the set includes a small decal sheet for the skateboard i love the two figs included within this set one is a hippietype with shades and leafed muscle short and the other pizza boy skateboarder check out the pizza boy on his skateboard two green brackets are included for attaching each fig to the long grey bar using this piece one can make the skateboarder do tricks and flips the street surfer vehicle is pretty nice to the sail is placed on a black bar and lance then attached to the vehicle heres a picture of the vehicle to me it has that old soap box derby look to it  like something kids would create to race down a hill the vehicle doesnt have a steering wheel but rather two levers which i think work well in the cockpit heres the underside the set has three neon orange wheels that attach to technic axle pins to attach to the vehicle lastly the entire set with a few extra pieces final thoughts while island xtreme stunts is not the best citytown subtheme esp for the traditional lego classic town fan it does have some fun sets like this little beach cruiser good figs a skateboard and a very rollable fun word equivalent to swooshable but for vehicles with wheels vehicle you can even blow on the sail to get it to roll across the floor this set is a lot of fun	neutral
great review i would buy the sets but sadly tlc doesnt sell them anymore i have one question only how can you be reviewing at this time at night i would never dream of doing that well i cant wait to see the other reviews	positive
lego12 on sep 7 2008 0805 pm said i have one question only how can you be reviewing at this time at night thanks for your comments lego12 i did this review a few weeks ago and just now posted it remember also that we are on different time zones	neutral
i had never seen these sets before in my retail stores before however i do remember the existence of its video games look like an interesting set for great outdoor enterainment and fun for lego citizens whom is out for real thrill and excitement this theme never really got me excited back then after reading your review its quite useful for some new addition to your town features such as including a skater boy holding the pizza instead of using the pizza van the high fuel cost must have caught up to them to resort using skate board for delivery as for the street surfer vehicle its a cool looking vehicle with unique construction pardon me i have not seen such design before i will actually tear off the wheels cover up the sides and used it for wind surfing thats the whole idea after giving some thoughts and weighs its factors i will have to give it a 3 for this set i will probably get it if its on sales once again brickster this is a lovely review which has showed us a new perspective of island xtreme stunts	neutral
like whitefang i too only remember this line in computer game form i used to love that game i actually have never seen a review for an xtreme stunts set so this was nice to see as for the set i think it looks pretty good i really like the hippie guy the windboard thing is nice as well but looks a bit strange somehow i give this set a solid 3 out of 5 thanks for the nice review edited by erdbeereis1 08 september 2008  0405 am	positive
nice review i got this set not long after my ending of the dark ages it was even then already on slae for just 5 euro i like the figs and the vehicles it were some of my first orange pieces the hippie guy is called  snap lockit and the pizza guy is called  pepper roni i think the legodesigners had a cosy evening with much beer when they thought about the names i think this line was the only line which was made first as computergame and after that as a real line instead of the other computergames based on already existing lines	neutral
her name was sky lane its quite sad though to actually play the gamethe xtreme tower is the only set that made it into the game itself and it was a really watered down version of the information center from the first two games but the island was in the game filled with incredible buildings that would have made really cool sets	negative
nice review is that one minifig breaking out of prison just wondering about his clothing the worst thing is the name anything with xtreme in the title almost deserves the lowest score possible on principle	negative
thanks for the review i loved this theme it had some of the greatest pieces ever arranged in any theme brilliant printed parts and figures and some good colours snap lockitt hippie dude  is a great figure with a cool name i own him from another set but unfortunately not this one it looks like a very good set no stickers and good printed parts too nice review pencoin on sep 9 2008 0521 pm said hippie dude thats snap lockitt island xtreme is one of the best themes ever im trying to get the sets off bricklink thanks fo the review i need this now hahaha that made me laugh for some reason i dont know why though i agree with it	neutral

this is a really nice small set i think it fascinates me that those are actual printed parts thats something we dont see too often anymore the figures are very good although i must say i like the name hippie dude better than snap lockitt does anyone know why the brickster has one blue hand thanks for the great review edited by erdbeereis1 09 september 2008  0645 pm	positive
i knew this set looked familiar thank you brickster for bringing one of my first lego sets ever back to my memory unfortunately i dont have many of the pieces left but thank you	neutral
hello all eurobricks members and town lovers today i will be doing up a review on glade runner set this is a very small set which is slightly bigger than the current impulse set its part of the race theme which involved in land and sea racers back in the early 1990s i just love these orignal race themes which is produced back then name glade runner theme lego system  town  race year 1993 pieces 29 minifigs 1 price usd325 an image of a 6513 glade runner swamp race shall begins this glade runner is pretty nice looking with its sleek sports look well for a glade runner in the water it certainly looks much impressive somehow i felt that the 6513 is aligned with the 6514 trail ranger i always had that perception that both vehicles are brothers and was released under the same year in fact glade runner was released in 1993 based on peeron information i always felt that this set is used for investigators or police to used for tracking or search purposes in the swamp areas instead of using it for a race i will place this set in the jungle somewhere like bricksters jungle settings although it looks too bright for such serious agenda but i think its pretty useful to use it this way they can rent it from the nearby shop and used it to search it kind of reminded me of the movie us marshals which acted by tommy lee jones and wesley snipes meet the ace please pardon his trousers i did not bleach it earlier it was caused overtime without adequate caring to the minfig look at this great article on how to protect your lego the driver wears a green vest with patch pockets on both sides this is my favourite design during that period it comes with a yellow lifevest too as for the 1x4 printed tile with 3 stars shining in front of the runner its a very nice printed tile that can be used for other racing purposes in other sets as well overall design the built is very simple and yet so realistic making use of the aeroplane tailhead to add as the holder for the rotor is smart the white bricks acting as a platform for both sides to hold the driver to sit onto the centre with the steering wheel at the front i am very happy with this design place the glade runner in front of the fan with a reasonable fan speed you will see the rotor runs like a charm different angles of the vehicle close encounter with the swamp sharks coined by brickster see you later to conclude this is a very nice little set that can provide much fun i dont really used it to race in the waters instead i leave it to my imagination and used it for police investigation purposes such as air crash excerise search and rescue operations and etc i think it can provides quite a fun loving experience although the set might not be very appealing to some people but i find it very fun to play around and is one of my favourite sets in the 1990s where i placed it with my 6514 trail ranger together summary review playability 8510 i leave it to your imagnination design 910 very simple yet realistic design price 1010 a very inexpensive set great way to buy such small sets at a low price overall 8510 glade runner is not common in town and city theme its not a must to have it but if you ever come across it do get it i gave it a 4 based on my review score card what about yours hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine comments and critics are strongly welcomed pictures can be found in my brickshelf when moderated	positive
thanks for the nice review whitefang i quite like this set the front looks a bit bare but for a small set like this it doesnt really matter this set gets a 4 from me as well	positive
nice review white fang this really reminds me of an allamerican set with its red white and blue colors and the white stars although i really like the fig with its scruffy bearded face i find the green torso a bit odd for this set i suppose i would expect some sort of redblue racer fig with a whiteblue racing helmet swamp sharks  too funny  you always add a nice addition of humor to your reviews now im going to check out some wonder woman clips on youtube	positive
one of my favourite sets me and couple of buddies got this set back then the fig was so cool sun glasses fast boat	positive
i love the classic sets of that era and a great review helps show off the simplicity of some older sets	positive
yeah the name on this set is strange i think all the boxes say garbage truck i guess its up to each builder to decide whether 1x1 round plates are recyclable material or not its a great model in any case i love these highly detailed city trucks weve been getting during the last year or two i used to have a preference for the late 80searly 90s city line but some of these new sets have really surpassed them in detail and functionality	positive
nice truck indeed but the yellow one is better i think at least if you put them on a roadplate it seems to me that those road plates are too small for that also it will not empty completely because of that panel well for the rest it is a nice set and a fine review	positive
trop beau	positive
erdbeereis1 on sep 10 2008 0538 pm said actually it does the back part of the truck with the panel hinges up so that when you want the truck to dump it doesnt get in the way i should have taken a better look at the one my brother has  it still is a nice truck much better than all the strange sets that were release those dark ages before	positive
a good set with a nice color scheme i still prefer the last one that had a removable bin	positive
what a great set and a very nice review erdbeereis i think the only improvement to this set would have been the use of chrome exhaust pipes and front grill i bought this set with a lot of excitement but unfortunately have not put it together yet what are your thoughts on these larger 6stud wide detailed vehicles as opposed to 4stud wide classics heres an image of 6668 recycle truck released in 1992 ps i like the use of taking out sponge bob in your review	positive
this looks like a great set and im happy you were dumping spongebob he deserves that this set looks very nice and if i see it i will probably pick it up	positive

thanks for this review i really love this set its perfect for my town and brings a sense of classic when i see it	positive
thanks for the review this is one of the few city sets that i own despite loving the theme so much most of my town is either custom or classic and its about as beautiful as a big garbage truck can ever be quote nice truck indeed but the yellow one is better i think at least if you put them on a roadplate it seems to me that those road plates are too small for that also it will not empty completely because of that panel well for the rest it is a nice set and a fine review well the truck barely fits onto the old roadplates not on curves though so if you put it in a display it probably wont look bad i think from what i see this and all the other 6 wide vehicles will fit much better on the newer roadplates which are four studs wider than the old ones	positive
hi i bought this set a while ago and have since remodeled it into a larger 8 wide truck now it can hold a driver and passenger its kind of boxy i may redesign it in the future	neutral
thats a really nice mod badsneaker the added bulk serves it well	positive
that looks like one of those big strange recycle trucks from new york city i like it	positive
i like this set but i cant give it a good grade for playability as the rearmost hinging section is too stiffly hinged so when you open it its likely to break if you hold it just over the shovel and broom my truck thus has that function and with it of course the whole container tipping disabled i also moved the cab a bit forward and the front axle rearward to give the cab the typical garbage truck look as they are often very low slung this also created space behind the cab for some equipment	negative
metalandi on sep 20 2008 0337 pm said that looks like one of those big strange recycle trucks from new york city i like it thanks guys its nice to see other people modding the existing design too	neutral
it would be cool if someone made a moc in which hippies steal the truck and cover it with flowers and bright colors and stuff	neutral
