These are my only space base plates from Classic Space. Actually, with only 2 plates, I could not do much serious expansion with it. Instead, I merged it with my old city baseplates, and used it as a docking station for scientific purposes or restricted facilities that is guarded by the police. These baseplates are very useful and is suited for creating a space command center, up in the space.  	positive
These plates are great in setting up your space base and giving your ships a place to land. My favorite, though, is the lunar crater plate, which I use to death in my comic. :)	positive

CP5670, on Jul 8 2008, 05:04 AM, said: These are pretty good, but I think they look too much like the standard town roads from that period. I like the black space plates from the early 90s better (6710). Oh how I love these plates. Afew years ago I found a local retail store with about 6-7 sets of these in their basement warehouse I was given special access to (along with MANY other old space goodies.. hehe..) I love the things, I have loads, and I've used them for multiple space bases and battles. Along with afew grey crater plates and the large grey plates (1.5x the size of a normal baseplate) you can get quite a monorail layout going. *sigh* I should really clean up and get one set up again, so I can take some pictures!	positive

Wow, nice. You probably have enough to make that scene on the box picture. I got one pack off ebay a while ago and have another octagon plate from the Blacktron 6988 base. I'm building my carrier MOC around one but don't have anything planned for the others. These baseplates are still relatively common on ebay for their age. I see MISB packs on there every few weeks and they tend to sell for around $20. The older kind (in the OP) are much harder to come by. Edited by CP5670, 09 July 2008 - 10:18 PM.	neutral

Year Released: 1976 Piece Count: 53 Minifigs: 2 LEGO brought out floating boats quite early, and in many ways the first were the best. (I'll explain why later...) This set in particular is interesting as it came out in two versions; one that includes the first minifigs and another that included the non-armless type. (Set 709.) The police signs are stickers, and are in surprisingly good condition considering the age of the set. (I am missing one sticker on the front though.) Note the Technic Bush and Axel; they are the old type. The position of the second figure is not a mistake; I think he's supposed to be sitting down.... The first boats out by LEGO needed a weighted keel to prevent them.... keeling over. (I have tested this!) I suspect this is because of the density of the old hulls and the flat bottom... but I could be wrong. (It can't be just because of the flat bottom as the new cargo ship doesn't need one.) The keel in detail. The bottom extension is for a motor. (Not included, nor made by LEGO at the time.) The keel had longer studs. Even now it holds extra firmly. This is why I prefer the old design. You can extend or shorten the hulls as you please, or even insert other LEGO in the middle. You can easily add wheels or any other piece to the bottom of these hulls. I wish they would go back to this idea; the 4+ hulls were of this concept but were too wide. (Probably so the keel wasn't needed.) The old minifigs aside from having odd feet and no arms had a normal stud as the neck. Thus when you turn the head it tends to come off. I love this set!	negative
Great review Sinner. I own the later version, 709 released in 1977. Mine no longer has decals though. The variations were minimal. It looks like your boat is in really good shape considering it's >30 years old. Excellent review!	positive

Nice review Sinner! The old sets... I donÂ´t know - every old set, especially equipped with the old non-moveable arms minifigs look very odd nowadays. I agree with you with the hull shape and its possibility to be extended, but every other aspect, the lack of detail, the keel itself (you canÂ´t float it in shallow water) keeps me from rating it higher than 3/10. In my opninion the best police boat so far is 4021 *click to enlarge*	negative
I love those minifigs, they'd go for alot on ebay I bet. Great boat as well, I love the old hull design.	positive
This set showed what potential variations on the standard brick had back then. I think that TLG was still finding its legs back then and learning new things so this is a solid set for the year it was released. Nice review Sinner.	positive
LOL! I can't help but smile everytime I see the quote on this thread..... don't worry these police are armless! LOL	negative
well what to say? i got this boat late 70s, when we were on our way to Italy to spend the holidays there. My parents always needed to keep my quiet during the 3-day trip, and the best way to do that was to buy me a lego set... I got this one in a gas station in Germany. As far as I remember Italy didn't have lego sets, so a gas station close to the Italian border but still in Germany or Austria was very often their last chance. I often saw large quantities of lego sets in those gas stations though... i remember seeing yellow castle and... the galaxy explorer, standing on a shelf. It would be my birthday 1-3 week(s) later so i always made sure they knew what to buy for me...	positive

So, you've been bitten by the classic bug too, Sinner. Great review; but one would think arms would come in handy (pun intended) when you are a police officer, right? It's a shame that many of the original figs must now be forced to stand looking like they have their hands in their pockets, eh? I have no idea where I was going with that last sentence...	neutral
Great Review Mariko! This set is way before my time too. I like how LEGO used to create simple one story houses instead of the really tall house that we see in today's Town Theme, such as 8403 City House. One story houses such as 345 just look more realistic to my eyes. The simplistic, minimalism vibe that I get with this set is something that is hard to find in today's much more detailed sets (although, trust me, I love love love today's detailed sets). - The Brick is Epic	positive

i guess it's easiest to put the entire shield on a transparent sticker and cut the edges. i would also do that with the white stickers, because now you can still see the gray edges of the shield.

Theme: Hobby Sets Set name: Harley-Davidson 1000cc Set Number: 394 Price (new): 260-280 $, 185-200 Euro Price (used): 14-175 $, 10-125 Euro Pieces: 143 Year of release: 1976 Links: Peeron, Bricklink and Brickset Looking at the release date of this set makes me remember the good old times when LEGO sets stayed in production and could be found in stores for long years. Yes, I hear you younger FOLs say this meant we had less variety at the time, but at least we did not have to go on a frenzy to get them all in just 1 or 2 years before they disappeared (to re-appear on the secondary market at crazy prices). Anyway, I also realise this set is older than me by 5 years (at least the first boxes of this set). I think my parents bought it when I was something like 1/2 year old, or even before, as my Father really liked the Hobby Set line and took any chance to get one, you know, for the kids, when theyâ€™ll be old enough to play with themâ€¦ I am really happy my Father did it, too. As a matter of fact, this has always been one of my favourite non-minifigure scale sets. I know younger eyes will look on it and wonder how we could love and enjoy a model like this, so blocky and rough. Just remember this was the best TLG designers could do with the bricks available at the time. Enough about memories; letâ€™s start with the review! The Box Front The front of the box (here cut and folded to save space) shows the Harley Davidson 1000cc in all its glory upon a nice town landscape. I really appreciate how TLG box designers used a real life photo of the model in a real life environment to give this Hobby Set a better background. Moreover, the landscape does not distract the eye, even with its lights, since the focus is strongly set on the motorbike itself. Back (and sides) The back of the box shows the model on a more neutral background and from another angle. We can see the stickers in place (take a good look at them here, because I did not apply them). The right side we also see a pic of the set from the front, and one with a child playing with it. In this latter shot, the model rests upon a nice black box with a Harley Davidson sign on it. I frankly do not remember if this was some sort of tray or smaller box within the LEGO one or if it is meant for publicity only. Another thing we can notice on the right-most side of the box is a white band, right below the LEGO logo, sporting the sign â€˜Designed for experienced LEGO buildersâ€™ in various languages. All in all, a really well done and professional job. Contents Inside This set includes a number of parts in mainly Black, White and Light Grey. Some Blue and Yellow add nice touches of colour to the total. The partsâ€™ selection is not mind-blowing, as most of the pieces had been in production, in these same colours for years. Anyway, Iâ€™d like to focus on a couple of details: The Milky White Technic axles as well as the Red Technic Bush Old 2 are among my favourite parts. The bushes, in particular, are quite useful to build more sturdy looking tubes than what can be achieved with the newer and slimmer ones. It would seem that the tile pieces appeared in the â€˜without groveâ€™ version as a standard and in the â€˜with groveâ€™ version as alternates (see Bricklink inventory). Notice, though that the box (above) and instructionsâ€™ (below) pictures all show the â€˜with groveâ€™ variety. As said, there are no re-coloured parts in this set. New pieces The few new molds used in this set are: Black and White Slope, Inverted 45 2 x 2 Old Type with Round Bottom Tube, Black Technic, Brick 1 x 2 with Hole Type II and Red Hinge Plate 2 x 4 with Articulated Joint â€“ Male and Female. The most interesting piece from this lot, as many of you will have noticed is the Technic, Brick 1 x 2 with Hole Type II. This kind of technic brick was use during 1976 and 1977 only. It would seem TLG tried a new design variant, which did not meet success and was later replaced with the standard bricks again. Nonetheless, Iâ€™m sure that people who own these bricks like them for the unusual design and the possibilities they offer into adding details to their creations. Instructions Cover â€“ As usual, the instructions are not organised in the form of a booklet, but they consist of a folded double printed sheet. The â€˜coverâ€™ shows again the same shot as the front of the box, with bigger LEGO logo and set number and without the other additional information. â€˜Back coverâ€™ â€“ Here we see the full name of the set: Harley-Davidson FLH 1200. This makes me wonder: why is this set known as 394 Harley Davidson 1000cc when it is indeed a 1200cc? Anyway, what really makes me love this page is the list of stats below the photo, and in particular these two lines: H.P. (?)/(not given). This calls for just one question: why did Harley-Davidson not release this info? My opinion is that since this is a motorbike built for the Police, they did not have permission to share the specifications on the motor, which was probably customised either by Harley-Davidson upon request or by the Police themselves. â€˜Random pageâ€™ â€“ As expected, no call-outs here, but the build is pretty straight forward and does not need them (apart for one passage weâ€™ll see later). The colours are easy to tell apart (in the end there is no Dark Grey in this set that could be confused with Black). Again, notice how the instructions include the â€˜with groveâ€™ tiles and not the older ones. Maybe this was changed during the long time this set stayed in production? The â€˜last pageâ€™ shows other four models included in the Hobby Set line. Unfortunately, I own only one of them: the 396 Thatcher Perkins Locomotive. Indeed, I would have liked to have them all! Building Start The handle bars look a bit too squared to me, but itâ€™s just a minor feature, and the overall shape is still good in my opinion. Notice the red hinge plate, which will be almost totally hidden in the finished model (see below), and the blue tiles which work as indicators. The first steps, used to build the front wheel and windshield are really easy, until you get to the wheel. In facts, the instructions do not show clearly all the pieces needed for it, and I found myself with a â€˜floatingâ€™ wheel for the absence of one of the Red Technic Bush Old 2 on one side (the one not visible on the instructions, of course). Not a big deal, but something that could have been done better. Motor and seat The second part of the build includes the motor, seat and â€˜saddle bagsâ€™. The technique used for the motor, or better the radiator, is very clever. To get the ridged feel, TLG designers used 4 Light Grey plates stuck one on the other but not completely in contact. This way, the studs, while keeping the plates in position, keep them raised from one another at the same time. The Yellow round bricks add some details and colour touches to this predominantly Light Grey parts of the vehicle. The use of the Engine, Smooth Small, 1 x 2 Side Plates for the exhaust pipes, while quite clever, still looks a bit strange to me. Iâ€™m mostly used to see them in airplanes, helicopters and spaceships. â€˜Saddle-bagsâ€™, a simple build for one of the iconic parts of this motorcycle. Here you see them in place, as well as get a look at the finished seat. I like how LEGO designers managed to make its shape with just a few quite big bricks. The â€˜saddle bagsâ€™ are a really nice touch, and they work perfectly when compared to the original. This is the rear wheel. As said before, only when you get to this passage in the instruction you get a real understanding of how the front wheel is supposed to be mounted as well. Careful readers will notice how this is not one of the original wheels in this set. The original ones were mounted using the Technic, Gear Expert Builder 9 Tooth. Unfortunately, I could only find one of them in my collection, an itâ€™s used as the front wheel. By adding the rear wheel (which is shown from a better angle in the instructions), we complete the model. Notice how the two technic bricks supporting the wheel are held in position by two 2x1 plates. I think this was a bad case of â€˜building by compartmentsâ€™ mentality: if TLG designers had considered this a bit more, they would have used 2 4x1 plates instead of 4 2x1. On the other hand, this is not the worst case I have seen in a LEGO set, and they keep up the tradition nowadays too. Finished set Front And here it is our fancy Police Harley-Davidson! Indeed, the front looks blocky and quite horrible to our eyes, but again, it was almost the best that could be done at the time. I only wish they had made it a little less bulky, even though this build is clearly thought to give better stability to the wheel. The Blue tiles work nicely to emphasise the indicators, the slightly unsightly red plate is normally covered by the plate sticker and the windshield, albeit being hard to see through, is nicely shaped. Back The back side is less detailed than the front, but shows the red light and antenna which are typical of the Police motorbikes from this period. How many times have we seen this angle in the chase scenes from TV shows like â€œCHiPsâ€? Side All in all, this model looks pretty sturdy (apart for the antenna, which falls off all too easily) and detailed, especially considering the limited variety of parts available and used at the time. They even got so far to put a 2x2 tile as kick-stand to display it without fear of it falling on the sides! Bonus images Size comparison? What I never understood about this set is what scale it is meant to be. I mean, it is clearly not minifig-scale, and it could not be technic-fig-scale (those came later). But it is not even Miniland scale! Moreover, the only other model with the same scale is the other Hobby Set motorbike, as the cars have a scale of their own and the Thatcher uses still another one! Final comments Overall, this is a great set for collectors of old models and motorbike fans, or both. It does not sport a huge variety of bricks, but was a good choice at the time, and even if the result is matter-of-fact blocky when compared to the original, it implements some good solutions to minimise the LEGO brick appearance and maximise the similarity as much as possible. Design & Colour scheme â€“ 9/10 (The design is as accurate as possible, apart for the front mudguard maybe, and the colours are completely in line for a Police vehicle. The solutions and details included in this set justify the â€˜Expert buildersâ€™ label and add to the appearance, and, why not, playability of the model.) Parts - 8/10 (Not a huge selection, and very few new molds. Nonetheless, a good source of Black and White standard parts for MOCs and one of the few sources for the extra rare Technic, Brick 1 x 2 with Hole Type II pieces.) Playability - 9/10 (A sturdy model which can take some serious play and swoosh-ing without falling apart. The easily detachable antenna and the lack of an appropriate scale interaction with most other models make it lose one point, though.) Build - 7/10 (Pretty straight forward, with few nice solutions and an already mentioned slightly obscure passage in the instructions.) Price - 5/10 (Like most older models, especially the Hobby Set and Model Team ones, this set can be found at reasonable prices only rarely. Most of the times, people are asked shameful prices for such a smallish set.) Overall: 8/10 Very good. As always, questions, comments, and pic requests welcome!

Great job on this review of a unique and rare set LuxorV! Considering the year it was released, this must have been a cool set back then. Even up to now with all the specialized pieces and advanced building techniques, I could still appreciate the beauty of this brickbuilt Harley-Davidson police motorbike. The various elements are instantly recognizable and it even has the unusual 'partly-stacked' plates technique for the motor. Overall, I'd say this is an above average set that is a must-have for any hardcore LEGO collector.	positive

LuxorV, this is a well written presentation on this LEGO Vintage review. I never knew the existence of this set and even though the design is not part of the modern LEGO design concept but the overall appeal back in the 1970s certainly appeal to many. I could not mind to own such vintage LEGO model and put them on display and potray as if it was a chart of evolution of LEGO motorbikes. Thanks for sharing and I can't wait to find out your next review.	positive

Theme: Hobby Sets Set name: Thatcher Perkins Locomotive Set Number: 396 Price (new): 369-450 $, 258-314 Euro Price (used): 100-355 $, 45-250 Euro Pieces: 434 Year of release: 1976 Links: Peeron, Bricklink and Brickset My Father assures me this is the very first LEGO set I ever got. In facts, he gave it to me as a present for my first half year. Of course, that is to say he bought it for himself and used me as the official excuse! When I grew up, at first I found it to be quite boring: no minifigures, limited play features; in the end, it was just a locomotive! It soon went to forgotten-land. Then, when I was about 10 years old, I one day found again the instructionsâ€™ â€˜bookletâ€™ and saw this bright coloured big steam engine, and I suddenly wanted to build it again. It would seem I finally got to the right age (at least for me) to appreciate the design of this great set. But enough about memories; letâ€™s start with the review! The Box Front The front of the box (here cut and folded to save space) shows the Thatcher Perkins Locomotive in all its glory upon a nice countryside landscape. I really appreciate how TLG box designers used a real life environment made of sand, gravel and pebbles to give this Hobby Set a better background. Moreover, the landscape does not distract the eye, since the focus is strongly set on the locomotive itself. The box measures about 39.5 x 24.5 x 5.5 centimetres, or 15.56 x 9.65 x 2.17 inches. This is more or less the size of the 4840 - The Burrow, or the Advent Calendars. Back (and sides) The back of the box shows the model on a more neutral background and from another angle. We can see the stickers in place (take a good look at them here, because I did not apply them). The right side we also see a pic of the set from the (3/4) back, and one with a child playing with it. In this latter shot, the model rests upon a nice black box with a Thatcher Perkins sign on it. Unlike the Harley Davidson 1000cc set, the Thatcher Perkins does not have the sign â€˜Designed for experienced LEGO buildersâ€™ for some reason. Contents Inside This set includes a large number of parts, mainly Black, Blue and Red, with some nice Yellow to lighten it up more. Parts of interest The partsâ€™ selection is not exceptional, but weâ€™ll see this set includes some unique pieces which have not been in LEGO sets for long years since the 1980s, like the very nice Black Plate, Modified 1 x 2 with Steam Engine Cylinder, Flat Surfaces, Black Train Wheel Spoked for Motor and the Red Train Steam Drive Rod Holder - Train Steam Drive Rod group. The Wheel Spoked Large, as beautiful as they were, saw the light from the production line for the last time in 1976! The only new mold used in this set is the Black and Blue Slope, Inverted 45 2 x 2 Old Type with Round Bottom Tube. As you can see in the above picture, this locomotive was designed to work (well, be played with) on all kind of surfaces, so the wheels sport tyres. In this picture you can see how they look without the tyres. Of course, builders can use the Thatcher Perkins on their brick-built tracks. Another group of interesting parts are shown in this pic: Red Wheel Spoked 2 x 2 with Stud (and tyre), Black Brick, Modified 2 x 4 with Wheels Holder Old, Clear Bottom and Yellow Minifig, Head (Plain) - Stud Solid. Many newer fans will not be familiar with the last two parts: they were standard fare in a number of sets between the 1960s and early 1990s, but then (unfortunately) they were taken out of production. To be fair, the replacement of the Black Brick, Modified 2 x 4 with Wheels Holder Old, Clear Bottom with the standard technic parts was probably due to the fact that the metal pin used to connect the wheels to these bricks had a shameful tendency at getting off the wheel. Too bad it could not be fixed and these parts kept in production. For those interested, here is a picture of the DSS, courtesy of Peeron. Instructions Cover â€“ As usual, the instructions are not organised in the form of a booklet, but they consist of a folded double printed sheet. The â€˜coverâ€™ shows again the same shot as the front of the box. â€˜Back coverâ€™ â€“ Here we see the name of the set and some additional information, like the year when the first Thatcher Perkins started working (1863) and the type (4-6-0) of this locomotive, which, as shown in the image, is related to the number and position of the wheels. On a side note, the pencil signs on the sides of the sheet were made by my Father while counting the parts in the set. â€˜Random pageâ€™ â€“ As expected, no call-outs here, but the build is pretty straight forward and does not need them. The colours are easy to tell apart. Full page â€“ As you may have noticed, all the building steps are drawn on one side of the â€˜bookletâ€™, making it more properly an instructionsâ€™ sheet. What really makes this â€˜instruction bookletâ€™ stand out in my eyes is the fact that it is indeed a poster: the building steps are all on one side, while the other is a bigger image of the completed set with the name Thatcher Perkins in yellow enclosed in an old styled red tag. Building Start The build starts with the base of the locomotive, putting the 10 wheels in place and strengthening the engine. Notice the use of this â€˜illegalâ€™ technique to build the bumpers. LEGO, as we all know can be a tricky medium to build with, and some details need special solutions to be completed. We then start building the boiler and cabin. Going up fast and steady! In the penultimate step, we build the chimney and cow catcher. Iâ€™d like to spend a few more words on the chimney and how it is attached to the main body. As you can see in the left picture, the 3x3 base of the chimney is asymmetrical, with a 3x2 base on one side and a combination of a 1x2 and a 1x1 plates on the other. In the right picture, you see the top of the main body where the chimney will be attached; it is made of a 1x2 base and 1 1x2 tile. Using another â€˜illegalâ€™ technique (or at least one LEGO designers do not like much nowadays), the holes of the 3x2 plate of the chimney will connect with the studs of the 1x2 plate on the main body, giving a well centred and quite sturdy build. Finished set Front The front of the model sports 3 big headlights, a nice cow catcher and the nicely detailed engine front. I can almost hear it whistle! Side And here it is our good old Thatcher Perkins Locomotive! Indeed, it looks like a classic and powerful engine form one of those Spaghetti Western films, doesnâ€™t it? What I found strange in the beginning is the choice of colours (I was convinced steam engines were all black, at the time). Then I checked some pictures of the original, and I must admit the resemblance is almost perfect! Back The back side is less detailed than the front, with cabin almost devoid of details. I think LEGO could have done a better job on it. 3/4 Front and â€¦ Just see how good it looks from this angle, with all the tubing, moving parts and the lovely 3 headlights! â€¦ 3/4 Back The back view is not as impressive, but grants us a good look at the big posterior wheels and the bumpers. Bonus images Size comparison? As I stated elsewhere, I never understood what scale these Hobby Sets are meant to be. They are clearly not minifig-scale, and they are not technic-fig-scale either. But they are not even Miniland scale! Moreover, they use different scales between locomotives, cars and motorbikes amongst the Hobby Set line! As I said before, the set comes with tyres on the wheels to allow a wider playing experience, not limiting this model to tracks. Nonetheless, builders can assemble their own track (maybe using the vintage blue 4.5V tracks) and make the Thatcher Perkins run its proper environment. Final comments Overall, this is a great set for collectors of old models and steam engines fans, or both. It does not sport a huge variety of bricks, but was a good choice at the time, and even if the result is matter-of-fact a bit blocky when compared to the original, it implements some good solutions to minimise the LEGO brick appearance and maximise the similarity as much as possible. Design & Colour scheme â€“ 8/10 (The design is as accurate as possible, and the colours are completely in line for the Thatcher Perkins Locomotive. The solutions and details included in this set justify the â€˜Expert buildersâ€™ label and add to the appearance, and, why not, playability of the model. Though, I still wish TLG had included more details in the cabin.) Parts - 10/10 (Quite a big selection, but only one new mould. Nonetheless, a good source of Black, Blue and Red standard parts for MOCs and one of the few sources for the extra rare Black Plate, Modified 1 x 2 with Steam Engine Cylinder, Flat Surfaces, Black Train Wheel Spoked for Motor, Red Train Steam Drive Rod Holder - Train Steam Drive Rod group and Wheel Spoked Large.) Playability - 9/10 (A sturdy model which can take some serious play and swoosh-ing without falling apart. The somewhat easily detachable chimney and the lack of an appropriate scale interaction with most other models make it lose one point, though.) Build - 7/10 (Pretty straight forward, with few nice solutions.) Price - 5/10 (Like most older models, especially the Hobby Set and Model Team ones, this set can only rarely be found at reasonable prices. Most of the times, people are asked shameful prices for such a smallish set.) Overall: 8/10 Very good. More pictures can be found in this Brickshelf gallery. As always, questions, comments, and pic requests welcome! Edited by Rufus, 10 July 2011 - 07:05 PM. Indexed	positive
Thanks for the review 'LuxorV', an interesting old set, though I find it hard to imagine a square smoke stack instead of roundish. It truly has that classic Lego simplistic build with all studs showing and making do with standard partsm except the few you havepointed out 'LuxorV'. A nice flashback 35 years ago....now thats old school anyway Brick On everyone !	positive

Excellent review BTW, it's always a pleasure getting a closer look at these classic sets which I wouldn't have known to exist had I not seen this review. Overall I think it's a really good set at that time, of course judging this one by modern standards won't be fair but at the time I'm pretty sure it was a 'cool' set to have (though less cooler than having the Harley Davidson set). Thanks Kiel. I can grant you that's the same old one I got as my first set.

Thanks for the great nostalgic review! Great pictures, I love the shiny glow of 37 year old bricks! Sets were simpler back then, but not less exciting in their own way. I wasn't even born in 1973, but one of my first sets was the 1982 update of this, 6630 Bucket Loader. Almost 10 years later, but the very same bucket assembly, only the colours have changed.	positive
Ah, the good old days........Thanks for the review 'Yoshi648' - CUTE and COOL at the same time. It's interesting to see that the same front end parts had been used from the early 70's up in to the late 90's ! Nice again to step back in time and keep on bricking everyone !	positive
I voted 'Outstanding.' Regarding this set, I found mine at a consignment store. It was inside of a larger set from the same time period.	positive
It's simply amazing how far Lego has come in 30 years.	positive
and again those tears in my eyes. with original box...! I really love those classic space stuff. Looks like I need to clean my stuff this summer.	positive
this was my first space set ever!! 1979, 1980... don't know anymore, but i do remember i got this together with 897 for my birthday when we where camping... with a little luck i may even have an old film from my dad, opening the boxes... well what to say... it looked soooooo aggressive with those two engines! but i never knew why you needed two steering wheels on it... they probably just thought a symmetrical model was better .... i can't blame them... what a nice set.... it would even sell today, no doubt... looooots of swooshability...	positive
Nice!!! 442 is the lowest set number I have seen for any Classic Space set, so it must been released with the first wave in 1978. Its remarkable that a LEGO spaceship this old and small can seat more figs than the much bigger MX-71 Recon Dropship of today. Anyway, I just want to grab it out of the screen and swoosh it all over the place, lol. TLG, please make these Classic Space sets again! I promise I'll buy many!	positive
INDEXED Everyone remembers their first time. For me, it was in 19*cough*somethingsomething*cough*. We were at her house, and her mother was gone for at least an hour. She slowly unzi... uhhh. Sorry, wrong story. Um, yeahh. Anyway, I do remember my first time. It was 1977, in late summer. Our neighbor, who worked for a department store called Famous-Bahr, said that the main store had a travelling LEGO display. So my family filed into the car and drove into downtown St Louis to see this display. To tell you the truth, I don't remember much about the display itself, but I DO remember that my parents bought me my first LEGO set. Set # 456, the Spirit of St Louis. Set #: 456 (also sold as Set # 661) Name: Spirit of St Louis Theme: LEGOLAND / Large Vehicle Year: 1977 Pieces: 49 Minifigs: 0 Price: $5.00 USD? (Bricklink MISB start @ $175.00 USD, Used Complete ~$35.00 USD) Links: Peeron, Bricklink, Brickset Packaging Box Front: The original box that my set came in was most likely trashed 5 minutes after returning home. This image was lovingly stolen off of the Peeron page for this set. I feel lucky that I even got this much. Similarly, I have no pictures of the plastic baggies the set came in. Truth be told, I can't be sure that there even WERE plastic baggies that the parts came in. THE SET Side View: Well there she is. My first set ever . Actually, I seem to recall the real Spirit of St Louis was silver colored, not Black and Yellow. If you need a history lesson, the Spirit of St Louis was Charles Lindbergh's plane when he made the first trans-Atlantic solo flight. More details can be found on the Wikipedia page. The overall shape is pretty close, at least. The cockpit window could stand to be moved forward one stud, but everything seems to be relatively close. The tail piece isn't the right shape, but it is likely the only tail piece LEGO produced at the time. If you look closely, you can see the various bite marks that my brother and I inflicted over the years. I know some people would be aghast that there are bite marks, but brick separators wouldn't come out for another 10 years. Besides, we were young. We didn't know any better. I certainly had no idea that it would become my obsession. There are some interesting part choices here. Everything is brick and plate built, as you might expect. The same set nowadays would have lots of slope, wedges and wedge plates to round things out. But LEGO was all about the brick in '77, so bricks are what we got. The black inverted slopes worked pretty well asthetically as the wing struts. The wings are simple 4 x 10 plates, nice and square. There were no minifigs in this set. If I remember correctly, 1977 was just about the time when minifigs made their first appearance. I know I have one other set from '77 that does include a minifg, at least. I don't have a lot of comments for the following photos. I'll let the pictures speak for themselves. 3/4 View Back Back 3/4 Top Front PARTS Interesting Pieces I have no idea if there were any extra pieces that came with this set. I kind of doubt it. Instead I took a photo of some of the interesting parts to the model. That translucent white piece didn't photograph so well, but it is a Technic Axle 8. That's right, sets from 1977 contained Technic elements. The two black parts are the forerunners to the 1 x 2 Technic Brick, as well. Everytime I hear someone on the forums complain about Technic elements in system sets, I think back to this set. The round brick is special as well. Here is a closer view of it, complete with bite marks . Round Brick As you can see, the stud is closed. It is only one of two closed stud 1 x 1 Round Bricks that I own. They stopped appearing in sets in 1981, for those that are interested. The DSS You thought you were going to escape this heading, didn't you? Surprise! Yes, even in 1977 LEGO sets had stickers. The oldest printed elements I can remember were in the Classic Space sets that started in 1979. Again, when people in the forums complain about DSS in sets, I can only help think of this set. And chuckle to myself maniacally. The sticker has held up really well considering it's been stuck on the brick for 32 years. No discoloration, very little curling. I think if all stickers held up this well over time, there would be less DSS complaints. THE RATINGS Playability: 6/10 - The set is quite swooshable, and the propellor spins. Outside of that, though... Minifigs: N/A Design: 6/10 - The overall shape is quite good, especially given the era. The color choice leaves a lot to be desired. Price: 1/10 - It's been retired for 30 years. It's going to cost you to get your hands on it. Overall: 13/30 - This set is for true collectors only. I can't imagine anyone wanting one because they want to play with it. It was a great set back in the day, but the design feels REALLY dated. And if you're wondering, mine is NOT for sale. Ever. All the photos, plus more, can be found in the Gallery.	neutral
Very brave to give an impression about one of the oldest sets ever reviewed! A lot members here are younger than the set itself. I think you will have to have grown up with it to like it. Nowadays we have seen quite a few better airplanes than that one, for example this years 7643 . But thanks for letting us know. Btw., the 1x1 round brick with the solid stud is no. 3062a instead of 3062b (with the hollow stud).	positive

Outstanding review of a very special set! I actually remember seeing this set on the store shelves of local department stores. Can you believe it? Fantastic review Walter. I really enjoy looking at these vintage sets. This one deserves a BLOG!	positive
In 1977, trans or yellow slopes existed already, and using them would have made the plane more realistic. A third rear wheel would have enhanced playability and design, rather than this ugly black round brick. It's the reason why I voted "below average" even considering 1977's standards. However this set is nice and simple, offering good playability.	negative
daoudbazaar, on Jul 15 2009, 05:26 PM, said: [...] There is no 45Â° slope in the original plane design ... and no front cockpit window. [...] Except that it wouldn't have been the Spirit Of St Louis. Oooops, you're completely right, the Spirit Of St-Louis didn't have any front window nor rear wheel. Anyway, I think a standard Ryan M-1/M-2 plane would have been a better choice. Less a legend, but more a flexible plan for multiple uses!	negative

Hey EB'ers, i got my Market Street on Monday and finished building it last night. I know it?s not such a nice review like *yoda* did the last times, but i hope you enjoy some of the pics. First a pic of the complete building: The 3 Minifigs: and i pic of the stairs (one of my highlights at this set): More pics you can find here My opinion about the set: I like this set very much, it was really fun to build it. I?m happy that that i got some more cherries and a croissant now *sweet* , a funny idea is the salad in the one box at the front. i think normally it?s a hairpiece of an exoforce fig. I also like the colours of the house, the dark blue is sooooo nice. I think i have to take more of this soon. The lighter blue is also nice. This set has really nice details like the stairs, or the owl at the entry of the market, or the balcony. I paid 89,99 EUR, a fair price for a really nice set!! Greetings Sandra	positive
thanks for the great review! *sweet* now that i've seen the set, I'm afraid i'm a bit disappointed 8-| 1) the color combination doesn't really do it for me. blue, dark blue, grey, black, tan, white, they're all mixed together without any over all design... 2) is there any interior? it doesn't look like it, and in any case, you can only reach it if you remove the modules... hm... |-/ now it looks too much of a box... 3) there are most certainly some nice ideas in this model and some great parts. the best part of the model is the staircase 4) i don't think he spent much time in thinking about the design. As apo said, the chimneys on top of a garage is kinda weird, there's also a gate, next to another gate which is weird as well... also, if this is supposed to ba a grocery, then the owner has done a lot to hide it. The croissant is nice, but next to the brown box with vegies, there's nothing that suggests this is a shop... 5) the white lamp and the the yellow cylinder are at the same level of the tiles. IMO it should be above the level of the tiles... 6), IMO not worth the 90 euro Edited by snefroe1, 20 June 2007 - 09:03 AM.	negative
Thank you Legocastlegirls for your quick review! *y* It?s the first time I realize the back of the market street. The tan bricks are a replacement for some windows I?d guess? I do love that building, especially the top floor with the neat balcony. *wub* Of course you are (again) left alone filling the interior. But I just had some food parts ordered at Bricklink... X-D One thing I?d like to know: This is an online-exclusive, right? Can I order it at a Lego-store (K?ln / Oberhausen) and get the sum rewarded on my voucher booklet? *sweet* I heard it here, but I?m not sure. 8-| If anyone is looking for how to fill it with interior: Go read the latest Brickjournal #8!

Well, now that I have some money, a trip to ToysRUs was obviously in my future, especially since my local TRU has much of the summer 2007 lineup. When I got there, almost all the smaller Castle sets had been sold out, but there was one left: the one I am now reviewing for both Eurobricks and BZPower. ;-) The Box: Well, for starters, the Castle theme boxes are beautiful! The blended clear and stormy skies give a great ?clash of the titans? effect, and the action poses help as well. ;-) The back is equally nice, featuring a photo showing kids how to use the crossbow, and the brave axe wielder taking a swipe at the skeleton (foolish soldier, that won?t work on skellies! See later on in the review to find out why). And of course, we have a small box with the link to the official Lego website, where TLC can advertise even more Lego sets! :P The Contents: After opening the box, a single bag of pieces (with a couple loose ones), the instruction manual and necessary catalog ( :-P ), and a new wider rubber band holder spilt out. The instruction manual is clear as a bell. No color trouble here, folks! Also, it?s worth mentioning the nice background with the mountain and King?s castle silhouettes. :-) Sorry that there's no picture, but I'll take one if someone wants to see it. ;-) The Pieces: For being a 5 dollar set (well, seven in my case. Darn your above average prices, TRU!), Crossbow Attack features a lot of nice pieces (as does the entire Castle lineup). Notable elements include two large brown spoked wheels, two brown modified 1x1?s, a pearl gold slope end, and SIX dark blue modified 1x1x2/3 slopes! The bulk of the pieces, however, are nothing special. I?ll let the picture do the talking for this. The accessories are by far the best parts in this kit. Two different helmets in a beautiful shiny silver are my favorite, but I also really like the scythe (looks good for MOCing) and the round shield ( *wub* ), which are both brand new parts. And can anyone not love the classic axe and crossbows? Oh, and there?s a black lightsaber too, but that?s rather boring compared to the other parts. :-P The Minifigures: Can you say, FOUR figures (including the horse)?! That has to be a record for a regular 5 dollar set, at least in the present age of limited figures per set. We?ll start out with the two Crown militia: a regular soldier and an archer. Both have old faces, but they look spiffy with the shiny helmets and the superb torsos. I?ll name the soldier Bravo the Stout and the archer Angler the Precise, for future references. Now we come to the skellie. Although some people dislike the new skeleton design, I personally prefer it to the old ones, since the arms are now poseable and the face much meaner. The only problem is that the arms hang too low, but it?s not too noticeable when they have weapons in their hands. And last, but not least, here?s the elusive skeleton horse. I for one am very happy that TLC took advantage of that awesome prototype piece and made it into an official mass-production mold. However, the horse is unfortunately one piece, but since regular Lego horses are as well, I don?t have a problem with it. I do have a problem with the pose, however. The legs are in quite an odd position, and I wonder why TLC didn?t make the front and back leg poses symmetrical. Ah well. The Finished Set: I have only two pictures here, since this set is so small. First, here?s the completed crossbow. I must say: FINALLY! No more ridiculous horse mounted catapults or crazy fire wheel launchers! Now we have realistic siege weapons, including the one included with 7090. Plus, it actually launches okay, although not the best. Here?s the other main attraction: the completed skeleton rider and horse. I think it?s rather dramatic with that pose and the dark background, don?t you think? ;-) Playability: Okay, so there?s not much in this set, but a bit of imagination brings plenty of possibilities. To show you what you can do, here?s a little story made only with this set. ;-) Overall Rating: Presentation: 9/10 Pieces: 8/10 Minifigures: 9/10 Finished model: 8/10 Playability: 8/10 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Final Score: 8.4/10 Crossbow Attack is a fine introduction into Castle, so I recommend it to any Lego fan, whether they are a castle nut or just want a cheap change of pace. TLC has a knack with making great small kits these days, and I more than ever support them in their amazing rebound from their dark ages (between 1997 and 2004). ;-) Edited by KimT, 10 August 2008 - 01:33 PM.	positive
Very nice little review. Tis too bad I'm skint and can't afford any sets at the moment. Loved the little story too! Also, on your comment about the skellie horses. All Lego horses are posed like that because it's the way horses walk. Check it next time you can.	positive

Here is a review of the new Monster Dino creator set with power functions First lets start with the box which is much larger than it needs to be!! It is one of the new style re-closeable boxes rather than the rip the sides style. This set is typical of creator and comes with three sets of instructions. The Monster Dino a kind of spider and a Crocodile The set comes with two of the new motors one small and one large, a sound module plus the new IR controler and receiver. There is a mix of techniques in this set the core is mainly studless technic, there are some studded technic parts and most of the details are standard creator style. There are two mechanisms one to control the legs and one to control the head and arms. The leg drive is from the large motor and the arm and head are operated from the small motor The completed mechanism will stand on its own without any detail added The detail is added to the base unit to complete the model. The operation of the Dino is very good the design for the motors and drives is very compact and well thought out. The walking motion works well although there is no steering and it will fall over it it encounters obstacles. The sound module is built into the head so when the mouth opens the Dino roars (sort of) Glyman made the comment that this set is ugly as sin and I tend to agree I think there are too many colour variations with different shades of grey, black and that lime green :-P which confuses the look of the finished model but I guess it might apeal more to younger kids. I also do not like the spikes along the back, which glow in the dark, because the are loose and keep falling off. This set is not cheap at ?70 but I guess this is because of the motors and IR controller. While on this I was surprised how good the range was on the new controller it would still operate ever when not in direct line of sight. I would give this set a 10/10 for playabilityit has kept the kid amused for hours I would give it 6/10 for value for money it is a bit pricey Overall 8/10 It took approx 3 hours to build and has been well played with I have posted some more images and some videos of the finished models on my brickshelf page HERE If you have any questions please ask Pete Edited by WhiteFang, 23 May 2009 - 06:28 PM.

Thank you very much for that interesting review, Ickelpete. *y* Well, the color scheme?s pretty bad and the design of that Dino?s a bit to blocky for my liking, but the two alternative models you?ve built?re quiet nice. At least there?re a lot of possibilities coming with that set.... :-)	neutral
Tks a lot for your review Ickelpete ;-) I saw that set at TRU a couple of weeks ago but was really not interested due to the design - I am not a fan of those motorized Lego sets |-/ I guess the lime colour is to please kids, as well as the general design, far from a real dino ;-) I am sure that its going to sell well to a younger croud. Let me quote you here: Quote The walking motion works well although there is no steering and it will fall over it it encounters obstacles. Hum, I really hope it works welll because I will have to buy that motorized AT-AT and I dont want it to crash :-P *yoda*	neutral

I don't like the colors myself (surprised? X-D ), and it seems a little blocky. Otherwise, the set is cool. I really like the head.	positive
I bought this set last night and it is great. My biggest surprise was the wheels that were included; I didn't even know they existed and there aren't even that new. Back to the set, he is such a cute dinosaur. :-D Since he is so tubby I think he looks like a baby! I suspect my wife wanted him more than me.... my biggest interest in the set was to have more motors and IR parts so I could make an IR car. Overall, I highly recomend this set, but as others have said, be warned that the box is very oversized. I wish Lego would give up on this whole 1:1 picture thing. *wacko*	positive
I didn't spot this great review earlier. Thanks for the effort of posting all those pics and videos, they helped me decide that this set is worth getting.	positive
Got this baby via shop@home a little early and I though it was time to post my view of this set : (Snefroe you NEED to get this one ;-) ) Sorry for the lack of pics but there are already many pics online of this baby So here it is : Best space set since... a way too long time This is my first new space themed set since more than 20 years and I must say that I’m not disappointed at all. I have much to say about this little gem. First, let’s cut it straight about the Martians minifigures: they are absolutely rubbish. I can’t imagine how Lego could produce such atrocity. This said; let’s move on to the dropship. A real piece of art. Reminiscent of the Aliens movie dropship. The cockpit is spacious and provides a great field of view, too bad there is no hinges to open it, you must remove the canopy completely to switch pilot. The drilling unit can be attached under the ship with the clever use of a rubber piece. It stays well in place once attached, good point. Some people don’t like the inclusion of the 2 containment area for the Martians and crystal on both side of the ship but I kind like it, it makes the ship less empty. The 2 wings are complete with air intake, some armaments and 1 standard launcher on the right wing. Normally I don’t like launchers but this one is very discrete and well integrated. On the tail section are 2 thrusters that can be rotated and provide thus some “realistic” movements to the ship. One of the last highlight of this ship is the landing gears, or I must say landing dishes. 6 medium sized radar dishes provide and incredible stability to the set. They are quite sturdy and can take a beating. I’m not going to review the alien spaceship in detail since it’s quite uninteresting. I consider it more like a bonus addition to the set than anything else. The look is passable and there are some interesting building techniques in it. That’s all. To end the review, a little pros/cons table. (We all love pros/cons table :-) ) Pros: - Incredible design - At last a decent space set - Modular functions - Quite Sturdy - Beautiful - Great value for money Cons: - Martians are rubbish - No hinges for the canopy - The drilling unit could use some more details. Score: 9/10 By the way , I added a nice cool feature on my site , you can download the stickers for some sets that I own. Before building I always scan the stickers, we never know it could come handy. check this out on my site (you need to go in the Lego lists on the left): [VTX] Classic games	positive

Of course, right before I post this I see that Ickelpete reviewed this set earlier in the week. Sorry for being redundant but it is already written so here ya go: Monster Dino Reviewed by Dunamis Set 4958 792 Pieces $89.95 from LEGO Online Store Build time 3.5 hours Here we go with another offering from the Creator line. I?m kind of fond of these sets as they are pretty imaginative and usually have instructions for multiple models. I like the reusability of all the pieces and the varied things you can build. The Box: The box that LEGO shipped this thing in was absolutely huge! When I first got this in the mail, I thought I had won the lottery and they had shipped the UCS Falcon early. Once I opened the shipping box, I was surprised to see an unusually large Creator set box. The box itself is pretty standard Creator type box but this one shows off the Power Functions prominently on the right side of the box. The back of the box shows some of the motorized features as well. Opening the box is a matter of breaking two seals. We?re back to the reusable cereal box type tab system for those of you who stay up a night wondering about LEGO?s next box design. Inside the box we have a bunch of sealed bags. Immediately the power brick, remote and motors stand out as they are each in individual bags. Also, there are three manuals. The Manuals: The three manuals are 76, 76 and 56 pages in length. They are laid out well and are pretty standard with all the usual trimmings: - Piece call outs for each step - Parts inventory at the end of the primary model build - Page numbers Color separation in these manuals were fine for me. Interestingly, the instructions for the primary build took a full manual plus about a quarter of another manual. Random manual photos: Parts list I?ll explain a bit more below, but it would have been nice to have some written documentation on all the functions of the motors, remote and receiver. Such as motor load guidelines and specific explanations of all the remote control functions. It is severely lacking in this area. The Pieces: Obviously, the pieces we?re most interested in are these new motors and wireless remote control. Note that before you fire this bad boy up, you had better BYOB. Since this is prominently a European community, I had better clarify my acronyms. Over here across the pond, BYOB usually means ?Bring Your Own Beer?. In this case, it still means bring your own beer (I?m on my second Heineken right now) but in addition to numerous bottles of beer you will need a total of NINE batteries to get through this set. I kid you not: Anyway, there are two motors (a small and a large) each with its own very unique name according to the manual; the smaller one is called ?motor? and the larger one is called ?XL motor?. Very creative indeed! The battery box takes SIX AA batteries and there are two compartments to hold them. Here is the first: That seems pretty normal. However, the back side of it holds the other three batteries and it seems to be very poorly designed: Note in the photo above where the bottom battery is placed. Compare it to the previous photo and you will see the difference. I played around with trying to get that bottom battery out and you better pack a lunch (or BYOB) because it is no small task! Why couldn?t they make this compartment just like the other side? There is a single power cord connector and a three position switch. The middle position turns the power OFF and the other two positions seem to provide the same functionality in either position as far as I can tell. Perhaps a little blurb in the manual would have been nice to clear things up a bit. The remote takes three AAA batteries. It is fairly small and lightweight even with the batteries installed. It has two thumb controls which could be levers if you insert Technic bars or even pins. The two controls are color coded and match the plugs on the receiver to control two separate motors. In addition, there is a four position switch which I assume changes the channel. Finally, there are two tiny levers that seem to have no function. I?m not sure if they are a trim control or variable speed control. I messed with them and didn?t notice any difference in the motor speed. Again, some documentation from the incredibly verbose LEGO manual would have helped. As far as the rest of the parts, it?s really a mixed bag. There are a lot of varied parts in this set to the point that there is almost one of everything. Lots of Technic gears, pins, studded beams, studless beams, axles, wheels, etc. Also, lots of little 1x1 slopes in various colors, teeth, horns, etc. You can?t really say it is a parts pack because there is not enough of one thing to make it a parts pack. A couple of notes: It seems the quality control issue on the axles has been fixed. I initially reported this back when I reviewed the 8285 about a year ago. All the axles worked fine for me. The color quality control issue is still alive. Check out the different shade of red in these two parts: Also included is the sound brick. This looks just like the other sound or light-up bricks we have been seeing lately. It does have a load dinosaur ?roar!? sound embedded in it though so hide the younglings if they are a bit on the skittish side. Finally, I?ve never seen one of these before (although someone will no doubt rattle off a dozen sets where you can find this part in about 5 seconds): No, I am not referring to the studded beam, I put that in the photo for scale. The Build: The build was fun and was fairly straightforward. As I mentioned, there is a lot of Technic parts, so if you are not a fan of the Technic line you should run, not walk away from this one. There were no gotchas to speak of, but you need to pay careful attention to the placement of the wires that go from the motors to the receiver. They kind of sneak them around a bit so watch closely. Otherwise, it was fine. Here is what is left over: So far, I have only built the primary model. As seen on the box, there are instructions for two more models. Both of the other models seem less complex than the primary model and are likely quicker builds. The Dino took me about 3.5 hours which included some time to screw around with the motors. I?m an old school Technic fan from way back in the 80?s so I had some familiarity with the old Technic motors. Obviously, 25+ years has improved some things and these seem much more powerful. The Design: If you have built the 4507 Prehistoric Creatures then some of the design will feel familiar, especially the head and tail. It is almost like they took the dinosaur from that set and figured out how to motorize it. This is not necessarily a bad thing, just a comment. The set does a good job of showing off the features of the new motors and remote. It is nice to see how one motor can perform multiple functions. In this case, the small motor makes both arms move and opens and closes the mouth of the dinosaur. When the mouth is completely open, it pushes the activation switch on the sound brick which emits the ?roar!? sound. Pretty cool. The ?XL Motor? handles the walking feature of the dinosaur. There is both forward and reverse. Forward works really well while the reverse just makes the dinosaur look like he is doing a Michael Jackson moon walk. (Wow, I never thought I would use Michael Jackson?s name in a LEGO Dinosaur set review!) It is almost like the dinosaur can?t get traction going in reverse. However, as noted previously forward works really well. This guy actually gets going at a pretty good clip. As you might expect, he kind of waddles like a duck since there is no articulation in the knees. It is a bit awkward but it works. The ?XL Motor? seems to kick out plenty of power. Overall, the design seems to be a mixed bag. The way the tail is attached seems to be an afterthought. The arms look to be too small. However, the walking mechanism and legs/feet are pretty cool as well as the head and mouth. I guess it is a reasonable effort to get people introduced to the parts and we?ll see designs improve as time goes on. Here are a few views of our new friend: But What About The AT-AT??? Of course, the real reason you are reading this is that you hope I will have some epiphany on how all this relates to the new walking AT-AT. Judging from the box on the AT-AT, it looks like we get one motor. I don?t see the remote which is a disappointment as I hope it is not controlled by a switch on the body and you either turn the AT-AT on or off. If that is the case, the first thing I am doing is scavenging the receiver and remote from this set to add to the AT-AT. Granted, it could be that it comes with a remote but is just not seen on the box. Also, the AT-AT box looks like one of the images shows that the head turns. I sure hope this is controlled separately as it would be really lame to not be able to control this independently from the walking feature. I?m kind of skeptical on the walking feature of the AT-AT. I suspect it will be rather cumbersome but hopefully I will be pleasantly surprised. Needless to say, this is all speculation but those are my initial thoughts based on this set. Overall Thoughts: It?s an OK set. Kind of pricy but I suspect a large part of that is due to the motors and remote. I haven?t built the other two models (they seem less interesting to me) but at least it has some variability. Also, you get a ton of different parts which can either be a good thing or bad thing depending on what you are looking for. The dinosaur is average. The color selection is marginal (black and lime green?) and the tail section is just lame. I appreciate it more for the mechanical functions and how the motorized parts work. It does do a good job of waking up my dog who seems pretty irritated by it. It is a nice set to show off to the neighbors or the endless caravan of my wife?s friends that seem to materialize out of nowhere. People are quickly impressed by it and then promptly move along once you start trying to explain how it all works. I?m a bit disappointed that the manual did not explain more about the remote and motor functions. I suspect that there is more than meets the eye and I?ll just have to play around with it to find out. It would be nice if LEGO had a website that showed all the cool functions of the motors and remotes so we fully understand the capabilities. Final Rating: 72% Build 9/10 (Pretty quick and fun. The mechanical part is cool) Functionality 6/10 (It is a Creator set so you have multiple builds. As far as it being a dinosaur, it?s just OK. Motorized parts are cool though.) Design 6/10 (Partly cloudy. Some things are cool, others are lame.) Parts 8/10 (New motors and remote are cool. Lots of varied parts included but nothing to write home about.) Price 7/10 (It is kind of expensive) Edited by WhiteFang, 23 May 2009 - 06:23 PM. Indexed	negative

It worked by the head simply swinging from side to side due to balence shifts. I suspect the AT-AT will be same. I also think that there will be no remote for it either. Thanks, that makes sense and you are probably right. I do have the Dark Side Development Kit, but I have not built that AT-AT.

Awesome reveiw, thanks! I gotta get this one!!! *y* *wub*	positive
I kind of like the design of this, but more importantly I really want to get my hands on the power functions motors and IR control system. I'd prefer the 8275 Technic Bulldozer, but there's no way I can stretch to the ?100 price tag, so I was thinking I would have to see if I could get a 4958 Monster Dino cheap in the January sales. Then two things happened today. Firstly I saw the Dino in Tescos reduced from ?70 to ?55. Then my wife said she'd buy it for me for Christmas. Wow! That's never happened to me before. I love my wife! *wub* Can't wait till Christmas now!	positive
Ickelpete, on Nov 4 2007, 06:41 PM, said: If you really want the power functions the Bulldozer is better value as you get two large motors, two small motors and two receivers compared to the one in the Dino set alos watch Toysrus and argos both have had the Bulldozer for ?70-75 in there pre christmas sales usually for a week only I am hopeing they will be on sale soon as I want a Second Bulldozer to get some more motors. Thanks for the tip, but even ?70-75 is too much right now. ?55 was just about affordable, but now my wife's buying for me it's going to cost me zero zilch zip nada nothing which is even sweeter! X-D	neutral
I ended up buying both this and the dozer. :-$ I plan on using my Dino for a IR car in a month or two...	neutral
I ended up buying a MISB set recently from a Lego collector who is clearing up his collection. Excellent set to get the IR remote and IR receiver and other motors without paying insane amounts for the bulldozer now. There is a quite a number of parts in Power miner lime green and 1x1 white teeth plate for the mouth and claws. The dino alone has 20 teeth in its mouth The glow in the dark "antennas" on the backbone of the dino is a nice touch as you can let him walk in the dark somewhat. I do agree with the reviewer, the box IS INSANELY HUGE!!! I don't think Lego wanted to show a 1:1 scale dino, they just wanted to promote the power function stuff as large as possible. Also, the remote is smaller than shown in the picture as the hand holding it I think is smaller.	positive
Thanks for the early review! I don't know much about the rebals show at all, but I can say that the over all design of the walker really appeals to me and the minifigs look top notch. I also like how the spring shooters are pretty much hidden in the frame, nice job!	positive
Pretty good first review! This looks pretty great, I probably won't be getting it due to budget constraints. (Bionicle) but still, very nice set. To me it kinda looks like the missing link between when the at-st evolved into the at-at. Also, I know the rebels stormtroopers get a lot of hate, but I really like them. Thanks for the review!	positive
Thanks for the review! I have two questions: - What is the driver standing on, when the hatch is open and he is looking out? - Could you show the face of Kallus without helmet, please? My only complaint is that the colours of both, Kallus's and the drivers's uniforms are wrong. Kallus's uniform is way too dark and should be more dark olive than black, and the drivers's uniforms are too bright and should be more greyish compared to what we saw in the series.	neutral

Great reveiw, shame on Lego for forgetting that they already made a AT-DP pilot helmet (Ezra's from the Phantom set) that didn't resort to needing a printed head.	negative
It's a different helmet. Ezra's is an Imperial Cadet Helmet (the same one he wears in "Breaking Ranks).	neutral
Thanks for the review and pics. This is a really nice looking walker. One question - how snug are the AT-DP drivers sitting in their seats? The cockpit looks good. Actually I'm not crazy about the AT-DP helmets on the show but I dig the minifigs! Good stuff. Awesome facial hair for Kallus!	neutral
Super outstanding review! I am outside at this moment and this review is certainly great to read while you are on the move. I am looking forward to get this upcoming new modular. It is definitely fun to play and real awesome indeed. Thanks Oky for this very fine review.	positive
I want more of the story you made! Also, ace review.	positive
Brilliant review and thanks for plenty of detailed shots of the interior, I may invest in this set but ill have to wait until 2015 Star wars is sorted and budget for the arrival of Pirates in April!	positive
Fantastic review, could easily be the year's best, and it's only January 1st! You've got a duplicated picture in the bit where the candy is being moved from the outside and through the barber shop.. ...and I was expecting a final B&W picture or two where the detective makes his report to the woman in red, and gets his reward (candy, of course) or she in turn reports back to her real boyfriend, the candy smuggler.

Great review Oky! I really love your introduction text. You put a lot of effort in this review, with lots of nice touches. Well done For me the set gets 4 out of 5. It's a great set, but there's something preventing me of giving it 5 stars.	positive
Wow, that is the best start to a review I have ever seen. Great job Oky, amazing set, I'll be picking it up this weekend!	positive
Great review Oky! I managed to pick this set up a few days ago and I must say, it might be my favorite modular yet for the feel alone. The pool hall, barbershop, and the detective's office itself are all wonderfully designed!	positive

Great review! The intro was great, but I'm still not convinced on this one. The height seems too small for comparison with the rest of the modulars. The play features are ok but I wish it would have been taller.	negative

Thank you for the review, it was very interesting and changed my opinion of the set, I'm now considering a future purchase ^^. Just one question: The mirror is on cardboard? I was hoping for it to be a window piece with a mirror on one side.. I hope it's not the same cardboard we had on some of the early Harry Potter sets or the element won't last long	neutral
Thank you for the great review of this set. I'm also curious for the backside of the mirror.	neutral

Amazing review! Very thorough with lots of details	positive
Thanks for the review! I'm a fan of the set but will be modding quite a bit. Have to get a small bar into the Highlander and then turn the second/third story above the barber shop into a proper apartment. The detective's office is great and will stay as is!	positive

Lego's affiliation with six wheelers go back a long way. I think the first one was released in 1981, more than 25 years ago. This year, Lego added another one to the family, Mars Mission's "Rhino 1", as its title sounds... It's been a while since i've bought and opened a large box, so maybe this isn't a surprise to most of you, but the box does not open at the front, as with many larger sw boxes, but at the side. The two printed seals(or whatever people call them) have gone as well, being replaced by one larger print in the middle of side... the box also isn't as thick as a large sw box, like the sandcrawler... The general size is, however, still quite large. PICT0001.JPG 281.91K 102 downloads the back side shows the Mars Mission theme sets... eccept the Rhino! I guess it shows this set will be released as a TRU exclusive or something, only to show up in Legoland shops and maybe Lego shops... It's a shame really, because this is by far the best set of the theme. PICT0002.JPG 285.42K 89 downloads When you open the front cover, you see a larger picture picture of the Rhino. Obviously, it seems to be some sort of multifunctional truck. i think the basic function is to drive around and explore. For that it has a drilling device and six giant wheels. PICT0003.JPG 273.7K 82 downloads The set comes with two instruction books. i'm afraid to say they did not resolve the gray/black colors issue. Colorwise, the real thing does not look like the instruction book because of it... PICT0004.JPG 302.63K 75 downloads The Rhino looks really big because of the six giant wheels. I guess it's more or less the same size as M-tron's Magnetiser with the big difference between the two being that the wheels have been turned around, creating a unique wheel design for a Lego model PICT0285.JPG 290.59K 83 downloads PICT0277.JPG 286.26K 80 downloads the wheels look very cool, even though the first couple of wheels stand a bit closer to each other. Don't know why that is. hm... |-/ and they could have used a bit more body, but the design is pretty good. i know, "Armagheddon" isn't far away... |-/ PICT0292.JPG 216.75K 70 downloads The suspension of the wheels is a bit flimsy. sure, it allows the truck to move around in a more realistic way than the old sets, but it's not as flexible as some older sets, like sw's CTT. Nor do the wheels have much body. the black bars you see on top of the wheels are more "window dressing" then functional... PICT0293.JPG 244.78K 88 downloads The over all shape of the Rhino is kinda "bulky", it looks more like a beatle than a rhino, if you're asking me. It has three major sections, but i wouldn't call it a modular building though... The cockpit is the first section. It's spacious and detailed. PICT0290.JPG 262.77K 0 downloads PICT0291.JPG 299.75K 87 downloads The cockpit hangs down from a weird angle. it's attached to a large vertical technic brick that is part of the Rhino's main structure, so it's not a seperate spaceship, which is a shame... oh well... you can't have it all, i guess... PICT0301.JPG 291.13K 78 downloads ah yes... stickers all over the place, but they're cool. the mid section of the Rhino dominates the basic shape of the model. It's as if those two large white parts form a strong and thick shield, protecting whatever is inside from whatever is outsde. PICT0007.JPG 213.22K 67 downloads unfortunately, there is nothing inside. it's extra space needed to house the spaceship. That's really a shame; a command center of some kind could have given the rhino a bit more "panache". PICT0286.JPG 251.35K 87 downloads However, what's really great, is the way in which they fit together: one side has an orange 1x2 plate that fits in between two white 1x3 plates of the other side, creating yet another unique shape for a Lego model. But again, it's a shame they didn't do more with this section... X-O PICT0283.JPG 287.75K 82 downloads The third and last section is a platform for a space ship. PICT0299.JPG 289.5K 77 downloads PICT0287.JPG 199.78K 75 downloads The platform itself isn't really special. no details, no stickers,... it's just a skeleton to carry the spaceship, nothing more nothing less. No, your space ship doesn't fall off, even if you rotate the platform into a launch position, pushing the weight of the ship backwards. In fact, the position of the ship onto the platform is so solid, it's kinda difficult to imagine how this ship flies off. |-/ The ship on the other hand, is pretty cool. It's all sorts of things at the same time it seems. It transports two aliens, but also a small car that reminds me of the small sets of Spacepolice 2, blacktron 2,... PICT0295.JPG 307.4K 85 downloads PICT0298.JPG 268.13K 75 downloads PICT0294.JPG 276.84K 76 downloads the shuttle reminds me of a Star trek shuttle and i think it needs some modding, but i do think it looks pretty nice. sure, the cockpit is a bit too low, a pilot needs to lay down instead of sitting down and the dropping mechnism, if there is one at all isn't all that brilliant either... The main structure is a bit too technical for me. I prefer actual parts with studs, not these Lego technic bars and pins. PICT0006.JPG 224.43K 74 downloads the crew: PICT0276.JPG 239.43K 70 downloads ah yes, there's also this green plastic residu. think they are supposed to be the aliens... and there's also this weird alien craft, but i didn't bother to build that... *sad* GOOD: *wub* Great, innovative design, lots of potential, i even like the colors *sweet* Lots of playability it's a big, attractive model; i don't see any weak spots in the design that could compromise stability or structural integrity. NOT SO GOOD: |-/ too many technic parts, some sections on the model, like the gun and the drilling device are a bit to flimsy I'd say 7.5-8.5/10 Price: 750 Danish Crowns, about 105euro	positive
This is a great review and so is the set *y* I thought I would buy it, but when I saw the price... I changed my mind X-D I always liked flying things better though... Like the Dropship... Although that is a BIT pricey too, I guess X-D	neutral
This set is truely incredible, a must have. BUT this set is also incredibly overpriced *n* ! Com' on it's only a big vehicle , nothing really special to justify the near 100? price tag. This set is clearly worth something like 65? at max. Look at the incredible dropship for 34?, that's a good value for money! *y* Edited by mutex, 15 July 2007 - 04:57 PM.	neutral

Nice Review *y* I have quick question though.... Do the crystals fit into the aliens hands? Try and stick one in there,Becuase the new catalog shows an image of an alien holding a crystal Lastly lego should have made the aliens with movable arms and no hole in the middle |-/ I don't want to waste any money so I am only going to grab 1 or 2 of the smaller sets Piranha EDIT:IMO the aliens would win becuase they have superior technology and all they do is have to cut the airtank line and the humans die Edited by Piranha, 20 July 2007 - 01:40 AM.	positive
Yes, they can hold the crystals. They can't move the hands ( |-/ ) but they do have the clawlike hand of the droid arm. EDIT: Could you post some general 'beauty' pics of the Rhino and the attached craft, such as front, side, back, etc. All we have of the ship is one top pic... Edited by Mr. Mandalorian, 20 July 2007 - 05:18 AM.	positive
Say, I was looking at your pics and then at the instructions and I just realised : haven't you put the stikers on the shield thingies in the middle upside down? I think you did :-D I don't know if I like those new sets, though... I mean they have great shapes and potential, but at the same time, they seem so holey... They're really huge and big but full of empty air and space as well... Well, this one not as much, and indeed it is the best looking set of the lot, though... But I don't think I'll go into that line...	neutral
snefroe1, on Jul 16 2007, 07:19 AM, said: ok then... i'll do that later on... but I will NOT touch that plastic residu! X-D You touched them to put them in their holders in the ship. So in theory, you will not review them. Anyways, nice review. I don't think I'll get this though. I'm trying to decide between this, moble devastator, or anothe 90$ set. I need to get something large before my B-day... Regards, ~VBBN~	positive
8-? such a wonderful machine! Great review! Too bad all my money is going towards the castle theme! >:-( My wallet is planning to kill me!	positive
Great review, wonderfully detailed. Don't care for the ship at all. It's that 'technic under a hollow shell' thing like the CTT. If it wasn't for the figures, I would have hated it, and nothing about these figures excites me. I'll end up finding the least number of sets possible to provide at least one of each figure for the general population collection and skip the rest (unless they do as I expect and flop here, thus leading to huge discounts). I like this set ... at half off. ;-)	positive
I agree iamded, Life on Mars, while not even that truly great, was far better than this line! >:-( I am hoping the next space line Lego does takes place in just that! Space! |-/ By the way iamded, I continue to stalk you....... Batbrick Away! >:-)	negative
Two of my daughters are building this as we speak. I agree the design is a lot smaller than I would have liked, but they're loving it. No question the figures are the real draw here. And at 6 and almost five years old they're doimg a good job building so far. At least for the 4-6 range in my house, this set is a home run. Thanks for the great review, Mostlytechnic!	positive
I managed to get two sets for my twin girls for Christmas, and would have to agree with your ratings (the Anna and Elsa figs are indeed excellent)	neutral

Vorkosigan, on 09 January 2015 - 12:29 AM, said: Isn't getting parts in new colors a good thing? It is a shame there is only this one set, I think TLG could make a whole subtheme out of Frozen. I do agree that they overuse lavender and magenta, I don't see why every girl set has to have these sort of colors instead of what would be accurate to the source material . Sure, new colors are good. But cramming a bunch of oddball ones into a single set where they don't even make sense just seems financially unwise for Lego. I'd rather have seen a larger set than light aqua spiral staircase parts. Or lavender tiny fences. Lego made the stairs in dark purple last year for Rapunzel's Tower, and those probably would have been ok here. Or make them in a more useful color like WHITE.	neutral
Thanks for the review! I have the same opinion about the design, looks like Belville. I bought it on Legostore Orlando December 30th. It was impressive. My wife saw them putting on shelf, 8 or 10 boxes. She ran and grabbed the last one! The girls faces around it was indescribable, mix of ecstasy and afraid to loose it. It happened in less than 2 minutes. My 7 yo girl didn't want it. She likes the dresses but hates the movie. Prefers Lego Movie. But my 2 yo girl who never saw the movie grabbed it for good, and we bought it. Lego will sell it like water, but I do not understand why a set so small. It is the WORST SET DESIGN since the introduction of Lego Friends. My 7 yo has more than 50 Lego friends minifigures, all the Lego fiends stores and concluded that the castle had a terrible design. She is 7!! Let's be honest, Lego should have released this sets months before this Christmas and is loosing a perfect opportunity to sell a decent set, with much more pieces. I am wondering if they are going to make another set with the same characters. At the end,. It is just for the minifigures.	negative
When I first saw the pictures, I didn't realize that this set had so much color barf going on in it. Also, there is a bunch of stuff that does not fit in with the movie, and it is pricey. The minifigures are nice, but no Kristoff or Sven. I thought about getting this, but this review is pushing me towards no.	negative
Yep, my family all thinks they should have made a bigger set, added figs, and just been printing money. This feels massively rushed into production. Which is weird, the other princess sets that just came out look worlds better.	negative
I wish Elsa had more of a white hairpiece rather than blonde. But it could be worse. Not a bad set overall, although Olaf doesn't look right without the twigs on his head. Anna is a really nice and accurate fig.	positive
The review is very well done. Thanks! I don't know the movie. My key question is whether the bricks in the set will allow to build my own snow/ice creations. Now, with "trans-glitter" being part of the design approach I am not so sure. Can those who have already bought it tell me: can trans-glitter be used as "transparent with snow particles" or is it just terrible? I cannot really tell from the review pic above.	neutral
I think the trans-glitter blue panels can be icy or snowy just fine. I'm sure that's WHY they used them for this set. Now, if you're looking for realism (like the photos in your sig seem to be), it might be tougher. But I've been thinking about using those big glittery panels to make a waterfall-type scene.	positive
Well, the good news for you is you're in luck whenever you find sets, since the figs sell for a good bit of money :) Right now the bricklink value of the 3 figs is about $30!	positive

Bennemans, on 13 January 2015 - 06:08 PM, said: There is a very simple reason for the flowers and green-leaved trees; you should remember from the movie it was actually summer when Elsa set of the eternal winter… True, but all around her ICE CASTLE it is all winter. So why are there non-winter bits in this set? Doesn't make sense. The picnic is because they wanted a mini-vignette for Olaf to fit into, but the rest of the green and flowers don't make sense.

I'm trusting there is something else going on behind the scenes because this should have been a huge set and released in November of 2014 at the latest.

Hello everyone, I am back to share with all of you, another of my Legends of Chima polybags review. It will be pretty comprehensive since the finished built will be quick and will be focusing more of what kind of fun that you can derive from there. This polybag was bought in September 2013, when I visited LEGOLAND Malaysia and I did not hesitate to put this in my shopping basket. Name: 30253 Leonidas Jungle Dragster Theme: LEGO System / Legends of Chima Year: 2013 Pieces: 30 Minifigs: 1 minifigure Price: USD N.A, GBP N.A, EURO N.A, SGD N.A Resources: Brickset, BrickLink An original polybag image of the 30253 Leonidas Jungle Dragster Back view of the original polybag image of the 30253 Leonidas Jungle Dragster The road scout of the Lions Tribe This polybag design is definitely plan to be the quickest and fastest dragster to recce enemy front by making a swift scout for the Lions Tribe. I believe by the sound of the name, Jungle Dragster, it might just be suitable to use in jungle terrain. Well, I don't quite agree that this is a 'Dragster' even though it has the kind of open view concept of rolling in fast but it does not have the length of a typical dragster, similar to this Town polybag design, for example. Still, it is nice to have smaller variants of their vehicular supremacy. Instruction Manual (Front) Instruction Manual (Back) The LEGO building content With just 30 LEGO elements, you can be pretty quick to be able to display these laid out content. After the built is completed, these are the remaining spare parts. I am fond of the wheels which are some useful parts, other than that, there are nothing spectacular about it. My name is Leonidas and I belonged to the Lions Tribe Do not be mistaken of his name, Leonidas to be the King of Sparta who led the brave men of 300 Spartans Warriors to fight to the death against the Persians. Instead this character is based on the bio resided in LEGO.com, you will realise that he is aligned with the Lions tribe and is a proud Lion foot-soldier. He may have that goofy idiotic look but he can be very serious in his commitment to discharging his duties. You are able to observe his nice back view printing which reveal his black and blue sash. Leonidas has a dual facial feature to reveal his much serious appearance. Leonidas is one of the common characters available in the Legends of Chima universe. It can be found in a total of five sets. It is a great pity that there is no weapon being made for him in this polybag design which will certainly make a fine addition. The completed built of the Jungle Dragster This is the main design of the Jungle Dragster which is very simple looking. There is no distinct fighting capability from the vehicular design and it look just like a regular patrol vehicle. One thing I like about this, is the close distinct colour schema of the Lions Tribe. Other than that, there is nothing special about it. Moving off with my Jungle Dragster To conclude, this polybag is really meant for LEGO fans or collectors who appreciate Legends of Chima or wanting to sample the Legends of Chima theme. It is a very simple built, but yet could form a decent force size for recce purposes before sending in the big arsenals to whack their enemies. Either way, I will only suggest you to buy it if you really love this theme at an inexpensive price. Otherwise, it is perfectly alright to give this a miss. Summary review Playability: 4/10 (You need to have more Lions Tribe vehicles in order to bring the best and fun out of it since this is more of a supporting vehicle.) Design: 4/10 (Simplistic built of the dragster and main focus is just acquiring the minifigure.) Price: 4/10 (Bought at about USD$7, which is not an awesome price, so get it if you can get it more than half of this price.) Overall: 4/10 (If only you are a huge mega fan of the Legends of Chima, then you need to get this.) I gave it a "2" based on my Review Score Card. What about yours? I hope every one of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine. Comments and Criticisms are strongly welcomed. Pictures can be found in My Flickr.	negative
Good and helpful review again, WhiteFang. I probably have no use for a lionish creature with goofy looks...	negative

Most of what I remember about the old Batman TV show actually comes from the movie as I own that. (Mum bought it for me.) I tend to put in on if I have friends over and I am drunk enough. I like the darker side of Batman only, and thus anything that is against the idea that Batman is as big a loon as the guys that he hauls in I don't like. Joel schumaker's movies fall well within that category. hinckley39, on Jul 18 2007, 04:51 PM, said: The crow is my favorite part. :-$ I'm happy to be swaying you over to the side of mini-fig suffering >:-) It sucks that your pricing is so different over there.

At least he can come down chimneys here without being burnt :-P ! But I am not too badly done by. I should be buying some more (non-Licensed) Lego goodness tomorrow...	neutral
When i first saw pic's of the bi-plane i wasn't sure if i liked it or not, but after seeing it in more detail i gotta say i love the thing *wub* It's a great plane with so many good aspect's, it's also the perfect counter vehicle for the new bat-plane. For me though the best part of the set has got to be the new pumpkin heads, those are just beautiful and i cant wait to get lots of them.	positive
Great review! Funny as allways! The comic was just a hell lot of fun. It really had me laughing. I would love to have this set but the price is just to high here, far worse than I had expected. I'll be better off buying the Battank, which is much better priced. Actually there is almost no price difference between The Batcopter and The Battank here *wacko*	negative
Tks mate for this brilliant review :-D I loved your Batfabuland story !! Always fantastic to read like always *sweet* I really love this set and I shall buy 2 copies: one to build as is, and another one for my town loool: regular biplane for the tarmac, and my swat copter ;-) BTW, I would have a request: could you post pic(s) of the parts inventory please ;-) Many tks in advance !! *yoda*	positive

Comparing the price of the Tank to the Batwing you seem to be getting quite a good deal there. Both are over priced for Australians and the Tank is twice the price of the copter. (They are 60 AUD and 120 AUD.) I am still not sure if I will buy either... :'-( Edited by Sinner, 18 July 2007 - 11:47 AM.	negative
Thanks for the review. I'm definitely getting this, mainly becasue it's Batman. I love the blue Bats, the Scarecrow is good as ever, and those new pumpkins are just *wub* . There's a few things I'll MOD, but nothing really major. I'll have to wait till I get this to decide properly though.	positive
Sinner, on Jul 18 2007, 08:24 AM, said: I thought you would like it! I am pleased to say that I didn't know that "the jig is up!" was also a common line. Most of what I remember about the old Batman TV show actually comes from the movie as I own that. (Mum bought it for me.) I tend to put in on if I have friends over and I am drunk enough. I like the darker side of Batman only, and thus anything that is against the idea that Batman is as big a loon as the guys that he hauls in I don't like. Joel schumaker's movies fall well within that category. Wait, what? Are you saying you prefer the Joel Schumacher films? If you like the darker side of Batman, I recommend the Tim Burton films. Joel Schumacher is as campy as "the jig is up" IMO. He added freakin' nipples to the batsuit for God's sake! :-P You'd have to be nice and drunk to enjoy his films. ;-) I really like Batman, Batman Returns and Batman Begins.

Excellent hinckley *y* *y* *y* ! Looks like a nice set - I like the mix of dark Batman-pieces and a bit lighter Badmans-pieces. Batmans new blue headpiece looks a bit off though.

What's up Kernow!!?? Nice review. Thanks for sharing. Welcome to Eurobricks, I hope you have fun here! :-D X-D That Qui-Gonn thing is weird. Come on LEGO! Someone is just asleep at the wheel over there with quality control. Missing pieces, injections molds, slipping quality, ice cube trays...IMO, that's a huge thing to miss. The mini-fig on the box doesn't come in the set=false claims. Anyway, the ship looks beautiful and I wanted this set when I first saw it and your review confirms that it is very cool. Thanks again!

7665 Review Part 2 The second half of the build goes quicker than the first. Once you start to add the engines, the ship really begins to take shape. The main body of the ship has a few surprises hidden away under a removable cover. Inside you get some retracting guns, a storage box, a little shuttle and space for a droid and figure. Here is everything you can fit inside. The guns are concealed behind the side vents. Pushing them forward causes the vents to open. Closed: And open: The final feature is the passenger area/escape pod. Inside is plenty of space for two figures. The pod cleverly attaches by pushing the front section of the ship forward, sliding the pod in, then returning the front. Everything locks together and is held securely in place by an elastic band. :-) Here's a couple of pictures of the final model. It's not the most beautiful creation ever, but it is an excellent representation of the ship from the film. The angular shape actually suits a LEGO build well. There's one more useful feature. The whole ship can be safely and comfortably picked up by two ball ended Technic pins towards the back end. It balances well at this point and does allow you to swoosh the ship around much more easily. This was the most enjoyable Star Wars build I've had in a long time. Everything progresses nicely with almost no repetitive bits. The ship looks good and is also HUGE! *sweet* Compare it to the 6211 ISD and you'll see it's only fractionally smaller. When I first saw pictures of this on the internet I thought it looked OK. Once you see it for real it is much more impressive. For ?69.99 in the UK I'm not complaining. It's the best value Star Wars set of the year so far. To conclude: Pieces: 9/10 Minifigures: 7/10 (would be a 9 apart from the stupid Qui-Gon/Obi-Wan head error) Playability: 8/10 Originality: 9/10 Set Design: 8/10 Overall: 8.2/10 The box says this is a Limited Edition set (whatever that means). So if you're planning to get it I'd suggest you grab it at the first opportunity. I'm glad I did! X-D Edited by Kernow, 22 July 2007 - 10:56 PM.	positive

Asuka, on Aug 1 2007, 01:47 PM, said: No, I think this is correct. The upper plate with clip for the door is a little high, on top of a dark gray 1x1 brick. So if you want the door to operate well you have to place it like that. I just put the clip under that brick, a very easy fix, so my door now is lower which looks better IMHO, and no sneaky skelly can crawl along under it.... X-D Exactly. Asuka is correct. Also keep in mind that the picture was taken looking down on the model that is sitting on the carpet. It makes the gap appear a little larger. In addition; for those of you that recommended ironing the sail, it worked great. I set the iron to low and used a t-shirt to protect the sail. It flattened it out perfectly. In fact, it worked so well, that I did the same with my old WW Weapons Wagon cover that has gotten wrinkled over the years. The iron worked perfectly.	positive
Yes, that was definately an optic illusion. Looking at it again, the gap looks a lot shorter. Thanks. :-) Shakar	positive
Yes, very nice review Mr Brickster! I think I , for a change, like the castle part better. The ship doesn't look quite right to me. If they're gonna make a pirate theme with ships like this I wouldn't be very happy... But I think the ship brings some nice accesories. Like the anchor, a black mid piece(!), steering wheel etc. I think I'll buy it eventually.

Ok here is the set alot of us star wars fans have been waiting for! The 7666 Hoth Rebel Base! *wub* First the box Now the great minifigs! That stunning K-3po fig! Now the snowspeeder! AAAAGGGHHHHH these parts are all stickers! Now for the turret! the 2 cones on the side press in to fire out 2 blue lights saber blades :-D Now for the small crane thingy. Yes the part under the engine on the snowspeeder is another sticker 8-| Echo Base!! (well the front door anyway :-D ) The main control room? :-D Again these are stickers on a tinted clear panel and on the slope |-/ I have no idea what this is meant to be! :-D Finally 2 shots of the full set! *wub* Well over all i really like this set and think it is great value for money. The minifigs alone would set you back more than the cost of this set. The build time was a good 2 hours or so and was good fun! The snowspeeder is not as good as the second snowspeeder and no where near as good as the first in my opinion, but i did love that first one. The k-3po fig is perfect and it is good to be getting more droids that aren't r2-d2 and c-3po. It is a shame about the stickers but that is the price of keeping the cost down i suppose (the only printed part in the whole set is the snowspeeder/x-wing windscreen). I will definately be getting atleast another 3 of this great set. 9/10	positive

Excellent set. The snowtroopers are just amazing (most Lego imperial troops are really good). However, it's sad that except from Luke, all the rebels have the same face which is what is more the most unexpressive that you can find. For the rest, the quality looks excellent. The snowspeeder is far better than the first they realized (but only one thing: it looks a bit too white to me. I think I remember they were grey and orange rather than white in the film) and the Echo Base door is really cool. Really nice set. Edited by Lord Beckett, 02 August 2007 - 04:14 PM.	positive

Man the stickers on everything are really starting to irritate me a lot. I'm not sure I like the white 3P0, in a set that is primarily made up of whites. Doesn't stand out enough. The snowspeeder looks a lot shorter than previous versions. Steve	negative
REVIEW - 42039 - 24 HOURS RACE CAR INTRODUCTION When the preliminary images of the "Le Mans Racer" surfaced somewhere last year (2014) it got a lot of praise. This changed dramatically when the final images of the 24 Hours Race Car showed up. The front side of the car, especially the head lights, and the curvature of the side of car had changed a lot. The car obviously still resembled the prototype, but the new design raised a lot of eyebrows. The new design was considered a step back instead of forward. Eventhough I still liked the design, I must admit I liked the earlier design better too. With the emphasis on past tense liked. I am not sure anymore and this review will show you why. Like the Arctic Truck this set has a B-model which is well worth checking out. That's why this review includes both the A-model and B-model. For people who are on the fence, the B-model might actually convince them to buy the set after all. Let's see what this set is all about! Note: All images can be clicked for hi-res versions. SET INFORMATION Number: 42039 Title: 24 Hours Race Car Theme: Technic Released: 2015 Part Count: 1219 Box Weight: 2110 gr Box Dimensions: 47,8 cm x 37,3 cm x 8,7 cm Model Dimensions: 40 cm x 18 cm Set Price (MSRP): €99.99 / $? / £99.99 Price per Part: €0.082 / $? / £0.082 Links: Brickset, Bricklink THE BOX The box measures 47,8 cm x 37,3 cm x 8,7 cm and weighs well over 2kg (2110 gr to be precise). The width of the box is the same as the box of the Arctic Truck. This box also feels like it's filled to the brim. THE FRONT The front shows a picture of the main model in action, with radial blurred wheels to emphasize the motion of the car. The lower right section shows the dimensions of the model. Upon completion, it will measure a length of 40cm and a width of 18 cm. THE BACK Like the front, the back side has exactly the same setup as the box of the Arctic Truck. The top shows the functions of the model, while the lower left side shows the B-model and the lower right side shows the motorization options. The picture of the B-model looks so cool, it could be a model of it's own. At this point I was very eager to build both models and compare them. THE SIDE One of the sides usually shows a part in 1:1 scale. This time it's one of the wheels indicating the size of the model. CONTENT OF THE BOX The box contains: 1 Book(let) 1 Sticker Sheet 13 Bags 4 Tires INSTRUCTION BOOKLET Since I own two copies of the set, I also received two instruction booklets. What's catching my eye is that my second copy is supplied in different packaging than the first one. It's for the first time (that I am aware of) that the instruction booklet and stickers come in a sealed bag, without cardboard back. Hopefully this will be a new standard for all sets with sticker sheets. Instead of multiple booklets, this set contains a single square bound book. In earlier reviews I have epxressed my preference for a single book. I don't see any advantage in having 2, 3 or even up to 6 booklets. STICKER SHEET Like the actual model, the sticker sheet looks very vibrant. The bright green, white and black color combination has found it's way to the stickers as well. Either you love 'em or hate 'em. Since I started writing reviews I have been applying stickers and I am happy I started doing it. Stickers do give the model it's finishing touch. BAGS WITH PARTS Thirteen bags with a total of 1219 parts (give or take a few) are supplied in the densily packed box. The rims and flex are sealed in a bag as well. Sometimes looking at the bags makes you wonder what the logic is, behind the distribution of the various parts across the different bags. Well this time it really got me confused. Take a look at two of the bags below. There's a bag containing all the 3L Blue Pins. Then there's a bag with various parts....and a single 3L Blue Pin. I figured this might be an error, but both of the sets have the same anomaly. TIRES The tires have been supplied unbagged, as usual. HIGHLIGHTED PARTS This chapter describes new and interesting parts. This set actually contains a lot of them. This set also contains an abundance of panels. If you aren't into panels, this isn't the set for you. CHANGEOVER CATCH This year (2015) the new changeover catch parts were released. It's a combination of three parts. The advantage of the new parts is that the red gear is the same on both sides, which avoids mounting it the wrong way around. It also avoids the changeover catch slipping out of the driving ring, like it used to do. You can apply lots of pressure, but the catch doesn't slip out. PINS Some of last year's new pins are also included in this set. 12 x Pin with Pin Hole and 21 x 3L Pin with 1L Axle. Securing Technic Beams can be quite simple with the new Pin with Pin Holes. The new 3L Pin with 1L Axle gives you more possibilities when connecting Beams and other parts. Below are two example situations where the new pins have been used. Granted, the examples below can be accomplished by using other techniques. However, some predicaments from the past can be easily solved by using these new parts. Like me, you will most likely appreciate the ease of use. ENGINE AND SUSPENSION Also included are two Steering Portal Hubs and Steering Portal Hubs with Ball Joint Arms and four Steering Portal Axles for driving and steering the vehicle. These parts are commonly used nowadays. The picture below also shows some other parts, like gear rack, steering arms and suspension. FRAMES This set comes with a single 5x7 Frame and three 5x11 Frames. PANELS This set contains a whopping 47 panels in three different colors. I personally like panels a lot and I do appreciate the variety we have at our disposal lately. This set even contains a new 13x3x2 Curved "Mudguard" Panel. NEW 13x3x2 CURVED PANEL This is the first set to contain the new 13x3x2 Curved Panel. Looking at the pictures doesn't do these panels justice. In real life they are actually quite big. I figured they would be smaller, but they are even longer than the 11 x 5 frame, with a length of 13 (including the attachment points). Hopefully this part will be available in other colors as well, preferably white, for adding variety to your EV3 robot. 19L WHITE FLEX-AXLES The White 19L Flex Axles have only been released in a single set, the 8461 Williams F1 Racer in 2002. Current prices on Bricklink are as high as 15 Euros! Needless to say we are very happy with the return of these White Axles. Now we can build Jeroen Ottens' awesome Alfa Romeo 4C Spider for a decent price as well. I am really happy that useful rare parts are being used more often by TLG designers PART LIST Here's the complete list for all 1219 parts. As you can see in the Highlighted parts section, this set contains a lot of interesting and useful parts. If you don't own sets like the 8070 - Supercar, this might be the set to pick up if you want to start building your own supercar. THE BUILD Enough with all the set and part information, let's build the model. REAR SUSPENSION The build starts with the rear suspension and drivetrain. As you can see in the picture below, the length of the Axle between the Steering CV Joint is 4L, where it usally is 3L. This is an indication that the finished model will be a bit bigger than usual (8070 for example). The finished suspension is one of the cleanest suspension setups I have seen in an official model. It's pretty basic, but it works like a charm. This setup is defintely worth using in your MOC. Here's a video: After attaching the suspension to the frame you rotate the module and secure it. At this stage the rear section of the chassis with suspension is almost finished. V8 MID-ENGINE Extending the chassis forward results in the picture below, where the front spoiler is already visible. What's also visible is the V8 engine placed right in front of the rear axle, resulting in a Mid-engine setup, perfectly suited for sports and race cars. Two exhaust pipes have been fitted on either side of the engine, together with two hoses attaching them to the engine. The instructions are easy to follow, although you sometimes you need to bend the beams a bit. Minor improvements are possible here and there, but nothing shocking. FRONT SUSPENSION The front suspension is a bit more complicated than the rear suspension, which makes sense considering the fact it contains the steering rack. The shock absorbers are placed in a different angle than the rear ones, resulting in a somewhat stiffer front suspension. All in all the front suspension is well designed and the steering rack can be easily powered with a Servo Motor. The picture belows shows the front suspension attached to the chassis. If you follow the official instructions to motorize the model, the area in front of the suspension is used to mount the battery box. When you are modding this model to make it Full RC this area can be used to mount the servo motor. GEARBOX Like the gearbox in the 8070, it's not used to switch gears powering the drivetrain. It's used to switch between two functions, opening the doors and the hood/bonnet. The gearbox is located at the left of the vehicle, near the cockpit. The mechanism to open the doors is located on the left side, while opening the hood/bonnet is taking place at the right side. To accomplish this, some axles traverse under the cockpit to the other side of the vehicle. Following the axles to other side of the vehicle and adding some gears, results in the situation below. The video below shows the gearbox in action. DOOR OPENING MECHANISM The mechanism to open the door is comprised of some Knob Wheels, Links without Stoppers and Pins with Towballs. Take a look at the doors opening and closing. THE FRONT Using the new mudguards and various other panels you finish the front of the car. The front is probably the most controversial part of the car. This is caused by the preliminary pictures shown before the release of this car. In the early pictures the front of the car had smooth curves and beautiful lines, while the final car lost these smooth lines and got a more blocky look in return. I must admit that at a first glance, the new design lost some of it's appeal. However, this model grew on me pretty rapidly. The headlight design can be found, in more or less the same way, on several real Le Mans type race cars. THE REAR The rear of the car looks great, with the stickers continuing from the mudguards to the panels underneath the spoiler. The two exhausts sticking out give some details to the back. I absolutely disagree with all the negativity surrounding this car. Maybe it's one of those models which needs to grow on you. FINISHED MODEL Here it is, the finished model. I know some of you don't like the looks of the car, but I think it looks great. The color scheme is outstanding. The new (for Technic) bright green parts, combined with white and black make this car look very vibrant and colorful. I am not a big fan of the green used in the 42008 - Service Truck, but I do like this bright green a lot. It fits perfectly well with the Mindstorms EV3 set. The curves on the side of the car are not as smooth as some of us hoped, but I still think the car looks more than acceptable from the side. The stickers add some nice details to the car, giving it that characteristic race car look. The model looks great in pictures, but it does even look better in real life. I love this picture of the front of the car. However, I do wonder if a dedicated 24 hour Le Mans Racer has the seat and steering positioned off-center?! Using the good ol' Google Machine I come to the conclusion that they do have centered seating and steering, at least the majority of them. There's ample space in the cabin, which makes me wonder why TLG decided to place the seat off-centered. The rear view looks cool too, with some of the suspension showing and the two exhaust pipes clearly visible. The bottom view is very useful to determine the size of the car in studs. It measures approx 59 x 27 studs. The chassis looks organized and well designed. The engine has been placed close to the ground, which is perfect for the weight distribution. A low center of gravity improves the handling of the car. I really enjoyed building this baby. The build is very clean and organized, although there are some steps where you need to bend the beams a bit to get things into place. Seeing the model come to life and seeing it grow to pretty impressive proportions is very satisfying. For me it was fun, but I reckon kids will go nuts over this set and the build. SIZE COMPARISON What became obvious during the build, but what's emphasized when you have finished the model, is that it's quite big! The size of the car is pretty impressive. The pictures below show the car next to the 42030 - Volvo L350F. The side view emphasizes the size of the car. It's even longer than the Volvo, if you dismiss the bucket. PARTS LEFT Some parts left. Nothing out of the ordinary. FEATURES AND FUNCTIONS Unlike the B-model, this model doesn't implement any unexpected features. The functions it does implement are exactly what you would expect from any car. Steering (HoG) Working fake engine Suspension Opening doors (gullwing style) Opening bonnet/hood Opening trunk Gearbox for switching between functions Unfortunately the steering wheel hasn't been linked to the HoG (Hand of God) steering mechanism. Placing the seat in the center would have provided an easy way to link the steering wheel to the steering mechanism. it's a shame we hardly see actual steering anymore. Opening the hood actually opens up the entire rear section of the car, providing you with easy access to the motor compartment. The mechanism to open the hood works properly, which results in smooth opening and closing of it. The same goes for the gullwing style doors. Both functions are operated manually and you need to switch with the lever to the left of the cockpit. These two functions are also the ones which can be motorized by placing an M-motor near the cockpit and a battery box in the trunk. All things considered I think this car offers lots of playability. The model is solidly built and the functions are easy to operate. I'd say it's pretty safe to let your kids play with it. B-MODEL Unlike the A-model, the B-model for this set received (almost) universal acclaim, and I can see why. Often the B-model is a pale shadow of it's part donor. In this case the model looks so good, it could be a model of it's own. It even incorporates a neat feature, which actually deserves to be in the A-model. There's a lot a variation in the quality of digital building instructions TLG is providing, but these ones are of very high quality. The picture below shows most of the chassis with suspension, fake engine and gearbox in place. FINISHED MODEL Some concessions have been made, but overall the car looks fantastic. The black of the roof has been extrapolated from the hood, which definitely works for me. The rear section of the car feels a bit empty, but the panels do cover up most of it, so it's hardly noticeable. The V8 stickers will be upside down if you use the parts from the A-model. Since I could apply new stickers, I have placed them using the proper orientation. The bottom of the car shows the chassis. It's obviously a bit smaller than the A-model's chassis. FEATURES AND FUNCTIONS Taking the functions into account, this model isn't playing second fiddle to the A-model. Besides the obvious functions like steering, opening doors and hood, this car features folding fog lights, which deserve a better podium than a B-model. Steering (Hog) Working fake engine Suspension Opening doors (manually) Opening hood/bonnet (manually) Opening trunk (operated by gear) Folding fog lights (operated by gear) Gearbox (used to switch functions) FOG LIGHTS One of the most interesting features of the B-model are the folding Fog Lights. It almost feels a bit weird that a feature like this is implemented in the B-model, instead of the A-model. Below are 4 steps showing how the mechanism works. I have also included a video. The mechanism is somewhat reminiscent of fork mechanism used in the 8109 - Flatbed Truck, which has been described in Efferman's Review. Take a look at the video to the fog lights in action. PARTS LEFT A fair number of parts left, which isn't uncommon for a B-model. SUMMARY To summarize how I feel about this set, you need to take a look at the picture below. The combined image reflects the quality of this set....or better yet....sets! You actually get two great models, for the price of one. You don't like the A-model? No problem, you can have lots of fun with the B-model. I can't stop playing with the fog lights, it's mesmarizing. The color scheme on both models is outstanding. I simply can't emphasize enough how well this color scheme pleases the eye. The regular green is dull and boring, but this bright green really pops out, especially when combined with black and white, and possibly some red details. Black, white and a little red?! Sounds familiar? Yes, bright green can easily be combined with your EV3 robots. So while you are combining the bright green with your robot, why not use the great new curved "mudguard" panels. These new panels are introduced in this set and they look great. They open up a lot of possibilities in the design department. The build of the A-model is outstanding. It is fairly simple, but since it's so clean, I really enjoyed it a lot. I think the build should be entertaining, which doesn't mean it needs to be a real challenge. And let's be honest; when is a build really challenging?! The rear suspension is a good example of why I liked the build. It's very simple, yet very effective. Works like a charm. The same goes for the other functions in both models. And the star of the entire show can be found in the B-model. How's that for a surprise?! Being aware of the fact that I like this model a lot better than most of you seem to do, I really encourage you to give this model a chance. The sheer size is impressive, the color scheme is awesome and you get a bonus model, which is actually worth building. SCORE Okay, so how do I grade this set? 8 DESIGN Open to debate, but I like it a lot. 8 BUILDING EXPERIENCE Fun and clean build. 9 FEATURES Superb function in B-model steels the show. 9 PLAYABILITY Both models offer lots of playability 8 PARTS Lots of new parts and cool existing parts. 10 VALUE FOR MONEY Two models for the price of one. 8,7 TWICE THE FUN I hope you enjoyed this review!

Outstanding review Jim, congrats ! Love the pictures, so clean and crisp . Hope to see many more of your reviews. As for the set, after seeing this review I kind of like it, if I will find it at a decent price, I will get it for sure.	positive

Really thorough review, Jim. I am super jealous that you have 2 of these and I have none, with no opportunity to get one any time soon.	positive
Great review. I see now why the B model is so popular. I wonder though, on the car, if instead of the panels for the rear spolier (or wing) if they could have used studded panels and maybe layer them to give the appearance of, ie: a three element rear wing. I won't mention the front lights. If I had the money I would buy it for the B model. H	positive
Great review Jim and stunning pictures	positive
I think this set will be my next purchase. I love the color scheme and indeed it looks like a nice set. Also 1200 parts for EUR 100 is not a bad deal. And yes, the looks of the car have really grown on my since the first official pictures appeared. I'm curious how the bright green will work combined with other colors than white. I really hope more sets in the future will use the color (so that more different parts will be available over time). I think I'm the only person on Eurobricks who doesn't like the looks of the B model, but I appreciate the extra functionality it offers. Besides the set itself, I think this is one of the best reviews I have read in a while. Great job on the superb photographs (which I think are essential to a review) and the extensiveness of it all. You really touched every subject, which is great :D	positive
Fantastic review Jim, from the quality of the review alone it is easy to see how much hard work you have put into it. I'm with you on the instruction manual, I much prefer one quality bound book over umpteen stapled booklets. Already have 2 of these sitting in the build queue, one for display model as I'm a fan of this one and one to build the B model then dissemble for parts, so I'm already sold on his set but still very much enjoyed taking the time it deserves to read through the review and ogle at your pro photography.	positive
Great review with fantastic pictures. As for the model, I'm glad that they chose to make it less pretty - real Le Mans prototypes are rarely a sight to behold. It is function and aerodynamics over form. I would, however, have preferred more realism for the sake of learning: - The front shouldn't open like that - instead it should be easy to remove the whole front cover, leaving the suspension easy to work on. - The aero seems to be realistic, except for the rear end where there's no indication of a venturi channel. This should have been easy to include. - There is no fuel tank, nor fixed fuel connector right behind the cabin. - There are no air jacks! Seriously!? This is one of the most unique features of a race car like this... and LEGO forgot about them. Instead they automated two functions which are manual on a real race car. - The top cars at Le Mans are hybrids with ingenious systems. I would have loved to see the front wheels connected to some kind of spinning apparatus indicating a kinetic energy recovery system. If I get this set... I'm going to make some modifications.	positive
I was very skeptical of this set because I really thought the redesign degraded the looks of the A-model a lot, but after building it I must say this is an excellent set. Good job TLG!	positive
I'm still not a huge fan of the model, but this is one awesome review. The effort and quality can be clearly seen and I hope you continue making reviews like this	positive
Great review Jim.. I have been sitting on the fence about if I will get this set for a while but I saw one built for the first time at a local brick show on the weekend. It definitely looks better in real life than any pics. I have decided to buy one	positive

Thanks for the great review of this set. I've been looking forward to it as well and I am excited about the wireless controls like the Dino.

Ickel, thanks for that awesome review. It makes me want to buy this set. I think it'd go just swell with the Mobile Crane. The fact that it has all the motors and such is awesome, I can foresee using those for a lot of other functions for MOCs. And, well I'm a fan of treads. You can never have enough treads :-D Hm, would you be able to tell us, perhaps after a test or two what kind of weight this beast can push around? Thank you!	positive

Thanks for the review. I can't help but think the minifigures are the weak part of the set. Snake and Apu are great but the rest.... I don't know. They kinda redundant now. They could at least give us new torso printing, like Homer wearing his jacket or Bart wearing his blue t-shirt or Marge wearing her coat. Or, as I said in the discussion thread, I'd have included Jasper in CMF series 2 and a Frozen version here. Overall, the set looks kinda smaller than what I thought. (Snake's bag needed a $ symbol printed, because it looks like he is stealing gargabe ) Pretty good review overall	positive

I agree, but so many people were complaining about how The Simpsons House should have included the most common versions (mostly because the eyes or whatever), so I think LEGO played it safe and just included the normal versions. It makes sense, since Series 1 is gone forever, and the common versions were in there, and this set is bound to be in stock for a very long time like the Death Star. I never really agreed when people were complaining about the alternate eye prints personally, but I guess this is a good business choice based on previous feedback.

Hello everyone. Excellent review! English is not my native language, but I want to express my opinion. Simpsons house was the first of its kind, and I can say without exaggeration that this is the most impressive set that I'm going (my collection http://brickset.com/sets/ownedby-celeb ). I look at the video from the Kwik-e-Mart, and is difficult to say how good it is compared with the house. The main disadvantages that I said to myself, is this: build the walls of the large panels, next is access to the roof (gray parts in front of the back door (I think they represent the stairs)) is not on the level with doors on the roof and when you open them, you can see the white block is openly trash, my points of view. Boxes on the left of go to the store and powersauce box, i want see make real and not just a cube, f.e. such as in the unreleased Star Wars set. About minifigures, I fully agree with Robert8. Two more of the same Homer, Marge and Bart?! Personally, I put my set as a scene and all the replays minifigure are inside the house that was not identical characters next And also absolutely terrible Bart`s accessory This set is made parking for bikes and it looks very cool. But damn, it is hoped to see the Bart or Lisa's bike, instead of useless balloons with paint. The walls are made with convex inside panels, why so? can anyone know? have not seen any pictures with such walls in TV show. Why did not they turn? I personally really like how realized roof, but my brother says that it is terrible :) garden could do more in the series there were almost jungle I do not know how to be considered here, maybe anyone can express any opinion or idea? I look at the Simpsons house, and then look at the photo of this e-Mart. I can not understand, in the house we have a garage, two floors, cool floor, a lot of furniture, all the rooms and walls, collected from cubes, many additional accessories. And where is all this detail here? It looks much smaller (maybe even poorer). If they still will release next year comic book store, it will be even less? Of course it is difficult to estimate without seeing it live, we have it will be sold only in May. At first sight it does not look so impressive as the house. Can certainly the case in the limit on the amount of detail, but why it was impossible to add $ 50 to the cost and make Jasper, the more detailed the roof, the walls of the smaller elements, that it was not convex. Sad. Thanks all for attention. Edited by celeb, 13 April 2015 - 05:10 AM.	positive
Can you post a pic of it next to the simpsons house? just curious about size comparisons...	positive
I have sooo mixed feeling about that... I loved the Simpsons House (save for the terrible wall in the Homer and Marge's room), but this so far is inferior in almost every aspect. The walls made of panels is a bummer. I expect a D2C set to be better that this. 60+ stickers? The same thing. Same price for less bricks and smaller build then the house. Strange coloured bricks on the outside wall (some ugly mix of yellow + tan) Panels again with their fronts facing towards the inside of the shop so we and up with those squares all around. The walls are yellow, this was so nice, lost opportunity to make it in some other less common colour. Then again the set overall looks is good. The roof is a nice detail. The shop looks actually like a real one, not just an approximation of one. The roof tiles are in Dark Orange - we got new/rare colour here The car looks interesting to build (just like the pink one from the house) Lots of nice references to the show It's The Simpsons! Definitely a must buy... but for a discounted price. I'll try to find one with maybe damaged box or after-display copy. Edited by Mestari, 14 April 2015 - 01:15 PM.	negative

Here's a size comp to the house: Click for a bigger image.	positive
That's actually not bad sizing, IMO. Sure, it looks like you get a lot more with the house, but the Kwik-E-Mart has a lot more of those little references that make it Simpsons. I agree with some of the complaining; a real Jasper behind a trans-blue panel would have been cool. You could always bulk up the roof with more foliage... I think it has a great foundation as a set, but could do with a few mods to make it better. Thanks for the pictures; I greatly appreciate being able to see reviews like this before dropping $200 on a LEGO set.	negative
Great Review Just2Good, honestly I love this set lots of great details and references.	positive
One thing that may justify the price: it has 527 different parts (if I counted correctly). I alway heard the more different parts the more difficult the set is to produce. The Simpsons House already had an astonishig amount of different pieces, but this one is even more extreme...	negative

I recently acquired 90% of this set, so I thought I would do a review of it. Please note that half of the Mini-figs are wrong, and there are some part substitutions. This is the only set that comes with this plate. There is a depression under the grey plates to the back. The pool depression can be easily covered by three quarter circle plates... which just happen to be included in this set. (Good set design Lego!) The stairs are old Fabuland ones, and have been used in a few other sets. This is the only one that has them in "ParaPink" however. What is the difference between "ParaPink" and "Pink"? Dunno... The big windows are in only two other sets, both of them DACTA ones! The smaller ones were in one other Paradisa set. The interior, while simple, works very well. I love the coffee machine. A cute car came with the set as well. The bird house is a nice idea as well. Once the current visitors leave I will probably be breaking this set. I wish Lego would go back to these sets as they always had some great parts in them.	negative
Great review of a classic set. *y*	positive
Nice review of a surprisingly interesting set. *y* Those windows are great, and no doubt difficult to get. Classic coffee maker, simple yet exactly right. That baseplate was in a few other sets, but never with that pattern. Would have made a great base for some of the classic 80s houses LEGO used to treat us to. In tan was part of the Adventurers Egypt sets. As recently as 2001 it was a base for Ogel. Versatile plate that hopefully hasn't disappeared completely. ParaPink is apparently "Light Pink" on Brickshelf, so I guess it's just lighter than normal pink (and stopped appearing in 1995. Just so you know, that monkey is drinking too much and likely to fall in the pool ... ;-)	positive

*wub* *wub* *wub* *wub* *wub* Holodoc, I seriously have some love for your review!! You're in it and using a Fabuland wrench!!! Such a clever review with a great sense of humor! I really liked this train set and it adds so much to a train layout, especially when you buy multiples. TLC is throwing away a potential gold mine by discontinuing this line. :'-( It is also nice to see those beautiful consistent slopes in that picture. It really is sad that TLC is letting quality slip. They don't seem to be responding to the issue they way they did the bley/frown fiasco. perhaps we AFOL need to make more of a stink! To the embassy!!! >:-( Again great job Holodoc and thanks for sharing *sweet* *y* What an excellent and fun review!!	positive
Thank you guys for your nice reply. :'-) I have to add two pics of my freight train showing a bit more clearly what the size matter is about: This is what it looks like when you put the Hopper Waggon right behind the red car of 4512. It looks a lot better without the red car! I had a lot of fun with this review and I will add another one (look at the 2nd pic ;-) ) the next days. Stay tuned!	neutral

Great review, *y* I have just bought my first 9V motor and you have convinced me, I will buy a least two of this set. :-)	positive
Yes my SpongeBob fans, its time for another review !! Lets look at our Bikini Bottom map and head strait to meet Miss Puff at her Boating school. She is waiting for us to give us a guided tour of her establishment ;-) Another bit of SB history: this set comes from the following episode: Boating School: SpongeBob fails his boating test for the 38th time (what a freaking retard lool). He's so determined to get his license that Patrick decides to help him. He implants a walkie-talkie inside SB?s head in order to cheat and tell him what to do. You will say that I am biais but I really enjoy building this set and I really like the SB theme !! Lets hope 2008 brings more of that cool spongieness !! But I digress... Here are general pics of the instruction booklet and the DSS (G there are loads of crappy stickers in that one also !!). As you can see the set is divided in 3 polybags. Shamelessly (but nonetheless wilfully hehe), I will disregard the third one which is that playability crap course !! I would have reviewed it but since it involves stickers, I didn?t want to ruin the parts and without stickers it would look dull, plain and ugly (it does look crappy with so imagine without), so that review will not be 100% complete and I do apologise in advance. But how many of you would have build that and keep it hehe Off :-P 1/ Mfs and extras I will start with the really cool Miss Puff *wub* (the fig mind you !!). She looks a bit stressed !! No wonder, that sponge menace will bring her to the hospital once again hehe. As you can see, that MF comprises 3 parts: the small blue 1x1 round and the 2 major parts. Yeay another great stupid looking SB. I love those idiotic faces !! 3 different SB figs and 3 idiotic faces hehe. You never can get enough of them !! Here is just a regular Patrick. Too bad Patrick doesn?t have different expressions ! The pull back boat car: nothing really to report (except the fact that I left it sticker free !!) The only thing I built from the third polybag is that pretty cool ancker holding tower thingie !! Looks great in a lighthouse set hehe. Yes the roud tile bouey is printed !! Its the same as in SB's bed in the Bikini Bottom set ;-) OK, its time for those two great buildings: the lighthouse and the school + pontoon !! Before reviewing them individually, here is a general pic. 2/ The lighthouse One of the main reason to own that great set !! Sure it suffers from accute stickeretite (sad but :-D ). T worst is that door), but nonetheless a great and simple building !! Great white/red colour scheme, and a really fantastic 2 turning lights !! I really like the yellow top of the lighthouse, it adds to the comic atmosphere of that theme instead of having a more plain red/white only. The rear has nothing really fancy, except tools to fix it in case of problems hehe. The only thing I modified since I didn?t build the third polybag is that I got rid of the trechnic parts on the right of the lighthoue to replace them with regular ?logs? All hail the tower King !! :-D 3/ The school and pontoon I really like that little building and its great to see that once again TLC uses the amazing dark blue color !! Its really a simple design but looks fantastic and can be used for many things in a town hehe I also really like the combination with those dark bluish grey slopes !! The rear reveals the desk, stickers on the wall (d?oh !!) and two clams serving as chairs (really like on the show). Its really great to see that TLC stays really as close to the show as possible. The pontoon again is simple yet really cool and effective. And its really nice to have 2 lifesaving boueys. The only thing I modified since I didn?t build the third polybag is that I got rid of the trechnic parts in front of the pontoon to replace them with regular ?logs? On the overall, I think its really a great set !! Apart from the crap stickers, I think TLC should have ditched (or simplified) the third playability polybag to lower the cost !! Oh well, parts are always usefull (except those one part shitty palm trees !!). So until my next review, I bid you farewell my Spongebob fans !! And I really hope to see next year hehe Will SB get his driver?s license one day ? For the sake of Bikini Bottom, lets hope not !! No license ever On !! *yoda*	positive
That?s really a great and overall nice playset with a very cool Mrs. Puff and a fine new Spongebob! *sweet* The boating school?s indeed very nice with a beautiful color scheme, and so is the lighthouse.... I?m really tempted to buy a second set just to "complete" these buildings.... although it?s a little too expensive for doing so, and it wouldn?t even fit with the style of the other SB sets. X-D Wet highway to the poor puffer fish? privat hell on! :-D	positive
You've done it again. *yoda* ! Great reveiw. I really like this set, but in my opinon, $50 is steep considering I won't actually 'play' with it. I mean, half of it is a track for peat sake! Ill eventually get it for the Mrs. Puff figure, though. *y*	positive
I like this one better than the other one for parts and such, plus I'm generally a sucker for any different minifig, but yeah, that price is steep. Great review though!	positive
One more SB face - YEAH *wub*! Being a lighthouse freak I really like it, the trans clear blue ones rocks *y*! I?m getting it - period! SB On copmike	positive
Nice review !! I'm not a big fan of those Spongebob figs. However this set has some very useful pieces. This is actually the first time I took a decent look at a Spongebob set.	positive
Man, that Sponge-bob head cracks me up! Hilarity.This is a cool set, although I much prefer the Chum Bucket set. I don't see what's wrong with the course, then again I can see why AFOLs wouldn't like it. It's just playability really. I like the breakable wall though. The building is cool, a few modifications (i.e. making it more realistic, real chairs for a start) and it would make a cool little wharf for your Lego town. And to SW4J, Mrs Puff's legs are connected at the feet, if you look closely. So, thanks for the great review, *yoda*!	positive
Thank you *yoda* for strike 2! It?s SB again. |-/ Sticker Alarm! :-X But this set is better than Chum Bucket. There are far more interesting parts if you don?t like SB. Especially the light house and the little hut with the wooden pontoon. *y* And yet again another set with smooth slopes and rough ones... Too bad, too bad. >:-( >:-( >:-( If I just knew the person who is responsible for that... >:-)	positive
Nice review mate, the set look's great and a real must for all those SB fan's out there. The whole set scream playability that's for sure, which is great because let's be honest their's gonna be alot of kid's and *yoda* out their playing with it :-P X-D ;-) . Geezzzzz what is it with all those bloody stikers? This set would be soooooo much better with printed piece's instead of those, still once your over that at least the rest is ok. Am i the only one who thinks Mrs Puff kinda look's like a kinder egg toy? Their's nothing wrong with that mind you (yes i have a kinder problem X-D ) just seem's strange to me.	positive
Maybe mrs Puff has a nice toy inside X-D I like this review. The lighthouse part and the school are nice enough for other towns. and the figs are nice, even mrs puffs 2 pieces you can't use for other things. :-) Pity that it's 50 dollars/+/- 60 euro. for half price I would think about it.	positive

The set, and the other Designer sets that came out with it (especially 4888) are incredibly well designed sets. I wish Lego would go back to doing sets like these as I loved the multitude of instructions and ideas. The last batch of Creator sets had zero ideas, even though I know several were made. :'-( Anyway, less whining, more review. The lion is the main model. His mouth doesn't fully close, but it does open more. The head works well from most angles. I love the dark orange bricks; great for rust... He is quite solid, but the joints take the weight well. The neck goes side to side and rotates, but doesn't go up and down. The body is built in two parts and pinned in the middle. With what is left you can make what I think is a hyena, a silly plant MOC... ...and what I believe is a vulture. There are also instructions for a few other models including a bat, boar and a snake... which I quite like. He can be built at the same time as... ...this cute little lizard. Overall this is a great set with an excellent blend of colours and pieces. I wanted it for steampunk potentials. *sweet* I hope you liked the review. Till next time....	positive
The lizard looks the best to me - put him in a town and you've got a monster terrorising the residents. Dr. S.	positive
Great review as always! *y* LEGO is timeless, so there is no such thing as an old set. I never build brick monsters/creatures, but this set had such a nice assortment of parts that I had to pick a couple up as they weren't clearancing out on Shop @ Home. I absolutely love dark orange and tan, so it was an automatic win. I love the use of "familiar characters" in the review, I can almost hear Hinckley screaming, "my megabloks!" :-P You sort of look like you're planning some vulture stew though. Might have to start a new challenge to determine a winner there. Sinner and his Big Pot o' Doom VS Giant Vulture! Only thing is, does everything horrify the Mrs? She seems perpetually shocked and/or dismayed at the goings on here. Now that I think about it, I can see why. I'm occasionally shocked and/or dismayed 8-? Brick Built Beasties On! *y*	positive
A very fine review of a very fine set, thanks Sinner. *y* The variety of cool colors in that set?s just formidable. One more beautiful Creator set indeed! Roaarrrr on! :'-)	positive
Thank you for the nice review, Sinner! I also bought this set but in combination with 4883 when it was on sale (50% - hurray!) at S@H. I made a short review of 4883 but wasn?t really sure what to tell about 4884. So I?m glad you did that for me. :-D I have different feelings about this set. On the one hand I love the lion. He is really impressive (even my wife -not known for being Lego enthusiastic- asked me, if there were more animals of this kind). The lion is - restricted - poseable and the colors used are fantastic. *wub* 3 models can be built simultaneously - that?s great! On the other hand I still don?t know what to do with these rotation joints. *wacko* And the other models are somehow disappointing compared to the lion. I seem to have missed the little lizard. :-$ I put it on my "to do-list". Like all the Creator sets: Great parts pack - but wait until they get on sale! X-D For me - I had a lot more fun with 4883. Indeed: Roarrrr ON! ;-)	neutral

Sigh, I really REALLY wanted to buy this when it was on sale on S@H and I never did and now it's no longer available :'-( It's a great set with a nice amount of bley, but a crapload of tan. It's like the perfect way to increase your tan supplies... Nice review you lucky aussie	positive

LEGO 75915 Pteranodon Capture I'm glad to review this nice set; 75915 Pteranodon Capture Name: Pteranodon Capture Set Number: 75915 Pieces: 174 Price: $19.99 Minifigs: 2 Theme: Jurassic World Year of Release: 2015 Links: Box The front of the box has the Jurassic World logo along with the set number, piece count, etc. Its a decent box size for a $20 set. Here it is compared to a minifigure. Here's the back of the box. It shows all of the features from the set an ad for the video game. The back also shows a small picture with a silhouette of the dinosaurs from the line, along with their set numbers. Instruction Booklet The booklet shows the same thing as the front of the box, nothing more, nothing less. Near the back of the booklet, there is a picture with all of the characters from the sets. The other page shows all the dinosaurs with a mini box that shows the size comparisons. The Minifigures The minifigures in this set are Simon Masrani and an ACU. Both of them have excellent printing on the front and the back. The gun is the same one from TLM that the SSP used. Simon Masrani is the only one with a double sided face. His second face shows a scared/worried exp<b></b>ression. He has a zipped up jacket or jumpsuit with a shirt underneath. The ACU trooper only has one face which is a scared/worried exp<b></b>ression. I would have a scared exp<b></b>ression too if I was about to get eaten by a dinosaur. He has great detail on his torso and legs. Let's take a look at the vest. The vest is the same mold from the SSP in TLM I think. It has the letters ACU on the front too. The back is nothing interesting. Pteranodon The pteranodon has great printing too. The colors match the ones that the pteranodons from the movie have. The wings, mouth, and head are a rubbery type of plastic and are easily bendable. It uses the same mold from the pteranodon in the 2012 Dino line. Here's a comparison between the two. Spare Parts The spare parts aren't many, just a few extras. The Helicopter At first the helicopter was 'meh' when I first saw it on the box. Now that I've built it, I've got to say that I really like it. Its my favorite helicopter of all of the ones I've built. Its sturdy and sleek. It's not too bulky either. The first play feature in this set is the net launcher. It works pretty well, not one of my favorite features but it does what it's meant to do. The other play feature is on the other side. Its a stud shooter which can be used by a minifigure. You can put it on their hand or you can leave it there and let someone operate it. The shooter can fold up inside the helicopter as well. There are stickers on both sides of the helicopter and they also have the Jurassic World logo with Dino marks. Final Verdict Value: 9/10 - For $20 this set isn't that bad. The parts count is a little low for a $20 set but the price is probably because of licensing. Other than that, it's a great deal, I would've hoped for maybe some bait for the pteranodon but that can easily be fixed. Design: 9/10 - I REALLY love the way this helicopter looks, it's sleekness and design is great. The only flaw this has is the huge net launcher, it's too big in my opinion. Minifigs: 10/10[/b] - The minifigures are extremely detailed and it even includes an exclusive minifigure. Playability: 9/10 - There are many things you can do with this set. The swoosh factor is great and so are the play features. Parts: 10/10[/b] - They're useful parts and there isn't many huge specialized pieces in here either. Overall: 9/10 - This set is great for fans of Jurassic World, it's also a nice parts pack. There's one exclusive minifigure in here too which makes it even better. Having a little fun with the set Hope you liked my first review here on Eurobricks! Please leave any suggestions on what to improve, thanks! Edited by TheLazyChicken, 02 May 2015 - 10:19 PM.	positive
Thanks for the review! I really like this set. I love the ACU minifigures and the dinosaur is really nice. I think the helicopter has great potential for a SHIELD helicopter. Only suggestion is that some of your pictures are a little bit dark. (Especially the box front one) But really good for your first review! Thanks a lot!	positive
I love the dinos in these sets but aside from that the builds IMO kind of suck just like the last Dino sets. This just has a franchise connected to it. And honestly I hope it does well enough to spark more Dino/Jurassic Park-World interest because I want to see MORE Dino "minifigures". Maybe a Brontosaurus or something. I will most likely be buying many of the Dinosaur minifigures here. However I doubt I'll buy the actual sets or the genetically altered dinosaur (which can only work for Jurassic World). This set is IMO average. Love the dinosaur...	negative
Nice review! Although, that picture of the ad reminded me of how some of the things surrounding Jurassic World (Lego, that is) seems hastily put together. Just look at that the minifig. He is Star Lord's head and hair, Indiana Jones' torso with different arms, and City legs. To me, that seems a bit weak, especially for a video game.	neutral

Yesterday I went to Toys 'r Us and bought the Dilophosaur Ambush. Beside that the shop had a display of the JW polybags. For €3,49 I picked up two of them. Now here is my little review of this pretty nice set. First some data: Line: Jurassic World Year: 2015 Pieces: 29 Price: €3,49 Packaging: Polybag Ok, lets start with the polybag itself. It is a standard size and had plenty of room for all the parts. The front depicts the whole set with a little hexagon on the right with a seperate picture of the dinosaur and its name. In this case the Celophysis is called Gallimimus. Weird choice Next is the instruction sheet. It is a doublesided paper with every building step in clear sight. The part selection is nice. There are only a few but all of them are pretty usefull for all kind of builds. There are two parts which stood-out. Both are printed tiles. The first one is the yellow/black warning tile in 1x4. You can't have enough of that. The second one is a 2x2 tile with the Jurassic World logo on it. That's pure awesome. The bigger sets seem to have only sticker for that, so this little set is a perfect way to get hold of this nice tile. The leftovers. Nothing special. Here is the complete trap. It is a basic build and functions pretty well. In the end the parts are more interesting as the build so it will definitely end up as a parts-pack. Now on to the star of this bag. The Celophysis/Gallimimus. I don't know why Lego decided to call this dinosaur mold any different, but I think it has to do with movie-connection and the will to not produce a new mold. Nevermind, this figure is great and the colour is very bright and totally stood out. Pretty beastie. A comparison between the 2015 Gallimimus and the 2012 Celophysis. The final set in all its glory. Final verdict: It is a great little set. The parts used a nice and usefull. The printed tiles are the secret stars of this set and the dinosaur is fun two. With a few packs of these you could easily build a Celophysis pack with lots of Jurassic World signs on their way. Highly recommended.	positive

Lego 31036 Creator Toy and Grocery Shop Thanks to EuroBricks for making this review possible! For years, Lego has offered a house of some sort in the Creator line each year - with the standard Creator 3-in-1 instructions, that's given us a very wide variety of housing. In 2014, they added a business option with their 31026 Bike Shop and Cafe set. This continues into this year's Toy and Grocery Shop set. These shops are smaller than the very detailed modular buildings, but that should help them fit in better with the other City sets, and this also lets them get into more kids' cities with their lower pricetag. Name: Toy and Grocery Shop Set Number: 31036 Pieces: 466 Price: $39.99 Minifigs: 2 Theme: Creator Year of Release: 2015 Links: Bricklink Peeron Brickset The Box The front of the box shows the "A" version model out of the three, plus insets of the B and C versions. I like the sorta-European looking backdrop; it goes well with the styling of the buildings. Interestingly, the main model is shown opened up for play, while the two insets show those versions folded. The Box Top On the top of the box, Lego helpfully shows that with 3 of these sets, you can make a whole street. The Box Back On the back, you get to again see all three versions together, but this time, folded. It's a little creepy though with those clones running around :) The Manuals Yep, three actual, printed manuals. There's nothing indicating them as being A, B, and C models, but it's pretty obvious looking at the designs which is the "main" model and which are the alternates. The Contents Bags of parts and two plates. Nothing terribly exciting to see here.... The Minifigs Nothing new here, but two nice figs none-the-less. Well, Bricklink does say that both figs are unique to this set, but there's not any new parts to them. The closest thing to rare is the female head - it's only in this set, 2013's Dragon Mountain Castle set, a UK store grand opening set, and one of the 2014 Holiday freebie sets. The faces aren't that unique, but I guess this exact combo of two faces on the head is. I love the kid torso with the spaceman on it. The Minifig Backs No back printing on anything here except for an alternate female face. Sorry. I do like that her two faces are so different though. That's much better than when a head has a "scared" and a "more scared" face. The "C" Build Enough with the basics; let's build. I'm going to review them in the same order I built them, backwards. Since you can tell immediately looking at the 3 designs that they're going to use different numbers of pieces and so forth, I figured I'd build the smallest first lest it seem like a letdown. All three have some basic similarities - the two plates are hinged to give a building that opens for play. They also do have interiors, which you can see starting to form here. The "C" Build, Front It's a pretty quick build, so it's done already. Here's the front of the building with it opened up. Like this, it appears to be two separate stores, a newsstand and some sort of shop you can enter. All the printed tiles help give the newsstand a detailed appearance, but I'm not sure why they've got a $100 bill lying on the ledge... The "C" Build, Rear From the back side, the interiors are pretty plain. The shop half has a plant in a jar and a weird chair, and the newsstand just has a register. The "C" Build, Sides Here's the two sides of the folded building. On the hinge side, there's a bunch of windows in a disjointed wall with random colors. On the other, why did they put in a huge window when the set does include a trans-clear door that could have gone there? And you get a small patch of plants, like so many sets seem to have these days. The "C" Build, Extras That's a lot of leftovers there. And not just little stuff - multiple doors, stairs, etc. And unused sand green is always a little sad.... The "B" Build, 1 A pretty similar start, with the hinge and little garden and some tiles along the ground. The "B" Build, 2 Now we see a big windowed wall, some details like lights, and how it has the usual alternate model "weird part usage" - like a 1x4 brick with side studs being used over the doorway, even though those side studs will not get used. The "B" Build, Front The finished building gives us a nice little post office, with a letter-carrying bird on the roof. Hope that's not their normal method of delivery! Something about the colors just doesn't work for me though. The combo of white / light grey / dark grey / black / sand green plus tan is just too much. The tan window and door frames I don't like. The "B" Build, Inside On the inside, things are weird. The counter on the left is ok, but the light above the door (with a yellow clip? ugly!) is too big, and everything else over there by the door doesn't make much sense either. The "B" Build, Sides I like the front side here, except the colors are still too much. The bench, greenery, mailbox on the corner, and streetlight are all nice. The boy is a little creepy though - binoculars in hand PLUS a telescope on the roof of the post office? Why? The hinge side shows more of the weird colors you get in the wall, but that's going to be hidden when the set is open. Plus we even see that on big modulars at times, so it's not SO terrible. The "B" Build, Leftovers Again, a lot of leftover parts. It's obvious this was another alternate, but it'd be nice to see more of them used to make a bigger building. But let's move on to the model that DOES use them all... The "A" Build, 1 The first half starts like this. Maybe it's just my bias, but it already feels like a more detailed build. Bottles on the wall, the yellow and red awning over the window, etc. The "A" Build, 2 The other half starts off with detailed work too. I think that's a red vending machine. The stairs are also VERY solidly built. I also appreciate the effort to get that diagonal base where a door will be - it's such a nice touch to have sections of a building that aren't right angles. The "A" Build, 3 Not too much has been added, but I wanted to showcase the tiny toys before they get hidden by a wall. That robot and train are just fantastic little micro builds. The "A" Build, 4 Things are coming together quickly. The walls, windows, and doors get the first floor nearly done. I'm still not big on the sand green and tan combo, but I do really like the red and yellow awnings. The "A" Build, 5 It appears the shop owner lives upstairs, since we've got a bedroom forming here. The bed is a little plain, but the table and lamp on the other half are great. And my big fingers did not like putting all those railings on the balcony, with the telescope posts and tile tops. Knocked quite a few off before I got them all done. The "A" Build, Front And it's done. All the details make this set really feel like a mini-modular. The roofline has great greebling, and the shop contents, and on and on. It's not perfect though. The tiny car above the toy store door isn't nearly as good as the toys inside. And the kid's yellow scooter? The wheels aren't even on the ground, much less able to roll. The scooter looks decent though, so that counts for something. Well, at least as long as you are at this angle, since the boy's only got 1 foot on the 1 stud wide scooter. The "A" Build, Inside Most of the interior has been seen already. The roof though does a nice job of being interesting for a roof. A skylight, the edge rails, etc. And you can see there's not much "wrong color" in the walls. The "A" Model, Sides An interesting building when folded up. Very tall and skinny. You can tell it's not really meant to be displayed this way - it's meant to be open. The good - lots! I like the awning, the diagonal door, the flowerbox under the upper window, the folding gate on the balcony that lets it be used in open or closed mode, and the green / white / blue colors. The bad - well, the stairs end short of the upper door, I still don't really like the tan doorframes (I think black would have been better), and why don't the upper floors match up in size? The "A" Model, Leftovers Ah, that's more like it. Just a few small pieces left as spares. The Errors You might have to click through to the full-size versions, but I did catch a few weird errors in the manuals. First, in the photo of the newsstand, the map in the front corner is on there sideways. The map does have a clear north arrow printed on it. On the second image, the boy's feet are hanging off the edge. Just unusual to see an alignment error in the manual like that. The Comparison Here are this set and the modular Detective Office side by side. There's a huge difference - as you'd expect. But is the difference MORE than you'd expect? This set is 466 parts, $40. The DO is 2262 pieces and $160. 5 times the parts, 4 times the price. Looking at them side by side, I'd expect a bigger difference in both. The Conclusion So, what's my conclusion on this model? I love the main model, but the alternates are meh. It's a nice set for someone looking for a town building other than police and fire stations, but who isn't ready to move to the modular line. Compared to the modulars though, it seems overpriced. Part of that is because the huge modulars are actually a great deal compared to other Lego sets. I'm also a little surprised that it's so small, when you compare it to the City sets like a police station. Those are generally designed with much more open space, letting them be more of a playset. This one is small and cramped, so it'd be tougher to play in. It's not really a City set though. The Ratings Value: 7/10 - It's under the 10 cents a part mark, but that's largely due to having a TON of tiny parts. All those flowers and decorative 1x1 round studs add up quickly! Design: 7/10 - Good and bad on the colors, and there's a big difference between the quality of the main vs alternate models. Having so many leftover pieces is one thing when the Creator set makes 3 very different models (ie a boat, plane, and truck). When it's 3 buildings, it seems wasteful to have so many parts leftover. Minifigs: 6/10 - I'm not sure they both fit the set. I suppose the boy is going to the toy store and the woman is going to the grocery? But there's no storekeeper in either. The woman doesn't look like a storekeeper to me, so that's why I assume she's another shopper. I love the boy, but the woman is just so-so - except that I do appreciate the head having two very different expressions. But again, that doesn't fit the set. I can't see her scared face being used. Playability: 6/10 - The shops are detailed with registers and so forth, but it's all so tiny it'd be hard to play with the figs in it. Parts: 9/10 - Tons of windows and doors, plus nice sand green bricks. But some things (the large blue curves used on the roof for example) are weirdly specialized and would be hard to use in another building design. Overall: 7/10 - I'd recommend doing what I did - build the alternates first, then the main since that's how you'll want to leave it. I'd really like to see the price a little lower compared to other sets (again, the part count is inflated due to SO MANY tiny parts) and the finished building is tiny, but it's loaded with neat details.	positive
A terrific, very comprehensive review - but I'm not at all impressed with this set. It feels like a mishmash of bricks with no clear design aesthetic and as such blatantly underdeveloped (i.e. designed to hit a price/brick count point rather than provide a solid set in the Creator Town tradition). Compared to other Creator sets at this price point (31025 - Mountain Hut, for example) it feels utterly uninspired and ugly. Edited by Johnny6666, 04 May 2015 - 10:02 AM.	negative

Cheers for putting in the time to create a wonderful review. I am not a huge fan of this set; I like the colour combinations, but it all seems a bit all-too-simple. It can (and will) be nicely modularised, though!	negative
Reviews for this set really should picture them next to the Bike Shop & Cafe, which it's intended to be compatible with right down to the size of the baseplates and grey tiles around the edge. It doesn't look that great on its own, but if you add the two sets together you get something that begins to look like a street scene.	positive
This seems like half of a set compared to the previous Bike Shop/Cafe. As I like many of the elements, I will probably buy a second one and build a mirror image version (making one entirely a toy shop and the other a book store/news stand) and adjust the sidewalks to work with the previous model. Then I think they will work well together. I remember a little area in Copenhagen that had this sort of architecture. I would hope the subsequent models are better deigned to create more complex alternatives, but these are both good starting points for original or enhanced models.	neutral
Thank you Andy for your speed review! *y* So there?s nothing left to open while advent? ;-) I like all the tiny sets, it needn?t be another police- and fireman |-/ , but well, what would an advent calendar be without them? :-D One thing about the train traffic lights: TLC used to give us similar lights, but you could show either of the lights with the other one being covered: That one was waaay better! :'-( Just a little piece more would have done the thing... ...and I won?t mention the radar-crap-dish :-X Let me quote Franz Beckenbauer: "Is' denn scho' Weihnacht?"

Informative review, thanks! *y* As usual, it makes a fairly good parts pack. Wish I could pick up a few on deep discount, but at full price one is fine. I do like the 'stewards' and some of the workmen. Overall, I think I'm looking more forward to the Belville calendar, just for it's assortment of unusual parts. Ugh. Belville. Still, parts are parts, and it's got some. Phoinix summed up one of the most common complaints I hear about all of the lines in 3 simple words ... "no girls....AGAIN!"

Thanks Andy for the review! I prefer the city advent calendar 2006 a lot! Those mini sets are nor good for me! The "road subtheme" sets are nice, but the others, not so good! The 05 version waf ok, the 06 version was better, with bigger sets, and more building ones! And the 07 is poor! It's just 2-3 pieces to put together on 2x4 plates... Where are the gardening accessories? Where are some nice small constructions that you can put in your layout like a mailbox or an orodator? And the chrismas tree looks :-X IMO!

I'm a big fan of anime and have watched some mechas like Full Metal Panic, Neon Evangelion: Genesis (it is a mecha!) and Chobits (Well... She is a robot...), so I was curious to see what this new Exo Force line was all about. The colorful sets and manga-like characters didn't persuade me right away, but the urgent need for a couple of white 3x3 wing plates made me purchase this little thing. It cost me 70 DKR as you can see on the box. This is 9.30 euro, or about the same an American has to pay for the new Republic Cruiser. Pretty expensive for so few pieces (90 + a spare technic pin) The box An action-packed box with one of the sides being oddly empty except from the LEGO-logo. What's inside There is a small building instruction, two polybags (no bag building here) and a sticker sheet with alarmingly many stickers. The build It takes so little time to build this set that I didn't get to take any pictures of the process. Every step was accompanied by an element description although I doubt most of you will need that with so few pieces to keep track on. Most of the dark green bricks have a sticker - even the slopes where the rough surface makes stickers fall off easily! There should also have been a sticker on the windshield, but I wanted to keep that piece clean for better usage later. (I'm one of those who keeps stickers on the bricks) The model You want to see this model from the front, as the back is pretty much neglected There isn't much for the pilot to grab a hold on either. He is pretty much a sitting duck up there with the screen giving him only partial cover. There is a huge wrench next to him which kind of symbolizes the crudeness of the mech. The set isn't called "Cyclone Defender" for nothing. The right arm might hold an ordinary light assault riffle, but the other has a spinning disc with samurai swords which you can turn with the yellow knob on the backside. Those of you who have seen Robot Wars might remember the incredible power of this melee weapon from a robot named Hypnodisc. It would have been nice had there been a pull-back motor to power the disc (I'm sure LEGO has a lot of these in stock), but the simple mechanism still works reasonably well. The riffle comes off and a pin makes it easy to hold with the hand, but the disc is fixed to the arm. It is also a problem that the swords get misaligned quickly during play. The minifig I really like this minifig because of the neat idea with an expression on each side that LEGO has made a standard for Exo Force. Posability Most mech-moc'ers show off their creations using Gundam-like poses. With two joints per leg (one being the ankles) and one for an arm I thought of some less serious poses: Crawling (Silent like a ninja!): Belly gliding: Kick off!; Upside down: Final Rating I have to disappoint you here. This is my first set in this line and I have absolutely no idea of how good it is. The last robot I bought was the awesome 6889 Spyrius Recon Robot for the same price, but it is in a completely different genre. The set had what I expected (two white wings) and is as such a no-nonsense set. I guess it would be of more use if you have some more Exo Force, which I don't. 6/10 Ups: Has great minifig, weapons and is easy to build. Downs: Crude design and a bit too expensive for what you get. (Brickshelf gallery)	neutral
A funny review with cool pics, thanks Lasse D. A somehow mediocre mecha design, but a beautiful dark green color! Upside down mecha yoga exercises on! :-D	positive
Nice review :) But... You paid HOW much? This set is priced around 7 Euros here in Germany, which is a very fair price for what you get in my oppinion. It?s a little disappointing though, that I couldn?t think of any alternate builds for this set, and there are no inspirations on the box or the EF website.	neutral

Great review Lasse D. A definite two *y* up. I bought this set for the swing-wing concept. I was very curious what TLC's design was like. I have been working on modifying it just a little to look more like the F-14. So far I have completed the back section, but I need to finish the cockpit. Overall this is a great set.

this is a really great set! when i first saw it i thought "oh a silly small plane who needs that" and then i got it and i am very happy that i did! this is one of the best designed lego creator sets! and it was designed by the designer of the Cafe-Corner!!!!	positive
A fine set, a great review and good additional pictures. Thanks Lasse D and Sinner. Teamwork on! *y*	positive
Thank you Sinner for bringing the pictures of the hovercraft. I think it is a really cool model, but The steering wheel doen't work too well. It doesn't turn easilly all the way around and when the craft turns, it doesn't stay stable on the three wheels because the front wheel turns quite alot into the opposite side. Now to the third model! This is quite a basic helicopter with the functionality of having the rotors turning. It doesn't use that many of the bricks and doesn't even have a landing gear. I have a question to all of you. As you can see, I prefer to show one or two large pictures and have the rest as clickable thumbnails. Most people use only the relatively big (typically 640x480) pictures so that you don't have to follow links. What do you prefer? It is no problem for me to do it the other way, but I would like to know if you have any preferences.	neutral

It is no secret that Marvel is one of the most successful companies right now. From the Avengers to the X-Men and down to even the most obscure characters like Ant-Man, every one of their movies has been a big hit until now. The latest Marvel movie, Fant4stic, was released last month and while I have not seen it yet, I'm sure it's just as great as their other movies. I mean, it has the word "Fantastic" in the title after all! And being the smart business that they are, The Lego Company decided to get in on the hype early and capitalize on this movie's undoubtful success two years in advance by making a set featuring Fant4stic's main villain, Dr. Doom. Now that's what I call forward thinking! But did they do a good job with it or were they being overhasty? Let's find out! Set Number: 76005 Name: Spider-Man: Daily Bugle Showdown Theme: Marvel Super Heroes Subtheme: Ultimate Spider-Man Year of Release: 2013 Pieces: 476 Minifigs: 5 Price: $49.99 USD S@H description: Quote Swing into the Daily Bugle and stop Dr. Doom™! Dr. Doom™ and his henchman Beetle™ are attacking the Daily Bugle in their speedy jet to steal Spider-Man's™ secret identity. It's up to Spider-Man™ and Nova™ to swing in and stop them! Trigger the Daily Bugle's explosion functions to cause destruction as the jet fires missiles! Stop Dr. Doom™ from hitching the jet's anchor hook to the safe with Spider-Man's secret inside! Knock Beetle™ off the building with the swinging web attack and drop Dr. Doom™ inside with the rooftop trapdoor! Then fly Nova™ in through the broken window with the dumpster catapult function and send those villains back to where they came from. Includes Spider-Man™, Nova™, Dr. Doom™, Beetle™ and J. Jonah Jameson™ with accessories and weapons. The first thing that comes to mind after reading this description is: Wow, that's a lot of TMs! Anyway, here are some resource links for this set: Brickset Bricklink Rebrickable The Box Since this set is based on the Ultimate Spider-Man cartoon, the box has the usual USM design with the red Marvel Super Heroes background, an illustration of Spidey in the upper right corner, and the USM logo in the lower right. As usual, there is a minifig line up in the lower left, and since this was before the terrible redesign, you can see the full body of the minifigs. I really miss this type of line up. There is quite a lot going on here: Doctor Doom attacking the Daily Bugle in his jet while simultaneously reaching for J. Jonah Jameson below with his jet's claw, Spider-Man (reluctantly) swings in to save him, while Nova fights off the Beetle. It's a pretty cool scene, even though it's not very accurate to the show. In "Beetle Mania", the episode that this set is based on, the Beetle was indeed out to kill JJJ, but it was in order to stop him from exposing his identity, not Spider-Man's (although Spidey was next on JJJ's list). And while he is a recurring villain on the show, Doctor doom had nothing to do with this plot and didn't even appear in the episode aside from a brief cameo. It's awesome that they included him anyway, though, so I'm not gonna complain. Note that the tower is so tall that it wraps around the top of the box. There, you can also see a scale reference with the Spider-Man minifig. On the back of the box, you can see the interior of the Bugle and all of its play features which there are quite a few of since this is a playset. It's all illustrated pretty well, although Lego's choice of sound effects is still a mystery to me. I don't get why they don't go for Spider-Man's signature "Fwip!" instead of "Fazzing!" and I didn't know that a breaking window made the sound "Btoom!" but I digress. Contents Inside the box you will find three instruction booklets (one smaller than the others), a comic book, a fairly large sticker sheet, five numbered bags, and two loose pieces: A white string piece and a gray 16x8 plate. There aren't really any notable pieces and nobody cares about the comic bock (no offense to the artist), so lets get right to the instructions. They are pretty straight forward and easy to follow. Some of the pages have a ghostly image of Spidey, Nova, and Dr. Doom in the top right corner which is fitting since these are all minifigs that appear in this set (which is strangely not something that can be said for many other Super Heroes instructions with this type of artwork). Minifigures As with most Super Heroes sets, most people will get this set mainly for the minifigs, so without further ado, let's talk about them. Spider-Man is the same old bootless one you get in almost every USM set. Not much to say about him. Some might complain that we don't get Spidey's alter ego Peter Parker in this set, but in the USM cartoon, MJ is actually the one who works at the Daily Bugle, not Peter. Curse the creators of this cartoon for ruining our chances of getting a new Peter Parker minifig by trying to mix things up. Next we get J. Jonah Jameson. He appeared in a Spider-Man 2 set before, but this is a complete redesign. He now has a blue suit with a red tie, a unique face print, and that combed-back hair in dark gray. This new hairpiece doesn't suit him at all and the old flat top hair was perfect for him in my opinion, so I don't know why they changed it. The good thing about this change, however, is the fact that this piece is exclusive to this set in that color. Nova on the other hand is spot-on. He comes with a new helmet mold and some nice torso printing. However, he, too, is missing his boots. TLC should have started making dual-colored legs a long time ago. Here are some reference images to compare them to. Okay, so JJJ's hair may not be completely black in the show, but I still think they should have given his minifig a black hairpiece. His suit is also not quite the right color. He rarely appears in person in the show (including the episode this set is based on) and is usually seen on screens around New York, so this is the best picture of him I could find. I guess I should be happy they included a minifig of him at all. In the episode, it was actually Mary Jane who was at the Bugle during Beetle's attack, so it would have made more sense to include her, but we got her in the Spider-copter set one year later, so that's ok. All three of them have back printing. In JJJ's case I'm using that term loosely since it is only comprised of two lines, but it's nice that they went through the trouble of adding them. Both JJJ and Nova come with angry alternate faces. It almost looks like they're trying to out-angry each other. Who do you think looks angrier? Let me know in the comments section below. Now let's talk about the bad guys. Even though he would be better off in a Fantastic Four set, it's great to finally get Victor Van Doom, one of the greatest Marvel villains ever and in comics in general. He comes with a dark green hood which was new and exclusive in that color at the time, and he is the only minifig in this set that has leg printing. Beetle is a regular minifig with wings. The metallic printing on his face and torso is pretty nice, but I wish it would have continued onto his legs as well. The Beetle looks quite accurate to his on-screen counterpart. The only thing that could have improved him is a new helmet mold with pointy eyebrows/antennae. Doctor Doom, however, looks nothing like he does in the movie. I just don't understand how Lego could have messed him up so badly. Maybe they were working off of early concept art or something. Here is a back view of Doom and Beetle. Beetle would be a pretty boring minifig if it wasn't for his wings which are awesome with their holographic texture. They are so mesmerizing, I could look at those things all day. This piece also appeared in trans. light green in the Galaxy Squad sets which came out at the same time. Here they are without their gear. As you can see, they both have back printing as well. And no, Doctor Doom does not come with an alternate facial expression, which is fine since you can't see much of his expressions due to his mask anyway. Here's a look at Dr. Doom and Nova without their headgear. Some say that Doom's face looks too cartoony, but I think it looks fine. Nova is wearing stylish goggles as a way of explaining his white eyes. It's a far better explanation than the Bat-sweatband. They did the same thing with the masked Wolverine later. Here are all the figs with their accessories. JJJ comes with a camera so that he can take "more pictures of Spider-Man!" Beetle comes with one of those overused ADU guns which is a very poor representation of his wrist-mounted blasters. I hate to say it, but even those bulky new stud shooters would have been a better representation of his weapons. Spidey comes with his usual string of webbing and Nova comes with some Iron Man style translucent studs. The weird thing is that they are red while his powers have a blue glow in the show. Doctor Doom sadly doesn't get any accessories, but who needs weapons when you have a jet with a claw and flick-fire missiles. The Build The first bag contains Spider-Man, a brick separator, and the parts to build the ground floor of the DBC building. After a quick and straight-forward build, you get this. The dumpster and street lamp are separate from the building and since the lamp post is not built onto any baseplate and is quite top-heavy, it gets knocked over pretty easily. Maybe it's meant to be that way, but I would have preferred it if you could stick it onto the baseplate of the building on which there is unfortunately not enough space to do so. As you would expect, the second bag has the parts for the first floor of the building. This is also the bag that contains Beetle. After another fairly simple build, you'll find yourself with a two story building with a spiderweb one side and a fire escape on the other. However, you have to apply three stickers during this section of the build which is never fun. Can you guess what's in bag number 3? Yup, the second floor of the building. You don't need superpowers to predict that one. Also, this bag contains Nova and Jameson. The build of this section is a bit repetitive since the second floor is mostly the same as the first and it takes slightly longer to build since you have to build the rooftop as well. Also, in addition to the two window stickers you have to apply ten 2x2 tile stickers! Trying to do this without having any of them being crooked is a real pain in the megablocks. The next bag contains Doctor Doom and the cockpit of his jet. Doom's cape is in the usual square white box and the string for the claw is folded up in a piece of tape. Here's what you get at the end of this section. Looks more like an escape pod than a jet at this point. The final bag is the smallest as it only includes the few parts needed to finish the Doom jet. Once you build the wings and tail, you stick them onto the cockpit via Technic pins and you're done. Spare Parts These are the parts that are left over after the build. There is the brick separator of course, an extra antenna, and the usual little bits and bops. What's really awesome, though, is that they give you an extra pair of Beetle's wings! Considering what a neat piece this is and that this is the only set in which it comes in trans-black make this a very welcome spare that you can use in your customs. The Finished Set Here is the complete set. The DBC building looks quite tall, especially when you count the antenna. Comparing it to a screenshot from the episode, the general look of the building is there, although there are some inaccuracies. Aside from the fact that it is obviously way down-scaled, the screens that show JJJ ranting about Spider-Man should have been hexagonal, not square, and should have wrapped around the building. However, considering how many stickers you would have had to apply if they would have made it accurate, I'm actually glad they kept the screen mercifully small. Much like Doctor Doom himself, the Doom jet didn't actually appear in the Beetle Mania episode. However, it did appear in a later episode titled "Not A Toy" in which Spider-Man plays around with Captain America's shield, accidentally drops it in Doctor Doom's Latvarian embassy and has to try to retrieve it. And yes, that episode was as godawful as it sounds. Here's a screenshot of the jet from that episode. Like with the DBC, they managed to capture the general shape of the vehicle, although it doesn't look quite as good as in the show. The color scheme is too dark and it looks kind of blockier. Let's take a closer look at the jet. There is no real way to reel the claw in unfortunately. However, there is a stud on the back of the jet that you can stick it onto. Needless to say, this is not the ideal way of storing it. I would have much preferred it if they would have attached it onto winch instead. The engines on the wings can be turned, even though they don't turn in the show, and there is a flick-fire missile on each side. Even if it's not much to look at, at least it's a very swooshable vehicle. On top of each wing there is a tile with the emblem of Latvaria. There was no such emplems on the jet in the cartoon, but they are useful pieces that make it clear whose jet it is, so I'm glad they included them. There is nothing inside the cockpit except for a seat and unless you want to ruin Dr. Doom's nice dark green cape, I wouldn't put him inside of it. They could have at least printed a control panel onto that empty 2x2 tile. Play Features Since this is a playset, let's look at all the play features it has to offer. Like all playsets, the building is open in the back so you can play inside. On the ground floor, there is a potted plant and... nothing else. Seriously? Is this all they could come up with for this floor? They could have included a security desk, a lounge, a second plant, or anything else! As it is, it's just a boring empty lobby. The first floor is a bit more interesting. There is a safe, a swiveling chair, and a pin board with various pictures of Spider-Man. There is one tile that reads: "The true identity of Spider-Man" which is supposedly what the villains are after. I wonder how Jameson got this information in the first place. Speaking of Jameson, the second floor is devoted to his office where he can sit and yell at his non-present employees, demanding "more pictures of Spider-Man!" It also has a swiveling chair as well as a desk with a lamp and a computer. There is a Technic beam connecting his desk with the ceiling of the first floor which you can remove in order to take off the upper half of the building, but it's difficult to do, so I don't recommend it. As you may have noticed in the picture above, there are a few red pegs sticking out of the building. These are for triggering the play features. Most of them are on the roof. There is one on what looks like an air conditioning unit. If you place Spider-Man holding is web-string on the jumper plate in front of it and push the peg, Spidey goes bungee-jumping off the building. Wee! There is also one that sticks out of the side of the building which when pulled triggers a trap door. The third red peg on the roof can be used to pop off the DBC sign. Why is it called the DBC, you ask? It stands for Daily Bugle Communications since in this version of Spider-Man, the Daily Bugle is not only a newspaper, but a news TV station as well, one that promotes its own highly biased views. So basically the Fox News of the Marvel universe. I guess if you're an old school Spider-Man fan, you could just leave off the "C" and have it just stand for Daily Bugle. The sign above the main entrance wont be so easily modified however. There is also a peg between the first and second floor which when pushed pops out one of the windows on the first floor. The safe is only attached to a couple of jumper plates and has some jumper plates on top of it as well, so you can easily attach the Doom jet's claw to it and rip it out of the building as seen on the back of the box. There are also some SNOT bricks on the corners of the building that you can attach spiderwebs or Spidey himself onto for some wall-crawling and webslinging action. This is not so much a play feature as it is just a feature, but as I mentioned earlier, there is a fire escape on the left side of the building. This was a neat idea as it helps it feel like a building in New York City, but it is executed very poorly. There is no hole big enough for the minifigs to climb down through, so they would have to climb down the ladders from the outside which makes no sense. No wonder Spider-Man always needs to rescue people from burning buildings. There is one more play feature in the form of the dumpster. You can open the lid, put a minifig inside, and make them jump by hitting a tab in the back. Remember, this is before the introduction of super jumpers, but nevertheless it's a pretty strange place to launch minifigs out of. I guess even Super Heroes like to do some dumpster diving. You don't think this was funny? No? Well, me neither, but that's the type of humor that this show loves to use. Sigh. Anyway, let's get on to the ratings. Ratings Design: 2/5 - The set looks ok. Despite many inaccuracies, the DBC building and the jet somewhat resemble their on-screen counterparts and don't look too bad, but they definitely could be better. Build: 1/5 - A mostly unchallenging and repetitive build with an attrocious amount of stickers. Minifigs: 4/5 - Definitely the strongest point of the set. Some of the figs could be better, but four out of five of them are exclusive to this set. Doctor Doom is easily the best and probably the most desirable one - unless the Fant4stic movie portraits him so badly that nobody will be interested in him, but that's impossible. Playability: 4/5 - As you would expect from a playset, the playability is quite high, although I still feel like there could have been more. Parts: 3/5 - Not many rare parts. If you're looking for parts for building your own skyscraper with tan walls and lots of doors and windows though, this set is for you. Price: 3/5 - At 476 parts for $50, this set is a bit pricey, but it is somewhat justified by all the large window and wall pieces. Overall: 3/5 - This set is mediocre at best. Playsets are always a good choice for Spider-Man sets since they give Spidey something to swing from, but unfortunately they are rarely pulled off well. The jet is blocky, the building is bare-bones, and the price feels too high. The only reason to get this set are the four exclusive minifigs. This set was discontinued early this year, but if you still see it on clearance somewhere, go ahead and get one for the minifigs and parts, or buy multiples and use the parts to build a better DBC building. I hope you enjoyed this review. It is part of the Reviewers Academy's 7th Anniversary. We're not doing a big celebration this year due to other commitments, but look out for more reviews with the 7th Anniversary banner soon. Now, if you'll excuse me, I am off to see Fant4stic. I hope it's as fantastic as it promises to be! (2 hours later) I was wrong! I was horribly, horribly wrong!	positive
This is my favourite set! Should be making more Spidey sets like this IMO. *cough* Oscorp Tower *cough*	positive
This set is from 2013, Doctor Doom is completely based off the Comic version/ TV Show version, not the movie in any way. Anyways, nice review. I personally own this set, and it's a nice set, but could have been better. Edited by Aegis2000, 13 September 2015 - 02:33 AM.	neutral
Yeah. I'm really hoping the concept art/Doom minifig joke is just that! I picked this set up on whim, mostly because a needed a building to add to a MOC, as a parts pack it's not a bad set at all.	positive

Thanks everyone! DarthBrickus, on 13 September 2015 - 02:53 PM, said: Thanks for the review, i've had that set for quite a while, and it's among my favorite Marvel Superheroes Sets actually. Compared to the other stuff we usually get to accompany the minifigs... All those "Laboratorys", the most recent Construction Site, and the "Hydra Fortress" .. yeah... You're being a little harsh here Perhaps you're right, maybe I was a bit too harsh on this set. Don't get me wrong, it's not a bad set, especially compared to some other sets we have gotten in this price range, but somehow I was still expecting more. DarthBrickus, on 13 September 2015 - 02:53 PM, said: Maybe you're still suffering from PTSD after watching Fant-Four-Stic! I still have not seen it actually (and I don't ever plan to).

Yes, the whole Doctor Doom/Fant4stic thing was obviously a joke. Everybody knows what Doctor Doom is supposed to look like, except for the makers of Fant4stic apparently. Zorglorfian, on 14 September 2015 - 06:44 AM, said: I actually would like to hear what your thoughts are on the USM - LEGO Dr. Doom comparison, Oky. Thanks for the review. http://marvelanimate...or_Doom_USM.png There's not much to say really. Doom in USM looks just like he does in the comics, and Lego recreated that look perfectly. Again, he's definitely the best part of this set.	neutral
I'm glad you were joking about Doom. I'm not that big of a fanboy, but I had the need to correct you for some reason. With that said, I bought this set for the minifigures a few years ago. Looking back, I don't really care about the figures today like I did in 2013. The building is decent for the size of the set though. Thanks for the review.	neutral
Thanks for the review.I'm not a big fan of Spider Man sets, but this set really impressed me. This must because of the design of this set and the minifigures that included in this set.	positive
This set seems to appeal more to the non superhero crowd. It is one of the only marvel sets I bought. Mainly because I thought that the building was a nice return to the old style of city sets. I would love to see this sort of backdrop for a more realistic agents theme... I also liked that most of the figs in this set were easier to merge into other (non-super) uses... Thanks for the review! God Bless, Nathan	neutral
Another great review Oky. I love this set.	positive
Hi again! They have arrived *wub*! They come dismantled inside the package instead of one piece like the Blackhole Stormtrooper did.

Hello everyone! By now many excited LEGO Star Wars fans have started receiving their UCS Falcon. Some of us here enjoy writing reviews and sharing our thoughts. I mentioned to Yoda that I was planning on doing a review of this set but it would likely take me a few weeks (of 1-2 hours per night) to finish building the set. Yoda suggested that I do the review as I go so everyone could see the progress of the set. What a great idea! So, here is the first entry. Feel free to comment along the way. I will try to post photos and updates every night on the build then wrap up the review when I complete the set. If you have any specific questions or photo requests, please be sure to ask. UCS Millennium Falcon Reviewed by Dunamis Set 10179 5195 Pieces $499.95 from LEGO Shop at home The Box: Obviously, this is a box like no other. First of all, it comes in its own shipping carton. Inside of that, there is a standard LEGO carton. Finally, inside the LEGO carton, we have the actual Millennium Falcon box and a nice little letter thanking you for buying the biggest LEGO set ever. Shipping box (Naboo set provided for scale) LEGO Carton and letter LEGO Carton The Millennium Falcon box is really quite nice. There are lots of photos and it does a good job of ?selling? the set. There are 8 individual pieces of tape that keep the lid on the box. The limited first edition comes with a seal on the lower left corner. Millennium Falcon Box (Naboo set provided for scale) Lifting the lid straight up reveals one compartment of several bags on the right. On the left, we find a thin, square box (like a pizza box) that contains the official certificate of authenticity, two sticker sheets and one enormous manual! Under the pizza box, we find two more compartments each filled with several typical LEGO bags. The box weighs 24 pounds! Stickers Pizza Box Pieces in compartments Not quite sure what the little 30th anniversary sticker is for yet. The Certificate of Authenticity is on heavy paper and is suitable for framing. More to come tomorrow. It's late here.	positive
Good idea to make this review while you build the set. I'll be monitoring your progress and feedback. The box so huge! Impressive!	positive
Nice review. I'll be watching and waiting for the rest.	positive

Wow that box is big but i somehow thought it would be even bigger, still it looks like for once lego are actully using all the space inside and not just a fraction like with other sets. Cant wait to see more dunamis.....you lucky megablok ;-)	neutral
xwingyoda, on Sep 27 2007, 09:18 AM, said: Many tks Dunamis for doing that, its really great and I can't wait monitoring your progress on the beast 8-? Like it was mentionned in another thread, the box looks less gigantic than I thought - remember the ISD box !! That was a huge box !! Is the instruction book in the pizza box ? How big is it ? I'm sure its really big and I hope for our sake that the colours are clearly marked X-D If you know what I mean :-D !! *yoda* Interesting question regarding the size of the box vs. the ISD. Here ya go: Also, I'll be posting more on the size of the manual a little later. I'm going to be building for the next few hours... *sweet*	neutral
Tks for that comparison pic Dunamis ;-) OK the box is big !! I pictured it a tad smaller though !! I know what I don't like, its the fact that it has the regular Lego Star Wars logo on top with Vader. UCS sets should have a different iconography like they did in the past. Sure its a trivial detail but it adds to the fact of owning something special !! After all its the most expensive set ever as of now ;-) Happy building !! And we'll wait patiently for some cool pics later on :-P *yoda*	negative
The Manual: The gigantic manual measures 17? x 12? and is almost an inch thick. It is spiral bound with a cardboard like front and back and it is 314 pages. Interesting decision not to break it up into multiple manuals. It is almost unwieldy at this size and thickness. Unfortunately, the manual is not available electronically from the LEGO website. Hopefully, it will be soon. Missing were the little instructions at the beginning telling you to not build this beast on shag carpet and to sort out the 5,000+ pieces before you get started. I guess they figure if you got $500 to spend on this thing, you can build it however you want. As usual, we get the regular LEGO manual features: - Piece call outs for each step - Parts inventory at the end of the manual - Page numbers - Photos of all the other 2007 sets at the end of the manual Manual (paperback book provided for scale) Various manual photos (8x8 plate provided for scale) I'm about 2 hours into building and sorting. I'm trying to stay a day ahead in my posting. The build has been easier than I thought so far. Despite the massive number of pieces, it has not been too hard to sort and find what you need. Build photos will start appearing in tomorrow's entry.	positive
Very expecting indeed. Waiting for your kind photo ... :-)	neutral
Wow I never thought I'd be impressed by a box but I certainly am now. Any chance of seeing all 5000 bricks in a big pile? Vader, on Sep 28 2007, 10:14 AM, said: My gawd that manuel is huge!!!!! That's enough to put a sane man off of buying this set.......Thank gawd none of us are sane thats all i can say X-D Too true, never had I imagined thinking about buying a ?350 Lego set before....Christmas is soo close yet soo far.	positive
Nice idea, reviewing the set while constructing it. This is the top of the bill for any lego-collector (also financially speaking..) and I like the look of all those thousands of pieces. The manual is incredible, I thought I had a really thick manual coming with set 8479, but this one exceeds it with ease... Review on!	positive
xwingyoda, on Sep 28 2007, 07:34 AM, said: Tks for that comparison pic Dunamis ;-) OK the box is big !! I pictured it a tad smaller though !! *yoda* I don't have the UCS ISD but from the pic i can see that it is about the same thickness, slightly shorter but much wider than the MF. So this leads me to believe that dimension-wise the UCS MF is more compact. Also, notice how in the content, the parts fit in just nice without additional spare space for anything else. Strange isn't it that when TLC is responsible for the shipping, we see optimum usage of box spaces. X-D imagine if all boxes were this efficient. $4.99 sets would be no bigger than a match box! X-D X-D the MTT would be reduced to 1/4 its current size! X-D X-D X-D	neutral
good review. *y* Me, I can't build it before Saturday. :'-(	positive
Great review so far! I am looking forward to additional posts! As for the number of pins - from the Peeron inventory for the set, there are over 400 technic pins of various lengths! (insert the "my fingers hurt from building" emoticon) Keep the pictures coming!	positive
The Build: The build is going quicker than I thought. I am sorting as I open the bags that I need. Some bags are in multiples so it is easy to pick them out. The build is a tad repetitive as the framework of the ship is somewhat symmetrical. Here are some progress shots: Note that two plates (1x4 and 1x8) are stacked in between Technic beams. Then the part below is assembled to hold the structure together. This took about an hour of sorting and building: I'll post another update tomorrow.	positive

Thanks for the review, and tons of pics! I've been wanting to pick this one up since I saw it. I thought the 4956 Creator House was nice, but this Model Town House is in a completely different league! I also like the alternate models that you can see in the catalogues.	positive
Thank you for the review Sinner. At first I wanted this set for the 4 blue 1x1 slope tiles, but I can see there is much more into it than that. It sure is a great value compared to what you get in the Building Bonanzas (no cars and less detail). It was funny to see the little side story in your pictures. Would it be hard to modify the cars to fit minifigs better?	neutral
Awesome review! Luckily you have two cute little friends and one beautiful lady to help you out! :-P I likewise love *wub* this set and your review does it credit! I laughed outloud a lot as I read it. I especially love you trying to look through the windowless back :-D :-D :-D Great job, now sort that out and start building for our competition! X-D	positive
Excellent review with great pics and cameo appearances by some of our EB favs *y* Definitely a set that was on my 'to get' list already, and this only confirms that. Might make me want two, just because I love tan so much and I'd like to see if something could be done to bulk up that car. Great job as always! :-)	positive
Thanks for this review Sinner! I love this house, with the nicely made tiled corners, the colorscheme and the garage. The only thing I dislike about this set is the way the windows are attached in train windows (so they turn inwards a little) instead of the usual frames with shutter-attachment-ability. But that is something that can be fixed in the blink of an eye. I will certainly buy this house some day when I find it at reasonable price.	positive
Thanks for the review Sinner! *y* ... although we had a not very detailed one already... :-P I bought this set at TRU with 20% off resulting in 54?. X-D Definitely a must buy for every townie. You get tons of useful parts to build other buildings as well. [shameless self-promotion /OFF] ;-) You have to love tan bricks though. 8-| MOC ON!	positive
Thanks for the review Sinner! I definitely want this set now. The mixed rough and smooth roof bricks would annoy me on a model like the MTT, but here it looks as is if the roof is quite old with some parts being worn and pitted and some parts being replaced with new roof tiles. I quite like the effect. I agree on which is the best vehicle, and if it doesn't fit minifigs, just mod the heck out of it! X-D	positive

It didn't bother me as I downloaded the instructions prior to buying the set. I think it was a deliberate choice to make the house flashy looking but not very functional. Due to the cool looking corners it isn't very strong either; while breaking it I was reminded of a zip! :-P simonwillems, on Sep 28 2007, 06:53 PM, said: The only thing I dislike about this set is the way the windows are attached in train windows (so they turn inwards a little) instead of the usual frames with shutter-attachment-ability.

Sinner, thanks for this outstanding review! I am glad that I had read this review in advance, before making my purchase on this set earlier with my girlfriend. We built this set for a total of 3 hours, to complete this beauty, in about 2 hours ago. There are stars circling around my head at this very moment, when I post this reply. I must admit from the bottom of my heart, that this is an wonderful piece of house, that simply shows the beauty of it, with the European kind of houses, where there is a garage. Furthermore, there is a lovely blue car. I am seeing stars right now, in the middle of the night, and I must drop a thanks to you personally as well. Although it is empty from its interior unlike the 4996 Beach House, but this set has the majestic look which simply place a "Wow" factor in front of it upon completion. At the moment, we had plans for getting the second set next month, to build the other design as well. Hopefully, I will be able to share with you guys, all of my different Creators sets, with its alternate designs as well in the near future.	positive

Nice pictorial review, I always like this little set ! A little more text would have been nice but that is ok as it is . PS: You should have mentioned in the title that this topic is picture heavy - I was wondering why it was loading so slow on my mobile	positive
Hi, You've done well on the pictures! But I agree with Freekysch; a little more text would be great. Ever thought about joining the Reviewer's Academy?	neutral
Thanks for comments. I know about text, I'm trying to write more, but haven't succes in this yet. I thought about joining Reviewers Academy, but I'm not sure because I have only maimum 4(may be 5) hours each time when I can make review or something that needs some hours.	neutral
Writing a decent review will indeed take some time. But you don't need to do it in a single session. If "each time" is 4/5 hours, you can write a review in 2 x "each time"	neutral
i actually bought this set last Monday as it was reduced to 14.99.....it actually not a bad little set considering the size and part count, has a decent array of functions. its a nice little set....the B model looks just as good so i might buy a second set, as you get the bucket left over and i need that bucket for another set.

Very nice review! Seems like I'll be getting my first Castle set soon.. *wub* Grevious, on Oct 10 2007, 09:33 PM, said: Most of them are old pieces recolored, but the ball on chain (what’s the actual name, could someone tell me?) That would be a flail. ;-)	positive
Wow thanks for the review! 8-? I already have the other two set (theyre fantastic *wub* ) and i know ill be getting this one soon! DP8	positive
Very nice review! I like the amount of pics and that alternate model. I wouldn't have thought of making a ship from those parts, I once made a larger, Crownie-ized skellie barrier instead.	positive
The pictures really tell all, nice review Grevious! I especially liked the story, great sense of humor!	positive
Thanks for this nice review. Nice comics presentation, too. *sweet* Makes me want to get some new Castle sets even harder, now. :-$	positive

Thanks for the review, the comic was great! :-D Your alternate model is great as well, I would never have thought of building a ship out of a catapult! :-P	positive
Great review, this is one of my favorite sets from the new castle line. It's simple and yet so effective, oh and great comic you have there *y*	positive
Excellent review! Showed everything in detail then added a fun twist at the end. Another set I pretty much knew I needed to buy is confirmed. *y*	positive

Thanks everyone for all the comments! ;-) My next review is most likely going to be the Toa Mahri I bought a long time ago; I also typed up a review for her but haven't bothered posting it! Ah well, I'll get it up eventually.... X-D Edit: Gah! I just realized how many posts I had! Better post something else on the boards quickly.... :-P Edited by Grevious, 11 October 2007 - 08:45 PM.	positive

Great review! *sweet* I wasn't aware that the catapult rotated either... This set isn't on my buy list though as it is all more of the same for me. Thanks for the cool MOC! :-D I always plan to add a MOC to my reviews but I always run out of time.... :'-(	positive
i just got this today. It is amazing like my other two castle sets: the joust and the crossbow. I am currently starting to save for 2008 but for Christmas i think i want the Skeleton Carridge and the Naboo N-1 Fighter.	positive
It's that time of year again when the days get shorter, the nights get colder, and children all around the world stare longingly into warmly lit toy shops and prepare their wishlist to send to Santa. This is also the time when The Lego Group releases their latest Winter Village set which has been an annual tradition for the past seven years. These sets have been very popular, especially among AFOLs, and are always highly anticipated. However, while some entries in this series have been more popular than others, none has been as controversial as this year's set, the Winter Toy Shop, which is a re-release of the first Winter Village set, 10199 Winter Toy Shop from 2009. It seems that many think that this set didn't need to be remade and would have preferred a new set instead, or that it is not different enough from the original and will be redundant in a completionist's collection. Does it deserve all the hate? Let's find out. Disclaimer: I don't own the 2009 version, so I can't compare them visually, but I will do my best to let you know what is different in this version. If you do need a visual reference, you can refer to Svelte's excellent review of the original. Set Number: 10249 Name: Winter Toy Shop Theme: Creator Year of Release: 2015 Pieces: 898 Minifigs: 8 Price: £59.99 / $79.99 / 69.99€ S@H description: Quote Welcome to the Winter Toy Shop! The holiday season has arrived and the toymaker is busy finishing off his latest creations! Outside, children ski and snowboard, and a freshly built snowman sparkles in the light that shines from the toyshop tower. Help decorate the huge tree that stands at the center of the square, play with the curious kitten on the cozy wooden bench or join in with the carolers beneath the ornate streetlamp. This charming set also features a ladder, trees in various sizes, jack-in-the-box, a toy biplane, helicopter, rocket, train, race car, truck, robot, tugboat, teddy bear and a wrapped gift. Have fun building this enchanting winter wonderland! Includes a snowman and 8 minifigures with assorted accessories: a male caroler, female caroler, a woman, 2 men, 2 boys and a girl. S@H Bricklink Brickset The Box The box art of this set is similar to that of the original, but there are some notable differences. The Christmas tree is on the right side of the image this time while the park bench is on the left and of course it features this year's design for Creator boxes with the dark blue stripe along the right side and the "Expert" logo in the top right corner. There's also a small picture of the back of the toy shop and the background looks less cartoony than on the original. The back is also very similar, showing a different angle of the toy shop along with some close-ups, although this time there is no minifig lineup. Instead, the minifig lineup is on the right side of the box. It also includes the accessories that each minifig comes with and some of the toys. On the left side of the box there is a thumbnail of the box art and the set name in six different languages. They also want to make sure that you know that there are batteries included by saying it in dozens of languages. The top of the box features the inventory and a 1:1 scale reference with the female caroler. On the bottom there is a picture that reminds you that there is a light brick included in this set, in case that wasn't clear from the front of the box, and it confirms that yes, it is a bad idea to put it in water, in case you were planning to go swimming with your Winter Toy Shop. The Contents Inside the box there are two instruction booklets and two groups of bags, one for each instruction booklet. While two groups of bags is not as many as there usually are in other sets of this size, it's still better than the first version of this set where the bags weren't numbered at all, so this makes the build a bit easier. The large bag in Group 1 and the two large bags in Group 2 have a white stripe going down the middle of the bag and only have one group number printed on it along with some other number and some kind of scan code. I have no idea why they made this distinction for these bags or what that code is for, so if any of you know the purpose of this, please let me know in the comments below. Here is a random instructions page. As you can see, the building steps can get quite challenging as they sometimes include many different pieces in one step, especially when it uses a lot of brown pieces which are very dark and hard to see in the instructions, living up to the set's status as an expert-level set. Most of the time, though, the instructions are pretty clear and easy enough to follow. There are some parts in new colors in this set that weren't in the first version or any other set until now, such as that large, flat Technic arch in dark green, the jester hat in orange and blue, one of those new 2z2 round jumper tiles in brown, a golden frog(!), and a snowboard in dark blue. There are also some rare Friends parts that make their Creator debut here such as the skis in azure and that new clear 1x1 round tile with a tiny tube coming out of it which is usually used as a stand for Friends accessories and is a very useful piece, especially for SNOT techniques (and no, I'm not talking about the type of snot that many people usually have stuck in their nose around this time of year). There are some printed parts as well, such as the clock tile, the letter tile, and the register slope like in the first version of the set. We also get a new face print for the white cat which is more in line with other modern cat designs. But the best part is the shop sign which is printed this time around. It features a lovely wood pattern, the words "toy shop", and a toy soldier on both sides of the sign. Which is ironic since the shop doesn't seem to sell any toy soldiers like this, but it looks so good on the sign that I won't sue them for false advertising. The Minifigs Let's start with the most unique figures in this set, the carolers. These two were also the highlight in the first version of the set, but in the original they both had the same head (this one -> ) which featured a very questionable facial expression that could easily be taken out of context. In this version, they have unique faces which look much better and help distinguish their gender. The male caroler uses Lord Vampyre's torso which looks quite snazzy on him. Maybe this is Lord Vampyre before he became a vampire? The female caroler is easily the best minifig in the set, though, because in addition to her exclusive head, she also gets an exclusive torso and skirt print! A huge improvement over the generic unprinted one in the original. She also gets the queen hair in dark brown and Aragorn's lined cape instead of two combined regular capes. This set truly is the Return of the Queen! The snowman is technically not a minifig, but as you can see here, he is exactly as tall as one and he is the first thing you build after the minifigs, so I included him here. He has mostly the same design as before, except this time he has robot claws for arms instead of levers. Which is good since they allow him to hold accessories such as his broom. His carrot nose is included separately again. The carolers both have back printing while the snowman looks no different from the back than he does from the front. Here you can see the black side of the female's cape. This lined cape is so much nicer than the solution they used in the original. Next up we have what I assume is a married couple who are likely the parents of at least one of the kids, as well as the toymaker who I will call Geppetto. The man in the pinstripe suit was not included in the first version of the set, so he's a bonus minifig! These guys are fairly generic, but they have some detailed torso prints, so they look pretty nice. Geppetto seems to have gotten younger since the release of the original set since his gray hair has now turned dark tan and he doesn't seem to need glasses anymore. The men both have back printing, but the woman is the only one in this set who doesn't get a back print. Why you gotta be so discriminating against women, LEGO?! Last but not least, there are the kids. One of the boys wears dark blue pants, a green jacket, and a wool cap. He looks a bit like a lumberjack, so let's call him lumberjack boy, or Jack for short. The little girl wears an outfit that wouldn't look out of place in the Friends theme with a lavender scarf and pants. I'll call her Lavender. The second boy is wearing an Octan jacket and a sports helmet which makes it ironic that he is the one not doing any winter sports on the box art. I'll call him President Business Junior, or PBJ for short. All of the kids have fairly detailed back printing which makes up for the fact that much like the adults, they are made out of mostly common parts. PBJ's helmet and scarf cover up the back of his head nicely which is important as you will see in the next picture. What's also great about these figs is that half of them have a double-sided head. Here you can see PBJ doing his best Macaulay Culkin impression. I also removed his scarf so you can see the printing on his torso better. But he's not the only one who seems to be easily scared. The mother also has a very alarmed expression. Maybe she got surprised by the Jack-in-the-box or maybe she just realized how expensive toys are nowadays. You can see the female caroler's back printing here. Her alternate expression is a non-singing face which is very nice to have and I wish the male caroler could have one too. She looks quite cute with those rosy cheeks. But the most adorable out of all of them has to be the little girl. She comes with a pouting sad face that will melt your heart. Please, don't cry! I'll buy you any toy you want, just stop looking at me like that! The Build The first half of the build is dedicated to the surroundings of the toy shop. It includes the Christmas tree, the park bench, the snowman, the toys, the carolers, Jack and Lavender. The large bag contains two smaller bags with small pieces, a white box that contains the caroler's cape, and the jester hat in its own little bag. The first thing you build after the minifigs and the snowman is the toys. This version of the set has a lot more toys than the original which is good because I always felt that the first Toy Shop was a bit light on toys. Also, the ones that were in the original have been updated. For example, instead of the two pairs of skis, you now get one pair of skis that use the new ski mold and a snowboard. The Jack-in-the-box is mostly the same, except it now has an orange and blue color scheme instead of the red and blue from the original. This change was probably not necessary, but hey, at least we get a new jester hat out of it. And instead of the brick-built teddy bear you get the new teddy bear mold. I have mixed feelings about this change because I actually kinda liked the brick-built teddy design and using a specialized mold seems to be going against the spirit of Creator sets, but on the other hand I can't deny that the molded teddy looks better than the blocky old one. Meh. The new toys include a tugboat which has some rounded Technic pieces as its hull, a biplane, a rocket, a helicopter, and a truck that cleverly uses roller skates for its wheels. These are all quite brilliant designs that feel like micro versions of Lego City sets and make a great addition to the set. Here is a back view of some of the more complex models. As you can see, the Friends accessory stand has been cleverly used to hold the biplane's fin in place and to provide a stand for the helicopter. The Jack-in-the-box has a hinged lid. The only thing that bugs me a bit is the T-piece on top of the helicopter that holds the rotor in place, but I can't think of any better way they could have done it. Next is the ladder that is used to decorate the tree which is exactly the same as the first version. The supports are on a click-hinge, so they can be adjusted or folded away. Then, you build the tree itself. You begins, of course, with the stand which is mostly the same design as before, but this time the plates at the bottom are brown instead of white and have golden studs as feet. Next, you build the first layer of branches. The main difference in this version of the tree is that this one actually has a brown stem rather than just a Technic axle on which you stack the layers of branches one by one. You wont be able to see the stem in the final result, but I like this change as it makes the tree more realistic. Then you add the second layer of branches. This one doesn't have lights/candles and attaches to the lower layer at an angle using the four trans-yellow studs close to the stem. The third layer is added. This one has lights again. Each layer is similar in that they are all made out of green plates that are built around a 4x4 ring plate, but they get smaller each time and are constructed differently enough for the build not to feel repetitive. With the addition of the fourth layer, we get close to finishing the tree. Lastly, you add one more layer and the tip of the tree. Now it's time to decorate the tree! However, it's not as fun as it sounds since that requires you to add lights to the two chains/ropes first which can get a bit repetitive. The clips holding the lights to the chain were white, but this time they're pearl gold which looks much nicer in my opinion. The next part of the build is the park bench with the streetlamp and the little tree. This is a fairly quick build with not much to it. The fishbowl helmet parts are a useful piece that you don't see too often, so it's nice to get them again in this remake. The design is pretty much the same as in the original set except for the wreaths on the streetlamp which use a green life preserver instead of a round 2x2 plate. This is another instance where they use a specialized piece instead of a brick-built solution, but I'm okay with that because unlike with the teddy bear, this part was not originally intended to be a wreath, so it's still nice part usage. The second half of the build is dedicated to the toy shop itself and includes the couple, Geppetto, and PBJ. Please note that there is a fourth 6x10 plate burried under the parts. You begin by tiling the floor, setting up the walls, and adding the interior items such as the fireplace, the cash register, and the toy displays. Next, you add the walls, windows, and the door and the ground floor of the shop is finished. So far, the build is the same as the old toy shop, except this time they decided to have the white stripes on the marquees be the longer ones instead of the dark red ones for some reason. I don't know why they did this and kinda would have preverred to get dark red 1x1 plates instead of white, but it doesn't detract from the look of the shop, so I don't really care. Now we begin with the upper floor. This is where things start to look a little different. Can you tell the difference? The difference is that this time they attach the roof using clip-hinges instead of bulky Technic constructions which gives you more space on this floor and allows it to look more like an actual attic. They even tile the floor next to the frog clock. Aftter adding the roof, the build is finished. The main roof feels a bit loose since it's only attached to the building by one side. I'm not sure if this was an issue in the old toy shop, but it's not a big deal. I just wouldn't pick the set up by the roof. What I do like is that they used double cheese slopes on the awning on the outer wall of the tower instead of singles which makes it a bit easier to build. I like how the supports under the tower roof now match those of the main roof. The wreaths have also been updated like the ones on the streetlamp. And those Technic arches under the roof look a lot more like garlands now. On the original, they were dark gray, so I didn't even know they were supposed to be garlands and assumed they were part of the architecture. The shop sign looks a lot better now that it is printed. The old one just looked like a white flag. I also like how the small plates under the marquee give it a wavy look and they included two trees in different sizes on the right side of the shop. The back is nice and open and allows you to see the rest of the toys, the robot, train, and race car, all of which have just as much of a simple and clever design as the other toys. The clock looks much nicer with the new golden frog. Because golden frogs make everything better. Spare Parts There are quite a few small parts left over, including a roller skate and one of those Friends accessory stands which will come in handy. The Complete Set Here you can see the full set together. It looks quite nice and festive with all the little details and there are many scenes that you can play out with it: You can have the minifigs decorate the tree, have the kids play in the snow, have the carolers sing by the bench, have the toymaker build some toys in his workshop, or have the parents buy presents for their kids. It's a festive, toy-filled Winter Wonderland! The fireplace looks cozy and I like the brick pattern going up the chimney. The entrance of the shop looks a bit empty aside from the cash register. I feel like they could have displayed some more toys here, but oh well. Being a set targeted at teens and adults, there aren't really any play features aside from the light brick which is attached to a hinge, so you can either activate it by pressing the button with your finger or tilting the brick upward so that the button is pressed against the roof. However, since the roof is not connected in the middle and only attached on the sides, it tends to split open a bit when you do that, so I'm not sure if attaching the roof this way here was such a good idea. Nevertheless, it looks quite nice when the light is lit. Ratings Design: 5/5 - This set is as gorgeous as it was back in 2009! The small updates that they made are mostly good ones, although the absence of a brick-built teddy is a bit disappointing and the new way the roof is attached, while not as bulky as before, makes the roof slightly unstable, but those are just nitpicks. Build: 5/5 - There are some interesting building techniques here, such as those on the tree, the roof, and the toys. The fact that the parts are only split into two groups and the part callouts can get fairly complex makes it a challenging, enjoyable build. Minifigs: 5/5 - They did a great job updating the figs in this set. While only 3 of the torsos in the original had any printing, all of the torsos have printing front and back in this set, even the skirt and cape of the female caroler. You get two exclusive heads and half of the heads are double-sided, plus you get 8 instead of 7 minifigs. You really can't ask for more in a Creator set. Playability: 4/5 - This set is more meant to be displayed than to be played with, but there are plenty of things to play with if you want. All the different minifigs, accessories, and set pieces make for endless possibilities for play. It's especially fun to swoosh the micro vehicles around. Parts: 3/5 - There are lots of good parts here. Most of them are fairly common, but there are some rare parts and some even in exclusive colors. Price: 4/5 - This set costs $20 more than the original, but considering that this set has nearly 900 pieces, including some rare and exclusive ones, as well as more minifigs with much better printing, I think $80 is still a fair price. Overall: 5/5 - So what's my opinion of this set? For a remake, I think it's great. They managed to make a good set even better. Are the changes minor? Yes. Are they an improvement? Mostly, yes. Were they necessary? Perhaps not, but it's good that they made them instead of just re-releasing the exact same set. So if you didn't get the first Winter Toy Shop, I can highly recommend getting this one. If you do already have the old version, this one might still be worth picking up for the hugely improved minifigs and rare parts alone. As for the controversy over re-releasing the Winter Toy Shop, I can see where the haters are coming from, but I find their complaints to be quite petty. I can understand if you're disappointed because you already have the first Winter Toy Shop and were looking forward to a new set this year, but there's always next year. If you're a completist and feel like TLG is forcing you to buy a set you don't need, you're wrong. Nobody is forcing you to buy anything but yourself. If you decide to buy every set in a theme no matter what it is, that's your problem, not LEGO's. So put down your torches and pitchforks and just be glad that they improved the set design and gave us another chance to buy this classic set. There are far worse things that can happen in this world than Lego re-releasing one of their most popular sets. Sorry for that little rant. So what is your opinion on re-releases like this? Please cast your vote in the poll above. I hope you enjoyed this special Eurobricks Reviewers Academy review and would like to thank The Lego Group for the opportunity to review this set. Happy Holidays everyone! Bat-Toys by Okay Yaramanoglu, on Flickr	positive
Thanks for a great review first of all. I do like the upgrades and changes made from the original 2009 set, more colours and parts are offcourse available today than back in 2009. It does look like a great set and i would really realy have loved to get it myself if i had the funds. However their are so many other sets thats first priority for me this december and next year, so sadly i might have to pass on this if its not that i can get it redicioulusly cheap at some point. And yeah, we should appreciate that LEGO does keep sets coming, even if its just upgrades from earlier releases. Town is known for a new police and fire station every year, cant see why a new toyshop is so upsetting. Once again thanks for a great review. And happy holidays to you as well.	positive
Nice to see they finally updated that generic screaming face from the 2007 Castle line. Awesome review, Oky. I have the old set so I won't be picking this up.	positive
Great review. You almost make me want to buy one. I don't know what it is with these sets. On the one hand they are so nicely designed and cute on the other side I never seriously consider buying one. I can't explain what it is that holds me back.	positive

That's the thing that usually holds me back. Anyway, I have the older version, so I am not interested in this set.	neutral
Regarding the reason for the different designs on the inner bags, I think that the white stripe is the new version, with the non-stripe version being old. I suspect the reason some sets have both versions is simply that they're still using up some of their supply of older bags. Good review. I didn't realise there were quite as many changes as you highlighted (tree, roof etc).	positive
Thanks for the excellent review! Unfortunately it only highlights how minimal the upgrades are (though they are nice). Definitively a pass for me. Let's hope LEGO does continue to make the more realistic winter village sets (versus Santa). I'm not opposed to a rehash, the post office could use some improvements for example, but this one is just a wee bit minimal.	negative
I bought it and I'm very happy with it.	positive
Cheers for putting up the review. Some nice improvements, but not enough for me to pick it up. The original set is good enough for me. Pity the poll has no option "Yes, but only in addition to new sets, not in stead of new sets". Edited by Withacee, 01 December 2015 - 09:38 AM.	neutral
Thanks for a nice review. I am building it as we speak, and I like it so far. Since I didn't have the old one, I can't complain.	positive
Thanks for the review. They definitely improved upon the original, but since I already own the original, I can't justify this set also, unfortunately. It seems to be the trend. But I'm sure there are a lot of first timers out there too that will snatch this up since it is a really lovely building. And the updates make it better for sure.	neutral
Thanks Oky for this fine review. I agreed with your sentiments on the unnecessary rants. I also owned the 2009 version and even though there are minor improvements. There must be a logical reason for its release again but is not entirely the same. I felt is an excellent opportunity for others to acquire this design especially after six years ago. As for myself, I will probably buy this if my spare funds allow me to own this set.	neutral

I know, but one can always hope, can't one! I hope the WV theme will be continued in coming years with new sets, but given Santa's workshop and this re-release, I don't get my hopes up too much. Time to get MOCing and reverse engineering!	neutral
Oky, on 02 December 2015 - 12:49 AM, said: I'm not mocking anyone. I just think that some people need to calm down a bit and that TLG is getting more hate than they deserve for this set, but that's just my opinion and you're welcome to disagree with it. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, including you and me. And yes, I would love to hear your thoughts on this matter because I would like to have a friendly discussion on this subject. That's cool, and I appreciate that. But, i would recommend avoiding the use of the word "hater" then. That's a perjorative term that's loaded with negative connotation, as I'm sure you're well aware. It's the flipside to me calling you a "mindless fanboy" or a "corporate shill." Those aren't terms that invite friendly discussion. They shut down discussion by belitting the other person's opinion, and implying that they lack the maturity or intelligence to think critically. I don't actually care all that much about this set. You just hit on a pet peeve of mine, is all. And it's one that I see spreading throughout Eurobricks, which is a shame. The use of terms like "hater," "whiner," or "fanboy" are becoming much too prevalent around here.	neutral
REVIEW - 42044 - DISPLAY TEAM JET INTRODUCTION The smallest of the 2016 sets, is the Display Team Jet. It doesn't seem to have lots of functionality, but maybe the landing gear is retractable. This set kind of reminds me to the 9394 - Jet Plane, although it's obviously a lot smaller. As you can read in my review of the 42052 - Heavy Lift Helicopter basically anything flying is +1 for me, so let's find out if this set also fits the bill. Note: All images can be clicked for hi-res versions. SET INFORMATION Number: 42044 Title: Display Team Jet Theme: Technic Released: 2016 Part Count: 113 Box Weight: 193 gr Box Dimensions: 15,4 cm x 13,8 cm x 5,9 cm Set Price (MSRP): € 9,99 Price per Part: € 0,088 Links: Brickset, Bricklink THE BOX Being a small set, it obviously comes in a small box. The Display Team Jet is an Aerobatics Jet, used in air shows. On the box it's flying rather high, but at least it's at a safe distance from the crowd. Front side shows the main model, together with a small section indicating you can use Digital Building instructions to build this model. BACK SIDE The back side shows the B-model, a Stunt Plane. And again a reference to the apps for Digital Building instructions. More on the Stunt Plane later. CONTENT OF THE BOX The box contains: 2 Instructions Booklets (A- and B-model) 1 Sticker Sheet 3 Technic Liftarms 2 Bags INSTRUCTION BOOKLETS Both the instructions for the A- and B-model are included in the box. STICKER SHEET A lot of stickers for such a small set. Apparently no panel is left untouched. LIFTARMS Three liftarms unsealed, nothing out of the ordinary for a small set. BAGS Two bags containing the rest of the parts. HIGHLIGHTED PARTS This section describes the new and/or otherwise interesting parts. YELLOW 5L AXLES The 5L Axle in Yellow has never been released before, so it's one of the new parts for this year. BLACK 7L FLEX AXLES For the layman this seems a common part, but the 7L Soft Axle actually has never been released in black before. Combined with the re-release of the 19L Soft Axle in black, this will open up lots of possibilities. For those of you thinking you've read this text before; you are right, the new Drag Racer contains these new 7L Flex Axles too. WHITE PANELS This small set comes with a whopping 10 panels. Great for the ones who like panels. Not so great if you think TLG is using too much panels lately. RUDDER This part, the Small Bionicle Wing, is the same as the one used in last year's 42033 - Record Breaker. PART LIST This set contains 113 parts, all listed below. THE BUILD This is the collection of parts, used to build the Jet. It sure looks like we are getting a landing gear. The build is fun, but pretty straightforward. There aren't any special or cool techniques used in this set. It almost took me more time to apply all the stickers than to build the actual model. FINISHED MODEL The finished Jet does look cool though. The white and yellow color scheme, combined with the stickers, work really well. I have seen people refer to the plane as being orange, but it's definitely yellow. Technic (or LEGO in general) tends to have some color variation when it comes to yellow. I do concur this is the warmer variant of yellow, but it's not orange. The back of the plane looks nice too, although I am not a big fan of the rudder part. It looks too detailed, compared to the other panels. It's not a big deal though, and maybe it's just me. PARTS LEFT Only three common parts left. FEATURES AND FUNCTIONS This set has a single feature and that is a retractable landing gear. It's operated by the black 12T Double Bevel Gear near the cockpit. In the following picture you can see the landing gear retracted. This image shows the landing gear when the plane is ready for landing. Hopefully the pilot will roll the plane before landing, but you probably know what I mean VIDEO Here's s short video demonstrating the Display Team Jet. B-MODEL This set also includes the building instructions for the B-model, a Stunt Plane. The building experience for the Stunt Plane is more or less the same as for the Jet. Well, what do you expect when both models are planes with a limited number of parts. For an alternative model the Stunt Plane looks fine. There's not a lot of functionality in this plane, but it's worth mentioning that the tail wheel allows the plane to roll on a flat surface. The plane also has working propellors. Both functions are demonstrated in the video. Unfortunately, the landing gear of the Stunt Plane is not retractable. PARTS LEFT A couple of extra leftover parts, but it's nice to see that most of the parts have been used in the B-model as well. Actually, there's probably an extra yellow Technic Smooth 1/2 Bush left. I just found it on my desk, but it could belong to one of the other sets. VIDEO Here's a video demonstrating the Stunt Plane. SUMMARY Two nice planes for 13 bucks, that's basically what you get. Both models look good and the set has some interesting new parts. Especially the 7L Flex Axle will be very popular. It comes with a decent collection of white panel, although they are very common nowadays. Both models have limited functionality, but each of them has at least one function to give the model some playability for kids, other than the swooshability that is. Okay, it might lack some proper functions, but I still think kids will love this set. I can see kids running around with one of the planes in their hands. All in all I think this set delivers what you'd expect. SCORE Let's see how this set flies! Remember that the grades are based on it being a small set. Obviously a set like this, cannot be compared with a Mercedes flagship. 8 DESIGN For a small set, the model looks very authentic. 7 BUILDING EXPERIENCE No surprises. 7 FEATURES Just the retractable landing gear. 8 PLAYABILITY It has swooshability, so I see kids running around with this model. 7 PARTS Lots of panels, if you are into that. 8 VALUE FOR MONEY Can't go wrong with these small sets. 7,5 FUN FOR KIDS More image can be found on my Flickr page. Thank you for reading. I hope you enjoyed it.	positive
While I can see kids enjoying this, I'm not sure I would buy. The flex axles are nice, and it is a decent number of white panels but I think I would get better return out of a larger parts set. Fantastic review though, and your pictures show off this tiny model better than the box art does.	negative
Very nice little set, and a lot of those new white small panels. It's a need!	positive
It says 5l in the parts list.	neutral
Love this model, awesome swooshability, interesting parts, and a nice little model to put on my desk at work :)	positive
For 10 Euros very usefull parts. I like it as well as other 2016 sets. I like the gear retracting mechanism a lot. Very good set for good price. Thanx for good review. :) Max	positive
Hi there, nice model, great review! I almost reverse engineered this model, but used wrong parts for landing wheels, didn't know how to fix the nose proper, and so on. So i was very interested in this model and i like playing with it. I love the reviews, but i think i have to mention, that the yellow axle must be a 5L! The picture shows a 5L, and a 5L would fit the size of the model. The cart has also a 5L in yellow. What sitze is the yellow axle in this seit. Really 4L as written in the text? Greetings, Robert	positive
I seem to have been messing up Axle Lengths in various reviews It's indeed 5L. My bad. Thanks for pointing it out.	neutral
Very nice review for a nice little set! I especially like the smoothness of operation for the retractable landing gear. I don't like the lack of symmetry for the propeller of the B model though, but understand the alternative would be to add one extra small panel to the set, or skip two of them in the B model.	positive
Good review, as always Jim When I first saw this set I thought that it would make a great parts pack for me, as that I have about 20 white pieces in my Technic collection (all from 42043) and this set has some really useful ones, all for a cheap price. Those 7L flex axles will be extremely useful in my current build I'm doing	positive

Fixed the video and fixed the stars in the voting. Thanks for paying attention guys	neutral
Set is only interesting for the panels, that's all it is to me	neutral
I just built the A model, and I rather like it. It is much bigger than it looks from the box - about 30 studs long. There is only one function - the landing gear - but it works very nicely. Apart from that, it's a very solid build, and achieves an elegant shape with an absolute minimum of parts. I don't usually get excited about small sets, but this one appeals to me. I like the feeling that every single piece has a purpose.	positive
My favourite of the 2016 sets I've built so far. I'd go so far as to say this is the best "budget" set in years. I would have loved this when I was a kid ... great "swoosh ability" ??	positive
I got this little set for Xmas and I noticed all the gaps and decided to fix them, so here it is. IMG_5344 by JJ2Sam, on Flickr First I added some beams to the wings and top to make it less hollow, second I put some navigation lights on it, I made the nose a bit wider and added a control panel, and lastly I changed out the landing gear wheels to more appropriate ones. IMG_5349 by JJ2Sam, on Flickr More pictures are HERE	neutral
Thats a cool little mod, two small nigles though, 1, your navigation lights are flipped on the main wings, 2, the panels on the tail i *think* were supposed to be the intakes for the jet engine, by using them to close up the tail you've turned it into a glider Cant wait untill i find one of these on shelves!	positive
So this set showed up in stores yesterday, and i immediately picked two up. All in all it is a nice set, but it is slightly different from what i was expecting, the plane feels a bit "flat", pointy nose, wide bottom etc.. And while the panels work very well as wings, it feels a bit simplistic to just have single-part wings. The stickers really work for it though. Its a cracking set though, nice parts pack, and a nice model as well	positive
REVIEW - 42046 - GETAWAY RACER INTRODUCTION Starting with the 42010 - Off-road Racer and 42011 - Race Car in 2013, TLG released two sets in the first half of each year, using a pullback motor. The pullback motor allows the model to be pulled back, followed by forward motion. Usually there's no apparent relation between the two set, other than the ability to combine them into an alternate build. This year there seems to some sort of Cops and Robbers scene going on. A Getaway Racer and a Police Interceptor. That can't be a coincidence. Makes you wonder who will be victorious, the good guys or the bad guys. Let's find out! Note: All images can be clicked for hi-res versions. SET INFORMATION Number: 42046 Title: Getaway Racer Theme: Technic Released: 2016 Part Count: 170 Box Weight: 302 gr Box Dimensions: 26,0 cm x 13,8 cm x 5,9 cm Set Price (MSRP): € 19,99 Price per Part: € 0,118 Links: Brickset, Bricklink THE BOX The box has the same dimensions as previous year's pullback motor sets. In the lower right corner there's a visual explanation of the pullback mechanism. The dark model with it's decals sure looks like a cool hot rod. CONTENT OF THE BOX The box contains: 1 Instructions Booklet 1 Sticker Sheet 2 Technic Liftarms 1 Pullback Motor 3 Bags INSTRUCTION BOOKLET Just a single booklet. Unfortunately no booklet for the alternate model. STICKER SHEET The sticker sheet contains a lot of cool stickers with flames and skulls etc. PULLBACK MOTOR AND LIFTARMS The pullback motor and two liftarms are found unbagged. BAGS A total of three bags containing the majority of the parts. HIGHLIGHTED PARTS This section describes the new and/or otherwise interesting parts. Actually, this set is the only set of 1H 2016 which doesn't use any new parts, not even parts in a new color. TIRES The Getaway Racer uses four low profile tires (Tire 37 x 22 ZR). RIMS The rims are Wheel 30.4mm D. x 20mm in Pearl Gold, found in 12 other sets. PANELS This set contains three #3 Panelsand three #4 Panels in black. PART LIST This set contains 171 parts, all listed below. THE BUILD This being a small model, I won't show any building steps. Let's skip right to the finished model. Below you can see the end result. In my opinion the model looks great. It's got that hot rod vibe going on and the stickers add darkness to the vibe. Slight problem with this set is that it really needs the stickers to finish the look. Otherwise it's quite dull, with black and dark grey liftarms and panels. The rear view shows the pullback motor connected directly to the rear axle. In this image you can also clearly see the exhaust pipes on the side, which are very well executed. The 3x3 Technic Discs with stickers, used in the rim, result in only seeing a part of the rim. This works very well with the golden rims. The bottom view shows the chassis of the car. Nothing really noteworthy, as you would expect from a pullback set. VIDEO The following video gives you an overview of the finished model. PARTS LEFT These six parts are left after building the model. Seems about right. FEATURES AND FUNCTIONS This being a pullback motor set, it only has a single feature. The video below demonstrates the acceleration of the vehicle. My girlfriend was kind enough to catch the model before it fell to the ground. Or did it hit something before it fell to the ground?! VIDEO This video shows the pullback functionality. B-MODEL The alternate model is a combined build with the Police Interceptor, which you can see on the back of the box. Unfortunately the instructions for the combined B-model are not included, so I didn't get a chance to build it. This would make for a fun challenge, building the B-model without the instructions. SUMMARY Pullback sets are not the most technically advanced models, so you can't expect any other functionality than hitting the walls in your house. However, I think they are very appealing to kids. The fact that this year's pullback sets form a duo adds to the fun. In my opinion TLG hit the nail on the head with the Getaway Racer and Police Interceptor. The Getaway Racer looks very badass, which is something you don't see every day in a Technic set. SCORE How do I grade the bad guy in this year's duo. 8 DESIGN It looks so cool, but it does need the stickers. 7 BUILDING EXPERIENCE Nothing out of the ordinary. 7 FEATURES Limited to the pullback-and-drive functionality. 7 PLAYABILITY Combined with the Police Interceptor, kids will love it. It does need it's Nemesys though. 7 PARTS Collection of common parts. Gold rims could be interesting. 8 VALUE FOR MONEY Pullback sets always deliver a certain value. 7,3 HIT IT!

Jim great reviews but can I suggest you one thing? Take some pics before you apply the stickers....and some with the stickers on! It helps to have a comparison!	neutral
Jim, on 01 December 2015 - 09:34 AM, said: You are right. I came to the same conclusion when writing the review. I tell you it doesn't look that good without stickers, but I don't have a picture to prove it. To be honest; I compared it to the model posted in the 2016 topic a few days ago. I applied the stickers before building the model, so I wasn't able to make a proper comparison. I will keep it in mind for future reviews. Thanks for the suggestion. You're welcome! I'm not a huge fan of stickers, for 2 reasons: I do re-use all the parts normally...and also I believe a model should look great even without stickers, then obviously they can be a plus, but only afterwords! Anyway I'm enjoying the reviews as usual, and those pics Thanks for making them Jim!!	neutral
Not sure what people like about this set, I think it's the worst of all 1H2016 sets. Odd shape, bland colors, no new parts, and the windscreen isn't even closed. But the reviews are great, indeed. :)	negative

Lego 42049 Mine Loader Thanks to Lego and EuroBricks for making this review possible! This was supposed to be a preview-review, before the Dec 1 release date for the set, but it got stuck in customs or something and didn't arrive in time. Well, I'd rather do a good, late review than a rushed review, so here it is. Name: Mine Loader Set Number: 42049 Pieces: 476 (I think) Price: $39.99 (I think) Minifigs: 0 Theme: Technic Year of Release: 2016 Links: Bricklink Brickset The Box Another standard Technic box, not that there's anything wrong with that. It is a littler weird that the mine loader is shown OUTSIDE the mine, but whatever. The Back of the Box Again, very standard. It's oddly technical, showing the exact angle of the machine when turning, but that's the sort of nerdy detail that Technic people like. The alternate Mine Cutting Machine model looks interesting and unusual as well. The 1:1 Part The 1:1 part on the top of the box is especially helpful with this set. These mining machines are very oddly proportioned, since they need to fit in mine tunnels, so it's hard to judge the model size based on the wheels or seat like you can an ordinary set. The Contents You get manuals for both models (a single book for the B and two books for the main), a medium size sticker sheet, 4 bags, and 4 loose tires. The Special Parts This set has 4 of the new mudguard panels in yellow, two cylinder halves in red (a new color), some of the new color red and yellow axles, a couple of the new-ish Technic spacers, some of the axle-pin combination pieces, and a couple swords! I'm pretty sure that's "an antenna" and a spare. The Start of the B-Model Since I like the main model better, I'm building the alternate first, so that's how I'll write the review. There's "power" for something (probably the engine) being taken off the one axle here. Overall, a pretty standard Technic frame beginning with some structural beams, a frame, and using liftarms to support axles out to the sides. More of the Frame The far end of the model has some obvious steering mechanism being formed, as well as a pivoting arm right in the center that's probably the connection from the Hand of God knob. The Steering Yup. Called it. Oddly, there is a different turning radius between right and left right now. I wonder if that'll get fixed... More Mechanisms That's looking more Technic now. Sad to see a u-joint being used just as a fixed straight connection like that, but it is the alternate model... The Engine Block Because all engines should be enclosed in a red cylindrical housing, am I right? The Chassis It's definitely coming together now. And yes, the B-model instructions tell you to put the stickers on. It doesn't matter whether you build the main or alternate first, you'll get the stickers on (almost - there were a couple leftover that didn't get used in the B-model). Almost Done With the rest of the body done and the wheels on, you really get the scale of this machine. That blue seat is tiny compared to the rest of it! And yes, the uneven steering lock got fixed. After putting the wheels on, you add a couple of "pin with ball" pieces to the underside to restrict the steering. They didn't do that at first so that you could turn the axles sharper while putting the wheels on, which made it easier to do. The Grinder Keeping in mind the scale of the machine, this thing looks terrifying! The tan gear at the back drives the spinning blade up front. The red bushes near the turntable let you adjust the angle. All Done The arm quickly attaches to the body and it's done. Sadly, that tan gear doesn't connect to anything - it's just a knob so you can spin the blade by hand. Raise Your Hand, If You're Sure... (I think I'm dating myself with that title...) This thing has massive reach. I'm imagining this inside a mine, grinding away the rock overhead. Pretty viciously effective machine! The crank on this side of the model is used to raise and lower the arm. Works well, and the grey spacer makes it nice to use since it spins freely. The Leftovers Not much left for a B-model. Nice usage! Starting the Main Model The main model starts similarly to the alternate, with a frame, some axles, and a drive connection from one axle to something later. Getting Complicated Already We're only a few pieces in and we already have three separate gear trains going on. There's the axle driving the tan beveled gears inside the frame at the bottom. There's more tan gears in the middle, and there's also a black gear sticking up as a knob that turns the grey connector in the center. The Body is Done I skipped ahead quite a bit, but it was a bunch of standard Technic building. You've got a fake engine with fan at the back, driven by one of the rear wheels, a knob sticking up for steering, and an axle coming forward to open and close the claw. The Claw! I like that they used a link system to open and close the claw instead of just gearing it. The axle comes forward from the chassis (it's the red axle) with a couple u-joints for flexibility and drives a worm gear. That rotates a gear below with a 2 stud liftarm on each side. Those arms have pin with towball in them and then a link going from that short liftarm to the claw. It's a small rotation of the liftarm, but makes the claw open widely and works very well. Raising the Claw A few black liftarms join the claw to the body of the loader and allow it to move up and down. It's a simple mechanism there - one yellow beam goes back and connects to a lever that lets you raise and lower the claw. When raised (as shown), the lever locks in place by going just slightly past the centerline. And It's Done Add some wheels, a cab, and some wheel arches and we're done. It's a great looking machine, pretty unique, and looks like the real thing. The main difference from reality is these usually have a scoop for moving loose rock. Since we've had so many scooping vehicles in the past (tracked loaders, the Volvo L350F, excavators, etc) the claw here is a fun change and adds to the playability for kids. Like the real thing, the body stays very low so the cab only has to stick up a little bit for the driver to see all around, because mines are cramped and busy areas. From the Rear This angle is great. I love the use of the new mudguard panels to make a nice curve to the back of the loader. The antenna is a little weird, but perhaps they had a big pile of flat silver fencing swords to use up. The black gear just to the left of the antenna is the claw control. Rotating that gear opens and closes it. The back end is a little lighter than a real machine would be, but Lego wanted to leave the engine exposed so you can see the cylinders moving. The Conclusion So, what's my conclusion on this model? I like it a lot. It's simpler than a big set would be, but it's got lots of design and playability crammed in a mid-sized set. It's a unique vehicle. However, it does have a few flaws. The steering on the main model needs some drag added. As is, you basically have to drive by holding the steering knob since it'll bend if you push it from behind. I don't like the use of pin with pin hole as mounting points for the orange and red trans plates for lights, since they can turn slightly and be at weird angles. The antenna is unnecessary and in the way. But none of these flaws are dealbreakers or even big deals. They're minor. The Ratings Value: 10/10 - Less than 10 cents a piece, lots of useful liftarms and such, nothing too weird or single-use. Design: 9/10 - Looks very realistic for the size of the set, good functionality, not too dependent on stickers Minifigs: n/a - n/a Playability: 9/10 - Controls aren't perfect (loose steering, small knob for claw control) but very functional and cleverly done. Parts: 9/10 - Nice selection, although heavy on the standard yellow and black. Almost zero studded parts. Overall: 9.5/10 - It's a great intro to Technic set - a unique vehicle, good functionality, nice part selection, and decently priced. I like it a lot and plan to keep it around as a finished set.	positive
Great review with high quality pictures, well done!! I'm glad you took the time to do it properly. Cool that you have built both models. I agree with the mudguards. They sure look good on this model.	positive
Thanks for the thorough comments! I agree that the set has some limitations, both in construction and realism, but I think they're acceptable given the pricepoint and size. The antenna is definitely ludicrous - I really do suspect they had a surplus of the swords to use up! And yes, the way the steering knob is mounted is loose. I also noticed that the u-joints to the claw are not in the right spot like you mentioned, but didn't include it since it still works fine. That axle coming forward to the claw has a very long unsupported section that does bend a bit when you raise and lower the claw. It works, but is a bit of a cheat that I'm kinda surprised they let through. I just checked and the bucket from 8043 is a couple studs too wide for this set. I'm betting that was seriously considered, but it'd have meant scaling the whole thing up and that would have put it into a higher price point. Or they could have pulled the mold for the 8x14 bucket back out and remade it for this set... I really like the model you built! And that's interesting about the cabs being basically flush with the top but sticking out the side. In image searching as part of my research, I found both that style and ones like this, with the cab sticking up more (like the photo of the Caterpillar one in my review). I wonder if that's a US/European difference, or different types of mining, or what, because both styles definitely exist in the real world.	neutral
Excellent review! Worth waiting for. The set itself is very interesting. looks like it may have one interesting build techniques. Thanks for the review, Andy Ad	positive
Great review, thank you. The set to me is kinda blah, interested more in the new panels than the rest of it.	neutral
Great review and great pictures ! Many thanks for talking the time to review this set . I am a fan of LEGO Technic construction stuff, but this set is not so appealing to me. But, then again I am sure some people will love it.	negative
Great review! One thing reaaaaaally bothers me about this set, both models have the engine connected to one wheel, the other wheel on the "powered" axle is just left to rotate freely, and that really bothers me, as it did in 42022 (on 42022 even more TBH, since its main feature is being a frigging car). Looking at the pics it isnt even a space issue (as it was in the hot rod, where they "needed" to route the steering through), so they just cheaped out and didnt bother fitting a diff in there (or even a live axle link) Im not very interested in this set (not into construction stuff), but i think this is a worrying trend :(	negative
Definately a quirky set, I think I'd have prefered a bucket on the front with a complex lift and tip mechanism, but a grab is different. As for the B model, I may prefer it's functions to the A model, certainly something different we have not seen before.	neutral
Great review indeed!	neutral

Lego 42045 Technic Hydroplane Racer Thanks to Lego and EuroBricks for making this review possible! This was supposed to be a preview-review, before the Dec 1 release date for the set, but it got stuck in customs or something and didn't arrive in time. Well, I'd rather do a good, late review than a rushed review, so here it is. Name: Hydroplane Racer Set Number: 42045 Pieces: 180 Price: $19.99 Minifigs: 0 Theme: Technic Year of Release: 2016 Links: Bricklink Brickset The Box Standard Technic box. Action photo, 2-in-1 logo, inset of functions. And the new "try our app" logo in the corner. The Box Back More standard stuff with the B-model and a larger app ad. The Contents 3 bags, two manuals (yes, despite all the ads for their instructions app, they included printed manuals for both the main and B models!), a BIG sticker sheet, and two loose black beams. The Interesting Parts There's a lot of panels in this set. Some are new colors (the blue curved panel) and the L-shaped blue panels are a new mold. I see them being used as mudguards on future sets (or maybe even this year; I haven't looked at the other 2016 Technic sets in detail yet). The hose, soft axle 7 long in black is new as well. The normal 7 axle in yellow is a new color too, and I have no idea why it's in this set. Both models use it in invisible places, so there's no reason other than making it easier to grab the right length axle to have it. I assume other sets this year are using it, but I'm not sure. The Manual And the dumbing-down continues. Now they have to show people to compare axle lengths to the 1:1 prints on the page that have always been there. But how does the 1:1 work on the app? Might have to look into that... (for the record... I pulled out my phone and tried to find the app in the Google store. Couldn't find it. So then I went to the Lego website shown on the page and it had a link to it. Turns out it wasn't showing up because it's tablet only, so Google wasn't showing it to me on my phone. I'll try again later with a tablet...) Starting the Build Two Technic standards. A bunch of pieces linked together to make a specific pattern of holes, and an engine block. Some Weirdness This felt very weird to me - making the crankshaft for the engine, they have you build it right to left. I don't know if it's because I'm a lefty or what, but it felt awkward. I need to look in some old manuals and see if it's always been this way... (nope! I randomly looked at 2013's set 42000 Racer, and it builds it left to right.) Assembling the Core Here's the core of the racer, upside down. The engine block, some gears at each end, and a couple boat studs for smooth gliding. And yes, they cheated and those are only attached on two studs instead of all 4. I'm always amazed at how Lego geometry keeps finding interesting ways that it works. Like here, with those boat studs. They fit perfectly into the bottom of the brick and against the beam. The Front End Up front we get a standard blue seat with a couple "hidden" wheels behind it. A boat doesn't typically have wheels, but these will drive the mechanisms of this model, so we'll let it slide. An odd part choice here though - in the very front there are two tan "axle pin without friction" parts holding that 3 long liftarm on. Why? There's no need in either model for the non-friction pin, and there's lots of the normal blue axle pins in the set. So why include these two different pins? And All Done! It looks like a huge jump here, but it's really not. The front and rear connect to each other, and then a bunch of big panels are added that make the model look WAY bigger. The stickers on this set really make it work. Without them it's pretty bland and boring, so I recommend using them. From the Rear At the back we have a fan to propel the boat. That's not so accurate. All the images I can find of real-life boats use props in the water. But since this is a non-floating model, we have to make some tweaks I guess. There also should be fins going down into the water for stability and hydroplaning, but again, had to drop that. Here's an example of a real boat: You can see they nailed the overall look quite well. The Underside For those that want to see the mechanicals, here's the underside of the model. Minifig Scale Technic? Nope, not quite. A fig will fit the seat, but sticks out of the cockpit and can't fit a helmet at all. So close... Starting the B Model Again with the engine block, but this time an opposing 4 instead of inline. An Odd Part It's rare for Lego to include parts specific to the B-model, so I was curious when I found this 2-axle with pin, a fairly new part. In the main model, it's used in a place that a normal 3 pin would have been fine, and it's the only one of these in the whole set, so it obviously must be needed in the B-model. Sure enough, there's an assembly here that needs it: The Front of the Boat More upside-down building. And that silver piston is basically only there as a spacer. It has no real function. (Yet.... it turns out later an axle goes into it, so it's a support for one end of the axle.) Adding the Wheels We keep building around the engine. This model uses the same wheel setup as the main model. Taking Shape The B-model instructions tell you to put the stickers on in case you haven't - they actually did a good job making the sticker work on either model. But the silver piston used as a cross-brace is a bit weird. It can spin, so that axle hole on the side ends up facing whatever way it wants. The Back End The flex axles are used here under the panels just for appearance and to support the exhausts at the right angle. Same fan propulsion as the main model, and just as wrong here :) Worse, the gearing is switched. In the main model, the pistons and fan spin pretty quickly as you push the boat across the floor. In this one, they turn very slowly. More Instruction Weirdness I'm always curious at how Lego decides to do instructions. Here's how the panels on one side of the boat are assembled. For the mirror image on the other side, they tell you to put all 3 pins into the short panel as step 1 (2 black and a blue), add the white piece as step 2, and then add teh second panel and stickers as step 3. Why two different ways? All Done Here's a similar angle as most of the official images. Looks ok. I noticed though how obvious the wheels are. The back of the box image is a lower angle that hides them more. And I like the mudguard panels as seats. Pretty clever. From the Side I'm not fond of the profile. It doesn't sit level like I think it should. The wheels are a stud too low sticking out of the bottom. The Underside Like most B-models, there are compromises. There's pins and axles sticking out, but that's what you do when faced with a limited piece selection. Minifig Scale Yet? Nope, not quite. A bit too big this time. I think the driver is supposed to sit in the seat with knees over the front of the guard (where the grey pin is). So the minifig is way too small. Spare Pieces Very few leftovers in this B-model. The Conclusion So, what's my conclusion on this model? The B-model is fairly meh, and too similar to the main model. However, I LOVE the hydroplane racer itself. It looks great and is very swooshable. For the price, it's surprisingly large thanks to the big panels on the sides, Yes, this is one set that really needs the stickers to look good, but they look great and are well worth putting on. The Ratings Value: 9/10 - Close to 10 cents a piece, and a fairly large model for the price. Design: 9/10 - Looks great other than the tiny fan on the back. Minifigs: n/a - I was tempted to give a score since a minifig almost fits, but that'd be cheating. Playability: 8/10 - Not much functionality other than the engine and fan spinning, but very swooshable and sturdy enough to be played with. Parts: 9/10 - A bunch of panels (including some new ones), just about every kind of Technic pin, and quite a few thin liftarms . Overall: 9/10 - The set is a solid winner, as long as your satisfied with the main model.	positive
Quote And the dumbing-down continues. Now they have to show people to compare axle lengths to the 1:1 prints on the page that have always been there. But how does the 1:1 work on the app? Might have to look into that... (for the record... I pulled out my phone and tried to find the app in the Google store. Couldn't find it. So then I went to the Lego website shown on the page and it had a link to it. Turns out it wasn't showing up because it's tablet only, so Google wasn't showing it to me on my phone. I'll try again later with a tablet...) Funny thing is that they changed colour of 7L axle to yellow, and on that picture it still is in LBG.	neutral
Thanks for a great review! Too bad there is only one blue curved panel in this set. My opinion on the frictionless axlepins is that the flex axle might be easier to stick in them than in regular/blue axlepins... Didn't actually try it though :-) Edited by MajklSpajkl, 05 December 2015 - 11:46 PM.	negative
Thank you for the review. I have this one in my pile to build. I wish there was more of the curved blue panels though.	negative
Nice review, thanks Nice little set, I might buy me one	positive
Very timely review Jim. My wife has just surprised me by giving me this set a few days ago and I have just built the A model two days ago and B model yesterday. I agree with all that you wrote above. I don't have Tumbler tires but I have 9398 tires. Driving is smooth but steering + suspension will be bad as you said due to negative caster and tires hitting the chassis. Anyway, tonight I will destroy the B model and rebuilt this http://www.busterhau...8-c-model.html.	positive
I was supposed to publish it together with the 42039 - 24 Hours Racer, but it somehow got backlogged. After completing the reviews for the 2016 sets, I felt I needed to finish it (was already 90% done). That C-model looks cool!	positive
Great review. I bought this model several weeks ago and the box has sat on my shelf, so I think after this I will be digging it out for Christmas and I expect my son will have a lot of fun with it when it's built. PS. these Tumbler tyres look amazing on this model, and indeed amazing in their own right!	positive
I think this model is more or less supposed to be a version of this thing. A pretty obscure topic, but also very interesting.	neutral
You switched the sides for the panel with the unsymmetrical sticker. Otherwise you would see that the cut off part is where there's a beam in front of the panel. That's probably done because the beam could possibly damage the sticker, either while building or while placed against it for a long time. Or it's simply omitted because it wouldn't be (completely) visible	neutral
Great review and pictures as always. Its an odd combo, but I agree that the B model looks good with tumbler tires THERIZE, on 14 December 2015 - 09:32 PM, said: I could be wrong but I am 100% sure that I've seen this review before. I believe Jim posted the same one in the reviewers academy	positive
Another great review I like this set very much, both models look good to me and it's a great part pack for me, the long list in the "high light parts" session tells everything. As for the real world counter part of the A model, how about this: Try googling Sno-Cat and there a lots of such things.	positive
Until I saw photos of this set I wasn't convinced I wanted it. Now after seeing all the combinations (A+B and tumbler tires!) I am definitely buying two copies. I need orange parts and black treads anyway. The only problem I have with this is that it's going to encourage me to buy many copies of the drag racer just to get enough wheels to play with.	positive

A symmetrically stickered panel could have more (re)uses for the MOC'ers. On Lego's own B-model, they handily camouflage it with the exhausts	neutral
Jim/anyone....i built this set a few days ago, i dont like the way the crane arm section has no knob to turn the mini turntable. you see the 20 tooth gear?....there is a pinhole located next to this....i would like to add something here to make it easier to turn the winch section.	negative
I have the 42038, nice set but I found the tipping of the bed clumsy. It was a pleasure to build and I do like the build with the tumble wheels	negative
Thank you Jim, nice Review It´s a great set: A lot unique parts and not just pins, axles and beams. I bough it to bring me back to Lego from my DA (10 years)... PS. Soon I will post an alternative model	positive
You wrote a very accurate review of this set, Jim. It's a pretty good model (with some obvious problems) but it's an even better parts pack. Your pictures with the Tumbler tires are great.

REVIEW - 42001 - MINI OFF-ROADER INTRODUCTION Technic Mini models are sometimes regarded as models not worth buying. I don't agree with this opinion. Whether it's a special part or innovative building technique, almost every Mini model has something that makes the set worthwhile. This time I will be reviewing the 42001 Mini Off-Roader. This model is not a smaller version of an existing model, so there's no real comparison with a bigger brother, or sister if you will. Nor does the model resemble a real life brand or vehicle, so it is what it is, a Mini Off-Roader. Note: All images can be clicked for hi-res versions. SET INFORMATION Number: 42001 Title: Mini Off-Roader Theme: Technic Released: 2013 Part Count: 100 Box Weight: 165 gr Box Dimensions: 15,5 x 14,0 x 4,2 cm Set Price (MSRP): 9.99 EUR DE / 7.99 GBP / 12.99 USD Price per Part: DE 0.100 EUR / UK 0.080 GBP / USA 0.130 USD Links: Brickset, Bricklink THE BOX The box measures 15,5 x 14,0 x 4,2 cm which is obviously not very big. The weight of the box is approximately 165 grams. FRONTSIDE The front of the box shows a though four wheel drive off-roader challenging a fierce rocky mountain trail...now does it?! What the box actually shows is Mini Off-Roader challenging a small foam rock formation, much like rocks used in Star Trek The Original Series, yet smaller The box also states that this model is for the age of 7 till 14. More importantly, the 2-models in-1 logo is clearly visible, which means this set can be used to build two different models. BACKSIDE The backside shows a picture of the alternate model and a smaller version of the original model. The conversion arrow and the 2-in-1 are printed to clarify that the main model can be converted into a secondary model. SIDES One of the sides shows the 2-in-1 logo and a picture of the main model. Another side shows a picture of one of the wheels in actual size and again, a picture of the main model. CONTENTS OF THE BOX The box contains: 2 Booklets 2 Bags 4 Tires BOOKLETS This set contains two booklets which is not very common for a set this size. Both models share the same chassis, which is why the build has been divided over two booklets, one for the chassis (8 pages with 10 steps) and one for the bodywork (34 pages with 23 steps for the main model and 20 steps for the alternate model). BAGS The box contains only 2 bags which is to be expected from a set consisting of 100 parts. One of the bags is filled with liftarms, panels, rims and two elastic bands. The other bags contains all the other parts, like pins, axles, connectors, etc. Opening the bags results in the following collection of parts, with the exception of the tires. No abundant number parts that will add real value to your collection. Nevertheless, there are some interesting orange parts and elastic bands. TIRES The tires are provided seperately (i.e. not contained in the bags). From the picture you can see that these tires have a front and a back side, so you should pay attention when fitting them to the rims, which have two different sides as well. HIGHLIGHTED PARTS This section describes the unique and/or highlighted parts. VERY SMALL SMOOTH TECHNIC PANEL (#21 AND #22) These two small Technic were new at the time of release and this set was only one of two sets containing them in orange. The other set is the 42007 - Moto Cross Bike. At the moment of writing there's a third set containing these parts, the Black Champion Racer. Side A Side B SMALL RUBBER BAND I was under the impression that these White Rubber Bands weren't that common, but it seems that these bands are as common as dirt. But hey, you can't have enough rubber bands! THIN LIFTARM 1x5 WITH AXLE HOLES Like the panels, these Liftarms were also new at the time of release. Looking at the the frequent usage in other sets, this part has proven to be a most useful mammal. THIN LIFTARM 1x3 Not a very rare piece per se, but if you are not into Bionicle, this liftarm part can be hard to find. Your other option would be to buy the 9390 - Mini Tow Truck, or the 8305 - Dual Bikes from a while ago (2000). LONG PIN WITH CENTER PIN HOLE This relatively new kid on the block is currently used in many Technic and non-Technic sets and has well proven it's worth. AXLE PIN CONNECTOR HUB WITH 2 AXLES Like the previous part this newish part is also quite helpful in certain situations. PART LIST Here's the complete list for all 100 parts. BUILDING EXPERIENCE The build starts with the chassis of the Off-Roader. After connecting some liftarms two elastic bands, one on each side, are attached to the towball pins. This is all there is to the suspension, plain and simple. The two elastic bands contract the L-shaped liftarms, which results in the long ends swiveling downwards. The video below demonstrates the suspension. The simplicity doesn't do it justice, because it works like a charm. The suspension is very smooth with the right amount of stretch and resistance. This great working suspension adds a lot of value to this set. To quote John Hurt in the movie Contact: "Why build one when you can have two at twice the price?". I have purchased two sets so we can simultaneously see both models and make a proper comparison. Below you can see two identical chassis which will be used for both versions of the build. At this stage we have arrived at the end of the first booklet, which only took about ten minutes. Not surprising, since the first booklet only has 10 building steps. Progressing to the second booklet, you need to choose between building the main and alternative model. That's a choice I don't need to make for this review, so let's start with the main model. MAIN MODEL When building the bodywork there's a rather peculiar building technique, which you wouldn't expect in an official LEGO set. The Axle and Pin Connector Hub with 2 Axles only protrudes halfway into the Double Bent Liftarm. The Thin 1x4 Liftarm which is added in one of the following steps makes sure the hubs stay perfectly in place, but I was still surprised to see this technique. The finished bodywork for the main model looks like....uhh...well.....I don't know exactly. It doesn't bear any resemblance to a real life model, which makes it hard to judge. One thing's for sure; it's not the best looking Technic Mini Model. The bodywork can be attached to the chassis by using a 7L axle and two bushes, one on each side of the chassis. ALTERNATE MODEL Unfortunately the alternate model doesn't look much better than the main model. It's even a stud less wide, while you would like to see slightly more body, matching the size of the tires and chassis. Attached to the chassis the body is even more out of proportion. It's not really ugly and the color scheme is great (obviously this goes for the main model as well), but the body simply doesn't match the chassis. I can only imagine that this model is supposed to have a chibi look, much like the Microfighter Star Wars models. COMPARISON The following section shows a selection of images from different angles to compare the main and secondary model. The main model has a bit more volume, while the alternate model has a more sporty look. FRONT VIEW The main model has headlights which are attached at a higher point, while the alternate model has headlights which are placed more closely next to each other. REAR VIEW A slightly different setup in both models, where the main model again has higher placed rear lights. SIDE VIEW The side view shows that the panels are used differently in both models. The main models uses them as doors, while the alternate model uses them as engine cover (bonnet). TOP VIEW The top view reveals that the main model might have room for a minifig PARTS LEFT The left image shows the parts which are left after building the main model, while the second image shows the parts left after building the alternate model. As you can see, the main model uses slightly more parts than the alternate model. FEATURES Besides the awesome suspension, which we already have discussed, there aren't a lot of features in this set. There's actually a single feature, which is only present in the main model....opening doors! Wow, impressive! Well, maybe we can't expect too much functionality in such a small model. SUMMARY The Off-Roader is a fun model which is fairly easy to build. The suspension is simple, yet very effective. The model could do better in the design department, but the suspension offers great playability and that is what this set is all about. The orange parts are not very common so they are an added bonus. All things considered this set is definitely worth the few bucks you need to spend on it. PROS Great suspension Fun to play with Some (semi) rare orange parts Great color scheme CONS No resemblence to an actual off-roader Not the best looking model SCORE Below are my scores based on different categories. 6 DESIGN Not the best looking Technic model. 7 BUILDING EXPERIENCE The suspension makes it fun to build. 7 FEATURES The suspension makes up for the lack of functionality. 8 PLAYABILITY The model has Car-Swooshability. 7 PARTS Some interesting orange parts. 8 VALUE FOR MONEY Great present for the younger builders. 7,1 ELASTIC Hope you enjoyed it! Thanks for reading and please rate this set at the top of this topic!	positive
Once again, excellent review Jim! Than you for not skipping this small but pretty great set. I also got two of this and I have to say, I really admire the nifty suspension. Building a third bodywork for the same suspension system is still on my backlog.	positive
The suspension is indeed awesome. For it's size, this is a great set! Looking at the grades, I seem to have lowballed the score.	positive

I don't like appearance of this off-roader at all but I've got it as gift so it's in my Technic collection now.

Here is the review...for Broadside's Brig 6259! A set from 1991, with a handsome count of 64 pieces, 3 figures, and a sale price of $8.75! The building(and parrot): We'll start off with the front. It looks like a good solid building to hold those scurvy dogs! We yonder over to the left side: And see a nice open back: And yonder to the plain right side: Back to the left, we find the corner, with a nice area to rest your tired soldiers! We see the platform in the corner, a lovely place for soldiers to stand on! It's a bit...skimpy, so watch your step! The middle is blocked by some stones, assuring security! But still open enough to stand in! The jail is cramped, and fits only TWO people, but we only need one prisoner in this set :-) ! Moving up is the watch tower, a place for your soldier stand and stand watch or for silly parots to sit on! Here's the front middle part, again those stones blocking the way! Figures and Accesories: We have a delightful number of a soldier, a sailor, and a scurvy pirate! A lovely parot! And a generous assortment of weapons! That concludes our review. Overall: It's a fantastic little set, and great for army and supplies and bricks gathering! I can't find any faults with this set, it's just the neatest little thing you've seen in a port *wub* Highly recomended *y* . And to end our review: A comic!	positive
You've done a good job of this review Mr ImperialScouts! But two things. 1) Background far too bright and the set is far too dark, easily rectified with Brightness & Contrast adjustment. 2) No poll to rate the set out of 5. Nonetheless this should be frontpaged on Classic-Pirates.com!	neutral
A fine little set with 64 pieces and 3 figures for under $10. May have seemed a bit steep in 1991, but I wouldn't know, I'd passed into my dark ages already, so alas, I haven't a copy of this set. Looking at the parts list, I could build one out of my current inventory though. Issued today for $10, I'd buy no less than 14 of them, even though it does lack the obligatory rowboat for the pirate to make his escape in. Very nice review and comic, thanks for doing them! *y* Edited by imperialshadows, 20 October 2007 - 06:10 AM.	positive

The Poll doesn't allow you to select 2 from 1-5. It instead says 1, 3, 3, 4, 5.

Wow i went to my local toysrus and apparently they had some there dont really like them but there neat:)	negative
Not my thing, but a very nice review, thanks for sharing it! I was seriously considering this one when it was originally announced as a 6212 copack item at a particularly good price and then everything changed. I do, however, seriously ache to get my hands on one of the more traditionally LEGO looking 2ft+ Vaders they use in the official stores (at least they had one here in Orlando). *wub*	negative

During the annual Thanksgiving Road Trip to the relatives, I stopped by the TRU in Portland, OR. Lo and behold, the new Mars Mission sets! Obviously, I bought them. ;-) The box: Not much to say. Standard box art for MM sets, nothing new. The parts: Some good parts here. Even if you don't like the set (Which I highly doubt after I've had my say :-P ), it's a decent parts pack. I noticed that some old parts have been renewed. I know the wheel has been used in the '07 sets, but the cockpit and hitch I haven't seen in a while. The VLDSS (Very large DSS). Grr. New part. At least, I think it is. Someone slap me if it isn't. *wacko* The figs. I know I've seen that head before, but I have no idea where. Does anyone know? I was hoping that the aliens would have new arms, at least. I was sadly mistaken... On the upside, I finally discovered that they glow in the dark. :-$ The alien has a jetpack. If that's not the silliest thing I've ever seen, I don't know what is. The build. Simple build. A block. So easy a caveman cou- oh, never mind. Geico's used that one enough. Then, we have this jobber right here. Not sure what it is, but it looks like some crystal scanning device. It's starting to look pretty nice. It almost looks practical. The cockpit is suffering from a bad dose of over-stickering. On the upside, we have a new piece there to hold the cockpit on. Part 1 complete. It has a nice little radio antenna, which is ruined by the use of a random missile that looks like it's going to shoot the antenna before it shoots the alien. Still, I never say no to a good missile I can use for something else. The trailer: Fairly simple, but it works. It features stabilizing arms, a handheld saw, and an extremely random mini-bot who's purpose escapes me. The Whole Meal Deal- Erm, general pics. Overall, I thought this was a good set. In fact, it reminds me of this:	positive
Cool review, thanks!! :-D I personally think the minirobot is awesome, and (dare I say) cute! This was described on Amazon to be a mobile lab, I'm not seeing that. I do however see a crystal hauling vehicle. *sweet* Pretty cool, not as bad as previous sets. ~Peace	positive
very cool. i'm getting this one as soon as its in america! well maybe. depends on how much money I have.	positive
i got most of the sets from '07, they're pretty cool.	positive
Thanks for the review, it's a neat little set. I hope it comes to Australia sooner rather than later. That minifig head was also used in 7699 MT-101 so that may be why it seems familiar.	positive

Hmm, not actually a bad set. Not high on my 'to buy' list, there're other things up there first, but definitely a possibility somewhere down the line. Thanks for the review.	neutral
Great review, but am I the only one who thinks this is a pretty homely looking vehicle? The small exploration robot is cool, but the large windscreen on the main vehicle reminds me about Jack Stone! I also think the bases of the vehicle parts are very basic and look almost unfinished with the holes and such. I think I will pass this one, even though the alien has a jet pack and there is the nice mini vehicle.	negative
Ah, thanks so much again, Mr. M! This set looks great! I probably won't get this though. I hat MM as far as it goes. I agree with xwingyoda on this one. Does the minibots wheels move? Edited by ~VBBN~, 26 November 2007 - 10:34 PM.	negative

Thanks for posting the picture of this new MM set. When I first saw the Mars Mission sets I was a little apprehensive about the design and the aliens (They could have at least make movable arms :(), but anyways when I bought the small fighter I was totally hook. My fave set from the line is the mech.	positive
cool review. I'm actually liking that new missile part as it seems to combine a bar with a pin. But it's a real eyesore if you ask me.	positive
Hmm, Its actually a nice bit better than I expected, and great review, thanks! But think ill pass on this one. I quite like the alien fighter though, heh. And loved the way you described how he sat in the cockpit.	negative
Very cool review, Mr. Mandalorian! This isn't a bad set, the alien craft is very sleek (if only they'd gone with the old alien body in trans-green...) and the transforming is alright. The tank mode looks sweet. *sweet* ~Peace	positive
after seeing this set review it change my mind about this set. By the way thanks for the great review.	neutral
Thanks for that very good review, Mr. Mandalorian! *y* I think that this is a plain beautiful set, oh how I wish that TLC would?ve taken that direction from the beginning.... :'-) The design is much more practicable, with fewer non-system parts and technic beams with(!) studs.... this makes everything much more easier to MOD and a lot more useful, at least IMO. *y* So it?s for sure not very hard to make the (wonderful enclosed) cockpit one brick higher, and even that little Alien Ship looks decent and nice.... X-O And the fighter looks sleek and elegant too, in both modes! That?s just very cool, compliments, TLC. Now all we need?re aliens with moving arms and here we go, Classic Space on forever! X-D	positive
Thanks for a very thorough review. I might think about getting this. I really like the mini alien fighter, and the transformation idea is always a welcome one. Both modes look pretty good, despite the some of the odd coloured bricks (which I'd MOD out). You know what it reminds me of? Some of the futuristic designs in the Gerry Anderson series.	positive
Wow. This is actually quite a neat set! It is definitively my favorite in the line after the big drilling unit! \begin{geek} I'm not sure it would nose dive when transforming from tank mode. I guess it would pick up speed and transform quickly since it doesn't seem to have any downwards pointing thrusters. \end{geek}	positive
hmmm, I doubt I'll be getting this set. Good review though.	negative
I really like the transforming aspect of this! The one thing I wish MM sets would include would be baseplates. I liked that about the classic space stuff because it really helped create the environment. Some "Red Rock Orange" Mars Baseplates would be great!	positive

The one thing you'd have to make sure of, though, is that it was fairly light and the wheel base had a fairly large surface area (actually, that's two things), so as to make sure it didn't dig into the soil. If that happened, transformation would be harder as the wheels would dig into the ground and drag through the soil. Then it'd nose dive.	neutral
Great review Mr Mandalorian! *y* I'm not a fan of MM and don't like this set much, but it has some neat features. But the only way I can see it transforming is by racing off a cliff and swinging its wings out *wacko* To the Brickmobile! >:-)	negative
and another tks and congrats MM on that review !! Like the o?her post I think that this set is a wastre of time and money and shelfspace. Its such a ripp off from that ugly Alfa Team crapjet. I do not like the design of the jet itself: the small flags as front is so lame !! And I don't like those orange wheels as engines !! Furthermore I don't like the "rover" mode either !! The only cool thing about it is the special martian jet which they should ahve sold separatly :-P At least some interesting parts but that far from saving that set IMO |-/ Money Saved On once again :-P *yoda*	negative

Sweeeet. *wub* It's nice to finally see a set that's not bipedal or (?) Tripedal. Quote Exo-Force is an anomaly in my LEGO interests. I don't know why I like it so much or why I keep buying it but I do. That would be a problem, wouldn't it? :-P Quote The cockpit itself is constructed very well but the canopy seems like an afterthought, closing on to the robot's head and leaving his back and sides completely exposed. I dunno. At least it has a canopy, unlike past sets..	positive

Thanks for that very neat review, Hinckley! *y* This set looks indeed very interesting, with a very cool antlike look and a simple but essential overall design.

this designers were on a roll with this one until it came to the flying unit. It looks like a shambles, epecially the guns looking rather simplistic.

This one is much better than I thought; I didn't expect the gun and the "turret" to be geared! I agree that a lot of the details sux (hollow inside, lame cockpits...) but as an overall package it looks quite good. The best part is.... no shooter! Is the nightmare finally over? :'-) The bonus robot is a much better idea. The large amount of blue pieces make this a must buy for me as Impartial needs more raw materials! :-P How well do the tracks work? The last tank was too light and it didn't roll well at all. :-/ Thanks for these photos as well Hinckley. *wub* So far the 08 Exo-Force sets are looking good! *sweet* Hinckley, on Nov 28 2007, 04:48 PM, said: And actually I did feel the same way you did about the flying module, until I put Sinner in it and started to play. :-P Wow!

I think the Mobile Defense Tank, although a better overall design, suffered from the odd angle of the treads and that was mostly why the treads didn't turn well. Plus, what was with those weird exhaust pipes?? Anyway, they are both cool tanks although I like the Mobile Defense Tank better... :-)	neutral
Fantastic! Great review, thanks a bunch for all the pics, they've shown me how (in my opinion) bad this set is. :-P I just expected it to be more bricky rather than technicy. Oh well, I wasn't planning on buying it anyway. X-D I noticed you spelt mini-figs mini-fgis in the first paragraph, in case you wanted to know. X-D So again, thanks, and I'm looking forward to seeing the rest of them, and the comics! ~Peace	negative
Thanks for this great review Hinckley! :'-) I know you're loving this attention! X-D :-P I actually like this set, and like it a lot more now that I've seen this review. I'll most likely get, mostly for the figs and parts. I reckon it would look a lot better alongside the rest of the 2008 EF mechs. Anyway, thanks for the review! To the Brickmobile! >:-)	positive
Thanks for this other great review, Hinckley *y* ! You sure you don't work as one of TLC's PRs? X-D ;-) Everytime I see one of your reviews I want to buy the set, and that is sweet to me, but bad for my money 8-| LuxorV	neutral
Thanks for that good review, Hinckley. *y* A really interesting set and a turning point for LEGO. Minirobots instead of shooting crap, pretty cool. I hope the kids?ll like it too. For the design, I love that asymmetrical look of the front part and the sleek guns of the flyer. It?s smart that the gatling gun moves along with the tank, too. The set idea with two vehicles in one?s not new, but very play- able and the treads/big wheel design?s cool. I don?t like the use of studless technic beams, but well, they do their job I guess. And Keiken?s cockpit should be easy to improve....	positive

I think this is probably my least favourite set of next years selection, but I still might get it, partly because of this review (thanks, btw). I quite like the mini-robot, and while there are a few problems (the front cockpit, the exposed axles) I relish the idea of MODing them out, and correcting them. And the change back to the original figs is welcome. I didn't really get any of this years sets, only last years. Makes it easier from a MOCing potential, anyway.	neutral

i would agree. the spider looks really cool. too bad we can't see how the combo mech looks like. instructions are not online yet. :-/ there should be another combo mech but you'll need the storm lasher set. :-P	positive
Hinkley, you are the MAN! Your reviews just keep on getting better and better! Although all of the sets this year are great and I love them all to bits, I can't say there was one that I absolutely felt like something I'd buy except for the Storm Lasher. But with this review, I think this will be the first purchase of 2008 for me! I totally agree with you on how the Spider looks better without Mini-robot. But from looking at where the cockpit is placed and how the skull on the cockpit is lodged underneath the walker, maybe the mini-robot would look better mounted underneath the head? That way it looks more even and even gives the thing a nasty set of teeth! I gotta try it out once I get it. Can't wait for the Fabuland comics! Keep it up, Hink!	positive

I gave this one a 5. It's one of the little pirate sets I had during my youth and I loved it for several reasons. First of all, it contains 2 of my favorite minifigs! It can be used as a small independent base or in combination with one of the bigger sets (Eldorado or Trading posts) as a lookup or outer defense. Besides all that, this set just looks beautiful.

its a fantastic set, cant think of anything wrong with it to be honest, even if the island is a bit small, the plate itself is still useful, and the rest of it is also very useful, walls can go toward a bigger fort, cannon can extend your ship, soldiers extend your army, boat extends err your boats, and the island prin is just cool	positive
Its a nice set. I would not mind owning one, just for the minifigs and cannon. The base plate is pretty cool as well. Nice review, I gave it a 4 out of 5.	positive
INDEXED I'm going to have to start dodging cannon balls soon if i don't start making some pirate mocs. *pirate* Anywayz, I've had my Shell Service Station set # 6378 built exactly by "the book" and sitting around for the longest time. With the recent twinning of my "town" with Dr. Sinister, I needed a gas station that could handle a lot more traffic (especially military traffic and these new 6-wide vehicles X-D ). Here be a thumblink to the original station at BL: I love this station so much, but it really needed some modernization. The reopening of this station received a lot of attention, even the local police stopped right over. One big upgrade to this station is the selling of propane tanks, which is generally a rare commodity from the lego towns i've seen. X-D Also at this service station is a propane tank refilling station. The milkman is our first propane customer. The interior has also had an addition and many upgrades. For instance, this building now has florescent lighting, a big frig in the back, and more shelf space. *y* Oh look! there's the officer purchasing a mountain dew. Now that there's more shelf space, we can sell more than just 1x1 round yellow bricks and levers. We now have available 1x1 round plates and 1x1 round cones available in multiple colors! :-D With this upgraded gas station, hopefully this town will bring in more business and customers into my small town. X-D P	positive
:'-) I really love everything you did with this gas station. It looks very cozy!!! Amazing how you said you built it by the book, does that mean you didn't have the set but you used your own pieces to rebuild the thing? The flourescent lighting is genius! And the interior space looks just like what you'd see at those little shops. I really dig the moc ;-) it gives me good ideas and now I want a gas station of my own :-P And the history behind how it was "rebuilt" and how it will improve business etc is so cool *wub*	positive

I like the new skellies because of their posability (I'm a big supporter & user of stop-motion) and I think there's nothing wrong with stickers. I mean seriously, why does everybody hate stickers so much??? :-| Sure, they are a pain in the megablocks to put on and, sure, they come off after a while and are never usable again, but hey, you don't have to put them on, even better, you can save them (like I do) and use them for your mocs! Could somebody tell me, please? I'm just curious. However, as I said, nice set! I might even get one. Gotta love that marion with the carot torch X-D and that arc is neat too! By the way, are all parts on it golden? Some more pics on it would be nice as soon as your camera is recharged! ;-) Thanks. Peace Out! As far as I know, those insignias on the arc are in the movie, too. But I don?t remember if they actually were on the arc or somewhere else. There are a lot of Star Wars references in all the Indiana Jones movies. Looking at your name, you might find it funny to know that the Asian club of Lao Che in Temple of Doom is called "Club Obi-Wan" The plane in the first Indy has the callsign CPO, which I just found out the other day :)	neutral
This and Motorcycle Chase were the two sets I've wanted from the start. I like how you get lots of snakes, and I'll add my snakes in too, for a Brickfilm.

My 2nd review (what a veteran) ... again, found this set via a shop assistant, in my local TRU (Portsmouth, UK) this evening. Comes in at ?44.99, which, is pretty steep, but, you get quite a bit for your money. Front of the Box : Back of the Box : Back of the Box Closeup : Contents : It was a nice surprise to get numbered bags ... not had a large set with numbered bags for quite a while, at least in none of the sets I've bought recently! Didn't take a close up of the stickers, but I was quite disappointed that the curved pieces had stickers ... if they could print the ATT curved pieces, why not these? Minifigs : Oh ... and there's a nice backprint on the Pilot figure : Now, the build was pretty good ... you build the plane first (after the minifigures). Quite an interesting build in a way, becayse for a while you think the back is the front ... and then you realise, heh! Now ... I've not seen the film in a while, but I don't recall a guy flying a plane with a fishing rod ... don't flame me if this is what happens, see earlier point regards not seeing the film in ages!! :-P After that, you build the temple in stages, starting with the entrance first, and then the holey floor section with the spears. These spears are just loosely placed into technic holed bricks. Quite easy to make em flick out but they can go anywhere! hehe Entrance : Holey Floor & Spears : These two parts are hinged and on an angle to each other and the gap makes for a handy bottomless pit, complete with pole for Indy to swing over with his whip. After that, you create the door and the ratchet mechanism to keep it raised. After that, you add the runners for the ball and the swinging knives trap. Swords Trap - Before : After : Finally, you build the statue that holds the efigy. Nice bit of construction here, especially the way that everything falls over once the efigy is removed. Do be careful when putting the curved bits on though ... it appears one of the edges on mine has slightly bent when putting it on ... nowt noticable though. Temple : Preparing to steal : Run!! You can see that the temple has toppled and debris has fallen all around ... And then, as he goes through the door, the door falls (he gets his hat) and then the rock ball starts a rolling! Ruuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuun!! The stickers were a pain though ... there's no room for a border around the sticker here! Beware!! After all that is done, you join all the pieces together and it makes more a really good playset. Plenty of opportunity for recreating scenes here! Idol Closeup : Total Set : Spares : Yet more spare stickers??! (sorry, i've already put the spares in my box of bits!) Overall, 8 out of 10 ... lots of play value and a pretty nice build. Too many stickers though ... and defo poor arms for the skeletons! Edited by imperialshadows, 01 June 2008 - 12:18 PM.	positive

this set is pretty nice i love the idol id probably buy the set just for that :-D lol is it just me or in the earlier concepts of this set we saw a native on the box? i wonder why they removed it :-( *wacko*	neutral
Tks so much Big Pete for thisd awsome review of yet another fantastic Indy sets !! Its clearly one of the best lines of all times with SW 8-? That idol is superb and I love all the details of that set: loads of cool defense mechanisms, sweet vegetation and yeay another black carrot torch :-P And those MFs are really nice !! I am so happy to see Lego go dark tan *wub* Now I clearly can't wait to enjoy building this set ;-) Fertility Idol On !! *yoda*	positive
i just noticed another inconsistency between box art and the actual set ... on the box, the biplan has white wing supports (they're just plane windows without glass in them) and yet the set they are dark grey (or is it bley ... can never tell the difference without careful study). Add to that ... the outer of the engine at the front is white on the box and black in the set. We don't normally have this many inconsistencies do we ?	neutral
Because of exams and other obligations, I haven't posted this sooner. Seeing that no-one else has reviewed this set, I thought I might as well do it myself. The set in its entire glory (minus the slammer, instructions and the (obviously) massive sticker sheet) The four cars included in this set; a muscle car, a sports car, a roadster and the police off-roader(!): Because the police obviously have no clue that an off-roader is useless for catching street-racers, no less a batmobile-ish sports car, it will always trail behind: But the police have a trick up their sleeve - the drawbridge: Gotcha! And the mechanism that makes it all tick: The motor is nothing more than a (slow) pull-back motor. Push down the bridge, the latch will hook on to the gear and keep it in place until the latch is released. And there's the new gas station. Staying within theme, this gas-station is, like the tanker in 8147, from the company Fuel 4 Speed: There's a notable presence of detail here, such as the soda-dispenser, water (coolant?) bottles and other accesories, two fuel pumps and bumper-level railings to prevent cars from crashing into them. There's no interior however. And as demonstrated here by a loyal Octan-employee and a pursuing officer, the gas station is built to minifig-scale: My impressions of this set: As a collector of tiny turbos, and yet to miss a set, I got this one regardless of what it included. The gas station is indeed very nice, and the minifig-scale accesories were unexpected. The lack of interior is no big issue, and the both the station and bridge can with ease be implemented into a mini-fig town. The bridge also solidly built, and includes the ramps in its design, so it can be lifted, with ramps attached, without breaking apart. The slammer included in the set is identical, apart from the white color, with those in 8147. The cars are also very nice, altough I am yet to get used to the yellow batmobile, as I've grown accustomed to calling it. I also love the off-roader's chunky tires, they make perfect wheels for the newer minifig-scale cars. I never consider price/parts ratio, and here it would, for me, be irrelevant, because it will never be demolished for parts. The play value is what I would consider pretty good, and while the bridge won't rise with a car on it, it's still strong enough to stay open with a car tipping over the edge. Hmm. Every nerve in my body is saying that this sets is worth roughly 8/10, so: Verdict: 8/10 Edited by WhiteFang, 23 May 2009 - 07:01 PM. Indexed	positive
Looks like a nice set, I like the tiny turbos and have most of the older individual cars, but I am put off by the ever increasing price of the large sets with lots of extra parts that I'm not really interested in. I wish these were available as individual vehicles as well.	neutral
Thanks for the review! It's really cool that the petrol station is mini-fig scaled, I wasn't expecting that! :-D ~Peace	positive
Picked up from the Lego shop in Bluewater yesterday Front of Box Back of Box Price ?2.50 GBP Contents, a very small instruction manual Instructions (Front) Intsructions (Back) 25 Pieces (23 used in the model) Regular construction mini fig Start of the assembly Roll in the drum Just attach the drum A little tap with the hammer!

Extra cement is always useful and not really wasted. Overall, a nice little set and I am pleased to see little sets appearing again at long last. The only negative is with the drum of the mixer, although the angle can be adjusted you cannot tip the contents out of the mixer. All in all I would say 8/10 for a good little set? Comments...? ? ?

Heres all the parts in assorted baggies, and the horribly messed up instructions. Four astronauts and four aliens, with an extra gold visor (yay!) Not bad. The base of the horribly unstable alien craft. The wings move up and down, aswell as back and forth, the purpose I know not. Next we build the nerf section of the base. Basically technic. And the rest of the tube connectors. Heres the farthest I got the little missle to go. Its fairly dissapointing. Good thing I didnt expect much from this portion of the set. Heres the start of the command base. More of the main structure, will be adding lots of things to all the little beams. Heres a storage container and the surprisingly not flimsy radar. On this side we see the alien elevator. It uses a HORRIBLY long technic rod, I have not seen one of this proportion, its like, a foot and a half long. More of the inner base where all the little tubes shall go. All the connected tubes and such. I also encountered a problem. In the instructions it says for the end of the elevator prong to be touching the tube connector where it is shown here, but mine has a 1x space inbetween. No matter. Heres the completed base. + My knee. Again. Onto the spaceship. The bulk of it is just technic supporting beams, with some large slope peices covering it all up. More on that later. The white coverup. The middle section lifts up to store the overly large jetpack. As you see, the storage containers take up most the bulk in the back, and you can see the jetpack on the ground. Aswell as the trigger hand hold thing that allows you to swoosh it. Look, in the back! Lego Greebles! Despite the large cockpit, it only holds one person, laying down. The wings are really the saving grace - double layered with a nice two toned effect. Kitty nudged me this picture so its abit blurry, my apologies :-| Extra peices and or peices I have no idea where the hell they go. :-P Overall, the set is quite fun I must admit. Full price, I probably would not go for it, But I got it for just under 70 dollars. For that price I can confidently say its quite worth it, many useful peices, nice figures (other than the aliens) and the tube things are quite fun to boot, even though I liked the life on mars system more, which I also have. None the less, its very fun to make them shoot around. Alright, so its not much of a command base either, and it looks abit bare. But it's still fun, even if you ignore the nerf section. Overall I give it a hardy 3.5 out of 5, the openness and epic fail of a missile launcher are hard to get by, but overall, its a dandy set :-D Merry Christmas *wub*	positive
Thanks for the review Brickmaster! I wanted this set at first but I realized I don't want it as much anymore, seems like a waste of 90$. :-(	negative
I don't recall mine having an alignment problem on the tubes... could you perhaps take a closer picture of the area? Did yours also have two of the same sticker for the wings of the alien craft?	neutral
Thanks for this review. Lots of minifigs is a plus, although half of them are junk jellies, but dang the base just doesn't seem impressive. It looks so cheap, like a skeleton. The tubes are just ridiculous. But hey, at least it comes with two cool spacecraft, that's nice.	positive
Thanks for the review Brickmaster! This set looks nice, I really like the orange (*wub*) and white colour scheme, although the purple of the LoM base was very cool too. I only have the LoM base, if you have it built could you show a comparison? On an unrelated note, by the time I realised the red and blue hangers on the LoM base were for the red and blue mechs, the mechs were no longer in stores. :'-( I was a bit slow, huh? :-P Anywho, this is one set I won't be buying, although if the rocket was sold separately I'd get that. :-D Thanks again. *y* ~Peace	neutral

Thanks for the photos and review Brickmaster. I'm hoping to find this on sale as well... no luck so far. I love the white ship, and I think the base would be amusing, but ultimately hard to re-use.

I think this is a very nice little chopper... but the biggest reason why I will probably get this is for the handcuffs! :-D Are the side windows flush like the old ones or recessed like the new ones are supposed to me?

As Brikbitz said on his site in the 7732 postal plane review... Quote You can see the traditional airplane window piece, but the bad news is they've changed the window pane. It's the new flat piece used in 4996 Beach House, it just doesn't work as well. Without the original bevelled edge it doesn't seal the window and there is small noticable gap around the edge. Not a major problem but it might get a bit draughty inside and certainly no high altitude flying. I was wondering if it is the old or new type.

Great review Sandra, thanks for taking the time. I love the theatre and the town hall, and the married couple is just a cute little extra *wub* This looks fantastic not only for the model, but for parts as well!	positive
Thank you for the great review Sandra *y* . I *wub* the detail that TLC added to this set. I would like to add that I think all the buildings look *sweet* . I really like how you compared the look to "Back to the Future". When I saw the first pics, I thought the same thing. The look of the set is definitly the 1950's. I am :-( to see the price though. I am sure this set will be $149.99 US too. GREAT REVIEW, Model On!!	positive
Axle, on Dec 28 2007, 02:07 PM, said: Can you take a picture(s) of all the film posters? There?s no necessity to take pics of all the film posters. There are only 3 different film posters at the set.

Sorry for answering so late but i was very busy... thanks guys for your comments *y* tedbeard, on Dec 28 2007, 08:08 PM, said: Sorry to disagree with anyone however, but this was not a great review. I appreciate the effort Sandra made but a great review would include more details such as what are stickers and what are printed pieces. A great review points out flaws or limitations as well as what works or is really neat. A great review would have analyzed the price per piece and compared that to other sets/themes. One might look at the recent reviews of the Indy sets or the new Spongebob sets as examples of really good reviews. The pictures are good but a great review, above all, should provide the reader with some new information, perhaps even answer questions posed in the pre-release discussion thread. I learned nothing new about the set from this review. That said, it was a good review for someone who had not seen the pre-release discussion and she did a good job of showing said person what they could expect in the set. It?s good that you told me your opinion about my review. It was my third review i made and i have to say that i made this review not for analyses, just only to show the EB Members some nice pics and to tell them my opinion. Lego is fun for me!! I don?t like to analyse the pieces, bricks, prices, colours. I just want to build something. That?s why i?m at Eurobricks and not at an other big legocommunity in Germany. Lego is fun, fun, fun!!

Nice review - thx for all the pics. They certainly made me consider getting this set. KimT BTW: which set would You recommend: Market Streeet, Town Plan or Cafe Corner? Just curious. They're pretty expensive and I might only afford one of them.	positive

I guess it all depends on what you are after Kim. If you want a really great and detailed set I would opt for the Cafe Corner, but if you want a set that can easilly be included in a city I would opt for Town Plan. Since I can't afford all of them, I will just get Town Plan, because I lve the feeling of thge set and that theater is superb !! *yoda*	positive
kimt, on Jan 4 2008, 10:25 AM, said: BTW: which set would You recommend: Market Streeet, Town Plan or Cafe Corner? Just curious. They're pretty expensive and I might only afford one of them. Definitely the Coffee corner. It?s a hard desicion between Coffee Corner and Town Plan, because they are both really great sets. The Market Street is no "must have" in my opinion. But the other two. Maybe you should start with the Coffee Corner, it?s the older set. The Town Plan is newer and will be available longer then the Coffee Corner. I hope it helped you a litte bit :-$ Regards Sandra Edited by Legocastlegirl, 04 January 2008 - 10:43 AM.	positive

Wow, I have not been called a "youg man" (by which I assume you mean "young") for a while. As a forty year old with three kids that's unusual. *sweet* I tried very hard to remain positive in my critique and complimented her on those things she had done well. I felt that given the somewhat juvenile "OMG, BEST...REVIEW...EVER" tone that was creeping in amongst the replys, that it needed to be tempered with some thoughtful suggestions as to how a good review could be made great. Your ad hominem approach is offensive and far more negative than I was and to suggest I should do my own review is ridiculous. I live in Canada and we do not even have the set available here yet thus I am interested in seeing reviews of this set. If I already had the set I would not be so interested. And next time you propose to critique a critique perhaps you should actually read what I wrote. I said she wrote a good review for a specific audience. I did NOT say it was awful or whatever you seem to have assumed I meant. Saying something is good but could be improved can hardly be characterized as "bitching". :-|	positive
Thanks for the review. I really want this set because: 1. It looks fantastic 2. Has harder to find colors 3. Is a 50th anniversary commemorative 4. Some of the models are based on the 50s sets (i love the old stuff) The tanker truck is a perfect recreation of the old HO 1:87 scale Esso Tanker Truck. I have one, and you can look at it for comparison if you would like. Lego HO vehicles I'd like to modify the truck from this new set to look even more like the old Esso truck, getting rid of the green and adding some decals.	positive
Happy New Year, everyone! I went to my local Wal-mart looking for an exclusive Bionicle set yesterday, but was amazed to find everything there- SW, Bionicle, EF, Indie, the works. I nabbed the JSF and the Rogue Shadow and scampered home to take pics with my new camera. *wub* The box: The same as the other '07 boxes. Nothing new. The back shows the various features, with "pop out R2." :-| Luckily, the intruction booklet and the DSS were intact- not folded like the last MM set I got. |-/ The DSS: Not too bad, but printed parts would have been great. The figs. Anakin is amazing, IMO. *wub* Fits the CW Anie great. I noticed on the S@H reviews the kiddies were saying how ugly he looked. |-/ They need to see the CW cartoon. For the sake of my health, I should probably stop reading those. :-D The build. I won't go too in-depth on the build, since *vader* posted a very in-depth review here. The start of the build: The body of the fighter starts out long and skinny. The JSF's landing gear allows it to sit comfortably without getting in the way while swooshing. R2-D2's launching device. R2 in position. When launched... ...He often gets stuck if you don't press the button hard enough. :-/ Looks like R2 needs to lay off... whatever it is robots eat. So far: The flag stickered. It's a big sucker sticker. Completed. I forgot to add the nose stickers before I took the pic. Warning- the nose cone sticker is actually two stickers. I thought it was one, peeled of one of the stickers, and put it on the middle of the two 1x8 plates, and didn't notice the other sticker. *wacko* Various completed shots: I think this was a beautiful little set. R2's launching unit and the flick missiles are annoying, but easily fixed. I plan to add proper cannons in place of the flick missiles. Anakin is a great minifig, but he doesn't look so well standing next to my other figs. The Brickshelf Gallery (when public) Will	positive

Okie guys and gals, here s time for some droid exploration with my review of set 7670. As a general statement I have to say its really a neat set that is not that expensive for what it holds. 1) Box art Like always I will start with pics of the box art. BTW, notice anything guys ? No bloody crappy DSS. Yes, finally a set without stickers and that feels great :-D 2) The Mfs Nothing really spectacular there. The only novelty lies within the inclusion of the new Commander (yellow torso) BD. Apart from that, there are 2 BDs and unfortunately yet another SBD (I like those but I have a huge amount of them, and I would rather had something different). You have 3 short blasters and a couple of extra parts. 3) The Spider Droid I think it?s a pretty cool little buggar. It?s a rather simple yet classic construction I think. It has sweet parts such as the BD body in dark bley. It really has a spider feel unlike the previous Ep3 one. 4) The Hailfire Droid This baby represents the ?pi?ce de resistance? of this set. I truly love it !! Sure it?s a bit under scale but I don?t really mind that. Its conception is superb even if I totally dislike assembling those technic treads (especially 80 of those small things). The ellipse of the treads is well balanced and that trans disc is a brilliant idea. The great thing is those new flick fire missiles: they don?t fall unlike the other ones and they do look good on this baby. Also you can put the wheels together and the missiles to gain some shelf space (easy storage ON :-D ) In conclusion those druids re really sweet and are perfect target practice for the upcoming RGS hehe !! I hope you enjoyed that review and do not hesitate to comment and ask pic requests if any ;-) *yoda*	positive

They released the battle droid commander in 2000 :-|	neutral
Trudop561, on Jan 5 2008, 04:21 PM, said: They released the battle droid commander in 2000 :-| While there was a yellow-marked battle droid officer in the 3343 minifigure pack released in 2000, the battle droid commander from 7670 is different. The new 7670 commander has a torso made of all yellow plastic, whereas the 2000 battle droid commander had a tan torso with yellow printings, and a tan head with yellow printings. So, while we have had a BD commander before, the 7670 commander is "new."	neutral

Nice Review! And you finally got an 08 set! I haven't gotten any, I blame Wal-mart for putting products out late |-/ :-D Instead of a SBD, TLC should have included a Droideka(New Version) *y* The scale is a bit off, so this is a Dwarf Hailfire droid :-P P	neutral

Great review mate as usual, for me the highlight of this set has to be the new spider droid. Even though it's made up of some strange parts it really appeals to me, i would love a few of those babys. The Hellfire droid is also well put together even if it is a little small, but hey it looks fun. I really like the look of this set but the price tag really puts me off, why oh why did lego price it so high.... :'-(	neutral

i got this and a couple of other sets on monday.and to tell you the truth, i was a bit dissapointed.i like the set, i like the parts, but it's definitly not worth it's RRP of $45 NZD, if you ask me i should be more like $35 NZD, but hey, i still like it, i got it for $30 on ebay so i'm not complaining *y* *y*	negative

Ah I finally got the 2 City sets I really wanted !! I am so happy that Lego went postal on us :-P . Since they are rather small I shall do a mix review of these 2 sweet sweet sets. 1) Mail Van (7731) Like always I?ll start with shots of the box art and bloody DSS. Now here are the extras of that set: I really love the new torso of the postal worker. My huge grip lies on the mail box: that mail logo is a freaking sticker !! For that part I was so expecting a printed part. That is really really bad !! Apart from that the design is pretty cool. The van is quite simple but I think its pretty cute. I love the fact that the rear is a window. 2) Air Mail (7732) Like always I?ll start with shots of the box art and bloody DSS. The extras are OK: another great postal worker. You also have yet another red trolley with a package that is a bloody sticker yet again !! G TLC should have more printed parts !! That plane for me is a classic thing of beauty !! Really is consistent with the fantastic planes of the 80?s. That?s the kind of lanes TLC should produce instead of those huge Playmo planes. Actually I am happy that TLC released that one ? for once its not a bloody airline exclusive promo set !! Here are general pics. I love the engines of the plane: simple yet superb. Also the top hatch opens to insert mail and packages. The front control panel is a printed part !! I love the classic double train windows and here is a poc of the undeneath of the set. In conclusion I truly love these small sets: they are the perfect size (4 wide car yeay !!) and the colour pattern is amazing as well. I hope you enjoyed that review and do not hesitate to comment and ask pic requests if any ;-) *yoda*	positive
Excellent review. You convinced me to buy these two. Could you tell me how much you payed for them? I think I'm gonna buy them tomorrow if they have it already (or if I don't see any cooler sets).	positive
I haven't spotted these in the US yet. I'm looking forward to finding them. Overall, the 2008 line-up is a excellent and it's going to be difficult for me to decide which themes/sets to pursue. There's a lot to choose from.	positive

Nice review yoda I dont think I have ever read one with as much cursing of stickers! :-D I love these two little sets, the colour scheme the little different wheels on the post van and of course the new postmen uniforms! Would have been nice if they had included little satchels like in the new indiana jones sets, oh well! ;-) postman Yoda on! *yoda*	positive
Thanks for the takes on these two sets, Yoda. Stickers or not, I still think these are charming sets with all the essence and nostalgia of the older sets back in the 80/90's. Am I the first one to notice the new doors used in the back of the van. Not only is it using the popular new frame, but the old container doors have been redesigned to fit with the new frame as well. Pity they're not yellow, though.	positive
Very nice, cheers Yoda! I'll definitely be getting the post van, not sure about the plane though. Both are awesome, but I think I have enough planes... Can you tell me though, the wheels on the van, are they rubber or plastic? They look a bit tacky...	positive
these little sets are really nice! they cought my eye the minute i saw them! it would have been SO great if there was a post office to go with them! there are so few buildings in lego city the design is very classic and i am ofcourse considering to get them but it seems that i have a lot of small cars and planes on my desk! :-$ recently i took a flight with Cyprus Airways from Thessaloniki to Cyprus and the two promo plane sets were there! I was so tired though that i couldnt stay awake to buy them! im taking a flight again on Tuesday and i hope they are not out of stock!! thanks for a great review Yoda! a fine job as always! cant wait for your next one	positive
Aww man, is TLC really getting too cheap for printed parts? Shame on you TLC!! Despite those stickers these are two really neat sets. Especially the airplane. Classic *wub* Reminds me of that little plane my dad bought in an airplane. Not sure what's the set nr.. The window at the rear of the van looks like a normal window frame without the clips for the shutters. I never knew those existed 8-? Might come handy for ship building. Thanks for the review Yoda!	positive
Thank you for the nice review Pity of the stickers but the design is nice 80ies on!	positive
Great Review *yoda* (I find myself saying that line alot :-D ) I love these two little sets *wub* TLC continues the Great City Line that started in 07 and continues into 08 Its also nice to have other sub lines besides Fire and police :-| :-P I hope there are many more Postal Sets, like a Post office!!That would be sweet! Hope these are Mainstream and not those damn exclusives >:-( Postal ON! P	positive
Thanks for the review :-) I was actually considering getting these, but I saw they were overpriced for my tastes - too bad, theyre nifty lil things *wub*	positive
loool : Spielberg goes on a career change :-D these are some nice sets. I really love that car. looks sleek	positive
Thanks for a nice review and few comments to sets: Nice airplane, finally some reminiscence for Lego City Golden Era (for me years 1982-1992). Everything is nice, but two things are freezing a smile on my face. First of all the ugly new hinge used for plane roof. I have already 4032 and those new hinges are looking really terrible when compared f.e. with 6368. Second one is new minifig, I don?t know what I expected, but this torso design looks too simple and too cheap.. Concerning new car - I appreciate fact, that TLC makes after long long years again Postal sets, but I don?t like those new-style cars. Matchbox wheels and bad rate between drivers cockpit and cargo space are damping me from buying. 6651 Mail Truck or 105 Canada Post Truck were much better...

And what about getting them out? You have to flip the plane upside down? :-| Weak. They should have had a hinged rear end or a hatch on the side. Yes, this is the LEGO charming! No stairs in buildings, cars with just one minifig, all those things that make LEGO what it is... Thanks Yoda for your review! Those posts sets will be mine, but I will wait to find them in my supermarket, even if I have to wait 2 or 3 months, I know that I will save some money, so I will buy more LEGO :-D There are simple designed sets, but we don't need more: two nice litle sets that are not oversized and too expensive.	positive

It's so different than those in the US. good point B... this design is just too foreign to my eyes for me to enjoy... i don't like either of these sets, very disapointing - the postal theme has so much potential. i don't really like the torsos either - too plain/cheap as kanal suggested. and i will agree that the wheels on the van look cheap. i was sooooo impressed with city 2007, this is a real let down. though, i am happy to see a small set with a postal box. so, even though, all that aside, i'll probably buy 6 of the van - just for the yellow mudgards, postal box and stickers to populate my city. and i think this set will provide some excellent piece to MOC a yellow civillian convertable with *sweet* - BM	neutral
I'm glad to see the mail van has the doors that used to be on the older cargo containers. I had given up on those older ones, but now that they're still out there, I may invest in the older cargo system instead of the new 6-wide ones. Both sets are good enough, I'll get both. I'm hoping for a postal building too, even though I have the smaller of the old post offices. A nice big modern one would be great. I'm not too hung up about the design of the plane; I've got the neat old cargo plane with the tail that swings open (one of the best plane sets) for big packages. The truck is goofy looking, but if I get sick of looking at it I can rebuild it into a classic looking one. Great review by the way, the pictures are some of the better one I've seen in a review recently.	neutral
Thanks *yoda* for the great reviews. I love the airplane, it's really cute. The van needed to grow on me though but you did the trick. I don't like the wheels of the van. They will need replacing. And wouldn't everything have been better if they were completely red? Dr. Brick	neutral
Thanks for the great reviews, *yoda*! The car looks great. *y* And the plane is very cool too, and much more suited to a Lego town than the large planes. On!(?) X-D ~Peace	positive
Hey everyone, my first 2008 set is this one, 5613. I thought I'd share a review of it. *sweet* I'd like to say sorry about my photos, they were taken quickly. first, we have the box: it is the smallest lego box I've ever seen, and actually looks cute *wub* it will be heavy competition with playmobil's specials... back of the box, showing an action pose: the contents of the little box, with a very tiny instruction manual *wub* the manual unfolded. Notice that every part has its part number beside it :-) the back of the manual, showing some fire sets and the other Impulse sets the parts, 30 in total: the small set built. the firefighter has a small fire to extinquish, armed with an axe, chainsaw, other saw and foam... psssh thing X-D . five extra parts in a 30 part set! we get an extra black hatchet, yellow bar tap, light bley 1*1 plate, red 1*1 plate modified with fingers and 2*2 dark bley radar dish. Besides the plate, I've never seen these as reserve parts... but I'm not complaining X-D here is a small "alternate" model I created with it: a small bbq... what? He's hungry and he needs to put something on the bbq >:-) X-D Overall, you can't go wrong with these Impulse sets. I paid 2.89 euros for this little set, so thats a great value! Sadly the only impulse avaible were these 3 city sets (no police) and the alien Mars mission... Looking forward to the knight and magician as well as those Indy sets! TT	positive
Cool! Finally its an entire line I can actually afford to own every set! :-D I can't wait to get my hands on them! If its possible, could you give us the demensions of the box? It would be apprectiated. *y* DP8	positive
Thanks for the review, Tanotrooper! This is a nice little set, with 2 axes (*wub* >:-)) and some nice parts. Cool alternate model too! X-D Tanotrooper, on Jan 6 2008, 09:07 AM, said: 9.3 cm by 9.3 cm by 4.5 cm X-D TT X-O Cute! I can't wait to see these Impulse sets in stores. *wub* ~Peace	positive
Thanks for that really nice review Dunamis! Now it is even more harder for me to wait for this set. I hope my Legostore will get it tomorrow!! It is really nice. I?m a really big fan of the creator houses.. but that one is now the best one for me!!! I love the colour of it and of course the windows at the roof. *wub* Creator House ON!!!

I got this set on tuesday on the sunshine coast (i was on a holiday) and since Kmart were having a 15% off lego it was only $40 *y* .

Hey, Yesterday I got around to MOD my beachhouse too! I bought two boxes so I could have enough material for an extra floor and then I also added a kitchen, a vine in the backyard, storage for the upper floor...

Edited by Darth_Legois_619, 23 March 2008 - 11:00 PM.	positive
Thanks for the review Dunamis, this is a great little set! I'm also very impressed with Takuto20's mods. I've been trying a few of my own. I liked the tower block design, but a lot of stuff needed fixing. Firstly I added a 4th wall, and made it so the storeys could be lifted off like in the other models. I also added flowers on the windowsills and doorways out on to the balconies. Still to be added is an extra door for the top floor which I'm going to get from the new doors and windows pack. I added a chimney that goes all the way up the back of the house, and has a fireplace on every level. Each floor is fully furnished with a fireplace, wash basin and bed on the upper levels... ...and a corner sofa and coffee table, plus an extra large fireplace on the ground floor. Finally here is my idea of what to do with two copies of this set! All the parts pictured are from 2x 4996, except 5 extra fence panels and the minifigs. The house on the left has it's garden at the rear.	positive
1. BEFORE BUYING Even if I am City fan, those new sized planes are really not mine cup of tea, my love to Lego is firmly frozen somewhere between years 1980-1995. Main reason to buy was, that I wanted to write a review at Czech Afol web Kostky.org. I bought it three days ago via web advertising, price was +- 35 USD. 2. AFTER OPENING THE BOX As presumed, some very big parts and three bags, and as an additional bonus lot of Danish air free of charge. First sight told me, that this will be really short and easy building.. 3. IMPRESSIONS DURING BUILDING ...and it was really true. 30 minutes of lazy building. Bag 1 - plane. Bag 2 - plane gondols with supports. Bag 3 - wings and propellers. When I saw the way, how is this plane made, I was strongly thinking to play Money for Nothing from Dire Straits as a music accordant with whole set. 4. IMPRESSIONS AFTER BUILDING - LOOKOUT Juniorized creeps. This is my first plane in this scale and for 99% the last one. Lack of details, lot of ugly big parts, from whole set you can see the main development target - to keep RRP at some certain low level. Inner space of airplane absolutely undone, no details, no luggage, no computers, nothing at all!! Just a lot, lot of air! The very only details in whole plane are the stickered pilots desk and some kind of seat constuction. 5. IMPRESSIONS AFTER BUILDING - PLAYABILITY But, what is playability at this set? Hydroplane, which cannot float (as seen on enclosed photos) ? If TLC will make some new kind of big parts used for gondolas, to make the plane floating, they will for sure make no other damage. Juniorization couldn?t be higher. You even cannot drive across the carpet with the plane. So, how to play? Open the doors, open the cabin part, and turn with propellers? Weak, Weak, Weak! 6. RESUMED IMPRESSIONS Sadly I must say, that at limited release sets TLC? boat seems to sailing to the worst part of the coast. After quite good 7344, perfect 7899 and 7900, strange, but acceptable 7998, juniorization came back with 7906, followed with this ugly Playmobilized 7732. 7. FINAL WORD In fact, even 15 USD seems to be too much for this kind of set. 35 USD, expected RRP in our country, is really overpriced to hell. Neither set, nor minifig is not interesting. TLC maybe knows about juniorization as well, as nowhere on the box the number of pieces isn?t written. If you my AFOL friends want to spent your bucks, better give half of the price to African orphans. You will save your money, and you will have a good feeling!

Ah great review Kanal-K1 (and welcome to EB! :-D ), I was waiting for one of this set. Not that I was expecting anything good, I won't buy it. I agree with thr playability, it does seem weak. What can you do with it. Swoosh it? :-/ Big step backwards LEGO... :-( Dr. Brick	negative

Am I the only that one that thinks it is not SO BAD???????????????????????What I am trying to say is wouldn't planes be this big in real life???I know it has a lot of big pieces but how would they make them any smaller,or how would they the big pieces into a bunch of tiny pieces?well any way I do think in some cases that if there is any "juniorized" involved it should be with duplo. complaning OFF	neutral
Thks for this caustic review :-D I'll wait for the parts on bricklink. I think you're a bit unfair with this small oversized submarine - oups sorry, I mean plane. Here are some advantages I tried to imagine : 1. that's the first submarine with a plane nose, 2. That's the first unprinted nose, 3. That's the first shark that make me laugh, and which has a plain white fin 4. And at last, you should have notice that that the first submarine with a wing made of several plates It is said that this set has more than 200 parts... Hide and seek ! X-D You may have lost several bags I'm eager that people buy this set a lot : I'd like to buy a lot of these new white 4x4x2 curved slope for my MOCs.

Great comments, ROFL, ROFL, ROFL. :-D :-D :-D Concerning last sentence - I have seen or built hundreds of different sets issued since 1980 until now, but this plane is really a hot candidate not only for Crap of the year, but for Crap of the decade... Last two days I thought about the sense of this set, and, finally, I was enlighted - I must call to my folks living in a small village, I am pretty sure, that they will be happy for a new house for their pullets.

i have to agree with almost all of the replies here that This set is the most ugliest looking Lego Set I have ever seen. If I have never seen this set, and ppl showed it to me, I would have thought it would be some little kid's MOC or something (no offence!) Huge juniorized pieces, bad color theme (i would say it would look better if the wing is white), no interior and huge DSS! I will avoid this set like the plague. I own the entire CITY line (except for the airport) and planning to get all the CITY stuff that Lego releases. But, this set will ruin my plans coz I will avoid it... unless someone gives it to me for free. haha *wacko* Boo LEGO BOO! :-X	negative

Hello and welcome to another Redman set review! Well, actually, the first Redman set review! I'm your host, Redman, and today I adorn my medieval outfit to tell you about the Impulse set simply titled "The Knight". This is a great set, with 14 pieces, 2 of which are spare, and a minifig with 2 weapons, 2 helmets, and some shiny armour. All this is packaged in a tiny box, just short of 10 cm? (or 3? inches?), with a neat little instruction manual that folds up to the size of the weapons rack included in the set. As you can see, this set only costs a measly 7 NZD. (Disclaimer: Redman not included.) Here we see the box, clearly showing what the box holds. On the top we see a 1:1 scale picture of a minifig, for those new to Lego, or who have forgotten how big a minifig is I guess. :-/ X-D The instruction manual, showing the nice and easy built, with me for size comparison. :-D (*Sorry about the dark image, I had to lean over the light to get a birds eye pic. ;-)*) Here we see the 2 different soldiers you can make with the set; a knight, and a guard or standard troop or soldier or whatever you want to call him... (Note, each set comes with only 1 minifigure, and additional accessories.) Of course you know I'm in the picture just for the sake of it, I'm not really one of the soldiers. X-D The neat little weapons rack, or rather equipment rack, as it holds not only a weapon but a shield (except the ovoid ones), helmet, and armour. Nice and easy storage, so your equipment won't get dirty lying around on the ground. :-D One of the spare parts is another of those robot hands, so you can stick that in place of the shield and allow the rack to hold 2 weapons. Just thought you'd like to know that. :-$ And here we see the nifty little structure of the thing. It can even support a whole minifig! Note the grey stud on the bottom bar is a spare part, I just find it better used there to hold the armour. :-) Huh? I don't remember this picture... 8-| It appears I drifted off, and these guys don't look too happy I overtook their weapons equipment rack. :-$ I should go... X-D So, in conclusion this is a great set for army building, at a reasonable price, with nice equipment, and it can be picked up as a little extra with your normal shopping. X-D That's all for today folks! *sweet* [/Redman] So, what do you think? Should I continue with these Redman Reviews ? (:-P), or just stop now? X-D Comments and criticism welcome! :-$ ~Peace	positive
An excellent first time (?) review iamded! *y* Well, atleast a first time Redman review anyway. I really enjoy Redman, I hope to see him pop up more often. Your pics are great now that you ditched the phone :-P , and you've shown the set from many different angles and perspectives. Thanks for this brilliant review, you have certainly convinced me to get a few of these, and then some X-D Redman ON!

Thanks everyone for your positive feedback, it's really appreciated! :-D You'd be surprised how long that 'Redman Presents' thing up the top took me to make! X-D So, it appears people do like Redman, expect him to be reviewing The Good Wizard and Battle Arachnoid in near future!

X-D) TheFrisian, on Jan 19 2008, 04:44 AM, said: Nice review, very detailed. *y* As for the spare parts, mine didn't come with any. Both dark grey 1x1 round plates are used on the weapons rack (one for the armour, one for the helmet) and I only got one robot hand for holding weapons. That's strange, maybe I'm just lucky. X-D I also got 2 spare orange Viking horn pieces in my Battle Arachnoid. :-D ~Peace	positive

I would have purchased a few of these except for the fact that I do not like the new torso that they use.	negative
Well today i finally got my hands on set 7038, now since the moment i first saw pics of this set i knew it was for me. So lets start with the new troll helmet and torso, these are both great. This troll really stands out as a leader when next to the usual trolls in the dwarf mining set: Ok so here's a few shots of the front of the set: Now one thing i really like about this set is the way that lego have placed the back wheels higher than the front. This allows the set to really appear to being pulled: Here we have a shot at the missiles on the wagon, these are better than some around i have to say. If you look just behind the bottom missile you will see a simple firing device, simply push it down and then let it go to see those missiles fire: The troll flag is moved behind the missiles for firing: One thing that does bother me about this set is the lack of anything on the rear, ok it's easy to fix with a little moc'ing so it's not the end of the world but i would of liked something placed there: Now lets move on to the Crownie's wagon, this is simple yet good for holding weapons: As for the Crown knights themselves, well there the ones from the impulse sets which is great IMO: Here's a few quick shots of the 2 larger trolls we have so far, i prefer the sand green one. What about you? Well that's the end for now, requests for pics and comments are welcome. Overall i rate this set as a must for anyone who's a fantasy castle fan, i know i'll be getting more of this set...... As for the new wagon well it's joined up with the other trolls: I do hope the impules crownies i bought today can handle them, oh and yes i did change the knights heads X-D : Fantasy war on!! *vader*	positive
Awesome review!! I like the turkey leg hanging in front of the troll X-D Yea the back looks a little....Empty 8-| Well Overall I enjoyed the review! See ya soon!	positive

Looks like an ace set :-$ I may get this just for the sand green troll, even if I'm not a great castle fan, I do want one of them things! *wub* I also love the goblin's new metal flaked helmet, and the same style with the wheels.

This is fantastic, I love the new helmets for the goblins *sweet* I've always loved the chicken leg thing, really screams LEGO to me!

In reality not all members of a species are identical, it's great seeing them in different colors. Great review X-D	positive
Those extra helmet pictures just seal how much I love those new helmets *wub* They look so great.	positive
Thank you for the review, vader! That set looks worth buying! 8-? i think you gave me a good reason to buy it... ;-)	positive
Great review, Vader :-) As I've said before, this is a nice set, but doesn't really come with anything that doesn't come with the other sets of the line. For this reason, it will be somewhere at the bottom of my list for 2008. Also, I like torso and helmet of the Dwarf Mining orcs much better. The colours make the torso look rather dull and boring, while the other, more brown one, looks much clearer and more exciting. I think I like the *knight* helmet better too, looks more covering and threatening than this one, although I'll save my judgement until I have one in my hands. Thanks again Vader ;-) EDIT: Forgot to mention, hilarious pic in your sig, Vader :-D Edited by TinyPiesRUs, 19 January 2008 - 08:28 AM.	negative
A Troll driven by a turkey leg, what a wonderful little detail!!! :-D :-D Thanks for the review Vader. Very clever, using a flag to hide that crazy firing device. I find it rather odd they used blue pins for this. Black or gray would've been alot more discrete. About the big trolls, I think using different colours is good. I don't think a troll force would be very organized, so different colours would make the effect complete *y* . As for your troops, looks quite fearsome! Definitely compared to my pathetic number of soldiers.. :-$ A nice set, but I would rather get the Attack on Tower though.. no matter about the price difference.	negative

Nice comparison shot, judging from these pics, I think I have to agree with you that green suits the Troll better. Especially since the Orcs are sand green as well, indicating some relation between the two races (if they are indeed separate races). Great review, very detailed and with lots of pictures. I was already interested in this set, but after reading your review I want this set for sure! *y*	positive
Thanks for the review of a set I would otherwise probably have passed on. Out of curiosity how did you 'know it was for you'? You seem to be building quite a collection. Why castle now? Was the fantasy element all it took? Just curious. Thanks again and God Bless, Nathan	neutral
Lego City Truck & Forklift Set # 7733 Pieces: 343 Price: $24.99 (USD) Store of Purchase: Toys R'Us Release Date: January 2008 After discussion of the mysterious yellow cargo contained in this new City transport set and a visit to my local TRU, I purchased this set. I was immediately pleased with the price/piece which I think is pretty reasonable (343 pieces for $25). Starting with the box, great City artwork boasting "Special Edition": Tha backside of the box (no alternate models comes as no surprise): The dreaded decals (I was looking for the skull and bones for radioactive, but no such luck): My favorite part of the set, a very clever forklift: Side view: And the backside: What I like about the forklift is the bars across the top giving the vehicle a "real-life" design. The double wheels in the front with two pieces that can hold the wheels also adds to a clever design: I like the figs (although not much new - perhaps I'll make the driver into a werewolf later): The set includes three cargo pallets, the first some sort of fuel with gauge: The 2nd, two Indy containers, and a square 2x4 brick (I have not put the decals on yet): And the mysterious yellow cargo. Your guess is as good as mine :-$ . On to the truck, the front section: The front grill: Another angle: The back: I like the opening mechanism that is very simple, but works well. Also is the large plate tile piece inside. I like this because the entire interior has no studs: And the trailer section of the truck: Orange and yellow tail lights: And the rear trailer open: The complete set: Summary: This is a neat set that reminds me a bit of classic Lego City (but larger). It is very playable and has a lot of accessories adding to the value. The build was very simple, and enjoyable (took me about an hour). It is a great addition to a number of City sets including the Cargo Ship, Container Stacker, the World City Cargo Train, and the new Cargo Plane. As I mentioned previously, I have not yet put on the decals that I'm sure will really add to the overall look of the set. The forklift is awesome and I like the cargo containers. The truck could have benefited from a few additional details (chrome smokers, and an undercarriage box that really opens). Considering everything, I would buy this set again. Hope you enjoy and perhaps this mysterious cargo will make its way into a Brickster Mystery. *y*	positive

Mr Tiber, on Jan 19 2008, 02:46 PM, said: Hmm, that's a thought, but why would they pick this particular set? I would expect they'd do that with a slightly bigger set, like the heavy hauler perhaps. Why do you think they'de pick this one? Good question. Maybe it's merely a gimick to help push the city sets with all the other competing themes. The cement mixer is a special edition as well.	neutral
this set looks pretty good to me, It is six wide isn't it? That is nice for a truck like this	positive
Great review! My only grip with this set is you can only fit one pallet in the truck. It should have been the same size as the trailer so you can at least fit 2 pallets. Seems like alotof wasted space. If i'm going to transport cargo, i want to use the maximum amount of space aviable!! X-D	negative

I got this set last week and just to add a few of my own points CONS: - The forklift spring feels a bit flimsy - I don't know how long it will last or how much stress it would take - and the end coil isn't really heavily secured to the lift mechanism. Time will tell on that one. - 30 stickers! It's the Exo-Force of City sets! The truck set does look less plain with them on though. I would reccomend lining them up with the green brick in the second container rather than applying the first lot without a guide or they may end up uneven - It's very hard to put the minifig in the forklift without dismantling (or breaking open) the set slightly - The cargo box attached to the main cabin of the truck doesn't hold very strongly - Minifigs are dull - that dark blue torso with pattern is way overused - green stickers are a different green to the bricks themselves PROS: - lots of nice pieces including the large white panels and cargo pieces, and i like the green/ white colour scheme - the cargo doors open well and the hingeing mechanism doesn't stand out to the detriment of the rest of the set (as some people have complained about the mail airplane) - studless floor in cargo containers makes it easy to move pallets in and out - fits in better than the Heavy Hauler to a minifig sized city - new 1x1x4 slope! (at least I hadn't seen it before) OVERALL - nice set with some good pictures, although a bit flimsy, and way too many stickers - the same issues I have with the Cargo Plane as well (although that had more colour issues).	positive
hey, thanks for the review The Brickster! i was just wondering if you could possibly upload a picture of the instructions for the forklift, and, if possible, tell me the piece # of the 1x4 slope bricks (to bricklink them). thanks!	neutral

Greetings, and welcome to another Redman Review! I'm your host, Redman, and today I adorn my medieval outfit to tell you about the Impulse set simply titled "The Knight". No wait, that's the old script. X-D I mean, "The Good Wizard". *sweet* The other Castle Impulse set (the first being 'The Knight'), this is a wonderful, and in my case unexpected addition to the Castle line! I did not expect to get a nice good wizard, but rather another plain white skellie for the Impulse, and was pleasantly surprised when I saw the first picture of this set. The Impulse sets give you pieces you wouldn't expect to see in such small sets, for example, The Knight came with the armour, and this comes with an owl, a gem, and a crystal ball piece. It comes with 11 pieces, including the wand, owl, and gem, and no spares, which doesn't really matter as it doesn't need any. The box sports the set number, age range (which I blissfully ignore X-D), awesome Castle logo, and the assembled set, with the usual 1:1 scale picture of a minifig. The back of the box shows pictures of the boxed Skeleton Tower and King's Castle Siege sets. Note the price is in New Zealand dollars, and is really the same prica as any other Impulse set. Next are the instructions, which are separated into 3 parts, 1 for the minifigure, 1 for the table, and one for the bird stand. Very simple, also worth mentioning is the parts numbers are next to their respective parts, for replacement parts etc. On the back we see (on the top half) pictures of Skeleton Prison Carriage, Skeleton Tower, and King's Castle Siege, this time not of the boxed sets, but the sets themselves. On the lower half we have 8 pictures, each of the different Impulse sets. The Wizard's torso is plain sand blue, with no patterns or anything, but it doesn't really matter is his beard's in the way. ;-) The head is that same old 'white fade to grey beard' head, but the white beard covers up most of the grey. My favourite part is the pants, I love that we're getting printed belts and legs again. His belt has 4 gold crosses (as seen in, if you look closely, the new Crownie's torso and the Crownie archer's torso) and a belt buckle, and the legs have a bottle, a coin, and a small bag. Nice little wizard-ey items. The, er, items, no, accessories, no, models? The stuff in the set include a little stand for the owl, and a table utilising the new 4x4 round piece in light bley, with the crystal ball in the middle, encasing the yellow gem held on by a 2x2 circle piece in blue. Why blue, I'm not sure. Maybe it's because the crystal is yellow, and the Crownie's colours are blue and gold, so the blue piece with the yellow crystal symbolise the Crownie's colours. Or maybe TLC just felt the need to include an odd colour. :-P In conclusion, this is a wonderful set, with some neat accessories, and it doesn't really need to be bought in the masses, after all, you needs an army of owls and wizards? :-| :-P So it works fine as a single set, and adds a more fantasy feel to your Crownie army. That's all for today folks! *sweet* [/Redman] Thanks for reading another of my Redman interviews, any suggestions on how to/what to do to improve it is greatly appreciated, as are all comments and criticisms (except those blatant thoughtless criticisms that don't help at all :-P)! ~Peace Edited by KimT, 10 August 2008 - 01:31 PM.	positive
Nice review, your camera is much better now. I look forward to more of your reviews :-) I just went to Toyworld today and got a wizard and 4 knights :-) And on top of that, they were having a 20% off sale *sweet* I might go back and get some more tommorrow. The wizard is pretty good, and comes with some good parts (owl, beard, legs, hat, round table, crystal ball..). It would be nicer if he had a torso with printing on it, but I can understand why they didn't.	positive
simonwillems, on Jan 20 2008, 02:59 PM, said: Thanks for the review of this nice little set. For it's price (3 euros here in Holland) it contains quite a lot of useful parts. The only thing that could have been better in my opinion is the wand, I always liked this one: I miss those wands! They could've used it, but I think the wood wand kindda adds "realis" to the set, and since many fans don't like their castle theme to be too fantasized, I guess Lego decided to use a mold that was still being used for various sets. When I get this set I'm going to put it on the Tower in the King's castle, you know, the one that is right above the throne room? ;-) That'll be a great spot, and then I'll finally have all the necessary characters, the King in his throne, the knights on the walls, the wizard on his tower top, and the Princess in her tower room that floats in mid air and is connected to the throne room by a 2-stud wide bridge! :-D I love the King;s castle siege set *wub*	neutral

Well, since no-one seems to have done one for this set, here we go.... Here's the complete set in all its glory. Yes, I really like it, but then, Tabletown has the capacity to support it and my green Army have their eyes on it as a potential military transport as well. :-) I'll start out with the little airport ground car thingy - very neat and functional, here are views front and back: Next up, the steps which allow the plane crew to embark and disembark: And to round off this little trio, the cargo loading platform, here in its lowered position. Note the prong thingy sticking out from the rear: And here raised. The prong thingy is now hinged up to support the back of the platform and keep it level: Here's a slightly different angle so you can see the pieces under there: The all-important cargo itself! Hmmm...not much for a plane this size... The cargo pallet slots neatly onto the loading platform: Here's the complete set of ground equipment - all attached: And so onto the plane itself. Note that unlike the other large planes, the main wing sits at the TOP of the row of bricks making up the side of the fuselage: I took it apart a little so you can see the internal construction of the fuselage. Note that the cargo area is really small, right at the back. What else is this thing carrying? Illegal immigrants? :-) A picture of the rear of the fuselage, just because I like the sticker: Front landing gear. WAY better than on the other large planes. I don't know if this is a new piece or what but I've had no problems with it at all, and my kids have been playing with it as well: The rather sexy rear undercarriage - this area reminds me of one of those giant Russian transport planes - wicked: Those angled grey slopes atop each side of the rear undercarriage annoy the heck out of me as they KEEP COMING OFF whenever I pick the plane up. I think a 1x4 plate on top to bind them together might solve that. A slightly blurry view (sorry) from underneath. The gear LOOKS like it might be capable of retracting internally, but alas, no. This is a shame as there's certainly enough room in there and it's a wasted opportunity IMO. Might have to modify that... A view of one of the four engines, I personally think they look too small and should have something under the wing as well to make them rounder: Cockpit: Crew door, open. I LOVE the smooth action of these doors and the way they seal flush against the fuselage when closed: Cargo door, open: Crew door with docked ladder: Cargo door with docked loading platform: Cargo slots inside and locks into place the same way it sits on the loader, neat: The minifigs, sorry this one is a bit blurry: And that concludes this week's "Show and Tell".

Lt. Veers, on Feb 4 2008, 11:42 PM, said: I do admit the amount of cargo is rediculously small, but It still looks good. Say, how much can the plane hold? Thanks for the review! *sweet* That's all the space you get. Now, it MIGHT be possible to rip out that rear bulkhead at the back of the wing and fill the middle area with tiles so cargo pallets could slide up the fuselage. But that would definitely prevent the undercarriage folding internally if that's what you wanted to do as well. Dr. S.	neutral

I loved the pics in the catalogues but was a bit disappointed by the build and end result. My own thoughts: CONs: - as noted, the cargo space is really small considering the size of the plane, although I can see this is restricted due to playability - without the barrier in the middle, the cargo would slide all over the place while the plane was being swooshed - the cargo 'lift' (I'm not sure how else to describe it) is very weak and snaps off, although it is a clever design I think it's badly implemented - there is nothing to hold the cargo pallet to the cargo lift truck so it tends to slide off all over the place as soon as the truck moves - colour issues - I had at least 3 shades of green with the larger plane pieces and noticeable variances even with identical cargo hatch pieces. At least one of them also came quite scratched, which was a little disappointing - At $79.95 AUD it's $10 more than the Passenger Plane was with less pieces and figs, and no printed pieces whatsoever! more $ for less, methinks. PROs: - Lots of nice cargo crate pieces and even the stickers for these are pretty good. - landing gear piece adjusts very well to height differentials so the plane doesn't lose its gear as often as the earlier passenger planes - the hinging mechanism works very well to open the cargo holds - opens very smoothly and is not noticeable - I'd definitely like to see more of this technique - the little vehicles work well chained together and are all good small designs OVERALL: - I really like the large planes since 06 but I don't think they've still quite hit the nail on the head. Whereas the earlier planes were a little flimsy, this one is sturdier but has its own issues. The look of the Cargo Plane is nice, and the new landing piece and cargo hatch pieces are really great, but some design weaknesses and colour issues detract from the overall product. It's a shame as with a bit of tweaking this could have been a must-have set.	negative
Wow, that's a great review of a great set Dr S! *y* As you yourself have already noted, this has the potential to be a fantastic military MOC! With a bit of modification you can get the engines to be rounder, or perhaps do away with them completely and replace them with jet engines. *sweet* Though I can't think of a system to retract the undercarriage at the top of my head it seems like there's indeeed more than enough potential to do so. It reminds me rather of an Ilyushin Il-76, one of my favourite cargo planes. :'-)	positive

Thanks for the review That seems to be a nice set but as far I'm concerned, I don't think it's worth EUR 49.99. There aren't so many parts though those new curved slope will add some more building possibilities. *y* What lacks : - A 2 x 4 cut out in the lower part of the nose to retract the landing gear. - A 4 x 6 cut out in the lower part of the tail to allow passagers to get off through the back like in a DC-10 - some real plates and tiles instead of these crappy wings.

The amount of cargo that huge plane carries! 8-? green peace would have a field day! X-D Nice review Dr S but this set is just too big for my town scale! ;-) Edited by casewindu, 05 February 2008 - 09:54 PM.	neutral
Nice review, Dr. S! I have been thinking long and hard about the scale of the planes in my town. I would like to keep my passenger planes in their classic 4-wide fuselage style, but I really don't mind the new plane hull pieces if they are used as an enormous transport plane like the Ilyushin-76. Unfortunately I can't afford this lovely new green one at the moment (which would be perfect to go with my green army) as I took too much of a hit buying the new 2008 Star Wars sets! But I have modified my white one to take huge cargo loads, in fact my APC is designed specifically to fit inside. Unfortunately I'm a bit busy to take pics at the moment, but hope to put some up soon.	neutral
Dr. S: I was not planning on buying this set after my disappointment with the other large airplane, but after looking at this image review, I just might buy. The green color is really the aspect that makes this airplane stand out. I think it looks great! Thanks for the review.	positive
If i do end up geting this set it will be for my slowly growing army. btw Nice review *y*	neutral
Thank for the review Doc! The only thing I like in this set is the small car. So I will not buy this set just for it! I really dislike those new planes, toooo bbiiiigggg! With this size, this cargo plane can carry just fiew things! What a shame! I think that the way TLC has made the wings is not very good... Like the rest of those big pieces... Just my thought.

The closeup of the Anubis statue, Yes the Eye is a sticker but at leasts a gold color! *Playability First off you can pull the pin on the Anubis statues which send them falling and taking out the walls. Behind the wall a skellie swings out! There is a lever in the back of the model where you push down and the snakes shower down upon the figs hehe With the snakes all around, Marion is both modeling with the new carrot torch and fending off viscous cobras :-D In the meantime Indy uses his whip to scale the wall and avoid all the snakes which he is afriad of. In the meantime leaving Marion behind to fight them off. :-P The whip is bendable but it will always snap back into a coil, its some type of bendy hard plastic *Scoring Figs- 9/10 Model- 8/10 Playability- 8.5/10 Overall Satisfaction- 4/10 (would be 9/10 if it wasn't for the stupid Anakin head error!) In the end this is a charming set and could easily fit in with the adventurers! It has the cool Anubis statues as well as the Ark. Plus Indy, Marion and a skellie, great selection of figs but Sallah would have been better since he actually removes the ark with Indy However I am still wondering the point of the Anubis statues, this set does seem pretty silly :-P P	neutral

Tks for your great review Pirnha ;-) Piranha, on Feb 8 2008, 05:09 AM, said: First off we have our hero, Indian............. What the hell? Why is there a freaking CW Anakin head on Indy!! There was a production slip up as instead of Indy's head I get Anakin's! :-| |-/ I open the box up and there staring me in the face is his ugly face!!

I got mine today! X-D I too got an Anakin Clone Wars head, although I'm not really complaining since I already have an Indy head from the Motorcycle Chase set. It is really odd that they would pack in such a different looking head though. Also, for those that think the head has no use, try placing it under one of the braided new brown dwarf beards. It looks pretty nice, I think! *y* On the set, it's wonderful! The hieroglyphic stickers are wonderful, Marion (especially her head and hair) is wonderful, and the Anubis statues are nice too. There's also lots of nice tan parts, such as 20 round 2x2s, and 8 1x8 bricks. All in all, it's a great set for the price, and I can't wait to get Race for the Stolen Treasure and Temple Escape now! *sweet*	positive
DAMMIT INDY, YOU WEREN'T SUPPOSED TO OPEN THE ARK!!! i really like this set, i only brought it for Marion but its a nice set and fun to build.	positive
Welcome to: My sigfig Sgt. Joey Sh. will lead trough this review of the new City 7743 Police Surveilance Truck. First of all the box: Front Back The Minifigs: 3 Police officers and a bad guy Now the vehicles: The cute little ATV *wub* The main part of the set: The Surveilance Truck A shot of the interior The trailer Back of the trailer The truck Back Side The little building: Front The interior And last but not least: Spare parts and not needed stickers That?s it! Hope to see you again at the next episode of Sgt. Joey?s Reviews.	positive
Thanks for the review, Stealth Hunter. *y* That truck looks better than I expected, and it?s for sure a pretty playable set. Nice, but still too much police mayhem to me. I think the new police station?ll satisfy all my safety needs.... :-)	neutral
Great review Stealth Hunter, a bit blurry in places but overall nice shots of the truck. It is much, much better than I expected, but i still won't get it, I have no need for more police. Thanks for the great review! Batbrick Away! >:-)	neutral
Thanks for the review, that truck is actually better than I first thought! I am still tossing up getting it, as I am getting the Police Station, and where would it park?! :-P I quite like the little building though, but still... I am so confused *wacko*	neutral
I like the new station but the truck is a good question. I still like the classic 1994 one and the 1980's can that was one of the first units I got	neutral
It looks to me that the little building is supposed to be like some sort of Customs checkpoint between one nation and another or like a toll facility on a highway. I like the little checkpoint but I think that should be part of a separate set and 7743 just having the Police Mobile Command Center truck.	neutral
Hello and welcome to another, oh wait, first Batbrick and iamded review! Today us two sworn enemies will be reviewing the Creator Cargo Chopper, here is the front of the box: And while pushing iamded to his doom, here is the back: Haha! Ouch! Oh dear...here are the parts anyway... Here is the instruction of the first model, the Cargo Chopper. I love Creator sets for the different models, they always excite me. Just ignore me finishing off my nemesis in the background. Something very interesting that I liked in the instructions was this step where you must add those three 2x2 yellow rounded pieces under the chopper. This is for support while you build, which is handy, and later you take it off: And even later use it as the cargo. I found that to be rather innovative and clever, as well as - Hey! What are you hitting me for? Both instruction booklets have the same back: Now heres the Chopper itself. I love the design of it, it isn't quite minifig scale but its great all the same. This is my first non-Xpod or House creator set, and it sure is fun. Here me and iamded go for a dizzy ride. I love the nose of the copter, and the landing gear is fantastic. A shot from the other side. Oh dear, it seems we've been a bit sick from that ride, and were vomiting transgreen 1x1s. The cargo itself is nicely made, though I forgot to put on two tiles here :-$ . It fits in real well with the chopper to, and the line is great for giving iamded the wedgie he deserves: This is my first power function set, so I was pretty excited. The motor is intergrated really well into this set, and is activated by pushing that little 3x2 plate with the 1x1 slopes on it forward, until it hits the motor button, that orange knob. Another point of interest is the use of bley barrels on each side. I like this as I don't have those pieces in that colour. A shot of the motor. Its really simple, all you do is pull the hook out to any length that allows, then press the orange button and it will wind it back up. This makes the Chopper pull the cargo up into its bay, and iamded pull me here reluctantly to a whacking: A top view, is that MY head? A view of the chopper without the cargo in it. I love the lowered cockpit: The leftover pieces from building: (NOTE: iamded's head does not count as set piece) And a final shot of the set with me and iamded. Oh, it appear we're dead, oh dear... Hope you enjoyed this review, soon I will post the two alternate models. I loved this chopper, its great to play with and has nice construction. It also has some handy pieces too. The motor function sounds like a gimmick but is well intergrated into this model. Well worth the price, so far this is another win for Creator I say! So far I recommend this model, but later we'll see if the alt models are up to scratch. Also, since this is my first review, comments and criticism welcome on everything. Batbrick Away! >:-) Edited by WhiteFang, 23 May 2009 - 06:37 PM. Indexed	positive
Thank you very much for a fine review, Batbrick. *y* What the.... I never realized these cool grey barrels till now.... that?s pretty interesting. :-) The whole Chopper looks very good, with a well fitting power function. It?s for sure a rewardable work to change that baby into a real MF version with accessible cockpit. :'-)	positive
Great review! Keep them coming! I might get this set now. I must have those grey barrels... Oh dear... :-D X-D :-P X-D This was a hilaruos review, too. Edited by ~VBBN~, 10 February 2008 - 11:21 PM.	positive
I am definitely getting this set. Thanks for the nice review!	positive
I wish I could just get those grey barrels alone, the rest of the set doesnt really intreigue me much :-$ Thanks for the review.	negative
Thanks everyone, heres part 2: The second instruction booklet includes instructions for both alternate models, which is good, I hate having too many manuals: Here she is, the plane: Its very nice and well proportioned, but where did iamded get that laser? Overview, the landing gear is very sturdy and nice, and the wings are surprisingly good: Top view, iamded's head fell into the propellers, I was trying to save him, honest! A view of how the motor on this one works, by pushing the orange button you can make the prop spin. It is well integrated like the chopper, though the prop only spins for about 2 1/2 seconds. Still, its a nice feature: The tail is also well made, simple, but lovable. Oh, and check out that tank! The prop spinning, Agh! Is that MY hand? Final view, there seems to be some sort of explosion here 8-| Well I think I got iamded more than me atleast. The second model is also great, though not as good as the chopper. The lack of space to fit something into the cockpit brings it down a bit, but it is a very nice model overall. I recommend it, though unlike the chopper it will be hard to mod into minifig scale. So far so good with 4995, here are the leftover pieces from the model: Enjoy! Batbrick Away! >:-)	positive
haha your review are so funny and so lego cool	positive
Lt. Veers, on Feb 11 2008, 11:55 AM, said: Great review, Batbrick! Iamded got what he deserved. X-D X-O :'-( :-P Great review, Batbrick! This looks like a wonderful set, I love that plane! It doesn't bother me that it's not mini-fig scale, as it looks more for display IMO. *wub* Looking forward to seeing the final model! *y* ~Peace	positive
Thanks guys, heres the final part: The Instructions for the boat begin on page 46: The overall set, its actually much nicer than I thought it would be, the pictures on the box make it look ugly. Top view, Tommy Guns do not actually come with set ;-) Side view, the designers have done an excellent job with the hull, considering the lack of many slopes pieces. You can see it is pretty much minifig scale too: Here you can see that by pushing in the red technic axle, the "anchor" on the front will be hauled back into the boat: Back view, these outboard motors are pretty cool, though I wish they could go own into the water more: Overall, though the weakest model, its still a lot of fun, and has a clever way around the lack of a shapely hull. I was impressed with it after the building it, it even has two rounded SNOTTy bottom pieces on the nose of the boat to give the impression it is speeding through the water with the front lifting up. Lots of leftover pieces for this one: The pieces: Sorry about the poor photograph there, it was getting late :-$ Overall the Cargo Chopper is another great set in the fantastic Creator line. Loads of fun, great play, and some clever designs, it challenges you to make your own things, and even includes some nifty pieces (bley barrels! *wub* ) I won't give it a rating, but I'll just say I certainly recommend it to fans of the theme and Lego fans in general. Now, finally, iamded and I teamup in the face of a larger foe. Get that Lord of Pies! Batbrick Away! >:-)	positive
Congrats to that nice review.... I like the Batcave set, you should also been able to find it at discount....	positive

And BTW, the Green Dude as you call him is named Killer Croc, he is a killer with a freakish skin condition. Batbrick Away! >:-)	positive
First I'll comment on the review and at a later date I'll comment on the set. You've done a top job Lord of Pies *y* You've captured the set from a variety of angles and posed the mini-figures interestingly.	neutral
Very nice review, Lord of Pies! Thanks for taking the time to put this together, and especially for all the detailed pics. *y* I very much regret that my dark ages occured when they did. Basically, I missed out on all the cheap and easy troop building sets, and this one is certainly no exception. The big sets are nice, but these are the ones that always make me wish just a little harder for a return of LEGO pirates... :'-) I gave it a 4 out of 5, just because I'd buy 4 out of 5 sitting on the shelves today, were it possible.	positive
Great little set! I bought this set only a few years ago MISB and I am still very happy about it. The hut is simple but very effective as a castaway building on some deserted island, the palmleaves are a good addition to any Lego collection. This set had a nice amount of weapons, two for each pirate and two of those weapons are flintlock muskets as opposed to just pistols. Nice poll as well, but you made sure nobody can give this set a 1 which is very nice (but probably a little mistake :-D ). I gave it the top-rating. *y*	positive

Wow. I remember this set from when I was a kid. I got it for my birthday and opened the package first. Sadly, I had to go to school so I had to leave it at home and not build it or play with it until I got home. Needless to say that was one of the longest days of school ever. Good review, great set.	positive
I bought one of these new from Bricklink a few months ago as part of my Pirate splurge I went on. I really enjoyed this set because of the amount of figs in such a small set, though Pirates were always pretty good about their fig count. Also the neat little hut is nicely done for its purpose. Great review, btw!	positive
Great small set that can help you add to you minifig count. The little boats are always cool, and the den isn't that bad either.	positive
Another first-rate review! It's a nice little set with a big number of minifigs. And 2 flintlock guns is also a nice bonus.	positive
A very nice review of a pretty and neat little set, thanks Lord Of Pies, guess it´s a 3 for me, with strong tendencies to 4....	positive
First of all excellent Review! 5/5 for me. I have yet to attain one of these sets. It has a nice trio of men including a redcoat, and a nice assortment of weapons. The rest, such as the leaves, is great for MOCing. imperialshadows, on Feb 19 2008, 08:41 PM, said: I gave it a 4 out of 5, just because I'd buy 4 out of 5 sitting on the shelves today, were it possible. If I saw 5 of these sitting on a shelf I would certainly buy all 5, then I would ask to speak with a manager to see if there is any way I can attain more pirate Lego stuff. simonwillems, on Feb 19 2008, 08:47 PM, said: Nice poll as well, but you made sure nobody can give this set a 1 which is very nice (but probably a little mistake :-D ).

A nice review and a nice little set for anyone's Pirate collection. A 5/5 for the review.	neutral
IMO this is a very simple and small set good to add some part to forbidden island. good	positive
Well since this topic has resurfaced, I would add my 2 cents about my appreciation of this set. It was the first and (unfortunately) the largest Pirate set I owned as a kid, but I played the wazoo out of it. Some of the minifigs have lost almost all their face printing after so many play sessions! Theres just something about the hut that appealed to me more than the cheesy skull-face islands we keep getting.Probably that it wa kind of neutral, good for my pirates, settlers or islanders. Though the palm leaves were rather fragile and used to break off the studded parts. It would be nice to get more of these "beach village army builder" sets.

So here it is finally, my first ever review of a lego set..oh wait, it's actually 2 sets. So i don't really know how to do it right, but i'll try the best. (Sorry if some pictures are a litte bit dark, but i'm not really into photography and i got bad light here) Let's Start with the Dwarf's Mine Defender: Theme: Castle 2008 Set Name: Dwarf's Mine Defender Number: 7040 Pieces: 86 Price: ?9,99 (EUR) First, as always, the box: The back, a few instructions on how the defender works, for those how don't know ;-) : And the instructions: We continue with the minifigs, sorry i forgot to make a closeup of the dwarf: And finally the mine defender itself, i personally think it isn't as bad as maybe some people think. The chain for the catapult is great i think: I kinda love those controls, the mechanism with the rubbe rband actually works pretty well, but only on a not-glossy underground. That's pretty much all of it, it's small but i like it a lot. So let's go on to the tower raid now, which would be my absolute favorite of those new sets. -------------------------------------- Theme: Castle 2008 Set Name: Tower Raid Number: 7037 Pieces: 364 Price: ?29,99 (EUR) Again, first the box & Instructions: We got 2 sets of instructios here, one for the tower and one for the siege tower: The Minifigs, we got one archer and one soldier here, both with the torsos of the 2007 sets: Now thw orc side, starting with the great leader, with the new armor and the golden helmet (i love those pieces!): Closeup of the armor & helmet: Then we got another orc-knight: And the prisoner, with handcuffs! The Crownie Tower looks great overall, though there is something i don't really like about it, but later on that. Now the back, and that is what really bothers me, there areno walls on the first floor except the one with the wall-piece and the door, and theprison also is open at the back. The orc easily could jump out there: Not sure what these are all about, they really don't add much to the set: Enough rant now, let's go on with a pretty sweet detail, the golden crystal on the little table: The wall piece on the first floor you can ram in: And finally the very best thing of this set, the amazing orc siege tower! From the front: The great working ram, you can pull it back very far and it got pretty much power: Here we got another sweet detail, the siege "platform" that moves out by pulling a cord in the back of the tower: Finally a picture of a bit siege action: If you ram in the lower wallpiece, the brown shelfs of the prison-floor collapse and the prisoned orc is finally free! Summary: Likes: As i mentioned before, i really think that's the best ever produced siege tower, it's got so mich details and works extremely well, also the overall look of it is magnificant. The destroy-mechanism of the tower is pretty cool too, the brown door is a fine detail too. Nothing much to say about the mine defender, i like this little set, and there's nothing really to bother about it. Dislikes: The Back of the tower. That's really the only thing that's a bit bad imo, they could have put there 2 more walls on the first floor and something to lock the prison easily. Final Thought: The Tower Raid for me personally is the best of the 2008 sets so far, it's got great playability and looks simply good. My opinion: Buy it!	positive
Tks for these cool reviews metalandi !! I love these orc sets !! I am so going to get these ;-) I'm happy to see that scared face again (I love it really !!) and the use of that handculfs !! That new armour looks really cool That tower is really nice and I wont mod it that much which os cool and the battle ram is freaking sweet !! Tks again for sharing ;-) *yoda*	positive
Great review, pictures and all! Thanks for showing all the mechanisms of the tower, I didn't notice them from either the pics we had or the instructions--it didn't hit me that when you knock down the wall the second floor breaks. That is a genius idea. This looks like a superb set, unfortunately my priority right now is the Troll Warship. Still, if that really is U.S. $80, I might skip it and go for this instead, which is only $20 US. One note, though. I think there might not be a back cage on the second floor of the tower so that the mechanism can work. Did you try to see if the second floor ground still falls if you add it a fourth cage wall? Also, you could just pretend that the tower is built against a mountainside. It would fit perfectly and add more defense to the Knights. Great review! :-) VK	positive
Tks for those so much!! :'-) *y* Nice reviews! I love that tower raid, and the defender, and will buy them both. Quote really don't add much to the set: Oh, but they do. More pieces= higher price. ;-)	neutral
Thanks for the double review, I like the Dwarf catapult but the real deal is the Tower Raid set. I love that Siege Tower and love that new armour, can't wait to get it. Thanks for the review! Batbrick Away! >:-)	positive
The Tower Raid has the best price per piece ratio in the whole 2008 line. Thanks for the review ^_^	positive
Thanks metalandi! These are 2 great sets, I'm definately looking forward to seeing these in New Zealand stores! The collapsing floor/prisoner freeing mechanism on the tower is wonderful, a great touch. Some slight modifications, like, some walls, will make this perfect. And the Dwarf's Mine Defender is a sweet little set, with some neat minifigs. Thanks for the reviews! *y* ~Peace	positive
Thanks for these great reviews! *sweet* The dwarfs mine defender looks interesting, the figs though are *wub* The only thing missing is a weapon for the dwarf and some shields The battering ram and tower are awesome! 8-? The Troll King with new torso, helmet, and body armor is simply amazing I like how the troll is handcuffed :-D The tower shows nice detail except for the poor "brig" . I love that gold crystal! The battering ram is a thing of beauty! $30 for the Tower and Ram and $10 for the Defender are very well priced! I still want the Battle Wheel more though! Damn Exclusives! :'-( >:-( P	positive
Well, I don't think Orcs are that sturdy, seeing that they'd have to jump from the second level of the tower, I don't see survival as his chief objective! :-P Awesome review! I'm loving these sets more and more! The Tower Raid is DEFINITELY the best and the cheapest set there! >:-) Oh, and Pirhana, it's not really a 'king', it's more like an officer. Remember, the Wizard rules these goblins! Edited by trooperdavinfelth, 22 February 2008 - 02:49 PM.	positive

Yeah, the open towers are kinda funny, although they were also typical of (for instance) 90s pirate sets. The trolls' vehicles are cool though. They look evil. I can't wait to start collecting '08 Castle sets...(I didn't buy any Castle in '07, I only got one set for Xmas, so I'm catching up on the '07 stuff first before it's all sold out)	neutral

Damn you to hell Dunamis >:-( Now tks to you I really want the 3 sets put together X-D Wow that is what I call a sweet review 8-? Tks for taking the time to make once again such a fantastic one ;-) The overall look of the building is brilliant and I love the nice additions they did: the cheese and mouse (Jerry :-D ) is hilarious !! I didn't know Green Grocer had a rodent infestation !! And the use of the new built furniture and detils like the radiator is freaking awsome !! Also that set has a definite plus for me: its the back details !! I love the stairs, the deck with table !! Wowx that is what I call sweet backdoor details !! Now its clear that I will need to buy the 3 sets asap !! Tks once again Dunamis ;-) *yoda*	positive
Very nice. Very nice, indeed. Lots of lovely, little details, even at the back. This review hasn't changed my opinion one bit, I'm still looking forward to when I can finally pick up mine at the post office. I'm crossing my fingers that there will be more buildings following after this one. I'm guessing that LEGO's just testing the waters to see how far AFOL's are willing to go regarding price vs. details. Green Grocer is still epic, though.	positive
For some silly (and quite delusional) reason I thought that I had a chance to review this first... :-D But yours is at your house, and mine is (hopefully) winging it's way to me... :'-) Thanks for the review! It will help me survive until mine arrives. I love this set. *wub* Hopefully there will be many more stunning sets like this to come. *sweet* xwingyoda, on Mar 8 2008, 08:03 PM, said: I didn't know Green Grocer had a rodent infestation !!

What a beautiful set, TLC give the designer a pay rise immedietly. I was lucky to order one of these while they were on sale to us aussies ;-) but dont worry lego the $100 you saved me will be spent on more sets like this. Carn't wait to watch my kids rescue residents in distress from those upper level windows with the fire fighters.	positive
Man, these sets are so awesome. Incredible work done by the designers there, must have took a long time to get all this ogether. if they weren't too expensive i would go and buy them all 3 right away *wub*	positive
damn it ! what a great great review ! I definitly love this set !!!! burn credit card, burn ! you're the must in there Dunamis ! many thanks !	positive
Great review, great set. I can't mine until after Easter. *weeps*.	positive
This is a nice review, thanks for all the great pictures!	positive
Truly an awesome review. Thanks Dunamis. I ordered my two copies (one to build, one to store in the "vault") last week. Can't wait to get this one! The attention to detail here is what makes the set great. There's nothing to criticize about this set. It's really the closest thing to perfection that I have seen from TLC. The difference between this set and CC is the interior detail, and because of that, GG now become (in my opinion) the best set EVER released by TLC. Do the CC/GG/MS sets fit well with the 50th anniv. town plan? My impression is that out of the box, at least, they don't. Which is too bad. However, I don't think it would be hard to mod the Town Plan so it looks like it belongs in the same town as CC/GG/MS. These sets, to me, are what I have always wanted from TLC as an adult. I hope they keep up the line, and add more elements to this excellent lineup.	positive
wow,, thanks for the nice review! I have the other 2 sets and waiting for this to come to our shores. Stupendous Design and Details! I really like the "hammer-rails" on the roof. CANt wait!!! *wub*	positive
Thanks for all the feedback. As you can tell, I really enjoyed building it. Cardinal Brick, on Mar 8 2008, 09:26 AM, said: Is it the first set you'e given 100% to? Yes, it is. I gave Cafe Corner a 96% and I felt this was a better set and improved on the things that I dinged Cafe Corner on (lack of minifigs was one thing.) That's why I enjoy reading the comments so I can see if my ratings are in line with what everyone else thinks and to see if I missed anything. I can't wait for some of you to build it and share your thoughts as well.	positive
A very fine review with great and informative pictures, thanks dunamis! *y* And what a wonderful set, a masterpiece and far beyond everything I would?ve expected just one year ago.... The amount of details is exceptional, from the different railings to the mousehole and the radiator.... sheer brilliant. :'-) And two female MFs (or hippies, you never know....) and a child.... only one adult male character who nearly looks like.... well, anyways. It?s simply a milestone, and a very creative and inspiring beauty. *wub* Easter Parade on! And, sweet GG.... will you marry me? :-$	positive
O. M. G. I MUST HAVE THAT SET!! :'-) *y* *wub* I remember you telling me that you were going to do a review of this set, and I was so anxious! I love these reviews! Thanks so much! Great pictures. *wub* *y* *y* This will dent my wallet. 8-| I am so envious!	positive
A very informative review, indeed. Thank you so much for doing so. Now I know that the price is worth every penny leaving my pocket. ;-) What do you guys think is TLC putting up as the next modular set? Is it asking too much of TLC to produce 1 modular set each quarter (4 times a year)?	positive
A million thanks for this review. This is greater than I thought. I especially like that clock. I'm going to get this set as soon as possible.	positive
:-) AMAZING!!! Great Review!!! :-D U have totalyl convinced me to get this set! Its so wonderful, filled with great details. What a waste, i can't order it in S@H because i am from Singapore :'-( I hope it will come to my country, so i am able to buy it!!! :-)	positive
Thank you for the amazing review Dunamis! This set looks amazing *wub* I won't be able to afford it though :'-( Congrats! This is on the frontpage *y* *sweet*	positive
Wow, another old technic set review by you. Nice set, and thanks for that review.	positive
Looks like you have the original 1989 version with the yellow top cylinders. :-) I got one too several years ago, although I probably paid too much for it. :-P On a side note, if that pneumatic tubing feels harder and stiffer than the modern type, I highly recommend that you don't use it and buy some of the newer stuff off Bricklink instead. TLC originally used a different material for the tubes and this stuff degrades the nozzles (on pistons, switches and so on) over time. The old tubes also grip the nozzles much more firmly and if you aren't careful when removing them, it's actually possible to rip off the nozzles completely. X-O I had this happen a few years ago, although TLC replaced my broken pistons for free. I got rid of that stuff for good after that, although the pistons on my Power Crane still have slightly discolored nozzles. Edited by CP5670, 10 March 2008 - 04:57 AM.	neutral

X-O I actually noticed that while taking it apart but didn't really pay any attention. I just thought that's because it's an old part. Well, thanks for the information!	neutral
Thanks for another fun review! This set is high on my list of things to buy, I love cranes, built many and bought many including the classic 8460 from 1995 and the more recent 8421. That threaded axle never stopped intriguing me... It was use in so few sets (I believe 8851 contained one as well?) and I still don't know why it's better than any other axle. Congratulations with a near mint copy of this set! :-)	positive
As I bought it, I didn't even know I would also get a box. It just said: all parts with building instructions. After opening the parcel I was like: "woah... woooaaahhh" and so on. ;-) I love LEGO-boxes because as a child I stood in the toy stores starring at the boxes, only seeing the front and the back, nothing more. This brings back some memories... :'-)	positive
I bought it some years ago for the b-model, and like it so much :D	positive
Hi! This is my third (old-school) technic set review! I don?t want to talk much, please enjoy just the pictures! #1 the parts: #2 building: The two axles, you can see in the middle, are not connected and don?t belong to each other. The axle on the left side is for the steering, on the right side for the engine. The dark-gray ?Technic Gear 16 Tooth with Clutch? allows the connection from the differential gear to the engine, trough the axle for the steering. The V6-engine: The winch: That?s a part you don?t see everyday: a 1x2 Rack. It only reappears in 2 sets from 2001 and 2004. (The Rebel Wrecker has been released in 1994.) The ?Front double wishbone with anti-sway bar?-suspension (yeah, I got it from Technopedia! X-D ) The finished model: #3 random shots: I really like this picture! Authoritative, isn?t it? 8-? :-D Thanks for viewing the pictures! Please comment if you want to!	neutral
Thanks for reviewing all these old sets! Will you be doing any more?	positive
This set is really cool. I might actually get it!	positive
Ah a good old retro review. Those old school days had some pretty impressive sets, with alot more complexity than modern sets. If you have it may I recommend 8880?	positive
Nice pictures. I also sort out the pieces the same way if I'm rebuilding a model. *y* This set packs a lot of functionality into a fairly small size, but was rather expensive for its size ($70) when it was still available, compared to other sets of that time. You can also rig up the Technic flag sticker that it comes with to the main model. I've done that on mine. You may want to reinforce it with tape if you're going to leave the model on display though, as it will break up over time due to UV exposure like many stickers do. I had to do that with mine after it started to crack, although it still looks pretty good.	positive
the only original stickers are the front headlight-patterns on the 2 red 1x2 bricks. The others have been destroyed - must have been the bad decaying sticker quality that breaks when you'll remove it - so I printed them. I didn't print the flag for only the alternate model needs it, although it's a neat idea...! and LordGalewind: clickey! I keep that in mind. One of my 8880 is already dusty enough!	negative
Thanks! You've just motivated me to go on a "senseless-preliminary-design-errors-hunt"...! A few things I've discovered: Left Side (Alternate Model): the steering link can only be put in place with a little violence... the handlebar (?) is turned (far more than it's actually possible) although the wheels are straight. Right Side: The 1x8 Tile simonwillems pointed out The half bush right next to it is... *can't_find_the_words* ..."wrong". Could be that the Technic Triangle is missing. The "windscreen"- 1x6 Technic Plates are mounted with 1/2 pins instead of Axle Pins with half bushes. Who can find more...? X-D	neutral
hmm, seems like the wheels are recycled into the harley truck in the 2008 batman set!	neutral
natelite, on Mar 10 2008, 05:57 PM, said: hmm, seems like the wheels are recycled into the harley truck in the 2008 batman set! nope. the harley-truck-wheels are thinner and somewhat more modern. I do believe they're the same like in 8274. Aaaaaaaand: for a long time in my life these wheels have been the best and coolest looking I've ever had! So where's your deference? :-D recycled... |-/ X-D	positive
BerndDasBrot, on Mar 10 2008, 05:56 PM, said: You've just motivated me to go on a "senseless-preliminary-design-errors-hunt"...! Man..., this set is a disaster what were they thinking! :-D :-P I just remembered one other fun aspect of this set: The crane hook can be attached to the underside of the rear bumper, to hold it in position while driving along, but when things are like this and you try and wind up the cable the winch is strong enough to break the (original provided Lego) rope.... It 'worked' with my copy. :-D So this set is capable of demolishing itself.... But still, one of the best Technicsets I have, with all stickers intact. I'm not so sure about that flag though, must check on that.	positive
Wow, that first picture is great! You must have a very wide angle lens with the capability to focus very close (macro). The perspective makes the model look huge. Nice work. I think the suspension on this set is my favorite of all Technic. It has such large travel and is so.... what word should I use..... "bouncy". Hey, why do you only review sets which are red? :-D Eric	positive

Any physics teacher would have to admit that a really fast car, approaching the speed of light, will always look red as it drives away due to red shift!! X-D On the other hand, 8880 looks pretty fast and it is black, although I have seen pictures of one that someone built in red. Yellow might be good too. Some cars even look fast in green.

I can remember that I've seen a few color variations on brickshelf and on ebay (They sold well). It's new and familiar at the same time. That makes it more interesting!	positive
Reread your review today! Great pictures! This IS a fabulous model. Got this model a few months ago for just € 25! It is small and has great working parts. I love the way the front-suspension is made! Epic! I only had the light-stickers replaced with trans-clear bricks. BTW: The gear rack has been used in this years 8048 Buggy!	positive
I also happened to receive this set this weekend, virtually MISB (the seals on the side of the box were loose, however everything inside was untouched). This little beast a joy to build and even more so to play with! As indicated by Eric on the technicopedia page, it's crammed with functions for a medium-sized set. I think I love it even more than my son does	positive

Hello, my dear friends! Here's something new. I am actually making a review with pictures! Yes, I got a new camera for christmas. Now I was testing to see how the camera would reflect, so some of the pics are a bit blurry. I have based this review from Dunamis's reviews. He is my inspiration.So, without further ado, I bring you the Review! Set #: 7693 Name: ETX Alien Strike Price: $19.99, ?12,99 Pieces: 246 Box: Okay, so as you can see below, the Box is pretty simple. As always, European versions won't have the Piece count, name, etc, just the Number I believe. Mine, having the American Version, has the info on it. as you can see, it has the Classic MM logo, and the red Planet, as well as the set in a pose itself. Very Nice. I linked it because the Pic wasn't resizing. http://www.brickshel...ke/dscn0017.jpg Below is the back of the box. It shows the other sets and some features of this set. Contents: Next we have the Contents. This set includes a medium sized DSS (xwingyoda), a bag labeled one, and HUGE bag labeled two, the 1 bag contains a smaller bag, and the two bag includes two smaller bags. 5 bags in all. Also pictured are the instructions. I have linked it due to the non-resize. http://www.brickshel...ke/dscn0019.jpg Figs: Included in this set are three figs. Two jellies, and 1 astro. The jeelies are fine, but I pefer the LoM ones. But they glow. Those new alien commanders for Summer look promising though. The astro is nice, and includes an extra gold Visor. MOC ON! Astro Miner: In all MM sets there is a human and alien set. The Astro par of this set is a Mini-miner. Here is a pic of construction and that wonderful space logo sticker. Not Much of a cockpit. :-/ Finished Miner(The set number, too): Overall I like the miner, and It is nicely designed. I feel the cockpit is lacking though. Aliens: The alien Vehical is the Main part of the set. This pic shows the beginning steps. Solid and sturdy. But those four axles/pin parts(blue) are pointless. No support, and they don't get used at all. Nice TLC. :-| Now we get cooking! This pic shows the tail added on and the more bulk being built. We get a little repetitive and build the craft up in this pic. And this pic from the instructions shows how the alien craft transforms for battle. The completed set and extra bits. Parts: 8/10 Figs 8/10 Price Per Piece ration: 9/10 Playability: 9/10 Overall: 85% The alien craft is great. The attack feature is nice and there are a ton of trans green parts. The alien falls out of the cockpit when turned upside down. I love this set, and it's perfect for MM fans or beginners.It has nice parts, and read the above part for more details. Gallery when Moderated. Keep an eye out for future reviews! Please comment. :-)	positive

thanx for the review. i have one question. do these aliens have moving arms? as far as the set goes i think lego did a bad job on the alien ship. i dont think any of the alien ships look good in Mars Mission the human fanction got a lot better this year and i would have bought this buggy if it came by its self..	negative
Sweet first pic review! *y* I got this set for a birthday present last year, and it is pretty fun overall. The alien ship in this set is actually one of my favorites. It just looks cool, and the way you can fold it out is really clever. The only negative for me is the cockpit of the mining unit. Not really because it isn't detailed, but because mine is top heavy, and keeps falling forward. It's kinda funny if you think about him driving along and then falling forward...but not funny at all when you're playing. |-/	positive

Well, as bad a concept aliensvshumans is for a theme... I really do like this set. The human rover has nice parts for reuse, especially those oldschool space wheels. And despite those wobbly wings, I really like the alien ship. goes from a flying saucer-ish shape to a spread winged almost raven shape, very ominous and cool looking. Now that 'alien commander' is terrible... if I don't buy bionicle minifigs already, why would I be interested in that thing? Kinda wish they'd take the Drones from the retiring ExoForce theme and do them in green, they'd make nice alien robot things...	positive

Hi! This is my forth (old-school) technic set review! Since blakbird pointed out that all my technic reviews are red, I chose a yellow dune blaster for today! just kidding. this set is red as it should be! (Don't worry my next reviews will be yellow and black... uhhh forshadowing... ;-) ) I will start with some facts! 277 elements and released in 1994 that's enough. #1: the box: #2: the parts: #3: building instructions and catalogues: Wow! No folds, no wear marks - simply: *wub* "Was lesen coole Kids?" - "KLICK! Das super Magazin fuer coole Kids!" (How obvious...) #4: building: No differential. I really love the way the 1x8 Technic Bricks on the sides will be positioned later. Fun fact: the engine contains no 2L-Technic Axle. ...and finished. A real quick build. #5: spare parts: ...for the alternate model. The yellow Technic Handle should be from 8412. Maybe a bonus feature from the seller! #6: random shots: #7: final thoughts: This is my second 8829 and I also noticed that the engine turns very hard. The alternate model is really (sorry to all those of you who like it) crappy. I mean- a nice idea, but not with this wheels! :-| Anyway: a really beautiful Technic-set! *reminiscing* (this word exists, does it?) thanks for viewing the pictures, I hope you enjoyed it! Please comment if you want to! Edited by BerndDasBrot, 21 March 2008 - 02:09 PM.	positive
That looks like a very nice set! :-) In your opinion, how does it compare to the current Dune Buggy? -Toa Of Justice	positive
I don't own the 8296, but what I can see from the pictures, I would say that 8296 is very similar to 8829. The only things that are different ist that 8296 is studless and features a steering wheel for the seat. But 8829 has got bigger wheels... >:-) It also would have been nice, if the wheels from 8296 could have the same tread.	neutral
A very good review with fine and informative pictures, and a really nice set, thanks, BerndDasBrot. *sweet* Hmm, I really wish that TLC would make some steerable cars within the System line too....	positive

Please comment if you want to! A great set review, as always. Nice try making a review of a set that was not red. It almost worked! Maybe next time. *sweet* One thing I noticed is that a bunch of your pictures are missing the beam that goes over the left hand wheel as a fender. Like this picture: What kind of camera do you use? The pictures have very good depth of field, meaning that both the foreground and the background are in good focus. This is usually hard to do without a very small aperture. Yes, "reminiscing" is a word. It means to fondly remember the past. I also noticed that the engine was sticky. Set 8408 has the same problem. It took me forever to figure out what the problem was. If you take the engine out of the model, it turns nice and smooth. Then when you put it back in, it works terrible. It turns out the key is that, in the back, there is an 8 tooth spur gear and a 24 tooth crown gear used as a spur. If you look at Technica, you will see that there are two different crown gears. One of them works well mated with an 8 tooth on parallel axles, and the other one doesn't. The difference is only supposed to be longer teeth, so it really should not matter, but it does. If your set works bad, try switching the crown gear to one of the other variety. Worked for me. Eric	positive

First, 8829 is a lot bigger. I really like the huge rear balloon tires. They both have rack and pinion steering, and they both have trailing arm rear suspension with a V-2 engine. I think the body on 8829 is a little more well done. For 8296, I think the alternate tractor model is much better. For more comparisons, see Technicopedia. Eric	positive

Hello All Apologize for digging out a such old post. Recently I got a bag of Lego Technic parts where there have been mixed three sets: 8858, 8829 and 8235 The resurrection of 8858 has been described by me in a separate post. Going back to the Dune Buggy – when I saw it for the first time back in 1994 I did not like it, as I was always big fan of 8840 (which I consider to the day the best looking Buggy) and set 8829 looked to me ugly. So there were those all parts in the bag… then I though why not build it ? And I started to do it. When I finished I was very surprised how the final look of this set is! Really taking my words back. Unfortunately in the bag there were missing some parts and I could not rebuild the back spoiler. So I made some changes to it and make it from spare parts that I have and it came out acceptable. I also added some additional parts such as “fake” steering wheel, “Rally” logo, antennas. I have also reverse mounting of the rear tires – why Lego did them like that I never know – as I think they look better this way. Set: well the review has been already made by owner of this post so I will only add few things into it. Engine – V2 (aired cooled?) is driven by 4 gears -> from the single wheel (no differential as in 8840) using two old school z14 tooth bevel , then by z24 tooth crown and z8 tooth type 1. Actually the (as in most old sets) the pistons are moving very fast (not as in current sets) and smooths – I needed to extra clean all engine parts as there was a lot friction. Suspension – set has “engine bay” working using two old gray shock absorbers 6,5l – the movement is not big but works very nice, better then in 8840 in my opinion. Steering – this is a bit odd as there is no direct connection to HoG as in most old sets, but first the gear rack is moved by z8 then two z14 tooth where reverse movement is taking place. Later connection of two old school z14 tooth bevel goes to HoG Details – this is the most that I like in this set, specially how the use of axle pin connector perpendicular and 1x10 bricks with 3x3 cut corners and plate 1x5 toothed ends 2 studs with center axle hole are making the body shape – is just wonder. Tires – the balloon rear are pretty nice the front is a new version of those that were in 8840. What I do not like: 1. Missing of Technic Figure (8840 had it.) 2. no steering wheel in the original set 3. no differential – but having in mind that Lego has introduce 24-12 teeth would be difficult to build the transmission in such small space where the engine is. I will shortly upload new pictures and post them here later on . Over all – I think it is worth buying it as it is very payable !

WOW! This buggy was my very first LEGO set. I like this review - it remembered my childhood. I also liked its body with those 8 studs long bricks on sides. I can also remember trying to build engine in such way that it works smooth without success. Anyway I think its "studless version" - set 8048 is much better.	positive

Thanks for the review, I think i'll certainly get these sets. They look very nice and have nice minfigs (I love racing, as long as minifigs could sit in them).

Hi! This is my forth pre-old-school review. As promised: a yellow-set ! My 8862 arrived today, survived the washing machine coaster and actually was real fun to build! #1: information: This set contains 664 parts (only! I thought I’d be far more!) and was released in 1989 in the TECHNIC theme. Be sure to visit Technopediaif you want to know more! #2: building instructions: Wow these instructions are used! I'm not used to this after all this sets with unread instruction booklets... The pneumatics page: The last step for the alternate model: #3: the parts: Wow! Look at all those technic beams, gears, pins...! (A few parts are missing in this photo!) #3: building: The left worm gear is for the outriggers, the right one for turning the “rear boom” The three 12L Axles: left one: outriggers, middle one: steering, right one: erm… rear-boom-rotation. The two worm gears in the front part: left one: lifting the bucket, right one: dumping the bucket. The turning-mechanism for the “rear-boom” is finished. Once again a toothed 10L axle. The Boat Weight 2x6x2 is hidden underneath the radiator grill. Okay… many hoses and a nice, comfy seat have been added. Now you can recognize the Backhoes real shape. Only with a little violence it’s possible to lift the bonnet (?) through the Pneumatic Pump. Yeah, outriggers. Same technique that the 8854 uses. The finished “boom / jib / scoop thing” (=BJST) :-| X-D The finished loader bucket. And to end the building process: the same picture from the introduction. (OFF-TOPIC: “It is all part of the miracle of nature! - The circle of life!” #4: functionality: This time, I tried something new! I hope you can spot something - if not: Technopedia! Okay, here we go. #5: random shots: I’ve got way too many pictures this time, so I refer to my brickshelf folder. Until it’s moderated you can follow the multilingual links! eins deux three quattro fem zes sédem osiem #6: final thoughts: Definitely worth buying! As a child I thought it looks hideous - but today I’ve found out it’s totally fun to build and freaking functional. Three things I want to mention though: The BJST can only be slewed (a new word!) if the outriggers are deployed. It is also possible that the BJST will reach the ground (danger of grinding or sticking) even if the outriggers are deployed. The two mechanisms for the loader bucket can actually interlock, and the 14 tooth gears might break / disentangle from the axle. thanks for viewing the pictures, I hope you enjoyed it! Please comment if you want to!	neutral
Thanks for your feedback! I like both, but I would say 8455 is far more than just a studless version! with 10 pneumatic cylinders and 2 pneumatic pumps it's a wonderful set for every pneumatic freak.

yesterday while building, I accidentaly dropped a Axle Nut. Of course I'm working in a total mess and so it tool some time 'til I found it again. there are ~324 axle nuts on bricklink with an Avg Price of $0.89. I didn't know of this Accessory-set: 5110-2... You can buy it for $40.00 8-?	neutral

Quote there are ~324 axle nuts on bricklink with an Avg Price of $0.89. I didn't know of this Accessory-set: 5110-2... You can buy it for $40.00 8-? I was thinking of getting one of those off BL several years ago, back when the price used to be more like $15 or so, but I realized that I hardly ever use the couple that I already have. :-P They came out with the modern turntable the year after this set, which mostly negated the need for these screw axles. I think their only use now is to hold non-Lego objects onto models, like the Technic pen in 8094. I guess you can try to make linear actuators out of them, but they're often too rare and fragile for that.	neutral

The finished “boom / jib / scoop thing” (=BJST) :-| X-D thanks for viewing the pictures, I hope you enjoyed it! Another great review and a wonderful set of pictures. I like your nomenclature for the BJST. Acronyms always sound nicely scientific; much better than "digger". No one would know you made it up until they found out what it means. I also really like what I will call your "kinetic photos". They convey a sense of motion and show the range of the mechanism without the big file sizes of animations. How long of a shutter speed did you use? The secret to not getting too much friction in the turntable is using extra nuts and jamming them together. You don't want to actually clamp the nuts tight across the turntable. You want to jam two nuts tightly together at each end which prevents them from unwinding, but still leave a little free play (gap). This way it will hold the assembly together but not prevent it from moving. Mine moves quite easily. This same concept is used on the pen plotter or 8094. "Slewed"? I think that's a word. How about "slewn" or "slain" or "slewifacated"? I think "rotated" is best. *sweet* Eric	positive
By the way, don't forget to build the alternate model of 8862. It is a combine (farm equipment) which is just as good as 8274. I liked it so much that I bought two copies of this set so I could display both. My favorite alternate model (not counting Universal Sets) is the 8480 submarine. Maybe it is time for a white set review? *skull* White is pretty rare. For your blue set, I recommend you review 8462. There are only a couple of green sets, and 8479 is the best. And then of course, 8458 is silver!! I think we all know what the best black set is. And according to your photography, you have lots of them! But don't forget 8868. Eric	positive
BerndDasBrot, on Mar 24 2008, 05:39 PM, said: could you explain your thoughts please? You know: my english skills ;-) I was thinking you could somehow attach a 16-tooth dark gray gear (the one that spins freely around axles) to the nut, which would make the axle move in and out when the gear turned and convert the gear's rotary motion to linear motion in a fairly compact package. Although there are other ways of doing the same thing that don't use such rare parts, and the 2008 Technic sets will come with pre-built linear actuators anyway.	neutral

That is unacceptable. It is imperative that you put a mortgage on your house immediately to get it! *sweet* Yes, 8824 is a good white set. I also see from your room photos that you have the 8839 Supply Ship which has lots of white. This is a really nice set. 8462 is hard to call old school, but at least it uses regular beams. The air tanks are the best part of the set. I wish LEGO had used them more often, especially on the highly pneumatic sets. The tank makes all the difference on 8459. You are right, 8458 is certainly not old school, but it is a great set with wonderful suspension. It is of the same era as the Super Street Sensation with all of the panels for body contouring. 8868 is Technic at its best. There is nothing else like it, especially with the compressor. Quote Did you had something like this in mind if the toothed 10L axle rotates the axle nuts want to rotate too but they can't because of that 2x4 Technic Plate. So they'll decide to move along the axle. The 1x6 Bricks on each end make sure that the axle won't move in or out. Thanks for your feedback! While the assembly you have drawn would work as a linear actuator, I would not recommend it. The torsional stiffness and strength of an axle are proportional to the polar moment of inertia, a section property. Most of the stiffness comes from the outside of the cross shaped axle. But in the threaded axle, you lose all the stiffness of the outer area because it is not continuous. This means you only get stiffness and strength from the small core. I think the threaded axle would bend and break very easily if subjected to much torque. Eric	neutral

Yeah, the Tow Truck was the last set that still used mainly studded beams. They made many changes to Technic the following year, with models becoming predominantly studless and making heavy use of the flexible axles/hoses and decorative panels. The Technic logo and box art style was also changed a lot. I really like the overall construction of that set. The model is fairly lightweight but extremely sturdy. It must be one of the strongest large sets they've released. Quote Did you had something like this in mind? That's basically the idea. As Blakbird said though, it wouldn't be very powerful and would put the axle under some stress. The linear actuators they're bringing out this year do the same thing and should work much better.	positive

Some time ago I sort of complained about the fact that there was not much Technic represented in the Eurobricks community (this was the topic, if someone is interested). I am glad to see someone took that complaint serious and started reviewing technic sets on large scale to show us how fascinating the theme really is! This review is once again an excellent one, I really enjoyed reading it. I must buy this set sometime soon because I always liked the three-way pneumatic system it came with and the overall look of the machine. For many years it seemed out of reach, much to expensive and hard to come by as a kid. Now as an adult there are many ways to acquire this wonderful set. Keep on reviewing! *y*	positive

Thanks for the review. And for giving me directions :-P I think the design of these two cars looks to be better than in the other set. The drivers are positioned lower compared to the windscreen and the design of the front on th red car is really nice. I'm missing details of motors and cars this big could use a working steering mechanism.	neutral
Speaking of pocket knives, I just got Speed Racer and Snake Oiler at K-Mart and might mod the helmet so it actually looks like the cartoon. The problem is - I don't want to shell out two bucks for a clear visor! >:-( By the way, I know trans-clear visors are non-production, but where did they come from? a pick-a-brick? if so, what store? Well at least if I do go through getting the elusive clear visor, it's not as bad as the insane $25+ red vader helmet! This set is great. I would have gotten this along with the one I purchased, but I didn't have enough dough with me to get both.	positive
Very good review! These sets are a lot better than I expected, and for $20, I might have to pick up both! My family and I are going to Orlando this summer, hopefully I'll pick these and some other sets up at the Lego Store in Downtown Disney. :-D	positive
As promised, and with only a single day of delay is my review of the 2008 set: 4994 Creator Fierce Creatures. This small set is the same size and price range as last year's 4939 Cool Cars reviewed by prateek and dillthepill. The box General info You get 193 pieces (vs 206 for Cool Cars) which is quite a lot, but most of them are small. There are a lot of hinges and some good slopes and wings. The building instructions contains three models, but no further ideas for inspiration. Primary model: Spider The first model is a big spider which shares some similarities to the secondary model of 4895 Power in the design. The legs each have 3 joints, where the ones in the middle have "stud joints" to be moved sideways while the rest use hinges for all joints. There are 8 of them and it does get a little tedious with all the repetitive building in this relatively small model. I like the design of the face with a lot of eyes and a big and ugly mouth, but the real gem is the X-pattern on the opisthosoma made using double/inverted slopes. It is poseable and I think it looks more "fierce" when inverted. Secondary model: Snake The face of the snake is nicely detailed with a splitting tongue and a mouth than can move a little. There is a problem with the construction. It uses stacked hinges for some of the joints, which are hard to pull apart without stressing the pieces. Tertiary model: Fly I'm not completely sure what this insect is. I will say it's a fly, although the tail and head are too pointy. This is a neat little thing. Conclusion Primary model: 8 It is a good design, but lacks some sturdiness in the legs. They fall off a little too easily. Secondary models: 6 They are pretty good when you look at the bricks that are available, but they don't wow you in any way and they suffer from the same issues as the primary model regarding sturdiness. Alternate models: 3 It is hard to come up with alternate models with so many small pieces and plates that are only 1 stud wide. The colors might make you want to build a Spyrius space ship. Playability: 8 The models have many movable joints and you can put quite a scare into your minifigs when their town gets attacked by these creatures... unless some EN forces are there to protect them. Price: 6 Creator sets are known for their great price to bricks ratio, but this set doesn't quite measure up to sets like Cool Cars. Pieces: 7 The pieces aren't great by themselves, but who doesn't need a fist full of hinges, slopes and basic plates in standard colors? I don't think this is a must-have set like the big rig was last year. The pieces are great and it has a nice primary model, but the set lacks a bit when it comes to the usual strong Creator qualities like alternate models and price.

Enchanted Island 6278 Pictorial Review Original price: $66 Pieces: 412 Figures: 7 This 1994 set marked the beginning of a new era for Lego Pirates - it became a theme more centralised around playability and not so much grand ol' ships. 6278 Enchanted Island was the flagship set of the Islanders subtheme, heavily based around Polynesian and Native American concepts (In fact, TLC was successfully sued by a number of tribes for using bastardised Maori names, such as Kahuka). It was released as a Legend set in 2001, but due to poor sales was discontinued again. The largest of the Islander sets, Enchanted Island is a portion of an island with a river running through. The left hand side features some sturdy buildings built into a tree-like structure on a rocky outcrop, whilst the left hand side features a tower built out of "wooden" posts and a large tribal statue. The box cover shows all the details; it does, however, differ from the instructions' finished product in that it has been more aesthetically arranged - bushes e.t.c. have been moved to fill in gaps and to not obscure other things. The sides of the box show nothing particularly special, although in one scene it depicts the Islander Canoe chasing the Pirate boat with the treasure; just one way to play with the set. The back of the box, however, is superb, featuring a large number of alternative models: a toothy statue, a Pirate tree (think Wolfpack) with an Islander base, Kahuka's throne, a fire-breathing statue and a souped-up boat for the pirates. These, and many more, can be easily made because of the large diversity of pieces. The set has a huge number of minifigures for its size, the third highest number in the Pirate range (The SES and the BSB being first and second, respectively) - a whopping 7! 5 Islanders, including the all-too-common King Kahuka, the elusive Islander babe and 3 standard warriors - this set alone will never leave you short of enemies! 2 pirates, Ironhook in his standard attire with a scurvy dog at his side attack the island, although they are only moderately armed - 2 cutlasses and a pistol between them; a musket would've been nice. The Islanders, on the other hand, have 4 shields, a bow and quiver and 6 spears, not to mention the big pokey thing with horns on top (Weapon? Idol? Staff?). A monkey, parrot and crocodile provide the obvious creature features, with a fair amount of gold to finish off. In the instructions, the goblet does not have the lid, although it does on the box; it's a nice touch anyway - adding a little more diversity to the monotonous treasure stashes. The pirates' boat is a nice 2 sail vessel, with oars for when the wind stops and a treasure map. The sails are similar to those in Lagoon Lockup, but with an extra front sail. It's an awesome little boat, better for raids than a rowing boat, but not too big that it can't sail up rivers. It can comfortably fit 2 men and, at a squeeze, 5. The sails are expensive if you buy them seperately; normally this won't be a problem, but they can cost aroun $5 each. The Islanders' boat is a canoe with a sail and an outrigger to stabilise it. The sail is beautifully done, with 2 spars taughtening it. There is a clip for the rower to leave his weapon when at se and the mast can turn to get as much wind as possible. It's quite a top-heavy boat, but it doesn't look hideous and without the mast/sail it looks great. 3 Islanders can fit in it, and more if they sit on the outrigger. The markings on the canoe are stickers, but they look fine and are probably more robust than markings for their job. Furthermore, they're waterproof! *sing* Kahuka's throne can be carried by 2 loyal subjects... ...Or strapped to his pet crocodile! The clips on the side can be used to rest his weaponry, or hold spears for battle. The throne looks nice, although I'm not too sure about the blue against the red - I'd have prefered white as it would clash less... An overview of the island; it is built in 2 halves - left then right and then joined together loosley, so it can be seperated for transporting. Around the back to the left and right, there are large open spaces that are great for battles - this set isn't so much about a large solid build, but creating a "village" - smaller structures linked by bridges. And the back... To the far left is a platform built onto the rock, with access from the river via a ladder. There's the standard Islander drum with the lovely zebra-skin part (Where did they get that?!). I've never understood the white flag - I was under the impression it was used for surrender... Further along the rocky bank, there are some hinged palm leaves that swing upwards to reveal... ...The treasure! It's an OK hiding place; not the best place to hide it, right where the pirates sail past, but it feels fabulous; it fits right in. Above it on the rocky bank is the main structure. It looks very disjointed when you build it (bricks all over the place), but once it's done it looks nice and rural, with leaves everywhere and the "balcony" where Kahuka is standing. You get a nice roof made from 2 large palm leaves tilting down. Around the back there's a slight shelter, a table for picnics and a ladder to access the upstairs. I was rather annoyed that it is so open, but the set is designed from just one perspective... To the left is the bridge to the other building... A nice, one piece bridge made of the softer plastic used for muskets and the post-1991 cutlasses. It looks good, but be warned! It tilts when you pull a pin, sending the pirates flying! This contraption is a good idea, but it is very stiff and so doesn't swing, even when burdened by a minifigure - you'll want to modify this bit if you get it. The other building looks like it is made out of posts and beams. They are all red; brown would have been better, but it would have added too many colours to the range, just like the use of black for trees in some forestmen sets. There are 3 clips for spare weapons; only 2 of these will ever be used when all the Islanders are armed, but it gives the pirates scope once they've been disarmed...There's another nice palm tree roof on top. 2 ladders give access...there's a total of 4 in this set - worth getting, eh? Although they're 5p on Bricklink, for a KABOB, they're like gold! At the top there's another hidey hole; the palm leaves lift up on hinges to show the treasure or hiding Islander. It can be seen from behind, but this set is designed from one perspective only. Nice cattlehorns too...alongside the slats you can see in the floor - 5 years later and it would've been a solid plate... The big statue is one of the main selling point of this set, alongside the tilting bridge - they're the action features shown in every catalogue at the time, but it is not really special, just original. The statue fits in with the theme perfectly - Kahuka's mask, his shield and this statue all depict the same deity, which is a nice "collectible" idea. The back is rather plain, except the angled 1x1 bricks - a good touch. I'm not sure why there's a black brick in the back of the head, but this is easily remedied; it could even be done with a brick from this same set, just swapping the two over... Aside from the head turning, the back can open to store sacred objects, or, in my opinion, prisoners, hence the gaps for breathing. Either way, it's a lovely piece of architecture and deservedly a flagship element of the set. There's your standard cooking pot floating around, although a 1x1 yellow stud as human flesh (remember, minifigs are yellow, no matter what the licensed themes say!) is a superb finish. This set is a stunning set for both kids and AFOLs who are just getting back into Lego/Pirates - it is a great army builder and, due to its release as a Legend, is extremely cheap on eBay - you should be able to pick one up for £18, or £15 if you're lucky. For that you get a lifetime's supply of Islanders, 4 ladders, some wall panels, 2 baseplates (one raised and both with rivers and printed vegetation around the edge), a ton of weapons, a fair quantity of standard bricks, but most of all, a heap of vegetation: This is an easy to buy set, with normally around 5 on eBay at any time, and is well worth it, for the parts, the play and the nostalgia! It can be easily modified; when used in conjunction with any other outpost, a much larger fortress can be made, especially if more rope bridges are used. if you pick 2 of this fine set off eBay (It'll still be less than the original price!), a huge complex can be constructed, giving you an instantaneous village for around £35.

Excellent review! *y* Getting a better chance to look at this set actually makes me interested in it. I was in my dark ages throughout the Islander days, though I have built up a small force of them (10?) from eBay buys, but no actual sets. If this is really as reasonable as you say there, I may just have to pick one up soon. Oddly, I do own the baseplates to this set, having also picked them up in a lot on eBay, so I might be able to recreate it manually, but I think I'd rather pick one up whole. It looks like a great mix of parts and makes a decent looking display piece. Thanks again for the fine review! *y*	positive
Thanks for a lovely review! I only recently bought this set off Ebay (pretty good deal: MISB for 30 euro's!) and I enjoyed putting it together and mixing it with the other Piratesets. When you put two sets of two baseplates together you'll get a large pond with an island in the center, just to achieve that I bought two more baseplates off Ebay. The result is this MOC. I always loved the Islanders and have most of the sets, not all of them but that is going to change in the future. *y*	positive
Excellent review! I really like this set and so I gave it a 5/5. This set is on my list to get. I especially like the speedy pirate boat, and the also very fast outrigger canoe with a sail. I don't think a small number of these cannibals will make much of an impact on gaming though, even if they get a bonus with spears. Duke	positive
A mighty fine review you've created SlyOwl! *y* After some sleep I shall immerse myself more fully within it.	positive
Nice review ( although I'm pretty sure Eldorado Fortress has 8 minifigs, making this set no 4 in the minifig count.) I gave it a 5. The number of islanders and vegetation pieces comes in very handy for land based scenarios. I've got 3 copies of this set, 1 of them costing me less than 2Euro's from an ebay auction in Scotland. Along with Forbidden Island it's easily one of the most common and affordable pirate sets to be found on he second hand market.	positive
A great and informative review with very fine pictures, thanks SlyOwl! *sweet* A wonderful set this is indeed, full of nice details and pretty playable, and a cool subtheme that offers a lot of fantasy and charming characters in a marvelous layout. I really love that little boat with the outrigger, and the neat buildings and sweet landscaping works together very well. TLC got sued for using some names of native sounding origin? Now that sounds really strange to me.... such names´re widely spread within novels, movies and such stuff, I didn´t know that there´s some kind of copyright on them.... 8-|	positive
Good review, mr. SlyOwl! And good pics too! I know it probably deserves better but I only give him a 3. I'll be surely the only saying that I don't like this set but I remember I had it for christmas when I was a child and it disappointed me very much because I expected it much larger after seeing it in the LEGO catalogs. Well it's just a little trauma I had :-P LOL Anyway I must admit it's an interesant set, specially because of the large number of mini-figures and accesories it brings with and the two little "ships" Edited by BlueBard, 31 March 2008 - 01:13 AM.	positive
Excellent review of an outstanding set! I love the main image. I want this set so bad!	positive
Yay! Pictures! Thank you for the review. You made me actually consider looking it up on ebay, but I already have so so many things to get on my want list. Drat my easy ability to get sold on something lego!	positive
It's a great set and one I have yet to add to my collection despite my large number of Islander extras. Enchanted Island, aside from having so alluring a name was good value for money in that you only needed this one set and you had a good representation of the islanders both in the size of the set and the number of minifigs. The flipping rope bridge and the river give it a great rainforest retreat sort of feeling and one is inclined to think of this set as more inland than directly coastal for me. Whilst the Islanders were never seen in the same light or popularity as Pirates and Imperials they were an obvious and colourful addition that to me added a whole new depth to the Pirate system and one was now able to play a 3 or 4 way war adding a greater political element to the sets. Enchanted Island is probably the 3rd most appealing of the large land bases for me after Port Royal and Eldorado Fortress. Good review and glad to see the set recognised!	positive
SlyOwl, you're a legend! Thank you for taking the time to do such a comprehensive review. You've captured Enchanted Island in impeccable detail and anyone who doesn't own this set should know it inside-out by now. I shall write my thoughts on the set itself, directly.	positive
For some reason I never considered buying this set. But your review changed that. I'll try to get it on eBay. Thanks for your efforts to make this wonderful review for us. It's now added to our index.	positive
Wow, that is one great review you made Sly! I gave it a four, only thing i don't like is the raised baseplate. It does get you a lot of figs, two ships and some nice assecories, great set!	positive
Thanks for the review! I am getting very interested in the classic pirates sets, and I wat some now. This seems like it would be a great starter.	positive
I was just going into my dark ages when LEGO began the Islander themes, so I've never really cared for them. BUT this review actually made me want this set real bad. I guess this is what reviews are for then - good job on the review	positive
Hello Eldiano. Although the review is fine and you have memories related to that set please have in mind that the post you were replying to was in fact some 7 years old. This is what we call "bumping of old topics" and it shouldn't be done. You might want to take a look at our FAQ: Posting tips and etiquette Edited by Phred, 06 April 2015 - 03:47 AM. by Phred: Read next post please.	neutral
Eldiano, thank you for posting about your desire to have this set. I do own the set, and I do recommend it to others if they somehow find a used one. The bricks are kind of sparse, but the the bricks it does come with are really nice, I love the figs, and the base plates are by far my favorite made by TLG. Captain Braunsfeld, I suggest that you read through the link that covers topic bumping more clearly. I apologize for the confusion Eldiano. I do believe that I have found a way to remove the confusion of posting in old topics soon among the Pirate Staff and to the other members of EB, please stay tuned.

Fortunately I got this set on 2000 (not the released version, the original one). And I said "fortunately" because it's a lovely set. How could I rate it, but awesome? A little Islander "army", the islander girl, Ironhook and that cool boat with two sails, the jail-polynesian statue. I must recognize that I have a thing with the Islanders. I know that they are weird, poorly based on the polynesian aborigens, etc. But they are very original, broke with the traditional enemies, and gave to the Pirates theme an exotic and wild look.	positive
I realized that building the chess set from the new pirates theme, they are two grey heads that reminded me of the king kahuna throne, which goes to say that I am hoping they bring back new sets, I just wish they were bigger. I would love to build the old ones, but I would side more towards the newer model if they ever released them.	negative
What an amazing (old) set! I loved Pirates in my childhood, but that was before the Islander and Spanish stuff... mine were the BSB and soldier fortress with the big baseplate. As I'm now returning to Pirates, I've tracked down most of the 2009 sets and of course bought the new 2015 sets... but knowing I missed this "middle" period of Islanders vs Pirates makes me a bit sad... those Islanders are soooo "Monkey Island" (those of my age likely feel the same) to my eyes! Oh for a "Lemonhead" minfig... ;) I'm curious now how much this set sells for, given it was apparently one of very few Lego actually re-released! I recently bought a MISB BSB that was an early 2000's re-release, and it was very pricey... but then, I suspect the BSB has a LOT more of a nostalgic following these days than this set! Can anyone give me a rough idea what this set goes for in as-new condition these days? Regardless, a fantastic review with some great photos of the whole set and minifigs... even though this is an old thread, I am glad someone else bumped it recently so I can add my thoughts too. :) One thing I've noticed comparing the newest Pirates sets to the 80's ones I had as a kid (and these from the 90's) is the move away from baseplates and big "panel" pieces. I actually like that in a lot of ways; whilst I miss baseplates being included as they are a great starting point for creating new things (and make the sets easier to "play" with), visually, I think Lego-designed model sets look better without them.	positive
Judging from your pictures there seems to be many interesting torsos and new fleshy heads but I don't think this set is for me. Fueling my dismissal of this set is that i saw the trailer for this film at the cinema today and it looked pretty terrible! :-X Thanks for taking your time to review this set though ricecracker! ;-) Edited by casewindu, 29 March 2008 - 10:18 PM.	negative

Sorry to bump such an old thread, but I´ve just discovered this set is on sale at Amazon.de - for a mere 25 Euros. I am tempted. Not because I like the set or the models, but because of the parts. As most of you might know, I´m especially into Exo-Force. So would you recommend to get this set just for the parts? Are they a good choice to combine with EF-sets? Would anyone of you be interested in obtaining the fleshie-parts of the minifigs from me, as I totally don´t need those?	neutral
Well...... Thanks for your posting, but I couldn´t care less about fleshie minifigs or movie-accurate cars - or the cars at all. This set would really ONLY go into my parts bin. Therefore I need to know what parts are in there and if they are "cool" enough to go into an Exo-Force collectors parts bin.	neutral
An opportunity has come up to buy this set for 100 AUD. Just wondering whether people think it's worth buying? I've heard very little about the speed racer Legos	neutral

Ah, thanks sommuch again for that great review! *y* *sweet* Man, I am so happy they made this set. The new one seems too boring. ;-)	positive
I'm in the same situation as you; I have this set but missed out on the newer 8421. This was a great set for its time but the 8421 definitely looks better to me. I've been trying to find a good deal on it on ebay but it's pretty expensive, considering that it only went out of production last year. Quote Inlay: I wonder why TLG doesn’t make inlays anymore… They’re noisy and brake easily but are great for (pre-) sorting. The box designs in general are crappier these days than they used to be 10 years ago. You don't see the old "featured parts" trays anymore and the boxes don't have the different sections either (these also acted as internal supports for larger boxes, so they were less prone to being crushed). The cardboard material is also quite a bit thinner. I think it's a result of TLC's overall cost-cutting moves since then. Most people toss the boxes and probably don't care, but I keep all of them. There was actually a time when the boxes used to be even stronger. I have an old 8859 set and the outer box is made of a hard, styrofoam material, although they probably stopped using that for environmental reasons.

simonwillems, on Apr 7 2008, 12:01 AM, said: Somehow I competely missed your review when you first made it, I saw your pics on brickshelf and wondered about the review... You have managed to review my all time favourite technic set! yeah, somehow I wonderd why only VBBN (thanks!) responded... But I learned from *yoda*s sig: "Patience !! For a Jedi it is time to eat as well !! Eat, Eat !! Hot !! Good food !!" :-D simonwillems said: It was the first large Technic set I was given by my parents, when it first came out in 1995. I played for hours with this set, making minifig seats in it (it was so huge there was room for four minifigs to sit next to eachother in front....) I made various applications for it, a bungee-jump system with a large rubber band, and lots of containers to be lifted. The first changes I made included the inverting of the wheels and the disabling of one of the flashlight-steering wheels because they obstructed eachother. By the way, the nob for your winch is yellow instead of black (I know this set by heart, so watch out :-P ). I always liked those nobs. and people think you can't play / MOC with Technic (at all)...! X-D about the nob: erm yeah. I only found 3 black ones in the box and so I took the yellow one that I got as an extra with 8829. simonwillems said: The alternate model was great fun too, the pump is cleverly hidden and the crane folds up great between the cab and the loading platform. You could easily mod it with a pneumatic claw on the crane, a motor to turn it and a compressor. The only flaw was the loading platform which had no floor (only some axles). another reason for the 8460 as favorite set? It's got a "real" alternate model, not just a different erm- crane. simonwillems said: Thanks so much for reviving my memorie concerning this great set!

I got more than hundred boxes... and my 8848 box came with styrofoam too!	positive
Thanks for the review. *sweet* For it's size and parts count this is a remarkably featured set. I don't think I've never seen the alternate model before. Personally I prefer 8421 because I think it looks much better and I love the six wheel steering. I also love the three segment boom and the transmission; they fit it all in so neatly. I realise that it has trouble even holding up itself, but ultimately it doesn't matter as it's not like you are really going to construction work with it. What bothers me more about 8421 is the design change in the boom from chainlinks to strings. I would try to mod mine but all I have is the prototype picture to base it on... and I don't have enough links anyway! :-P BerndDasBrot, on Apr 7 2008, 07:29 AM, said: yeah, somehow I wonderd why only VBBN (thanks!) responded...

Somebody (I haven't got the time to look :-$) on Brickshelf has made a quite good alternate. Lego have been a bit inconsistant with alternate models lately. The recent tow truck had a good one; I even made both!	positive
Great review! While I admit I wasn't into Technic at the time this came out (I was a mere child, give me a break! :-D), I can see now why it was featured so much. From the booklets to display stands at toy stores and at my local LEGO center (when it was still around), this thing was everywhere! With your review, I can now truly appreciate all the details of the set. I got to admit, I can see the appeal now! That comparison shot you took is amazing. I love not only just how it included the little details such as the stabilizers, but also looks incredibly fun to play around with. Great set and an even greater review!	positive
thanks guys! @ sinner: i hope you refered to 8285 so my answer will match: 8285 is interesting: main model: american styled truck, alternate model: european styled truck. I don't think TLG produced many european styled truck. EDIT: I just found a wonderful MOC-alternate on brickshelf: 8436 by industrialdesigner. If I got him right, he designed a few offical technic sets for TLG. @ all: promises, promises, promises... hm. and again it's eBay that's blocking me. I want to foreshadow my next review (although it'll take some time to make it): I know, you know. But please act inconspicuous until you'll can act very astonished...!

Anger the Woman in charge and thou shall have no dinner. Great review, the sets looks good, and the retunr of the tent is something to be very happy about. And also, those giant camp-attacking ants look really great, they can be use as bugs in a ToD spike and bug room diorama.	positive

Can't wait to get this one (ANTS!!!) I don't have a tent either, so that'll be a great pickup. I'm surprised, though, that it includes the gold Exo-Force sword. I didn't expect this to come in any other sets besides the tower. <Faramir-<	positive

I was already thinking of buying this set, and you've totally convinced me. Thanks for the review, Alex Btw, I think they are ants, having that shape; moreover, we already have spider molds, and they have already been used in Theatre themes (see Spiderman ). LuxorV	positive
OK! I think, it''s a no-brainer that this is a must-have for pretty much anyone who likes LEGO! It's cheap and a great minifigs & parts pack! I'll be getting at least 1 of these! Here is what I like about it: 1. Great minifigs with nice torsos, sweet faces, and awesome hair! (Gotta ask 'em where they get it done! ) 2. Golden katana! 3. Chicken leg! YUM! 4. Nice campfire! And this is what I don't like about it: 1. Dark bley knife! Seriously, they could have at least made it silver like the sword, if not chrome! 2. Rehashed tent. 3. Spiders with 6 legs!!! I actually don't really care about the tent and the multi-legged creatures. Those go straight into the sorting boxes. Perhaps I might use the tent someday for a steampunk MOC of some kind, or a stop-motion film, or maybe some kind of contest... Anyway, what's up with that thing that holds the katana, the sword, and the saber? It's in the airplane set too! Is it perhaps one of the treasures of the new movie or is it something Indy takes with him everywhere in this film? 44However, nice pics, nice review! Thanks, dude!

I simply that tent! I guess I´ll have to buy three of these just to make a proper expedition MOC somewhen.... A great little set indeed, with marvelous new MF torsos and that new black feminine hairpiece´s also great and very useable for creating some characters related to the sixties and seventies. And finally a pan that´s not black and a knife in grey. That´s very handy indeed, the chrome one always looked a bit too shiny to me.... Thanks for that sweet review, alex!	positive
Thanks for that great review! This is a very interesting set filled with nice parts for customisation. Somemore, the price is not that steep. I will need to get ready for the second wave!	positive
Set ref: 7625 Name: River Chase Number of minifigs: 4 Number of pieces: unknown Price: 22,90€ A general view of the set: We’ve got an amphibious vehicle, a small boat, an observation post and a dark green croco (so beautiful! ). For the figs, we’ve got Indy of course, Marion and two Russian soldiers, nothing special here. In the back of the tree, there is a box, to put some things: The amphibious vehicle is very nice! The proportions are really great (not too big, not too small) and there are a lot of details everywhere, like the propeller: A back view: An inside view: The small boat is a dark grey Zodiac, but the details are nice too, giving it a retro look, in the same way of all the Indy vehicles: The outpost has a net to permit to the bad guys to capture some nice guys and girls… But it seems that the girl Marion is scared of the nice croco! So Indy comes and help her pushing the Technic axle with this round inversed tiles, which push out the net and capture the croco. Now Marion feels happier! And she takes a can of oil and whacks the poor croco, without defences! Who has said Marion is a nice girl? So, I’ve bought this set like an add on to my city. In fact, the elements of this set can easily be integrated in a town layout. I plan to use the outpost for my forest section, and the amphibious vehicle is always a nice touch of originality in a layout. Yes you can use all those military things without creating an army in a layout: just put the violent parts out, and you’ve got nice things, like a biologist car in the case of the amphibious vehicle!	positive
Great set, i'll definitely get it. Is there any sign of flesh on the soldiers, like at the collars?	positive
Nice review, I like what I'm seeing in this set. I liked the little comic, Marion should be arrested though	positive

Without the gun, that vehicle is a nice little amphibious car with a tent (I assume) strapped to it, some tools, a spare tire... The little tree hut is quite cool, and a nice touch with the box in behind there. I love the design for those gasoline cans too. Thanks again, Alex! You're lucky to be getting these sets! ~Peace	positive
Thanks for the review! I really like this little-ish set, quite alot of detail, it reminds me of sets from the late 90's More Soviets are always welcome too, and the new torso for Marion is nice, as is the new dark green alligator All of the neat little accesories are great too, a cup, shovel, binoculars and of course the cans of gasoline Again, thanks for the review, alex	positive

A very fine review of a really great set, thanks alex! This set has everything, a croc, very nice MFs, a neat tree trap, a cool zodiac and a marvelous and very detailed amphibious car in a beautiful color scheme. The only thing I´m not colpletely sure is the design of that jerrycan (thanks for the right word and the interesting link, Kingboy ). Although the use of the revolver´s pretty clever indeed and fits well too, it´s still clearly, well, a revolver.... very unusual and interesting for an official TLC design.	positive
Just like 7626 this is a must buy in my opinion. I just the amphibious vehicle,very nice for army building.	positive
This set looks good. About the jerry cans, I like how they give me more pistols. This may be the only Indy set I get from this batch. I'll just have to deal with the fleshie heads... (Exchange them for yellow.) Like Stealth Hunter said. This will be good for army building. Silent Help	positive

This is a great set!!!!!! It is probably my favourite Indy so so far! Great reveiw! Although the set is great the price is greater have to get it on sale..	positive
Wow in the protype pics I kept thinking this thing looked lame; a boat on treads with saw blades? But this is definetly something I want now. lots of great plant and animal parts. And looks like plenty of wheels with those treads; its just begging to be made into a propor tank.	positive
This one is my favorite from the bunch. Thanks for the time spent in making a review	positive
Thanks for this fantastic review, Alex! Those trees are a neat add on to any jungle, as is that sweet cave. But the main part of this set, the Jungle Cutter, man, that is wicked! Packed with that awesome dark green and with those wonderful treads, not to mention the smoothly spinning buzz saws. However, this set's a tad overpriced in my opinion, and looking through the instructions they have that crazy colour syndrome again, using blue, yellow and red parts in the internal build. Still, thanks for this sweet review with neat pics! *thumbup* ~Peace	neutral

Here's a review of the second largest set in the Dragon Masters subtheme for castle month, Dark Dragon's Den! Figs: The set comes with 3 Dragon knights, two of which have the dragon wings on their helmets(Sad thing is, one of my knights was missing the left wing on the helmet). There are also the definitive dragon, Wiz the wizard (or Majisto if you prefer)two horses, and a hawk( try to find him in each picture!) The set: there's a large spot under the mountain for the dragon to guard the treasure chest. The chest has 2 red and green 1x1 circles in it. Another gate in the back, along with a door for knights. The right side of the mountain has a ladder and a removable rock face. The left side has some stairs leading up to the top. I love this tree design. simple yet effective. A shot of the top- Hey, what are you doing?!? NO!! Throw him in the dungeon! Overall: This set when first released in 1993 was priced at $43USD, although that might just be because of the Juniorised pieces (6 BURPs!). It's a fun set that provides excellent playability. If you can find it at a $20-$30 price point, pick it up. Overall grade: 8/10 Edited by KimT, 10 August 2008 - 01:33 PM.	positive
Thanks every much for the review! I remember having this set, and making really terrible stop-motion movies with it. Very playable. This brings back lot's of fond memories! Thanks! Majisto ON!	positive
Ah, the wonderful Dragon Knight (Or was it Dragon Masters?) sets. I personally preferred the Black Knights, but these guys still had some awesome sets! Thanks for this review, this looks like a neat little set, although those modern stairs look a little out of place. That tree design is indeed a neat one, I remember having that in one dark Forestmen set I got. The interior sure is roomy. May I suggest for future review you photograph the set on a cleared table, that way you won't get distracted by the clutter in the background and can focus on the main part of the image, the set. ~Peace	neutral
This is probably one of my favourite sets and/or one of the sets which I wish I owned..the 90's was probably my favourite castle era! tobad I was to young to buy this set when it came out Man I wish I had one of those dragons, they were one of the best type I reckon although all the dragon's are good thanks for the reveiw Edited by hollisbrick, 16 April 2008 - 07:41 AM.	positive
Yay, go Dragon Masters! I have to agree with iamded, I do like the Black Knights sets better for their design ( betrayal! ), however, the Dragon Knights are just awesome, 'cause they have dragons! This is a nice set, with some awesome minifigs and a nice overall design. I wish I had it... Go Masters!	positive
Agent Rick: You're definately the Dragon Master around these parts. What a great little set. I really like the classic dragon which reminds me of a similar style used for the Lego crocodiles. And the dungeon is pretty slick too. I like the use of the large gates plus the doors. Plus the set contains the blue wizard. Awesome! Great review.	positive
Great Classic Dragon Den! I love the old green dragons very much! There were my fave. I love these theme very much after the Black Knights era. This is a very very good set! I wished i can have this too.	positive
A very neat set with charming MFs and a great classic dragon, a good use of BURPs and a really nice tree indeed. Thanks for the review, AgentRick57!	positive
the wizard somehow "controls" the dragons i think, like, for example the wizard of the new castle line does with the undead skeletons. but i think it isn't sure that the dragon master's wizard is evil. as it is still unclear which factions of the older castle series are "good" or "bad".	neutral
phoinix, on 16 April 2008 - 09:06 PM, said: this was the last castle set i got before my dark age.. really liked it although the big rock parts looked really bad ( i am kind of used to them now) unfortunately i lost the little wand.. and i never understood who is "good" and who is "bad" does the wizard own the dragon? well they dont seem to be enemies but isnt the dragon supposed to be evil?? I always liked the BURPs, I don't know why. Maybe because they were dark grey and dark grey pieces seemed a bit hard to come by at the time. I always assumed that the dragon was, sort of, the mascot of the Dragon Masters. The wizard was there to keep him under control so he wouldn't turn on them. I always figured that the wizard was working with the Dragon Master King, and they were fighting against the Royal Knights (the dudes with the lion faces on their torsos), or whatever they were called. I like this set a lot. I think the castle theme declined after the Dragon Masters and Royal Knights themes were discontinued. The new knights never really took the cake. It's funny, but it seems, to me anyways, that when the Lego Minifigs lost their regular smile/smirk faces (whether they were masked by a beard or not), that's when Lego began to decline...a bit. The Dragon Masters had their vicious faces and all, but they still had that smile/smirk underneath their rough exteriors. The new knights look a little...less confident.	positive
I own this set and I think its a great for a smaller fortress building. There is a good selection of mini figs, the BURPS do detract somewhat from the set, but they do make it feel as if its in a large cave. The cloth flags that are included are really nice and mine have lasted a long time.	positive
The 8291 Dirt Bike comes from a long line of Technic bikes, and I think it's the best ever. It looks great, and it's fun to ride around in the house. I hoped to find a figure the right size for it, but none of mine would fit. Unlike a lot of Technic models, it looks good from all angles. Considering the size of the model it has a complicated way of connecting the engine to the wheel. The rear shocks are just the right stiffness... ...and they have a good amount of travel. I thought these shocks were new. I need to get out more... Functions: Shocks: Two front, one stiffer one in the rear. Drivetrain: 2 piston engine linked to the rear wheel via gears and a chainlink. Steering: Yes it does... Stand: Retractable. For the price, size and subject, what else could be added? 10/10 Parts: Considering that it has three shocks and a 40 chainlinks it's a great set for parts. Some hard to use large parts are included, but they are not overused. The usage of the green does limit part usage somewhat though, and I'll be struggling to find a use for those wheels for anything other than a motorbike. 8/10 Price: At $39.99 AUD for 248 parts it isn't the best value set. The US price is $25.00 which is somewhat better. It does have some more complicated parts however. 7/10 Looks: Lego seems to be moving away from the see-though look for Technic sets and this is a good example of it. I'm not a big fan of fairings but I think they work great in this set as a fuel tank. 8/10 Fudge: This set was great for me as I have never had a Technic bike. However for those that want this for just parts or have other bikes it could be a hard sell. The alternate model (a chopper) is a complete rebuild (which I didn't make), and it's great that Lego have been including these most of the time lately. 7/10 Overall: Recommended. 8/10	positive
I saw this set at my TRU for only $20.00. Now I might go get it! Thanks sinner for another nice review! Quote hoped to find a figure the right size for it, but none of mine would fit.

Thanks for taking the time and effort to review it for us. I'm not really interested in the set, but wanted to support my buddy since I know how much work you put into these.

Thus the set is probably the way it is as it's the gear that fit best.	neutral
How did I manage to miss this review? I must have overlooked it somehow... Thanks for making this one Sinner, it's always nice to see reviews of Technic sets. I'm not so sure whether I like this set, I am not that much into motorbikes, but Lego did a good job on this one. It looks a lot like an upgraded version of one of the first bikes Lego made, namely the 8838 Shock Cycle. I also believe the back gearwheel is somewhat oversized, it looks better with the smaller one you attached. It is good to see that Lego is back to making the Technic sets the way they were (except for the green, that is )	neutral

I wasn't very interested in this set at first. It seemed to be just a nice looking truck with a small motor... but when I found out it had a transmission I changed my mind! Here is the transmission. It allows the single motor to be used for two functions. This system has been around for a while, and Lego seem to be using it more and more. The Transmission Driving Ring alone (the red circle) goes for $5-15 USD on BrickLink, and you also need the Catch and Clutch Gear so I have been buying sets that have them instead. I now have enough parts to make a Supercar gearbox. (I bet a new supercar comes out next year now...) This is the gear that rotates the arm. Note the colour of the 24 tooth gear; it seems to be a new gear trend. A lot of work has been put into this truck looking real. Personally I think they went too far as the truck seems to have been designed for a tilting cab, but it's disabled to prevent breaking the front. Bottom of the transmission. The bottom shaft lifts the arm. Note that there are more dark grey gears. The motor fits in very well also. The bottom of the arm. I was surprised by the usage of a 12 Tooth Bevel to link with the 36 Tooth Double Bevel as I had never seen that done before. As you can see there is no room for any drive train. Standard steering for a recent technic truck. There is a hand-of-god at the cab top that links via two Knob Wheels. It looks good from the back. You can also see the white Clutch that connects the transmission to the motor to avoid burnouts. It goes decently high, and can go a bit higher if you use the crane arm. Compared to last years fire truck. (If I didn't buy the fire truck for half price I would have been annoyed that Lego brought out what is almost a motorised version of the same set.) Functions: Cherry Picker Arm: Motorised rotate and lift that links to a motor via a transmission and anti-burnout clutch. Steering: Rack and pinion controlled via a hand-of-god linked by Knob Wheels Doors: Open and close. Good functionality that works well, but I wish they made the cab lift and I'm a bit sick of the lame fairing door trick. 7/10 Parts: Motor, battery box, transmission, clutch, practical wheels, only two fairings, compact turntable... this is a great parts set. 10/10 Price: At $99.99 AUD for 726 parts it's OK value when you consider what you are getting. The US price is $60.00 which is better, but still not great. I bought mine for $80 AUD which was good however, and I suspect that the price is designed for easy sale...8/10 Looks: I'd buy this for the looks alone! 9/10 Fudge: The functions work well and I llked it more than I thought I would. Oddly mine seemed to be missing a Axle Pin with Friction, but since it includes extra parts for the alternate model I didn't mind using one of my spares. On the subject of the alternate model, it is a dump truck which is made out to be a total re-build, but it isn't. It could have easily been done like Super Street Sensation was, but Lego have probably determined that instructions like that confuse people. 8/10 Overall: Recommended. 8/10	positive

Thanks for the review! I think I am going to get this set for it's many technic pieces. I could really use those for a rig I'm going to build.	neutral
Looks like an interesting set. I didn't realize the motor controlled two functions through a transmission switch. That's always good to see. I'll probably pass it up though until the price falls a bit. The overall design is a bit too studless for my liking (I think the 8275 bulldozer has a much better balance of studded and studless pieces), and the wheels somehow look too small to me. I also have something of a backlog at the moment; I still need to pick up that bulldozer along with the 8421 mobile crane (on ebay).	neutral

Set: 7627 - Indiana Jones - Temple of the Crystal Skull Pieces: 929 Price: $AUD149.99 Out of all the Indy 4 sets, this one seems to cop the most flak - which may account for the fact that the other 3 were reviewed weeks ago and this one has sat, unloved and alone, waiting for someone to turn their eye upon it (or, y'know, buy it). Luckily I'm a sucker for spooky old temples, filled with devilish traps and hidden treasures, hissing fountains and overgrown foliage, creepy skeletons and crumbling stonework, so here it is: Indiana Jones 7627, Temple of the Crystal Skull. Part 1: The Figs First off, the figs - 6 humans and 4 skellies (or should that be skullies? ) Indy, Mutt, Irina, and that sneery Russian guy that's in the 2 smaller sets. Nothing new here. Aha! What have we here - two natives. I wonder if hair is a sign of power in this culture, since one guy is completely bald and the other one has the most extraordinarily luxurious black mullet. Somehow I doubt the movie will answer this question. Back view - as you can see, the scalp tattoos are also popular in this tribe. Fashion conscious! (Note in the background the paws of the fearsome black jungle panther, ie my cat, curious as to see what the tribe was up to.) Also, don't ask me why these guys are carrying axes rather than, say, spears. And what everyone's been waiting for, the skullies - three of 'em and a conquistador skellie - very cute. Note the backs of the crystal head have a plume-sized hole - or maybe that's just where they injected the blue brain-plastic. Spooky! I love these skulls, I wasn't sold from the initial pics but they have a very creepy smile and the head shape is just... weird. With the large eyes, it's kind of Homer Simpson-esque. And here we have the token vehicle in the set - a weird little tank thing with treads. Kind of looks like a cross between the amphibious boat and a mini-tank. I'm sure there's a military expert around here who can tell us exactly what it is supposed to be. The treads are nice, but the rest of it is a bit thrown together. You can tell they wanted to keep the dark green colour scheme but the budget only allowed them 5 parts to do so . All in all, a mixed bag with the figs. 4 repeats from the cheaper sets which means we have one new native figure and the crystal skullies. There are heaps of the old-skool skele heads scattered around the sets so those that prefer can replace the skullies with ordinary skellies. Bizarrely, the top of the box which has the line of 1:1 figs pic (you know what I mean) doesn't have names for any of the characters, whereas all the smaller sets do. Part 2: Box, Parts Front of box: Back of box: Two instruction books: Parts. This set has come under criticism for being overpriced - myself included - but the official piece count is 900 plus, which is pretty good considering it also contains the baseplate. 6 big bags and 2 of those 12x12 bricks in dark tan. (Note: set does not contain live Black Jungle Panther™) The DSS, helpfully comes pre-scrunched thanks to TLC. Even in a $AUD150 set they can't get that right... sigh. The dark tan baseplate. Say what you like, I'm in love. I know some people don't like these, but they were such a staple of Castle/ Pirates for so many years that I don't consider them a juniorised piece at all. This one, recycled from the 05 Police HQ and 06 Hospital, is much better in design than the King Leo's Castle one as the different heights and asymmetry make it look much more like a natural piece of ground. Perfect for MOCs. And it's dark tan - how could anyone not love such a huge slab of dark tan? Note this love doesn't extend to applying the stonework stickers which are, frankly, crap. Random instructions page: Part 3: Temple of Doom - or just a doomed temple? The complete set, front view. Isometricish view: Back view: Top view: First impressions? It's very dark tan, isn't it? And green. And bright green. And dark green. And dark red. And normal tan. And dark bley. And pearl gold! In fact, it's a bit of a mish-mash of colours. I'm of two minds about this. I kind of prefer the palette to be a bit subtler, but I can see that a playset designed for kids isn't going to sell bucketloads all tastefully done in shades of tan with lashings of dark-green foliage. There's a huge amount of dark red in this set, which is always a welcome colour, but I'm not convinced it quite works with the 2 shades of tan on offer here. On the plus side, there's also a huge amount of dark tan in ordinary 2x2 bricks, tiles, plates and 1x1 and 1x2x3 slopes, which is great for anyone wanting to stock up. Let's take a closer look. I'll do this roughly in order of the build itself: a) The big scary face. This is a simple, fun build and very effective at projecting menace at the temple entrance. It actually detaches very easily from the temple (as pictured on the box art) to allow easier access to the inside. The eyes are flick-fire missiles, with Scary Face's hair conveniently providing ammo refills should you run out. All in all, from me. (b) The Back Spin the skelly head and stone steps appear - we haven't seen this feature in a while. Nice to get these pieces in dark bley. A conquistador hides under the stairs - this is a bit useless as the stairs can't fully extend while he's there . Moving right... a trapdoor - what could possibly be behind it??!!??!!? Answer: not much, really. A little red stair. I really like these 2 stickers though - very intricate. The staircase leads to what I like to think of as the Crystal Skull Transmogrification Chamber. Now, I know nothing about the movie except that it's supposed to be have a kind of 50s B-movie plot rumoured to feature (look away, spoiler-haters)..... aliens. These weird, creepy gold chairs look made from the bones of aliens if you ask me, with their strange vertebrae and silver claws. It wouldn't surprise me if bringing these aliens back to life was part of the plot of the movie... hence the crystal skull? I guess we'll find out May 22. In any case, transforming aliens clearly like a disco whirl as when you pull the handle, the whole of this assembly spins giddily around. A very clever and simple trick - it's basically just a wheel under the platform but the effect is great. Also under here is a bottomless pit (stickered)... I would very much expect a villian to be thrown down it at some point. "So, do you come here often?" "I don't know who designed this club. These chairs are REALLY uncomfortable." NB. I am really, really over those pearl gold 1x2 roof corner slopes which started popping up in the 2006 Castle range, infected Exo-Force and have now spread here. Can we please have these in a different colour? Or a different pearl gold piece? Pretty please? ( c) Left tower (looking from the front) A small tower with a trans clear gem. (d) Right tower Waterfall with booby trap. I like the sticker, it's very cartoony, which fits with the set somehow. When you turn the wheel, flick fire missiles spray out and hit whoever is on the stairs. Both towers have a trap where if you move the skull, another one pops out from the dragon mouth. (e) Central turret thing This thing is kind of annoying and doesn't really sit or work well. It's kind of like a laser beam sending messages to space, I guess. As the central dome rises, the two plates peel away. I find it is a little bit tight to work smoothly and the two plates doesn't really sit well together at the top. Maybe I just need to rebuild it. I'm sure this will also be explained in the movie. (f) Final trap - the stair that isn't there The final trap is at the front - as Indy goes down the staircase, you can push the red heads and all the 1x8 bley bricks come tumbling down. Simple and works well. (g) Alternate view Here's how it looks as pictured on the box with the head removed. As you can see, this allows better access to the centre of the temple. As you can see, sadly there is nothing actually interesting there except a staircase to the turret and 2 dark tan slopes which are just stuck there and look a little out of place. I mean, come on, everything else has a splash of dark red and gold! Your Destination: Nowhere! Part 4: In Conclusion So after all those endless pics, what about the set itself? CONS:As a playset, 7627 doesn't quite make sense. Admittedly, the traps that are there are well-designed and unobtrusive. On the other hand, there's a great big whopping entrance at the front - but I wasn't sure if the figs are supposed to sneak in through the backdoor and go up the spiral staircase and past the waterfall (as shown in the box art) or if they were meant to end up in the golden skull room. The middle area doesn't really connect with anything, nor does the giant space turret. It may be that some of these questions are answered in the film, but whereas with 7624, 7625 and 7626 I could at least picture a story myself (eg with River Chase is fairly obvious what's happening - a chase down a river with a croc and a communist staking them out)!, the Temple set is a little all over the place. The design feels a little off to me - not really bad but not really great either. PROS: On the plus side, the natives and crystal skulls themselves are great. At 900+ pieces, this is also a great parts pack for dark tan, dark red, plant pieces, gold oddments etc. I especially love the baseplate in that shade. I like the overall shape of the temple - a big staircase with secret nooks and crannies. The build is reasonably interesting and there are some clever tricks with the traps. But upon reflection I shouldn't have to sell this set - it should be able to sell itself! As I said before, I'm a huge fan of dark, mysterious old temples so for that I have to give it some love. It reminds me of the big old Adventurers sets and the whiff of nostalgia is itself a powerful intoxicant. However, for the price Lego is selling it in Australia/ Europe/ Canada I couldn't recommend it as a must-buy for full price when the smaller sets in this series are themselves so good.

The figs look great! The natives and the skeleton conquistador are my favorite figures in the set. The set itself is very good. The interior sort of reminds me of an older style lego set for some reason. It could be just me, but it has a classic feel. This will a great set to add to my list! Great review!

Thanks, svelte_corps. I was really hoping that the conquistador helmet would end up being silver in the final set, but I suppose it's good to know that the helmet is being porduced again anyway. And is the armour the skellie is wearing pearl gold? Thanks again, I look forward to the rest of the review EDIT: The dark tan baseplate is in fact very nice Although the fact that you have to put stickers on it is a real downer.

Thanks for the great review, svelte_corps. I've been wanting to see this set in detail since it debuted at the conventions. I have to say that, on the one hand, I agree that the minifigures, the crystal skulls, and the colors are great (I even like the waterfall), but, on the other, I kind of think that the set itself is a disappointment. It looks like they tried to accommodate design and playability needs, but really didn't come through on either. So, as you pointed out, the mid section doesn't really fit in with the other parts, and the trap sequence doesn't really flow, either. But, perhaps your right, and all will be answered in the film. I was surprised at just how empty the temple looked in the photo taken from above. They really should have gone the extra mile and made the temple look more like a temple, and not worry so much about the action features. Eh, but so it goes. But, I, too, am a sucker for tombs and temples, so I won't be able to pass it up. Archaeology on!	negative
Thanks svelte_corps for the great review, if it's out in Aussie then it should hopefully be reaching NZ soon. I can't wait! This looks like a great set, for me at least. I too am a great fan of spooky old temples, they are such fun. I love the look of the base plate, but the stickers don't look all that great. I wish they printed it like they always used too. I have to get this set. And the other ones too. Thanks again, you have brightened this sad day.	positive
Outstanding review! Your efforts have totally convinced me to get this set no matter what! It really looks very great and funz reading that review. I will be looking forward to the new addition of those mini-figs. Just love the layout of this temple. A great addition indeed	positive
I was going to review this on Monday but my camera ran out of batteries! Anyways, great review! As I have the set built, it's a really fantastic set. The waterfall is a reall cool sticker, and the flick fire missiles are quite interesting. Another point of interest: There are seven of the new flick fire missiles overall, if anyone cares.	positive

Great review! Now I'm really truly convinced that I'm gonna buy this set. My faith was a little wobbly, but its benn restored Anyway, I just wanted to point out that the temple's entrance might actually be the turret thing. If you watch the teaser, there are some very similair stone pillars surrounded by sand (there are 4 not 2 though ) and when they close up it looks like all our characters are sucked into the sand and magically appear underground going through some stone plates(which act like steps to go down) that dissapear. So, in theory those steps beneath the turret are actualy the entrance, and I'm asumming from this picture That the steps with 1x8 bricks with the dragon heads at the end lead us of somewhere else. All in all this temple looks like a mixed up version of the real temple, which is fine by me (SIDENOTE: I'm not sure but based on minifig inclusion, either Lego was cheap or Colonel Dovchenko is dead by the time Irina and her goons reach the temple, I'll wait till I see the movie. ) Edited by Belloq, 02 May 2008 - 02:14 AM.	positive

Thanks for this review! You have reviewed my most favourite town set of all times, I am so happy to own this one. I actually is a story to go along with it: In the summer of 1998 I went on holiday with my parents to the country of Luxembourg, in the city of Wiltz we encountered a small toystore which still had this set for sale, (9 years after the release!). I did not had the sufficient amount of money to buy the set and had to leave it at the store, I was practically in tears... Four years later we passed through Luxembourg and I remembered the city and the store. We made a detour and stopped by the same store. Every other old set was sold, the only one remaining was this one! I bought it immediately and treasured it ever since. I use the baseplates a lot in my cities, they serve well as roads with parking spaces next to them. This was the first set I owned which had the huge 6x24 plates in them, I remember my surprise when seeing plates of such enourmous lenght... I recently made an entire racetrack together with this set and to promote myself I will place a link HERE	positive
metalandi Thanks for this wonderful lovely review. I enjoyed myself very much when I am looking through at the lovely pictures. I must admit, this is what I called a "real classic" race prix I miss those cute sweet little race cars which is able to contain a mini-fig. Furthermore, this set offers 4 race cars and 13 mini-figures In addition, if town collectors remember, the car number tiles are printed instead of using stickers. This is the other set I owned, which holds the similarity above. 6381: Motor Speedway Overall, great review! simonwillems, on May 9 2008, 02:20 AM, said: I recently made an entire racetrack together with this set and to promote myself I will place a link HERE I saw your entire racetrack.

I can remember when I saw this set in LEGO catalogues, looking at it, dreamin to have it.... like so many other sets... And this one is still a dream... I really like the design of this set, it looks really complete, with some nice details. There are no lost place. The strairs withe the foot bridge add a lot to it IMO.

WARNING! This reply may contain several minor movie spoilers. If you haven't yet seen the movie and want it to be a complete surprise, do not read. Batbrick, on May 10 2008, 06:05 AM, said: But it is Cruncher Block, his lady Driver Taejo that really shine. Look at those awesome suits! The cool faces! Taejo has a ripped shirt! I was originally skepitcal about the driver figure—I like the head, but I was trying to figure out why they put in a female minifig with no hairpiece. After having seen the movie, I now understand why; Cruncher's driver is a fairly manly looking woman, and most of the LEGO hairpeices would make the minifig look too girly for the character. :) Now that I know why Taejo's shirt is ripped up I don't mind the bits of fleshie color that are printed on it, but I do wish they would make some of the new torsos a little more head-colour agnostic...there's no real reason why Cruncher and his driver couldn't have had ties that came all the way up to their necks instead of having those little wedges of flesh showing through loose collars. Yeah, they are low-level mafioso type scum, but they aren't complete slobs. Batbrick, on May 10 2008, 06:05 AM, said: Front view, the new windshields are fantastic: They are indeed very nice, it's the main reason I started looking at the Speed Racer sets in the first place. Batbrick, on May 10 2008, 06:05 AM, said: While a very cool car, it is rather silly of TLC to give us the exact same one we got in the smaller set. I didn't get the smaller set with this car, so I'm still happy, but it is a bad marketing move: I think the error they made was in the smaller set though. In the movie, the only time we see Cruncher's semi is when he's being chased by Racer X. Racer X and Taejo do end up on the same team for a cross country rally race (along with Speed of course), so I guess that's where they were going by putting those two together in the smaller set, but it would have been much more interesting for them to have made up a set with Taejo and one of the cars from the very goofy, comic book-gimmicky teams they are racing against. Especially since one of the teams (that is chasing Taejo specifically) is a bunch of Army-wannabee loonies—I'm sure more people would have loved some sort of dark/sand green racer with one of the IJ Soviets at the wheel than another Racer X. To summarize: Two Racer X's is bad, but it is the smaller set that should have been changed (imho). Batbrick, on May 10 2008, 06:05 AM, said: Annoyingly enough, this part opens up to shoot a pointless rubber projectile: Thus blowing the front part open and launching it.....well, not far really As much as I normally don't like the stupid techic launcher thing, and would rather not see it in a set ever again (although one of these days I will make a giant multi-launcer rig out of them just for fun), at least there is a reason for it to be in this set, as Cruncher's semi has a missile launcher in the front end of it in the movie. I think you're supposed to lift the panel that hides the missile before launching it, similar to the way that panels slide out of the way on the semi cab to allow for firing in the movie. Batbrick, on May 10 2008, 06:05 AM, said: And now for the most disappointing part - step three, the trailer: That's right, almost the entire thing is open, even the "filled in" side has holes! I'd certainly be cared to be back there, one bumpy hill and back you go I'm gonna chock this up to the standard LEGO philosophy of "playset" rather than "model" design for a lot of things. The semi rig and Raver X's car are the models, the trailer is the playset. Seeing as how the trailer is Cruncher's mobile office (rather finely appointed with lots of paintings and his pirahna "babies" in their tank behind his desk), and the intent seems more or less to have a playest bit in order for kids to re-enact the scene from the movie, I'm not going to give them too much grief over this. They tried to capture the basic bits of the movie set (which we see mostly from the inside during the movie) and translate it into a playset type environment. That being said, I do wish the back walls were more solid, as I see no reason for there to be gaps in the back wall when the front wall (or the "fourth wall" as the case may be here) is already conspicously absent. Batbrick, on May 10 2008, 06:05 AM, said: There are some pluses too though, like the ridiculously awesome minifig paintings I'll be using for Wayne Manor. Also note the "control" on Cruncher's desk that when turned, turns the gun at the bottom. It's an alright feature: Could have been a little better, but it's such a minor bit of this scene in the movie that I can see why they didn't spend too much time and effort on it. It would have been nice to have more paintings though, had the back wall been more complete (and I like your idea of how to use them :) ). Batbrick, on May 10 2008, 06:05 AM, said: And though I'm not a massive fan of stickers, this is just too cool. The little aquarium is very simple but very clever, using a printed piece between two clear windows to create the illusion of a tank: Definately a feature which is not showcased nearly well enough on the box art. Since it is one of the major features of this set in the movie, it's nice to see it translate rather well into brick. Batbrick, on May 10 2008, 06:05 AM, said: Design: 2/5 - Pretty poor considering the best part is available in a cheaper set, and only the front part of the truck looks cool, but still not truly awful. That may be a bit harsh (but not much) given what I've said further up this post, but it probably only deserves a 3 at best, so I'm not realy going to quibble the point. :) I still think that Racer X should be exclusive to this set and a different car should be in the smaller set with Taejo, which would have improved the cachet for this set overall. Batbrick, on May 10 2008, 06:05 AM, said: Price: 2/5 - Overpriced easily, but Rogue Shadow is worse! True...this should have ideally been about a $30 set (especially given the general awesomeness of the IJ Race for the Stolen Treasure set), unless they made the trailer a bit more detailed (better back wall, perhaps some drop down gun ports like in the movie) or at put least one (or more) of Cruncher's goons in the set, then maybe I could agree more with the msrp. On that note: if I remember correctly from my visit to my local TRU yesterday in search of the new IJ sets (since local Targets seem determined not to get them in stock yet), they had this set on sale for around $35 along with an offer for a coupon good for $7.50 towards the purchase of a ticket to the movie with any Speed Racer toy purchase over $25. I may be wrong on the sale price, but I know the ticket offer was there. So, if you haven't seen the movie yet, and are interested in this set, TRU may be the place to go right now to get both at a slightly cheaper price. Batbrick, on May 10 2008, 06:05 AM, said: Fun: 4/5 - The mere concept of such an open truck kept me playing with this baby for hours! So you did enjoy the playest aspect of the trailer, even though you didn't care for the design...looks like they didn't do too badly then on what they wanted out of that bit. :) Batbrick, on May 10 2008, 06:05 AM, said: Overall I'm really glad I bought it as the minifigs are fantastic and the paintings and fish tank are cool. It's fun, stupid and downright ridiculous, but while not a great set by any means, certainly isn't as bad in the brick as it looks in photos. I was actually thinking about going and getting this set now that I've seen the movie and I understand what the heck is going on here more. Your review has definately added an additional impetus to that notion. My pocketbook (does not) thank you!	neutral
Batbrick thanks for the sweet review. You give me great insights into this set. Hehe, I agreed that Racer X is nice, but I believe we can get it in the other set for a much lower price. For me, the trailer which does not have a cover is bugging me alot. That's why, I holding my reservations against this set. At most, I will consider the other 2 smaller sets for collection purpose. Nevertheless, Batbrick great job	negative
Thanks for the great review! It seems like the most awesome part of the set is the sticker sheet, which is a reversal of the usual situation!	positive
I really like this set: My favorite parts are the minifigs and X's car. VROOOM!	positive
Hi all Newly arrived today, don't you just love Shop at Home. Thought I'd give it a quick review. See more details over at my site. The Tumbler: Joker's Ice Cream Suprise	neutral

Good review.I think the sets amazing!	positive
The Batman minifig have a detailed and cool torso. Thanks for the review brickbitz. Edited by darkrebellion, 16 May 2008 - 07:31 PM.	positive
Nice review, brickbitz. I actually think this kit is really very nice for the size. True, you only get three figures, but it seems that's a norm in most batman sets. Besides, everything else is great. The tumbler looks like an amazing build - they really nailed this tank of a ride. And the Ice cream truck... Plus, this set does seem to have some neat pieces in it (trans green popsicles and lime hubcaps, anyone?). I think this far beats the rest of the batman lineup this year, which seems quite disapointing overall. Edited by Grevious, 16 May 2008 - 08:12 PM.	positive
It's on the way! And also the buggy!	positive
Great review, as always! Although I know you don't take many pictures in your reviews(IMHO, ) but can we see a little more about the Tumbler? Is that little windshield down near the bottom front a third seat? What is in the framework of the back, behind the cockpit? I know there's a blunt shooter and flick fire missiles, but is it all framework?	neutral
Nice review I really can't believe that it is out already! I love that new Batman suit and the tumbler have they made the posicles before? This is sure a must have!	positive
A nice review of an interesting set, thanks brickbitz. A great new Batman, a funny ice cream truck and a pretty detailed Tumbler. And although I wish that vehicle would be just a bit smaller I almost wonder that it´s not even bigger, compared to TLC´s other Batvehicles.... And well, the interior could be better too....	positive
brickbitz, on May 16 2008, 11:41 PM, said: I'll get some set up tomorrow in better light. To be honest there isn't a lot to see, most of it is just basic technic blocks underneath with all the slopes built up on top. Some more pics of the tumbler.	neutral
Hey brickbitz, I love how your review is not biased 10 ups. In the end, you said, "Overall slightly disappointing." Most people post reviews only with praise, but I'm glad you take both sides . Enjoyed the review just like others have, thanks so much	neutral
General Grievous Reviewed by Dunamis Set 10186 1,085 Pieces $89.95 from LEGO Shop @ Home Build time 3.5 hours It is the start of summer here in California and along with the weekly deluge of new action films we start to see some of the next wave of Star Wars LEGO sets. The latest offering from our favorite building toy company is none other than the infamous General Grievous! No doubt you all know the story of Grievous; two parts Technic and one part human and his hatred of the Jedi. Follow along as we get a close-up view of the mighty General. No doubt the observant will wonder why I purchased this set from Shop @ Home instead of my trusty LEGO store in Glendale. Well, it’s really as simple as two things: I’ve been traveling a lot and didn’t have time to drive to the store to get it AND gas is now $4/gallon and I would likely spend more in gas than the $9 shipping cost to get it to me. So there you have it. The Box: A gigantic box (much larger than expected) held the mighty General. We’re back to the perforated tabs on the side and two stickers on the front that let the box lift open: Inside, we have 17 bags, two manuals and three stickers on a relatively small sticker sheet. The Manuals: The manuals are not terribly thick in fact the second manual is noticeably thinner than the first. They come in at 75 and 31pages. Interesting to note on the back we see the next (and more interesting) wave of sets later this summer. Nothing new to report on the manuals as they provide the LEGO standard of high quality and features we expect. - Piece callouts - Models divided into sections - Large images - Page numbers Since there were links posted to the .pdf files of the instructions online, I’m sure you can all get an idea of the manual and the parts inventory. However, for those of you without access to the Internet here are photos of the parts inventory pages: Random manual image: Features page: The Pieces: The short answer is you get lots and lots of little pieces in white, gray and black plus some big pieces in white, gray and black. Mixed in the set is a fair amount of oddball pieces like minifig tools, Jedi hood and trans yellow dome. Fear not, despite the eclectic collection of parts, it all comes together in the end (not unlike a typical day at work for me…) It is probably worth noting again that there is a heavy amount of Technic parts and pieces here. The Build: The build starts off with a rather in-depth build of the stand in which General Grievous stands on. Once you think you are done, you keep adding on to this (rather solid) base. I bet there are 250 pieces just in the base alone! It is quite nice when you get done with it though and really adds to the display. I’m glad LEGO didn’t skimp on the base as it completes the model. Once you get through all that, the rest of the build is a real thumb-bruiser. Anyone who has built a decent size Technic set knows the feeling of your thumbs being sore when you are done. You get the same effect here. It is actually a fun build and I really liked seeing how the designers used all the various pieces to recreate a fairly accurate model of Grievous. The model is built from the ground up as seen in a few of the progress shots: Here is what is left over: The Design: The design is quite good and is very accurate. Some might be disappointed that since this is a Technic set we don’t have more articulation in the shoulders and have the ability to separate two arms into four as seen in the movie. However, it would seem the real intent is for display and not functionality. Here is a shot of the torso and the detail involved: Here are Grievous’ organs: Careful observers will note that my model is lacking two “arrow” stickers from the two white chest pieces. I failed to see these on the sticker sheet and only grabbed the large Grievous sticker. So, note that there are actually THREE stickers and not ONE. Chest protector and respirator: Head and arms: I was a little disappointed that we got two yellow blades and no green blades on the lightsabers. Note how all the lightsabers have different hilts which is a nice touch: Here are some shots of the completed model with a few other sets shown for scale. He is actually pretty tall: You have the option to remove the top two arms and put in shoulder plates if you so desire: Detail on the back: Overall Thoughts: I’ve been saying for a few years that we should have a Technic Grievous set and we finally got one. Designed more as a model and not a fully functional swooshable figure, Grievous is a tad flimsy. You won’t want him to veer too far off his massive and sturdy base. It would have been nice to have is cape with him (like the Technic Vader set). I do like the size of the model and it is impressive to look at. LEGO Star Wars System fans will likely want to think twice before purchasing but Technic and UCS fans should be satisfied. Final Rating: 75% Build 8/10 (Very Good – Fun, relatively quick build. Technic fans will be more pleased than others.) Design 8/10 (Very Good – Some nice SNOT and Technic techniques. A bit flimsy but the base is kind of cool.) Parts 7/10 (A mixed bag of stuff. Probably can’t get too many diverse builds from this except for other robot type models.) Price 7/10 (Just OK – A bit stiff at $90 USD for a nice display model with limited functionality.) As always, let’s hear your thoughts and feedback.	positive
Thanks so much dunamis for your awesome review . Yeah I think TLC miss the cape, it would be cool to own one but when we were talking of the 2008 sets around july of last year I can remember someone said it would come with cape. Finally is a little dissapoint TLC miss it . Edited by darkrebellion, 16 May 2008 - 07:20 PM.	negative
Hey Dunamis, think you can get a straight-on shot of the face? The red pieces inside the eye sockets are topped with trans-greenish-yellow studs which make his face look eerily alive and very close to his screen appearance. It's a nice little detail that seems to not show through on pictures I've seen of the set. The legs are a little wobbly. I'm scared that he'll be leaning too far forward in about 5 years	neutral
Nice review dunamis ! I built it two weeks ago on the LEGOWORLD speedbuild in Oslo and didn´t have time to get the "feel" during that crazy race. I agree with you that the base is nice & sturdy, makes it stand real still ! I´m looking forward on your next score! Four eyes arms On copmike	positive

The walker reminds me of the old Kenner CAP-2 Captivator which is good.	positive
Thanks for the sweet review, brickbitz! That really is a neat little set, that walker is fantastic, most likely the best part of the set. Though the alien craft does also look neat, and it's cool how it can fold down into aa walker. Or rather, a sentry turret, seeing as it can't really move while in that mode. Still, it's nice. My favourite part is the mini mining robot though. So cute! ~Peace	positive

Hi y'all! Guess what happened today? When walked into my Toys 'R' Us in Fullerton, CA, just to buy a simple Tiny Turbo racer, what do I see? All the Agents sets sitting on the shelf, ready for the taking! I didn't have too much money with me, so I just got 2 of 8631 Mission 1: Jetpack Pursuit! It's a really cool little set, so I thought I'd review this puppy for you! I shall proceed in the order of the instructions. So, let's get started! The Minifigs Let's begin with the minifigs, Saw Fist and Agent Chase! They are really cool, some of the coolest minifigs I have seen in a while! I took off Saw Fist's wig & chainsaw so you can see his head and cybernetic arm better! Here is a back view of Saw Fist, and - SURPRISE! Agent Chase has a double sided head! One side with his cool "mission face" with sunglasses and headset, and one with his casual Bruce Wayne type face (note, though, that it is not really the Bruce Wayne face). His wig, btw, is Mutt's hairpiece in black! Very neat! Poor Saw Fist seems to be forced to always drag his chainsaw around for it is way too long to just hang down from his shoulder like a normal arm. The Snowmobile Next up, we have the snowmobile, a sleek little vehicle with only minor design flaws! The container with the jewel is attached to the vehicle by a single stud, so it doesn't fall off, but is easy to pick up! In the pic below you can see the only two tiny design flaws: Thanks to the exhaust pipes, the laser cannon (or whatever it's supposed to be) can't be lowered any further than this. Also, the corners of that slope-ish piece that the handle bar rests on are sticking out a little at the sides. Other than that, it's pretty well done! The Jetpack Finally, there is the Jetpack! IMO, a name like Autogyro-pack or something would make more sense, but whatever. Although a little bulky, the Jetpack is very well designed! The rotor can be tilted back, and at the lower back of the Jetpack, there is hook with which you can grab the container with the jewel from the snowmobile. What I like best about the Jetpack is that although it is attached to the minifig in kinda the same way as that of the Riddler, this one doesn't rotate around. So, the Agent is being held in place steadily! "See ya later, chainsaw-cyborg-dude!" Stickers This set comes with a surprisingly large sticker sheet. The reason is that half of it are extra stickers! There are two large Agents logos and one Inferno logo - perfect for Agents MOCs! There are also a star and a small, round sticker portraying the number of the mission. The star seems to be part of some kind of game where you collect the stars from all sets on an Agents ID that you get from the Mission 5 set. I don't know, though, if you get any gain from this except for becoming a full-status Lego Agent! Below, you can find the list of parts from this set! Click here for a better quality pic! That's pretty much it! I hope you liked this review and will run straight to your next toy store to get one or more of this set! This was my very first set review! So any questions, comments, or requests? Any more pics you want me to take? Would you like me to exchange the chainsaw with something else, or do you want me to try the Agent's new hairpiece out on another fig? If so, just tell me! See ya!

That's a great review for your first one. I think the jet pack if far to bulky it could do with some minimising but that’s life. I assume that you can’t fit a standard hand in the chainsaw arms are the hole would be to large but would you be so good as to confirm this for me? Overall I quite like the jet ski and the ability to lower the arms to much doesn’t both me. How much was it just so I can get an idea of the price? Finally thanks for posting this review so quickly.	neutral
This is MUCH MUCH MUCH more promising than the 2008 Batman set for $10.00. The vehicle looks like someone took time to design it, but the Batman one looks like . Lego dear Lego, where is the quality for Batman??!?! I really like the new cyborg arm, and the propellers on that thing : ), it is a really promising line although I would get rid of all those bionicle pieces.	positive
Thanks for the great review Oky Wan The two vehicles look quite nice for a small set and the minifigs look great! The two sided head is nice, although it would've been nice if it was a new head rather than the standard frowning face. The cyborg looks good, nice and cartoony, I like the printing on his back. The belt on the hips should be useful, not to mention the robotic hand. I assume that anything that fits into a 1x1x1 cylinder can fit in it? I hope so Thanks again Oky. Any chance you can get any more sets?	positive
Thanks for the review. I'm looking forward to some of the new parts and ideas in this line. The figures look great. The actual sets themselves don't really appeal though.	neutral
Thanks, guys! I really tried to make it a good first review! Now to answer your questions: The robot arm can fit EF robot claws and anything that a minifig can hold in his hand or that would fit into a 1x1x1 cylinder, so normal minifig hands are too small to fit. TLG is using the robot claw idea for the main villain of the Agents line! Do you still want me to try it out and take pics? The price was 10.99 USD at the TRU I bought it at. I bet it'ss be a dollar less on S@H! And I'm sorry, but I probably won't get any more sets any time soon. I have to save my money for all the other good set that are to come. But if I would get another set, it would just be the one with the helicopter and the all-silver car! If anyone gets this set, can he/she PLEASE review it? Thanks! Any other questions I can answer for you guys? Edited by Oky Wan Kenobi, 18 May 2008 - 08:59 AM.	neutral

I love the way the bad guy has a special attachment on the jewel case JUST to allow the Agent to grab it with his hook. It's like the two of them sat down beforehand and drew up the plans for the vehicle together... CYBORG: "OK, and then I'll make my getaway in the special snowmobile and you can follow me..." AGENT: "...And I'll scoop up the jewel and return it to foil your plan". CYBORG: "Perfect. See you Tuesday?" Dr. S.	positive

And it's because villains are cooler. Actually, it could be long-simmering resentment towards the not-highly-regarded Alpha Team/ Dino Attack sets bubbling forth. See Dr Lucky's hilarious post here for an example of what I mean... I'm sure the new agents will learn to fight back soon	negative
does anyone know if the turbo car chase is out yet?	neutral
I've copied another thing because i don't know how i must do a review. And i can't do long reviews! Set ref: 7884 Name: The Buggy: The Escape of Mr Freeze Number of minifigs: 2 Number of pieces: 76 Price: 13,95€ Front of the box: Back of the box: The comic: Very close: What's in the box: Without: The set: The set with the box: The time: Wow, this is a funny set, but it's a little expensive, and a little to small, but i like some pieces like the fire, and the mr freeze gun. And the best of all, here it comes, NO STICKERS! That's one of the greatest things. But i understand why lego has made this set, some people want batman lego, and they are most of the time expensive, and the mr freeze set is also expensive, but this set not. If you want more pics, you msut ask! For exaple for the minifigs, or the mr freeze and the blaster. Ask it, and this is my first review and sorry for the great and blurry pics! The Final Verdict: 7.5/10 Figures: 8/10 Playability: 6/10 Build: 7/10 Pieces: 7.5/10	positive
Very nice review Riddler!	neutral
Thanks for the review... Ill probably get one copy of this set. Mr. Freeze and his cart look neat. I dont like the huge wing on the back of Batman's buggy so Ill probably mod that out.	neutral
Quote But I have to say that these two small vehicles just look plain ugly IMHO, without any inspiration nor orginality Indead. The only reason to get this set is if you couldn't afford the Batcave back in 2006 and want a Mr. Freeze fig for a cheap price. And anyone who did get that kit really have no reason whatsoever to get this. Wait, did I forget something? Oh yeah - thanks for the review, Riddler.

I'll get it, I admit the vehicles are extremely poorly designed, I mean REALLY poorly designed, but the Mr.Freeze fig is fantastic, and I would buy two of this set just for him, as his head and gear are very useful for mocing. It also comes with some nice pieces, like the grappling hook, little wheels, exhaust pieces and such. Still, a pretty bad set build wise, but it has atleast inspired me to make my own Batbuggy Thanks for the review theriddler, appreciated. Batbrick Away!	positive
As others have said, this really is a set for those that didn't buy the Batcave. Thus I want it! The cars are pretty horrid though... Thanks for the review ???theriddler???!	neutral
Thanks for the review! For such a high price that we need to fork out, compared to a total pieces of 76. It's is very expensive to pay for such poor design. But then, I will still considered to get them. As what Sinner had said, this is a very good way to get Mr Freeze without getting the Batcave. And it so happened that, I do not have the Batcave too. I believed that is the cheapest set among the four. So, for the mini-figs ONLY, this set is recommended. Other than that, I am sorry.	neutral
WOWIE!!!!!! I'm glad you like it! Maby i'l do the tumbler also! But soon the batcycle and the scuba also come!	neutral
Thanks for the reveiw The figs are bloody great! but those cars are a bit... well I'll put it blantly, RETARDED!!! Although they shall be good after some modding! and whats with that grapple hook? does it even have a rope, so I guess Batman will hokk it to Mr freeze so his ride looks more ugle anyway, can you pleese take some pics of the figs	neutral
That's a great set. It'd be even better if it were sold as two separate little cars. They remind me of the dozens of little LEGO cart vehicles I got as a kid. Those were always fun, quick builds that resulted in lots of cool play. I think this set is aimed more at kids and, in that respect, it's a pure winner. It doesn't hurt that you can get Freeze and the newly designed Batman both in this set for a reasonable price.	positive

Thank you, The Riddler! ) For this highly informative review. Despite the fact that I still consider it to be one of the weakest sets in all Batman Line, I guess that now I may even get more than one of these for the same reasons as Batbrick. ) Good day, gentlemen! )	neutral
Thanks the penguin, and more pics on monday!	neutral
Thanks for the review. This set was poorly design, when i first heard of it i think it was like a car with a much better design than this one. I think i will get it for the minifigs.	negative
In actuality, I think that this may be my favorite Batman set of all time. I know, I know - it's a small set with crappy tiny vehicles; so it probably sucks for the fan who likes to display sets; but look at the MOCing side and you see this set has a ton of potential: -New Batman fig. Well, mainly the torso; but it looks nice, sleek, and armored! A definite plus whether you're a MOCist or batfan. -Mr. Freeze. Because nobody bought the Batcave when they should have...and by nobody I mean me. Plus, I love that head! -Cheapest way to amass the lightning piece. The other sets that have it are lolhueg (Well, not really, but I don't have $50 to toss around on a little skeleton tower...), and it's a great piece. -Two little blue gems. I may be alone on this, but those are my favorite parts (the gems), and that's my favorite color for them! <3 <3 <3 -Several other useful parts, including a +O piece in black, some light/medium blue bits from Mr. Freeze's kart, the oddly placed grappling hook, and some cheap wheels. Now, I don't know about you guys, but this is as close to a Batman Battlepack as we're going to get, lol - I'm buying at least three, maybe more once I get my summer job ^.^ (Oh, and the fact that the US price is only $10 helps a little, but this year you guys can't complain - you got practically every set first, ESPECIALLY the new castle! T.T) ~Trexxen	positive
I got this yesterday and built it this morning. Apart from the figs, it is very crappy. Mr Freeze's buggy is OK but the bat buggy is easily the worst vehicle I've seen for years. Colours are all over the place, the grappling hook feels cheaply made, the inclusion of those odd pearl silver parts which have been in the Exo-Force sets seem especially random here, the terrible Bionicle flame piece... It's the first Lego vehicle I've built where I've immediately had the urge to disassemble it and pretend I never bought it! Really, I only got it for Mr Freeze so I shouldn't complain. But still. It's a real step backwards. The comparable Catwoman dragster set was heaps better. The Penguin sub is sweet though Thanks for the review anyway!	negative
Coming in at around $50 US, Turbo Car Chase is one of the bigger of the new Agents sets. A big box with a helicopter, car, and gate in it. Seems like a winner, but how good is it really, and is it worth the cash? Let's start with the Minifigs. This set comes with a standard Inferno Henchman, Spy Clops, and Agent Chase. The Henchman is you basic LEGO criminal type with a gun and a jumpsuit, nothing real groundbreaking here. Spy Clops, on the other hand, is very cool for, technically, half of a Minifig. His head has a neat electronic goggle print and the rest of him is a torso mounted onto a set of six legs made from Exo-Force robot arms. The whole thing is really well done and neat as hell. Agent Chase (Turbo Car Chase! ) seems to have a standard agent body and a double-printed face with one side a sunglasses and headset print. The other face is a determined Agent look. The set also includes a laptop with Doctor Inferno wallpaper. The laptop is a new piece and works like the LEGO books that are in a lot of Harry Potter sets. Molding on the keyboard is really well done and the thing can be held by a Minifig along either corner, but not in the middle and not while closed. The gate in the set is nothing revolutionary by itself, and I sort of get the feeling that it was included to drive up the piece count and the set price point. That being said, there are some things to like here. For instance, the gate has four wheels of barbed wire attached to it. The barbed wire is new and makes me want to start building some World War I trench MOCs. The rest of the gate is fairly big and it has a handy ramp attached so that vehicles can roll through it easily. The main feature of the gate is a sound brick. It's much better then LEGO sound and light units of the past, when the gate is opened it depresses a button and an alert klaxon blares that sounds every bit like a prison-beak in progress. The triggering action works surprisingly well and it's pretty much for this feature alone that I'm not going to immediately break the gate back down and add it to my parts bin. The designers did make an effort to create more then just a fence though. A nice control panel connected to a big spotlight crowns the piece, and a pair of cameras watch the opening. It's really hard to mess up a LEGO helicopter, and this set is no exception. The Inferno Chopper is a nicely proportioned and well built machine. It looks properly menacing and has the uniform orange and black of other Inferno property. It's armed with a set of four Technic pegs cleverly used as guns on outriding mounts, as well as a pair of the newer-style flick-fire missiles. I personally don't care for flick-firing missiles, but these look decent enough and seem to stay put so I really can't complain about them. Along the fuselage are a pair of intake pieces that I've never seen before and I'm guessing are new. They're pretty well designed and will come in handy for MOCing down the road. The action feature of the aircraft is the wench system. This is very different then other LEGO wenches in that you build the entire mechanism and housing. You can then use it to raise Spy Clops up and down from the bottom of the chopper using the rotor. Now, this also keeps you from sitting there and just giving the rotor repeated spins to simulate flight. I'm not too thrilled with that, but there are a hundred other LEGO helicopters out there with fully rotating rotors, so I guess I can let it by just this once. As you'd suspect, the bottom of the cockpit is completely open, which makes this a vehicle pretty much solely for Spy Clops (Sorry Henchman). But there is plenty of room beneath the body to attach a plate with some seats on it to accommodate another pilot without drastically altering the design, or even removing existing pieces. The Turbo Car is a slick little honey of a LEGO car, and the silver pieces that make up the body work contribute a lot to that fact. The front license plate appears to be an Exo-Fore code brick. But it also hides the activation lever for the passenger ejector seat. The seat works about as well as the Spruce Goose, which is to say not well at all, but here it's the thought that counts. The interior of the car is really well done. There's even a radar screen for keeping track of pesky helicopters. But the Bond-like features don't end there. A lever in the compartment raises pair of guns in the hood and a knob on the rear deploys a quad rocket system with more flick-fire missiles. This is a car that won't be stopped easily! The rear has two cones sticking out. I'd like to think they're smoke nozzles or oil-slick sprayers. All-in-all, this is a really good set. The car is pure LEGO vehicle love and looks fantastic. The silver pieces are very nice and it's a shame LEGO doesn't use metallic colors in System sets more often. There are, however, a LOT of sticker for this set and I know how much that bugs a lot of people. I personally like how much detail the stickers add to these sets and don't mind them so much. The set also comes with an Agents ID card for Chase which you can put little star stickers on from other sets as you get them. It's printed on a real nice piece of sturdy plastiboard and would be cooler if you could put your own picture and name on it instead of pretending to be Chase. Sold by themselves, the car and chopper would be must-haves. All tossed together with the gate sort of makes the set a little less then the sum of it's parts. And with 498 parts (most of them small) that's not so hot. It's only slightly over-priced in my opinion, but if you do shell out the money you won't regret it. I'm very comfortable recommending this set to anyone. Close to perfect, but the price and some minor flaws bring it back just a little. I'd say 4.33, but out of 5 is close enough!	positive
can't wait for the review the car is ly!!!	positive
Deinonychus, on May 23 2008, 10:12 PM, said: Pics and thoughts tomorrow! I picked up this set earlier in the week and was quite pleased with it (in fact I have missions 1-5 and am happy with all of them - this series is much better than the old Alpha Team ever was). I look forward to reading your thoughts on it. I will say 2 things about it now though. 1)My set came with defective instructions. In 2 places pages are missing and duplicates of other pages repeated. For instance, the car instructions are missing steps 16-21. Fortunately, I was able to make out what pieces went where in the missing steps by studying the illustration in step 22. I hope you have better luck with your instructions. 2)This set contains the best LEGO sound brick ever (it's just begging to be incorporated into my Arkham Asylum).	positive

WOW! Thanks, Deino, for this great review! I can't wait to get this myself, but right now I gotta save for the CW sets! The car is with no doubt one of the most mind blowing things TLG has come up with and we can only hope that there will be more models made out of almost only metalic colors! The spider cyborg, while not as innovative as some of the other cyborgs, is a very nice fig, and his head will be very usefull for Splinter Cell MOCs! And those intake pieces are only relatively new btw, they are in almost all of the current $10 Racers sets. Any chance of you taking a pic of a line-up of all the silver parts in this set?

Great review, Deino! Man, that car is just so beautiful, and the helicopter is nice too. Unfortunately, this seems pretty pricy, and I hardly think I'll be getting it any time soon, what with my limited budget and all. Still, it's great to see how well Agents is shaping up.	positive
I love it ! Fun, playable, cool looking, and killer minifigs! Sweet!	positive
Wow, thanks for the great review Deino This set is really a must have for me. The sound brick seems great, the helicopter looks very nice and the car is superb! All of the James Bond features are really cool, though I'm very interested in how the ejector seat works (or doesn't work..). The car itself is very sleek and full of beautiful silver, and the inclusion of the new rims and windshield mean that I won't have to buy many Speed Racer sets. As for the minifigs, they all look great, especially SpyClops. Though it looks rather easy for him to fall off of his spider legs. Can you confirm this? A great review of a great set, thanks Deinonychus	positive
Thanks for the awesome review, Deinonychus! This really is a sweet set, a bit expensive a set for me, as I only get the cheaper non-Castle sets, which is a shame because I love that head! It would be great for some more cyborg troops. The car is awesome, I didn't expect it to have that many silver parts, that's fantastic! Heaps of play features too, that ejector seat mechanism sounds interesting. Thanks again for the sweet review! ~Peace	positive
ES.JPG 47.94K 110 downloads The ejector seat A long Technic axle runs the length of the front of the car. It comes in to the seat area here and nests into the gray joint which is attached to the small gray Technic beam. The beam is attached to the ejector seat (bottom white 3x2 plate) with a Technic pin. The seat, in turn, is attached to the side of the car with a Technic pin. The result is, when the axle is pushed forward, the gray joint and beam tilt the seat and "eject" a Minifig. After about 20 shots the Minifig only went outside of the car 3 times...the rest of the time he just bounced around the inside of the car. So they get an A for effort, but an F for execution	neutral
Thanks Deinonychus for another great review. I must say I do look forward to people uploading reviews of new sets, it really helps me decide if I want it or not. If it's a good set (IMO) then it adds to the excitement of picking up one myself! This, I must say, is one of those sets! The only concern for me, like alot of others, is the price. I will just have to wait and see and continue to look at these photo's Deinonychus has provided for us!! So much for thinking the Agent line was going to be weak! I wonder if the ExoForce style code brick number plate is a hint from TLC as to what will replace ExoForce at the end of this year? JB	positive
Thanks for the great review! I'm really liking these agents sets the more i see them. The car seems to have alot of features. Its to bad the the ejection seat doesn't work as well as one would hope. Oh well. Makes me want the big rig even more now!	positive
Looking closely at the red cones on the missles, and grey cones on the car's rear These appear to be a new piece. Note how there is a slight stopper ridge at the base of their top stud. Interestingly, the trans green cones on the helicopter seem to be of the older mould style.	neutral
Thanks for your great review! It looks very nice indeed! The gate have very interesting mechanism. The car looks very slick and cool. It looks like those typical kind of James Bond car. This review gives me very good insights.	positive

Both these sets adds up to $18.00 (CAD) And the skeleton pack have the same price of $18.00 (CAD) *prices quoted from S@H I understand that 7009 and 7090 offers more pieces, horses and same amount of mini-figs compared to a typical battlepack. IMO, I feel that all 3 sets are all army building sets. 7009 offer small catapult, 3 mini-figs, a skeleton white horse. 7090 offer a joust divider, weapon rack (good accessories), 2 mini-figs, a horse with barding and a skeleton black horse. These sets have different purpose. For me, buying multiples of 7009 is to build its catapult, white skeleton calvaries. While 7090 is to build on Crown calvaries and Black skeleton calvaries. However, Battlepacks have a different agenda. It offered some castle accessories that is not available commonly. For a Castle army builder like myself, castle accessories are always in demand. The black robe, silver armor, silver short-axe are not very common castle accessories. It can be used as a good stock up too. I am not saying this battlepack is an one way solution to solve everything. That's why, different sets are released to target on different purposes.	neutral
WhiteFang, although I realize that the battle packs are great specifically for building armies, and castle accessories (which is why its such a shame that I won't be able to buy these things ), while sdpirate's sets are more for a catapult, Calvary whatever. The fact to the matter is with the battle pack you get: 5 minifigs with lots of accessories. While with the sets that sdpirate showed us you get: 5 minifigs with an okay amount of accessories 3 horses (including two skeleton ones) A ballista A weapons rack, and a jousting barricade. You cannot say that the battle pack contains the same amount of stuff that the other two sets have and therefore should be priced the same. It just seems that Lego is ripping off Canadian army builders, to me if the battle pack contained a small catapult, or wall so that it contained about the same amount of stuff that the other sets had it would be fair. It seems stupid that you will only get minifigs from one set, while you can get about the same amount of minifigs plus a bunch of other stuff from two other equally priced sets. That’s why to me these battle packs are a rip off, because of what they contain, IMHO the Battle Packs seem to be only worth about 10 dollars.	neutral

MacK, I can understand your concern when pricing is concerned. Pricing is always a big issue for us to determine whether to buy or not to buy a certain set in a particular country. Pricing varies differently across different countries such as US, Europe, Canada, Australia and etc. This is something very hard for us to decide on. We can't be sure why TLC placed their pricing strategies this way. Well, I think we should appericate what TLC is trying to do for us, by not using price as the only factor to judge whether to buy this set or not. At least, I am sure there are many of us trying to request for battlepacks to muster armies for their MOCs, Armies Collection and etc. Different people have different judgements towards different sets and different themes. I respect your opnion. IMO, let's don't let price be the only determined factor to decide whether to purchase a particular set or not. Instead, consider an array of factors that is offered. However, I do know that consumers like me and you are always affected by price. iamded, on May 26 2008, 01:40 PM, said: Thanks for the review Whitefang! Your additions look great, I like your mace much better than the use of a small technic cog, your looks much sturdier. And that helmet looks really great on skellie soldiers, I never thought to use that before. Very cool indeed! iamded, I am glad you enjoyed the review and my slight modifications. That mace was a much looking weapon. It looks much firm than the orignal look. The design was inspired from Dwarf Mine and Dwarf Mine Defender. I would not want to have so many troll flags hanging around. The nose cone helmet, was to give the soliders a whole new look. To me, it retains the classic look, yet it belongs to present theme, suitable for my Skeleton Elite Guards.	negative
Thanks for sharing these close-up images of this battlepack WhiteFang. I actually had this set in my hand at Legoland Cal. and could not decide if I wanted it. I'm currently out of "castle-mode" with my large Indy Jungle set up on the table, and creating Ghost Train MOCs that are starting to line up on the bookshelves. Once I buy the Troll Ship, I'll want to start collecting these great fig sets. Thanks again for sharing.	neutral

Sorry to be going a little off topic here but personally i have just bought 40 crowny battle packs for the only reason that i am running out of space to store the left over blocks. About 500 of my crownies came from sets (mentioned above) on sale which would have been cheaper than the battle packs. Thanks for the review Whitefang but i dont think i will be buy any skeleton battle packs, that army is large enough.	neutral
For those of you who buy so many of this and the other battle pack with Crownies, what do you do with all of them? Is this simply to create a large-scale army, or do you plan to build large castle scenes with all the figs. I'd love to see some pictures (on the "share your castle army" thread).	neutral

Great Review. I saw the instructions of this set, but never atracted me Until now A great set an a excelente review.	positive
Great review! I just barly missed the Jungle series, growing up with half a year of Jungle and mainly Orient Expedition and Dino Island. I like Egypt more, but this set (despite the 4x4 palm tree) is practically perfect. I love the detail and vibrant colours. Gotta say, I've got a thing for Pippin Reed myself. By the way, what does "VHTF" mean? Edited by sdpirate, 28 May 2008 - 01:06 AM.	positive
VHTF= Very Hard to Find. To answer some earlier replies... No, there are no stickers in this set. While some Adventurers sets of the era had stickers (the 5956 Zeppelin had tons), all of the interesting mesoamerican designs from this set are printed. Also, simonwillems was correct; my mechanic is missing his hat, which should be a black kepi. They're extremely expensive on BL, though (proving once again that this set has some awesome parts), so I ordered a replacement from Lego. It's in the mail and should come soon.	positive
Athos, on May 28 2008, 07:47 PM, said: The printed pieces are the real gems of this set. Beyond them, there isn't much to this set, though the boat hull is nice. The model itself, isn't all that great. The new Akator temple is definately a superior model (at least in piece count), but those printed pieces are hard to resist. Steve I have to agree. Too few pieces for such a high price- but amazing figs too, and a nice baseplate! Despite a 4+ palm tree, you get more palm tree leaves for MOC's. Plus, I think a monkey? And that sweet Achu figure.	negative
this set is awesome .......... gr8	positive
I just rebuilt this entire set today, and the nostalgia was totally worth taking bits and pieces from a few of my own MOCs. Only now did I realize how rare some of those pieces are, and I'm rather thankful that I have all of the printed pieces, and Achu. The only pieces I am missing is a transparent orange headlight (3 out of 4), black minifigure hammer, light gray chain(replaced it with a dark gray chain), and ONE WHOLE minifigure, which is the mechanic guy. I still have both the instructions and the box, and both are in appalling conditions. Kudos to the pre-2000s lego sets like this one! Love 'em	positive
Great review Voltio, I never actually owned this set but my friend does, He gave me some of the peices, but he burnt the base (don't know why)	positive
I got this as a birthday gift when I turned 7 years old or so. I can still remember the big box with the brown bridge in its display! So many hours of fun. One of the most amazing sets I own. A lot of play value. A true classic!	positive

Welcome to Cardinal Brick's Review of 7736 It's a small set but as I bought it the other day I felt that it probably did merit a short review. The box is ofcourse far larger than necessary! There's plenty of air inside. The contence is one bag and the instruction booklet, you could proably build it inside the bag if the desire took you. We have one new coastguard with the slightly stubly head found in the castle range and a trans-clear visor. The build was challanging and arduious The final product is quite nice at one ?3.00 it's a good set only 50p more than an impulse set and with enough extra parts to justify the increase in the price. A good set for a little gift or so on, the buggy moves well. There's not that much to say really for I can't really think of additional models to build with the parts but then what do you expect for the price.

So i just piced up a new digital camera and i thought what better way to try it than doing a review of my newest set. The new 7738 Coast Guard Helicopter! itsmy first review, so go easy on me! lets start off with the small stuff. First the mini figs. You get 4 figs total. Two helicopter pilots, a diver and a civilan to rescue. The torso's are nothing new on the pilot and diver. Same ones as in the last coast guard line. But i like the colors alot better in this coast guard line than the previous generation. The yellow and blue really work well together and the coloring on the badge looks great! The civilian looks to be just a dock worker with an overall torso and a beenie. The diver has nice vented helmet and a pair of flippers that suits his duty perfect! Next we have an absolute work of lego art. The rescue raft! The orange flaps can be moved back for easy entry to the raft, as well as the white "support" beams with the caution tape. I put support in perenthaces cause they really don't support anything. Just there to fill in the gaps. At the top of the raft is a red locator beacon, ccommunications antenna, and a cargo loop for lifting the raft. lets move on to the interior of the raft. Not much here. But you can see the techinc beam that attaches to the top loop,and to the floor of the raft. So far this has proven to be very sturdy and has supported the full weight of the raft quite well. You can also see the white box that holds the equipment of the raft. Here you can see the life saver tube. Here's a shot with our dock worker peaking out the side. The raft says max ocupants 4, but with the storage box, that might be a tight fit. Now lets move on to the Helicopter! in my opinion this is one of the best helicopters TLC has come out with to date. I really felt they captured the look and proportions of a real Coast Guard helicopter. it uses a lower hull and tail section of the new airliner, and cargo airplane. It really seems to work well with this application. The engines have good detail using new "cheese graders" as vents, as well as the new engine stacks that come in the new speed racer sets. The rotors also appear to be new as well. lets move on to the cockpit. We have two seats for our pilots with a sticker sheet for intruments on a flat 4 wide plate. There's also an antena being used as a flight stick. Another shot with our pilots at the helm. Now lets moveon to the high lihgt of this heavy lifting machine. The med bay, and lifting winch. http://www.brickshel...icopter_020.jpg here you can see the winch arm at rest, along with the medical strechter. The bad part is that the med. strechter doesn't include the ussually included fold away wheels. here's a shot with the winch arm extened ready for rescue! In the second shot you can see the drum that the wire coils up in. It coils up via a recently new power functions "pull" back motor. To operate, just pull out the winch cable, hook on your load, and presse this orange button on the side... The bad part of the new power functions winch is that although its very smooth in its operation, its not very strong. It will only lift the raft a couple inches before it runs out of torque. It also has a tendency to want to pull the crane arm backin while its lifting. It doesn't matter if its a light load, or heavy load. The bay doors open on both sides for easy postioning of the figures and accses to the strechter. Here we have our diver looking over his rescue-e. Nice and roomy if you don't mind a crane arm being in your way!! At $39.99 and a peice count of 445, i felt this set was a great good considering what your getting. The raft construction is very creative and is probbly the highlight of the set by itself. The helicopter is probbly one of the best, if not the best helicopter TLC has ever came out with if you can get over its size. in a scale of one to five.... Price- Peice count- Playability- Design- overall- .5 I would have given it a full 5 out of five, but since the winch can't pull the raft all the way, it didn't fell it right. Even with this minor flaw, i still highly recomend this set!	neutral
Wow. I was skeptical of this Coast Guard line. Though getting to see some detailed pictures of this set I really want to get get it. Alas, I have not the money to get it and it isn't available in my town. Oh well. Maybe I can catch it on a sale at some point. Good review!	positive

Klaus-Dieter There is no real way to lift up the stretcher. Due to the crane arm being in the way there really isn't any room for any kind oflifting straps. The set does include a 1x2 plate with a hinge for the diver to stand on so at least he can hold on to someone, the crane lifts them up and then he can put them in the strechter. Thats my guess at least. As far as the motor, i don't believe it uses bateries since you pull out the motor, and all the button does is recoil the winch line back in. I have to say it does a very good job of that, and is very smooth. (as long as you don't have anything to heavy) One detail i forgot to meation is the shark. Its nothing new, just the basic shark lego has had around for nealy 2 decades, but it was a detail nothing less.	neutral
Nice review! The helicopter reminds a Sikorsky chopper,isn't it?	positive
I could tell from the pictures that a lot (maybe all) the designs on the raft were stickers. In the whole set are there any printed parts besides the torsos or is it all stickers?	negative
This is a very good review, thank you! But I have some questions about the grey new parts in the life raft. Are they 1x1 like their counterparts with the clips or 1x2? And can they be held by a minifig by the handle? If so, these could be very useful for brick-build weapons & tools! Also, I'm looking forward to some orange ETA 2 Jedi Interceptor MOCs now! Who wants to be the first to make one? BTW, which Jedi has an orange ETA 2?	positive
I noticed that you said the torsos are the same as the last line; the last line had orange torsos, this one has yellow torsos. -Chuck	negative
What an outstanding copter! I love it. The orange looks fantastic. This is probably Lego's best copter to date. Thanks for sharing the review. I would definately recommend that you downsize your pictures a bit though.	positive

Thank you for clearing that up I felt that it was OK to review an old topic, as stated, rather than just go ahead and start a new one. A shame that this set, as all other Batman sets, have gone up so highly in value but still all things considering (general after market Lego price hikes) it is still a wonderfull set even with its market value today (that is if you can ignore the MRSP).	positive
I bought this off ebay, while not having been collecting space as a child, it was mainly Wild West and City... I have decided, upon reading KDog's M:Tron Bar Brawl Mania strip in his Space Comic, to buy as many M:Tron sets and figures I could find.. except I got distracted and bought some different sets as well... To start off with, here's a picture of the box: Here's a general shot showing the entire set: A front view: The buggy: Another shot of the buggy without the minifig: The flyer: The flyer without the Minifig: M:Tron crate with some equipment and hoses, I don't know the use of the hoses though : The cockpit open: The cockpit closed with the crew: The Magnetic crane: Another shot of the Crane: Rear View with Hatch open: One of the side slots that can carry either the Buggy or the Flyer: Top view of this excellent Vehicle: Excellent for getting Spyrius or Blacktron out of your way : Final shot: Excellent set, one of the biggest space ground vehicles and one of the best sets made by LEGO. Undoubtably better than it's newer counterpart the MT-101 Armored Drilling unit.... A great addition to any collection and has a lot of cool neat features that make it have a lot of playability. Simply excellent! Five out of Five!	positive
Great find and thanks for the review. Inertia, on May 28 2008, 11:08 PM, said: Undoubtably better than it's newer counterpart the MT-101 Armored Drilling unit.... Care to explain why? Personally I think that aside from the colour scheme the new one is far better. Why? Suspension, more enclosed cockpits, bug-like appearence.... I suppose it's a matter of personal opinion though.	neutral
Great Review of a great set. I always figured the hoses were welding torches (attached to jetpacks, yeah!) as the whole thing had the vibe of a mobile repair center. Much like many of my favorite sets, this one has a base of simple bricks and plates and then from that solid foundation the rest is built out to be decorative or have the action features. This gives sets a very solid feel as demonstrated in this set, the first Snowspeeder, and Galaxy Explorer. The MM Armored Drilling Unit has a more technic base giving it a less solid appearance and though I like the set, that jet that luanches from the back is horrible, partially because of the useless orange containment things. The Mega Core has a nifty crane instead of a big useless jet. -Tohst	positive
Sinner, on May 28 2008, 02:35 PM, said: Care to explain why? The MCM has a pure weight of parts that I find hard to quantify but love... It is just so dense when you build it, full of nice surprises, no technique required, and a wonderful stearing mechanism that I rank as more important than the suspension of the mars version. This thing was meant to crush anyway, who needs suspension? I also like the way you never felt that the M-trons deserved a base after building this, it was that good... The colour scheme was perfect... It's space and I like it... enough said Great review BTW God Bless, Nathan Naturally you're entitled to your inferior opinion...	positive
Thanks for those wonderful pictures and congrats! I think buying this on eBay was a good decision! I have no M:Tron sets at all, but I like the MCM very much. It's just a wonderfully big set with many nice detials. Lots of playing possibilities! I wish I had it too.	positive
I love the design of the front canopy of this set, but I always felt that they could have done more with the rest of the model. This set is good candidate for customization though. There is quite a bit on unused space inside, especially in the middle section. I want to try putting a Technic-style engine into mine at some point, along with the necessary gearing. I got my MCM brand new off ebay some years ago for a pretty good price, but the box was very worn out and the big trans-neon panel, which floats freely inside the box, was a bit damaged. As for the hose/jetpack things, I always assumed that they were either welding torches or flamethrowers. Take your pick.

Fluyt, on May 28 2008, 01:56 PM, said: Since when is that? The new train couplings have magnets, only with a special casing. You're right, I should have clarified -- it's the old loose magnets that apparently are being discontinued, not all magnets altogether. As you noted, the new train couplings still have magnets, but they appear to be permanently attached to a fairly large housing, which I guess will prevent kids from eating them. But the old M:Tron round magnet pieces are presumably discontinued.	neutral
Thanks for the review, maybe I can pick one off eBay.	neutral
It looks like you're right about the old magnets. I got a few off PAB two months ago but they no longer have them. I guess I should grab some while they're still widely available on Bricklink, as they can be useful in a number of situations. On a side note, one interesting thing about this set is that it seemingly had two US/Canada names, Mega Core Magnetizer and Multi Core Magnetizer. Brickset, Lugnet and all the other sites I've seen call it Mega, but I have some North American catalogs from that time period that call it Multi and the box also says Multi on it. I actually didn't know the Mega name at all until many years after the M:Tron line.	neutral
This does look alot better than the new MM drilling tank. Great work!	positive
Inertia, on May 29 2008, 08:44 AM, said: I Just thought that the MT-101 was very skeletal and couldn't really steer that well, although I do like it. Also the MCM has a better design, in my view, as the wheels are closer together, making it look a lot more tankish than the MT-101. Also space in the rear isn't wasted on having a shuttle.

Yeah.... it´s pretty sad, some of these new sets just look very cool at the outside, but appear to be hollow and blank at the inside, especially with the annoying use of studless technic beams. To MOD these sets often means to change the whole inner frame, leaving us with a bunch of IMHO not really very useful parts. It´s not a very honorable marketing strategy to produce set designs that´re aimed to look impressive and cool on the box art, but´re pretty useless in their inner structures. Of course I don´t want to offend some Technic lovers, and although I always was more the System kind of guy, why can´t they just use some technic beams with studs at least? I grew up with 'just imagine', with pictures of alternative models on the box, and I don´t think it´s that easy, especially for younger kids, to MOD some of these terrific blown-up sets like it once was with sets like this one here....

Of course it´s a money issue.... my question was more rhetorical. But I still don´t like how they sacrifice inherent set design on the altar of cost saving efforts. To be even more correct, I don´t understand why they try to make extraordinary cool looking sets with a pretty weak 'inner life'. Yeah, they want to sell sets with something that looks exciting on the box art, but.... LEGO was (and fortunately, is, with many recent sets too) always more than just an impressive spaceship or S.F. tank vehicle.... it´s the sum of the set itself and its parts and what you can do with it that makes out the full fun of it. The best thing you can do with a new set, beside some UCS sets perhaps, is to MOD the set according to your own likings. This is where 'just imagine' begins, and how kids start to learn how to MOC, at least it was like that to me.... Individualizing official sets, and looking on some cool alternative models gave me my first ideas and helped my imagination and skills to grow, back in these days when I was a wee child. Books, movies and t.v. series as a source of inspiration just came a little later.... I can see many people complaining about how to make the alternative models, yes, but just stop using them on the box art´s a very poor solution and a dangerous one too, at least in long terms. Of course I know that you know all these things too, Sinner. I just think it´s a shame, and a risk too, because TLC´s perhaps sacrificing more than they might know by yet.... Building with bricks is the main attraction of LEGO, not just some cool crafts to play around with.... others can do this too and maybe better than TLC. If the kids of today ever forget about the fascination of being imaginative, TLC´ll only lose in the end.	neutral

Harley & Mistah J. I want to preface my review by admitting that I’m an unrepentant Harley Quinn fanboy. I’ve been enamored with the character since she first appeared in Batman: The Animated Series back in the 90’s, and I’ve since followed her misadventures through her introduction into the regular Batman series during No Man’s Land, into her own series, and even on the short-lived and not-so-good Birds of Prey TV show. So please excuse any pro-Harley bias. So, down to business. The 267 piece set retails for $30 US ($35 at Toys R Us) and builds up very fast and easy. It consists of Batman’s Bat Cycle, Harley’s Hammer Truck, and brand new Batman and Harley Quinn Minifigs. There is also no lack of weapons. In addition to the usual bag of Bat-accessories and guns, the set also comes with a pair of gray revolvers. Batman in this set has the new “armor” torso print and the hips are the same color as the legs, hinting that this is supposed to represent the movie style Batsuits more so then the traditional comic book “underwear over tights” look. Harley Quinn is a very cool looking Minifig, and I haven’t grinned so much at a new Batman character figure since my first Batman Minifig a couple years ago. The figure is very true to the character, and the torso has been accented with a few shape lines to try and distinguish her as a female despite the boxy body. Harley’s jester cap is an interesting new piece. It seems (to me at least) to be made of a slightly different grade of plastic then we’re used to. It’s molded in red and painted with black and white, and it comes packed in its own separate little baggie. I expect that this piece may have cost LEGO a little more then usual to produce. Harley also has a buildable accessory, a giant mallet. Sure, she can’t stand up all that well unless it’s held in specific ways, but it’s neat and most importantly, it’s funny. It’s especially fun for smacking the everloving crap out of other Minifigs with. The Bat Cycle is in bag number one and is a very fast build. This isn’t some little Japanese sport bike like Nightwing’s cycle. This monster is almost a car and seems to pack just the right amount of intimidation for the Caped Crusader to exploit. Thanks to the thick tires (two in front, one in back) it stands up just fine on its own and rolls very well. The huge exhaust pipes are a nice touch and give the thing a look of engine power. The only real flaw is the inclusion of the flick-fire missiles mounted on the sides. But, as with any LEGO model, they can be easily left out without hurting the look of the vehicle. The hammer truck is the bulk of this set and a lot more fun then it looks. Of the monster truck persuasion, the vehicle is designed and built with a surprising level of solidity. The axle mounts are particularly impressive. The big wheels and tires just beg you to drive this thing right over the Bat Cycle (or Batman). The mega-mallet gimmick is also a surprise. Not so much for its technical complexity, there isn’t any really, but for the fact that once you start turning the knob at the rear to swing the mallet back and forth, it’s really a lot of fun. There are some low points to the truck design. Again the flick-fire missiles are tacked on and there’s a cargo crate/bed set into the back for Harley’s loot of jewels. The crate would have looked a lot better molded in black. In brown it breaks up the look of the truck a little. Speaking of which, the look of the truck is very pleasing. The red and black Harley Quinn color scheme works really well on the vehicle. There are a few stickers here, and unfortunately, the diamond patterned ones are applied over multiple bricks. The rest, however, are great. Not only does she have an “I Love Joker” bumper sticker, but she has a Joker playing card taped to her dash, I guess serving as a picture of her beloved Puddin’. There is also a sticker for activation of the hammer, which boldly shouts HIT ME! This is a fun set. A neat new Batman vehicle and a big truck with lots of playability. The Harley Minifig is a must-have for any Bat-Fan and, if you only get one of the Batman sets this year, I’d recommend this one. The price versus piece-count on this set is a little bit of a deterrent though. This might not be the best set for collectors on a budget or people looking for something completely new and innovative, but anyone buying this for a child can rest assured that the kid will get your money’s worth out of the set through its play value. When added together and averaged out, the pros and cons of this set combine to give it a score of out of 5. Even if Harley herself is a clean 6 out of 5	positive

Grevious, on May 30 2008, 05:03 AM, said: *gasp* Are you kidding me? Honestly, I hate this set. The batbike looks far too blocky, and that Hammer Truck looks super shoddy and thrown together. The only real reason I'd get it at all would be for the Harely Quinn figure - but I'd probably just get her separately on Bricklink. Besides, the Tumbler and Robin's Jetski sets look far better to me. They actually seem to have great vehicle designs. No new villian figures, I know, but still some great old ones. Er, wait a minute... oh yeah, hope your review gives the real scoop on this kit, Deino. The batbike may look blocky, but the Hammer Truck is by no means thrown together. Read the instructions, it actually has a great assembly. Add into the fact it has Harley, great wheels, a modable Batbike, awesome stickers and awesome pieces and I'd say this was a win. The Penguin is a bit of a repeat and the Tumbler is too big for me. Either way, it's a great set, Batman 08 wasn't nearly as bad as I thought it would be, which is great. Batbrick Away!	positive

A very nice review, thanks Deinonychus. That Batcycle looks pretty neat.... like a Hells Bats Angels version of that tumbler, a really nifty idea.

Brickadier General, on May 29 2008, 07:27 PM, said: Hi all, so I was at "The Wal-Mart" yesterday and had the munchies and was looking for something to eat. Somewhere along the line, I stopped caring about food and decided to browse the toy department to see what they had Lego-wise. Thank you very much for that neat review, Brickadier General .... I´m glad that you changed your mind, a review of a burger wouldn´t be half that interesting for sure. It´s just a mediocre set to me, but of course it´s always cool to get important MFs in less pricy sets. I like the Penguin´s sub from the Batcave more, just because they did a fine job on resembling a penguin without using a sticker.... Robins craft looks fairly nice, but the most useful parts of the whole set, for me personally, would be those indeed very neat green engines.	positive
Yay, another Technic shooter!! Whew, I need a spare one in case the 14,348 other ones that I have all happen to break. Seriously, do Lego set designers get some sort of bonus for incorporating catapults, Technic shooters, and / or flick-fire missiles??? Anyway, thanks for the review. Looks like a cute set.	positive
Thanks . Why isn't this set on S@H? Who Want's The Second Riddle?	neutral
Thanks for the great review, Brickadier General! The sub looks very nice, and I like the idea of a raising periscope (did the Batcave sub have that feature?) and the details on the sub look very nice. The inclusion of The Penguin, Robin and two of those great brick-built penguins really confirms that I'll be getting this, considering that I didn't purchase the Batcave. However, I am rather dissapointed that this set is so similar to the vehicles of Penguin and Robinin repectively in the Batcave set. I feel that it only really caters to those who havn't bought the set, and I would've much appreciated different vehicles. Overall, a very nice set, perhaps the best of the 2008 wave, despite it's lack of originality. Thank you very much for the review BG	positive
I was never considering getting this set as I don't really like Batman, but if I found this set and had some money with me, I would buy it!

You know I like many had doubt's about these sets when they were first mentioned, but I've decided I want the whole line now! This set is the créme de la créme. Just beautifully stunning! That is a great review svelte_corps, you have gone into fantastic detail and description of all the elements. Really it is this review that has persuaded me to buy this set. I blame you! The minifigs are great, the vehicles are better, and the truck and interior is awesome! The few minor draw backs are far outweighed by the attention to detail and the many unique and cool elements used in this set. And printed pieces! That is even better! Great job, you have obviously put a tremendous effort in making this review, and I for one definitely appreciate it! I am looking forward to these sets being available in New Zealand!	positive
MUST. GET. TWO Thanks so much, this review has truly shown this set as a brilliant one. Even those who hate this theme must admit it is greatly designed. I love the way the mini vehicles fit. I love the light brick. I love the truck front. I love the trailer. I love the missions bay. I love holding cell. I love everything!

Wow. Like others have said i was unsure about these when i first heard about them but then looked at the first leaked pics and thought they actually look pretty neat. now i have seen all the reviews i have to have all these sets. at first i was thinking they would be great as parts packs but the more reviews i see the less i want to use them as part packs and just keep them as built (or buy 2 so i can do both !!) Can't wait till they hit the shelves in the UK...... Thanks for the review	positive
Wow! Great review of what seems to be a great set. I love that ponytail. This looks to be a must have set! (It probably won't stay together for long though...) Thanks very much.

svelte_corps, a fanastic review of this biggest Agents' set. At first, I was not very keen to have this set. However, after reading your review, you have make me swing up and down. Its simply fabulous! Thanks for your hard work. I am sure it's not easy to do this review. I love that female mini-fig. She looks awfully sweet especially with her new hair. Great job!	positive
OMG! Thank you, thank you, thank you! You made my day! So that means Dr. Inferno's hair isnt rubber! But one question, is it like that weird funny soft plastic like the ants from Indy 4? PLEASE ANSWER	positive
Great Review, thanks! That's one hell of a set. I think LEGO has reached a certain kind of peak with the design, cleverness, and fun of this one. I'm so relieved that Agents seems to be shaping up to be even better then I thought it was going to be...and I thought it was going to be cool to begin with. Agent "Charge"? Not only does he look like Dash Justice, but he has the name of one of Dash's Alpha Team squadmates? I call shenanigans!	positive
Woah, I got to have this set! I shall buy it ASAP! Thanks for the review! Expertly done.	positive
Splendid review! I love everything on this set. No question 'bout it. Somehow I knew I should have saved up and buy that when come to TRU...but the sight of Turbocar Chase and Jetpack Pursuit was to tempting to pass up.	positive

I first I thought the whole Agents line would not be very good. But boy have I changed my mind! This set looks amazing, as do all of the other sets in the line. I really like how the small vehicles all fit into the truck. I don't like it when sets come with smaller vehicles and don't have anywhere to store them, so they just float on the side. That light projector is fantastic! I can't believe they are actually printed! This is definitly on my to-buy list! Thanks for the amazing review!	positive

Great review. I just got 7644 MX-81 Hypersonic Operations Aircraft. It's a great ship. I started to review it, but then it started to rain (I was outside), so the review is coming tommorow. Technicolor stickers! Very pretty!	positive
You really are an awesome set reviewer, svelte_corps!! Thanks very much for this sweet review, so in-depth and detailed, that is one sweet vehicle! It's got three of my favourite things, treads, orange, and big slicey blades! Thanks again! ~Peace	positive
These new sets are just totally off-the-wall radical :D. It's the little details like the scoops on the blades and the alternate alien energy source (Lego didn't even have to include those, but they did!) that show Lego are really getting back into their groove this year. The ability to add power functions is just so cool as well, I'm going to pick-up the Creator Monster Dino set for the electronics when the sales hit as svelte has suggested. A very entertaining review, just like the Agents mobile command center one :D	positive
This set looks 10 times sweeter with the power functions, too bad I'll have to buy some extra.	negative
Wow, this thing is very cool. Definately no lack of details, and is quite cheap for the bang of the set that you get. For some reason I really love the bay in the back of the detachable ship. Quite an improvement from last years line. Thank you for the review.	positive
I was going to buy this set anyway, but now I'm even more excited. :D My favorite part of this set is the bay that holds the little cart vehicles.	positive
Thank you for that fine review, svelte_corps. That´s a pretty cool set, much more solid than the Armoured Drilling Unit, with a nice little transporter and some for sure pretty interesting additional power functions. A very smart idea indeed! Did I miss something or is there really only one (and probably improved) shooting device? And there´re even some levers to control the vehicles.... wow. A matured MarsMission on indeed!

I ordered the extra from S@H at the same time I bought the set - but only because I had already looked at the instructions and knew what I needed. (If people have the Ferris Wheel set as well I think the small motor comes in that.)	neutral

Thanks for the great review Sveltecorps. I bought some of the MM last year and ended up selling them off for SW. This new set has got me interested in MM again, partly due to your cool review!

Excellent review. Loving. This. Set. I mean, come on, it's a flipping tank! Awesomeness is written all over this - from all those blades and scoops at the front to the mini rover. And yes, you can even turn it into a motorized battle tank! Reminds me of the old technic days when they advertised in the manuals how to hook up the kits with separately sold motors.

Well, title says it. The description, you'll understand later. I ordered this off of S@H last tuesday, and oddly enough, it's listed on S@H as MX-81 Hypersonic Airplane... I'd like to apologize for the random, horrible, faded pics. I took the review outside, and the clouds kept shifting, changing the lighting, and then I had to go inside because it started raining. It's been raining for a week. It's raining now, as I type this. So, I foolishly went outside to take pics. The front of the box. Not bad, as far as boxes go. It features a lift-up tab... ...which shows the various functions. Back of the box. Still not much to say... Two manuals. I think this is just right- Not too thick, but not too many manuals, either... Oddly enough, the box came with a little folded up piece of paper telling us not to mix the bags. It comes sorted into 4 bags, by the way. Minifigures The set features 3 normal MM figs, 1 normal jellie, and one of the new commanders. I really like this guy. He has a few issues, like his hands being stuck sideways, and still being hollow, but still a great improvement. He'll make a lovely addition to any Halloween MOC. Stickers The set comes with a fairly big DSS for the Spacecraft. Pretty normal, but I do like the dragon sticker. Then, suprises of suprises, a technicolor sticker sheet for the aliens! How cool is this, huh? The tops of the actual stickers are shiny, which is hard to see in the pic. Even the bottom is shiny! Who said stickers can't be cool? The mining craft The little guy is pretty cute, and well built. My only gripe is that there's nowhere to spin the drill! It seems so lifeless without a feature... The alien craft You'd think a Commander would be important enough to have a seatbelt, rather than be stabbed with a clip and stuck on the ship like those other grunt aliens... I think this thing has some potential. Shiny stickers, different body shape. And when you look at those engines, this thing could be an alien Corvette! But then you look at the back. Pretty bare, no flares or anything. It's a cool little craft, but it just...lacks. The modules These things have some potential, as well. With some modding, they could be pretty cool. Unfortunetly, it's pretty boxy, there are no engines, and the wings are too small. The top is pretty nice, though. The greebles are all right. The controls, as usual, are a sticker. Pretty spacious, mind you. The cockpit doesn't stay flush with the body, though. The front plate underneath it can be easily replaced with a brick to fix that. ...I'm not gonna comment on this. The main body Too bad. The 'labratory' isn't much of a lab. A trans-red panel and some tray thing are all that compose the 'lab'. I was expecting more, but true to form, this Mars Mission set has no impressive interior to speak of. There is a lot of space, though, so it shouldn't be hard to mod. Phew! The lab folds up like so. Pretty simple, and would allow access to the lab, if there was one. And then we have this thing. What is it? Defense laser? Communications array? Satellite T.V.? The modules connect like so (sorry, out of place...): Too bad the pins stick out... Various pics... As you can see, this thing has more of those bars than an AT&T commercial... (There, you understand the topic description now? ) The rear. It uses a white City plane wing for the...wings. When I first saw the prototype pics, I thought they slanted downwards... That would've been really cool. Ah, now to the platform. From the position of the drill, I think this could be a really cool turret location when I MOD it to more military space. Back to the bars. If we had space monkeys, they'd love this. This set has more bars than a jungle gym.( ) Here we see the button that drops the platform. Pretty clever, and it's not in the way. Best of all, it really works! Really well, actually. Good job, TLC. 2 more bars and a shooter mechanism. Jeeze, this is really setting itself up for a joke. A shooter mechanism walks into a bar... Never mind! Here we have the handle that allows you to pick it up safely. A good idea, but it's placed waaaay to far back, way off the center of balance. You have to hold on to it pretty well to keep it angled up, though it does stop your hands from getting in the way of the platform. Ah! The platform in action. This is really a neat little feature. Not only can the ship land in a reduced footprint, but it also prevents the nice white paint job from getting red dust all over it... It's centered pretty well, too, and you don't have to worry about knocking it over, just don't shove it back at all. Here we have the latch. When the button on top is pushed, this gets pulled inward... ...Which pulls out of this hole and allows it to swing neatly down. Good luck, and happy mining!! Again, sorry for the lack of in-progress review. I would've liked to take pics of the mechanism and so on, but typical of the MM sets, you can't really take it apart. Well, this is really a nice set, which can hopefully be upgraded with a better lab with little difficulty. Some of my military mod plans include: -Strip the lab and install a command center -get rid of lots of bars. The thing has more bars than Alcatraz. -Install some turrets. This is a big command ship, so why all the forward-facing weapons? It'll need some AA defense... -mod the landing platform to be a troop dropper with installable AA turret. -mod the cockpit pods to be more aerodymic. So, that's all folks. Shall I include one last "bar" joke?	neutral
I appreciate your review Mr. Mandalorian, but why the negativity?. I'd try to find more positives about the set instead of kinda criticizing it after each picture. I personally think it looks freakin' awesome!. The size is very impresive and I nearly fell of my chair when I saw the first pics earlier this year. It's quite unlike anything I've ever seen from Lego. Edited by radiant7, 04 June 2008 - 08:27 AM.	positive
Thanks for the great and very detailed review. I love the new holostickers! I'm still not sold on this set though. I'm not sure why... I think it's the big wing piece and the too-technicy build (from looking at the instructions). The platform seems kind of out of place. And for the size of the set, the functionality doesn't seem as good as it could be. It reminds me of 7699 Armored Drilling Unit - looks impressive but doesn't seem to do that much. I do think Mars Mission has improved this year though. Bar none, this is the weakest of the new MM sets I think.	negative

Thats the observation I had when I saw the first pictures of this set online a few months ago. I am a proud owner of the 6973 Deep Freeze Defender and 6980 Galaxy Commander, so I'm looking forward to see how the 7644 stacks up next to them. There is a definite lineage here, and these sets clearly demonstrate the evolution of Lego set design over the years. The MX-81 may not have the most playability out of all the new MM sets (although it has ALOT from what I can tell), but its hard to beat the look of a large sleek space cruiser sitting on your shelf or dresser, at least for myself.

Algernon, on Jun 4 2008, 09:34 AM, said: I don't understand why there's so much negativity... this is actually my favorite of the new MM sets. The finished look is very sleek and not very gappy at all. The deployable landing pad is great, and it'll make it easy to put on a shelf without taking too much room. Lots of greebles... although I will concede that it's just begging to be modded. Still, though, I'm definitely buying this one. :) It has a really great look to it! I don't understand the negativity either, one man's treasure is another man's trash I suppose. That said, having grown up with Lego during the 80's this set has a certain nostalgia factor in its overall look and feel that harkens back to that earlier period in my life which I fondly remember. Aside from the Factory Star Justice set (elements of which I loathe), I expect the 7644 to be the closest thing to a Classic Space revival that we'll ever see again from the Lego Group, but I hope to be pleasantly suprised someday. Though I'm not living in the past, and do appreciate everything Lego is doing now and will do, and has done since. And, like you, I'm one who's definitely buying this set. No matter how few of us there may be.	positive

Great review, Mr. Boba Fett. I really like this set a lot. Some of the features may not be as good as I hoped they would, but overall this looks to be a really nice set. I'm so happy that the giant spacecrafts are finally back. Quote I've noticed a trend that the larger sets have plenty of parts potential but when assembled the model is not more than the sum of the parts... Eagle Base certainly didn't seem worth the asking price, at least this is one large model. On a positive note the lame aero tubes, darts and martian carrier pods have disappeared. Hm, actually, I don't see the comparison. Eagle base looked terible to me right from the start, so it was no suprise when it ended up being the weakest kit in the first year. This big ship, on the other hand, looked great as soon as I saw it, and still looks good.	positive
Iron Moose, on Jun 4 2008, 02:15 PM, said: Do tell. (I'm being curious, not confrontational. ) Well, first and foremost like many other people I'm no fan of those dreaded unprinted minifig torsos and stickers. But also the cost to piece ratio of the set, it just seems too expensive for everything that you get, such as too many small parts and a lighter than usual piece count for the price. Though if it had included printed minifigs and other elements, I maybe would of been able to swallow its 100 USD cost a little easier. But Star Justice is still Lego SPACE in the most classic sense thats available today, and I will probably pony it up just because... Anyway, I hope were not breaking Forum protocol by not discussing the 7644 review of the original poster or that particular set in general.	neutral

It's certainly reminiscent of Space sets of the past, as others have said, and the drop-down ramp section is just really cool. As an idea, you understand. Sure, the lab is a little crap, but at least the effort was made (sort of ). The sheer fact that it's so big though, really makes me like this. There's just something appealing about large spaceships. Not capital ships, just big space ships. With lots of guns! Spacefan, on Jun 4 2008, 10:34 PM, said: Anyway, I hope were not breaking Forum protocol by not discussing the 7644 review of the original poster or that particular set in general. Hey, it's no worse than Batbrick and I. No, really, it isn't even in the same league!	positive
Thank you for that nice review, Mr. Mandalorian. Wow. Somehow it´s almost like Classic Space´s back indeed.... It´s a great star ship. It looks stream lined, original and impressive and even the huge plane wing part looks rather cool and smooth on it. It´s equipped at least with some kind of engines on top of the wings and although they´re made with only two a little 'juniorized' parts it´s better than nothing. There´s a lab or some sort of engine room with enough space inside to allow one or two MFs to play Scotty.... yeah! The two cockpits´re nicely detailed with a cool use of these orange 1x1 round plates and to detach one or all two of them reminds a lot of the playability of the good old Space sets. It seems even like it´s easy to attach them to some kind of Cloud City Twin-Pod Car thanks these hinged wings. Looks like some solid fun to me. Of course.... the cockpits aren´t airtight and even this reminds unfortunately of the post blue, grey and trans yellow era of CS. Anyway, there´s no real fun without some MODing I guess. Another great advantage of the set´s that it´s not overpacked with shooting things. One technic shooter, cool in grey and only one trans orange prison pod too. Well, I can surely live with that especially since it´s nicely asymmetrical. The drill rover´s very charming, a little like a rebuilt Oldsmobile Convertibe stranded on Mars. Sweet! And that platform feature´s plain nifty and well done too, very playable and useable for a lot of things. Hmm.... recently I complained a lot about the dense use of studless technic beams for the inner structure of vehicles like these ExoForce tanks par exemple which makes MODing (in an economical way) pretty frustrating.... but the beams here´re used in a very proper way. It should be fairly easy to MOD, let´s say, the back of that lab section up to perhaps even the cockpits to create a larger airtight area that could be boarded from the platform.... just to fit this certain spacers need for, um, realism.... There´re many more nice details too like that 'satelite t.v.' thingy and that cylinder with trans blue 2x2 dish for the knob or these cylinders with cones on that handle, and that Alien craft´s pretty nice and detailed as well. Like I said before.... I really feel like Classic Space´s back.	positive
Hey, thanks guys. So you tolerated the bar jokes and faded lighting? radiant7, on Jun 3 2008, 09:01 PM, said: I appreciate your review Mr. Mandalorian, but why the negativity?. I'd try to find more positives about the set instead of kinda criticizing it after each picture. I personally think it looks freakin' awesome!. The size is very impresive and I nearly fell of my chair when I saw the first pics earlier this year. It's quite unlike anything I've ever seen from Lego. Algernon, on Jun 4 2008, 06:34 AM, said: I don't understand why there's so much negativity... this is actually my favorite of the new MM sets. The finished look is very sleek and not very gappy at all. The deployable landing pad is great, and it'll make it easy to put on a shelf without taking too much room. Lots of greebles... although I will concede that it's just begging to be modded. Still, though, I'm definitely buying this one. :) It has a really great look to it! Spacefan, on Jun 4 2008, 10:38 AM, said: I don't understand the negativity either, one man's treasure is another man's trash I suppose. That said, having grown up with Lego during the 80's this set has a certain nostalgia factor in its overall look and feel that harkens back to that earlier period in my life which I fondly remember. Aside from the Factory Star Justice set (elements of which I loathe), I expect the 7644 to be the closest thing to a Classic Space revival that we'll ever see again from the Lego Group, but I hope to be pleasantly suprised someday. Though I'm not living in the past, and do appreciate everything Lego is doing now and will do, and has done since. And, like you, I'm one who's definitely buying this set. No matter how few of us there may be. I'm sorry you guys thought I was being negative- I actually love the set. It brings a real feel of Classic Space to MM (No, I'm NOT talking in the third person. ). However, it does have its own small issues, which are nothing, really. I said that there's not much of a lab- but that's the beauty of lego. There's a lot of room in the ship, so it should be a piece of cake to mod to a bigger lab. Too many bars? I'll take them off. I really like the set, I just want to change it to suit my tastes. It looks beautiful- It will find a home among my other MM sets as a favorite. Iron Moose: Good question. It's about 17 inches wide, 11 inches tall (with ramp down), and 16 inches wide. As for the platform, it's pretty stable. It tilts back a small degree so it doesn't collapse when tapped on the nose, but I wouldn't leave it on the edge of a table while in that position.	neutral
I think this thing is compensating the poor lab with the bar army.	positive
Nice review. Just one little point. Since there is no sound transmission through space, but there is an atmosphere on Mars through which this this thing supposedly flies, hypersonic airplane makes far more sense than hypersonic spacecraft ;)	positive
Sorry Mr. Mandalorian, I guess I was just getting a bit defensive because when this set first appeared here, there were literally 2 pages of people just bagging out the new MM sets (but then the thread took a turn and people started to warm to them, much like the Agents). I do agree that it definitely needs some MOCing, but with that work I think it has the potential to be a really amazing set in terms of what you could cram into it. The lab is a little disappointing, I've always wanted an enclosed cabin space in a vehicle this size because then all the little space guys can have a true meeting place! The drop-down landing ramp is my favourite part, it has lots of potential uses. Maybe it's even possible to integrate pneumatics :D	positive
Hello SheFOLS and AFOLS, as well as TFOLS, welcome to EB News Reviews, I am your host...For tonight anyway... Shadows will take over after this episode, if we make more... Today we are reviewing Mars Impulse sets 5616 and 5617. Starting with 5617 Alien Jet, I must say it is a small and quick build, the jellie, is made of hard plastic, which surprised me, as I had expected Jellies to be a soft plastic. The jet is mainly 2x4 plates, some swingy hinges, the "seatbelt" and a thing which I cannot seem to name My one gripe about it is that the Jelly cant see where he is flying, it looks better with a MF in it. There was a red 1x1 as a spare part. We move on to the 5616 Mini Robot, which is basically a "safe" brick, with binoculars, soem cheese slopes, little arms, and legs. The best part i must say was the metal detector and "safe" brick, as these seem to be quite rare in sets (By my knowlage anyway). The austronaut has a face, shown in Dr. Sinsters review. The set also comes with a pick-axe and lime green gem. Extra peices where a cheese slope, a green 1x1 and a white droid arm. That concludes these mini-reviews. I also will use this opportunity to show my photo setup. Both sets are reccomended, if you either need a army, or are just trying to get a variaty of figs like myself.

A very nice little review of a pretty nice little set that I wish I'd bought between 1 and 10 of. Just for the griffin. Oh well. Your review has shown me that it's useful for more than just that, so maybe I'll try to pick one up someday. Can't have too many black capes, books, or printed things. Speaking of which: WhiteFang, on Jun 9 2008, 09:41 AM, said: Interesting parts It comes with a wizard book, owl, 2 printed tiles with a spider and stone prints on it. The far right, seriously I don't find any good use for it. Can any EB members enlighten me on that gray thing on the right? The gray thing is technically a plume, like any castle plume, except in this case it's a feather (presumably from the griffin), and made from the mold to the old Indian feathers in the Wild West sets. It's a case of an old part coming back for a slightly new use, in a new colour. Beyond that, the "stone print" tile is a bundle or rolled up blanket or package, depending on where it's used. I don't think it's ever meant to be a stone. It was used as a rolled up pack on the back of the Star Wars speederbikes, for example. Nice pics, plenty of useful information. I'd give this review an A+ Thanks for doing it!	neutral

Guys, thanks for your kind comments! I am glad that you have enjoyed this review. For this set, I think I bought about 7 to 8 sets, all for the griffins. It's used for my griffin riders in my Castle collection. Now, the green and brown parts come in very handy for Castle MOCs too. imperialshadows, on Jun 9 2008, 11:13 PM, said: A very nice little review of a pretty nice little set that I wish I'd bought between 1 and 10 of.

I must have overlook it, and used it as a stone tile instead. Nevertheless, I am glad you have give me some good insights on the parts that I am not familar with. svelte_corps, on Jun 10 2008, 10:49 AM, said: Thanks for the nice review - it was one of the first ones I got when emerging from my dark ages . I bought two of these, just for Buckbeack - I thought he would make a good statue in a Persian temple type MOC. I also liked the minifig head pumpkin and plant part in bright green - both new pieces to me at the time. All in all, it was a good castle or forest building set with a nice selection of pieces for rocks, grass, plants and trees. The dark bley plume piece also now appears in the 10185 Green Grocer set as detailing on the roof of the turret. I never thought of using Buckbeak as a statue for worship. I find this concept very interesting. Yes, I agreed that this set offers new parts at that time. Personally, I pretty like the green plant. Good for any kind of terrain settings. I did not realise that the dark bley plume piece appear in the Green Grocer. Thanks for pointing out. Edited by WhiteFang, 10 June 2008 - 03:39 AM.	positive
Ohhh great idea to review the "old" Potter sets! Especially the line from Prisoner of Azkaban... I was in my Dark Ages then. Luckily I was able to catch up on the missed figs with one internet order. This Draco is the best TLC has made, if you ask me. The new one (also doubling for Belloq and "guards" in the Indy line) doesn't look quite as hautain as this one. Buckbeak looks cool. Looks like his neck/head can be moved, right? Rather similar to LEGO horses. Well designed. The orange brick doesn't have a pumpkin face on it, right? Unlike the one from Philosopher's Stone in the set with the troll. I'm looking forward to more reviews by you, sir WhiteFang! Good work	positive

I bought about 5 or 6 of these sets when they were on sale in mid- 2006. I still have a few of them laying around unopened. I think I payed like under $5 for each and thats a great deal for all the variety of neat parts you get with this set.	positive
nice review. I like the treemaking pieces the most of this not very expensive set. The Buckbeak fig is very nice and can bow his head like the horses. I was annoyed to get another Draco without some other not made figs (Pansy Parkinson for example). About the dark bley feathers; In the second version of Hogwarts there were several of these feathers put in little 1x1 cones like it was a feather to write with it. I bought 2 sets of these and when they were for sale I just bought +/- 6 more of it. Only annoying that I had then even a bigger army of Draco's.	neutral

Great review. The hippy and the "story" at the end were hilarious. I think this was easily the best of the Spiderman 2 sets. You're right though - it wasn't movie acurate, as the actual movie dock was far shabbier and more trashed than this. Ah well, I guess TLC couldn't do everything.	positive

Hi Everyone, Please note that this review was done back in 2006, so do forgive me if you happened to notice any dated comments. Product: 6205 V-wing Theme: Star Wars No of pieces: 118 Release Date: Feburary 2006 RRP: SGD29.90/USD9.90 Availability: Lego Shop@Home, Target, Toys 'R' Us (US & Europe), Bricksworld (SG). Lego.com said: Rule the spaceways! The sleek V-wing fighter can adapt to any situation! Position the wings and flaps in attack mode to protect Palpatine's shuttle from enemies. Or position the wings in flight mode to survey the area for intruders! Either way, the V-wing is ready to strike for the Republic. Includes Clone pilot and R4 droid. Position wings in attack or flight mode! Sorry to all for the delay, since this was supposed to be done 3 days ago. Anyway, to get on with it... Quite a minimal amount of baggies for this set, as noticed. And the best thing is... no sticker sheet. Yippee!! :bounce: The completed v-wing. Though not really a complaint, it would be nice if the entire astromech body was provided instead of only the head dome. :p Of course, then it wouldn't be movie-accurate, since the Q7 series astro-mech is integrated with the starfighter. :lol: He's definitely well-painted for a simple mini-fig. Since even the back is painted too. I have to assumed this is the same mini-fig provided for 7259 ARC-170 Starfighter too, since I don't have that set. Anyway, this mini-fig is much more accurate for this v-wing since his suit is rated against vacuum, while those in the arc-170 aren't . :p One thing that's lacking is the instruments panel in the cockpit... it's totally non-existent here. I wonder what went wrong during the design stage. Personally... this is the second most anticipated set for 2006, the first being the tie interceptor, for me. One thing is that there's no known release of the V-wing starfighter by hasbro, nor the other well-known brands. The other thing is that being a star wars vehicle collector, I would really loved to see a replica toy of the V-wing. And the V-wing by the Lego Group does not disappoint... it's nearly movie-accurate, except for the cockpit transparisteel cover which could used some paint like the x-wing's. Also, there's a permanent landing gear that quite neat, since it allows you to land the craft on uniform surfaces. The s-foils on the other hand can be quite a pain to pose into flight position. Very difficult for the s-foils to remain symmetrical during play. The "swoosh-able" or play factor of this product is quite good... just check out the pics for yourself... :D *Crackle* General Skywalker, we have incoming! To conclude, the v-wing starfighter would make a much better companion to the Eta-2 Actis Interceptor (Jedi Starfighter), than the arc-170. Coz the arc-170 seems more like a long-range bomber to me, than a snub-fighter. :p And a final pic to show it at rest... Comments (For 2008) Just an updated pic to show my latest display on the clone wars Hmm... off the record, I do understand that sometimes, reviews by most tend to a certain set of guidelines like naming the set, and showing the boxed, and out of boxed pics, and of course, the grading portion. Regarding my review, I prefer not to grade any of the lego sets at all as far as possible, because to each, his/her own. My reasons to put up a review is not to belittle the efforts of TLG in coming out with these products nor to help them market them, but to show my appreciation and enjoyment of these products. I hope noone is offended by this, and would like to apologise for any misunderstanding that this may caused. For those who do not understand the above paragraph, care not for it and Play On!

Thanks for the detailed review valentin it had good picture quality and a nice little comic near the end. Although this is a slightly older set it still was a good one, I remmeber that I bought two of them to build up a small airforce for the Republic, and if I see another one I may buy it for use in the Starwars Comic game. Keep up the good work .	positive

I picked up this set mainly because of the many (5+spare) glow in the dark parts and the promise of 2 racers and one helicopter for the price of a little more than two racers (90kr. vs. 2x40kr.) The box The back of the box shows the two alternate models you can build if the polybags rip. There are 3 cheese slopes and two 1x2 tiles that glow in the dark, where the tiles are exclusive for this set. The total parts count is high at 142, but there are no really big pieces among them. Inside the box you will find the building instructions, a sheet with some odd sticky labels (thrown away) and 3 polybags marked by the bag building difficulty. The models The lime colored car doesn't bring out anything new. We have seen racers built like that before, but it does contain some nice bricks for the collection. The police cruiser surprises with an interesting design along the sides as seen here. It is harder to build because of the greater level of details: The helicopter is without doubt the hardest vehicle to build in a bag. I can't finish it because it's larger than the bag. You can't put on the top blades nor the tail of the thing, so it beats the forklift from 7733 where the top bar is the new kind that doesn't completely fit. There is also instructions for the alternate models, but it requires the bags to be opened... The vehicles are pretty standard for the racers theme with the police car being the highlight of the set Conclusion I like the difficulty curve between bag 1 and 2, but the last bag should be labeled 1000000 instead of 3. It requires some inhuman skills to build that helicopter in the bag... ? Lime colored car: 3 - We have seen it before, but it has some nice pieces... and lime. Police Cruiser: 9 - It has a massive diffusers, rare parts and a high level of details. It is a shame LEGO relies so much on stickers. Helicopter: 6 - if you see it as a set for one fourth of the price of the cars, it is quite amazing, but you can't bag build it and I would personally prefer some more detail instead of the big size. Overall it is a nice little set, but the police car is the main attraction. I wouldn't get the other vehicles if they were sold separately.

Seeming as there were no reviews of this set in the index I have uploaded mine from Jabbas Hutt . Here is my review for LEGO set 10178 Motorized walking AT-AT Because I live in the UK I got this set with 6 free duracell batteries which was great! (It's just twice as expensive as the US) Heres the basic set that is from the instructions. This is the cockpit but please note after I took this photo I realised it was slightly built wrong. Heres one of the feet in proportion to a minifig to give you a general size. This is Luke Skywalker swinging on a wire trying to destroy the AT-AT I really wish LEGO didn't make so many Luke's because I want differnt minifigs. It would also be nice for a thermal detonator piece. Underneath the AT-AT you can see the shaft that moves the back legs, the motor and squeezed in on the righ t the massive battery box. A load of cogs that move the legs. These are the included figures Snowtrooper, General Maximilian Veers, AT-AT Driver/Pilot or whatever you want to call him and Luke all whithout there wepons. please note Veers should have a dark stone snowtroooper torso with 4 red and blue badge things not 3. These are the figures with weapons I gave them and the included ones Snowtrooper has new style blaster, Veers has Standard light grey pistol like the ones from the old adventure sets, AT-AT driver has old style blaster which I call heavy Blaster and Luke has SHINY HANDLE blue Light Sabre . The Shiny blue light sabre was included with the set which is a bonus because i really dont like the grey ones. http://www.brickshel...sc00521.jpg.jpg This is the switch which is attached to the battery box on either side of the AT-AT underneath the lift up side panels. you push the forward to walk forward and backward to walk backwards simple eh . A front veiw with the the panels open. Here are the Drivers controls which are simply a cotrol panel and 2 exo-force robot hands which are joystick things seen in the film if you look closley. The almost useless carry handle. This is the weird back piece. Looking down the AT-AT from the back where you can see the the battery box and switch. Troops decending from ropes and cables and Vader leading the assult for this I hadnt got any more imp's so I used Clones Pilots. (I now have a whole load more snowtroopers) Solo and Chewie sabotaging. More troops to squash rebel scum huzahh! A very bad picture of everyone packed up inside. The size incomparison to its predecessor Overall I would give this set 9/10 because it should come with more snowtroopers or it could be and Endor version with loads of strormies and scout troopers. Aswell as this you can really sit any one down because of the battery box but I stilll find space to put all the shown figures on this review in the interior as you can see on the above image the chains and ropes are hanging down a bit. Tjis set is now limited to 5 per customer in the UK and now no longer comes with free batteries. The walking on this is a bit wonky and dosen't really walk like they do in the film as it moves two legs at a time. I am currently attaching a motor to the head to make it move independently.	negative
Nice review, I have the original AT-AT and I like it a lot. Considered buying this one but it being motorized made me not. Also, I think a set this size could really come with some more snowies! Benny	negative
I mean by the Clone Turbo Tank turned into the AT-AT I think in the films. When they changed all there technology and vehicles when they became the Empire.	neutral
As far as I know the AT-AT was a invention by General Veers himself? Benny	neutral
Nice review ! The "Driver/Pilot whatever you call him" ( ) 's helmet looks kind of odd, and why does have a long red pole instead of a kick-butt lightsaber?	negative

I never got the set. It looked way to skinny. I came close to buying it for the figs but then decided not to. If you compared this one to the later one there is a big difference. This one just didnt seem proporshined with the legs and its body.	negative
thank you for the review, Skipper. I never got this set because it was too expensive, and motorized. It completley reminded me of the old robotic toys called Zoids, or maybe even Gundum. At least the figs are great. A chrome lightsabe hilt for luke, ecxellent. and the pilot is cool too, and another snowie doesnt hurt. and i didnt even know about the commander guy (whatever you call him), so people could have made a custom DS this whole time?! thanks again!	positive
Hmmm, ive still got this set and i must say, i think you did a good job of reviewing it. But... Overall, i hate the set, probably the worst UCS set so far (apart from the naboo fighter but that hardly even counts as UCS) from my experience. Unless you really really want it and have nothing better to spent your $$$ on, in that case go for it. But in my case, it was a very repetitive build and final model was quite... well, bland, not must variety to it, if you know what i mean.for the price, i would really reccomend the UCS star destroyer, because thats a much better story..	negative
even though i never liked UCS, i absolutley hate this one. Sure, its great on display, but the build looks extremley boring to me, just stacking plate after plate. And as you said, its going to break a little if you touch it. The only intersting part for me is the firing laser. Although i do have to say the proce isnt too bad, i still wouldt buy it. And no minifigs so thanks for the review, but ill pass on this one. The new minifig scale DS looks awesome though, and this might have hyped some up who are buying the new DS,	negative
Grevious, on Jun 24 2008, 10:12 PM, said: Thanks for the review. Eh, honestly, I though this was awful ever since I first saw the pictures. To me, an incomplete grey ball doesn't really work as a special UCS kit, for the sole reason that it's BORING. Extremely so. Now, the new Death Star playset is a whole different story. They should have done that in the first place. There's nothing to add to Grevious' post. Thanks but I never like the big grey ball. Benny	negative
Great review KimT . I like this set (even if I don´t own it) because it looks simple fantastic to display. I just have one question: The mini Executor can be moved around the Death Star II or its attached to that place? Thanks for the review .	positive
Good job KimT, it´s a really nice set. It will be interesting to see the size of DS2 UCS compared with the new Death Star playset. Keep up the great regulator job you are doing. Morten	positive

Though there is 4 "spots" where it can be attached to the DS. Reading your comments on this set, I can see why TLG has been forced to put it on sale on the US S@H. I don't agree that the ISD is better - IMHO they're exactly them same - big and grey This is a question of personal liking - which is the coolest DS or ISD. Not comparative. I'd still call this an ok UCS when looking at it individually, but there sure is a lot other UCS sets that would get a better score than 5/10. KimT	positive

Great concise review KimT, though its not for me, you held my interest all the way through! Thanks ISC	positive
I think it's a very weird and boring UCS set, but... What a lot of grey plates! You could build something much better out of them, but it would be fairly flat. It looks very fragile though , my UCS AT-ST is... Edited by Shoc, 25 June 2008 - 10:28 AM.	negative
I also don't feel this is a very good set. But is that old grey? In which case it would be a nice part pack... Dr. Brick	negative
Thanks for the review KimT! Honestly, like the others have said, I don't find any appeal in UCS sets, especially this one. It's just a big, incomplete, grey ball.	negative
The build was a bit boring and I suppose a big grey ball isn't all that interesting, but since the Death Star II in the movie is a big grey ball too, I don't see the problem. I didn't think it was particularly fragile. I don't care about minifigs or playability either. A few plusses: in my opinion it looked pretty damn impressive sitting in my LEGO room and the construction is really clever. All in all, I actually liked this one, but perhaps I have a different expectation of sets than most of you. Sets are mainly parts packs and would you look at the quantity of grey plate in this thing! (It's new grey BTW). I paid half price for it at shop@home UK, which is still a _lot_ more than half price from the US, and I didn't regret it for a second. Cheers, Ralph	negative

Not comparative. Here are some advantages that makes ISD win for me: - A lot more fun to build with less repetitions - It is easier to build alternate models from it! (How many alternate models of the DS2 have you seen?) - The bricks are more varied. - You get magnets! - It is a larger set if you look at the size	positive
Wow, what a letdown. I recently picked up this set, and I looked up this review to see what I was getting into. Not good news. The silver lining is that it was a "Damaged box" deal at Brickworld, so it only cost me $100 (half off the already lowered price) so it was definatley worth it as a parts pack, if nothing else. It's the last unopened/unbuilt "large" kit in my collection, so even if it is repetetive, I am going to build it anyway. It is likely however that I may substitute pieces to do away with the colored interior. I've already determined that after it sits on display for a while, I want to do a Zepplin as an alternate build. Looking at the parts list it looks like its the perfect set for such an undertaking.	negative
I'd love to get my hands on one of these, but you'd need about three jobs to justify the prices of this guy on eBay. Fantastic review KimT!	neutral
KimT, on Jun 24 2008, 03:22 PM, said: 4: zero swooshability I think its very swooshable, assuming you swoosh it at the same speed it moves in the movie. :D While I would never do something like this, I bet if you packed this sucker with a bunch of M80 firecrackers it would make for a fantastic end to a stop motion movie.

I've just ordered the bits for this from bricklink (I'm awaiting the final order now) so I'm interested in these comments. I can see that, since I'll be building it with the kids, I'll have to plan in plenty of breaks and do lots of parallel building to keep us all from getting bored!	positive
7656 General Greivous's Starfighter Release: 2007 Number of Pieces: 232 Minifigs: 1 Brickset Welcome! This is my first review, so contstructive critisism is very much appreciated! On to the review: First, we start out with the box: The box art is the same as always since 2006. nothing special. Then we start the build. The build is fairly easy, and will take the seasoned builder about 15-20 min to complete. Here is the finished model: and bird's eye view: As you can see, this ship is very sleek. The fins or "wings" each have an outer slope and an inner one, with the guns in between. There are also cones on the front of the fins, which give the ship an even more sleek look. In the middle of the wings there is the main body, with a big slope and stripes decorating it. This set has a very good playability factor, as I'm about to show you now. The guns on the ship are pretty cool looking to begin with; a bley slope attaching a lightsaber hilt and a trans-neon green stud to the fin on each side. But theres more than what meets the eye: Yes, the guns flip up! ...and they can flip all the way back to hide them, for whatever case they need hiding. Lets have a look at the back, there is a tail fin used as landing gear and some lightspeed boosters: But wait... The tail fin can flip up for flight thanks to a hinge attached to the back of the cockpit. Heres another playability factor: The cockpit can slide open very smoothly and easily. Heres how this is possible: A clever system under the hood allows the cockpit to open. See those two bley pieces on the black ones? Those bley ones attach to the tan plates under the hood, and the hood and windsheild attach to the black peices. The black and bley pieces work together as a sliding system, so the cockpit opens. Viola! And then the cockpit snaps in place thanks to the red hook and clip. Its a very accurate system, and works very well. You'll want to open and close it over and over again! Now, finnaly to the fig: The General himself. A very impressive fig, with a new head and torso mold. In this set, (which is one of only two with Greivous in it) he comes with 2 green and two blue lightsabers, all with bley hilts ( ). I was hoping for chrome hilts, but its a minor fault. Grievous also comes with a new mold pistol blaster (not pictured). Heres the General in the cockpit (sadly a weak cockpit, no details): He just half lays down on a small slope. In this set, he doesnt come with a cape beacuse with it on, the cockpit doesnt close. Thats about it, heres the... FINAL VERDICT: Build: 7/10 Fairly easy but fun. A little bit weak. Playability: 8/10 Many playability factors, but some are boring or pointless. Swooshability: 8/10 very fun to fly around, sometimes pieces break off. Minifigs: 10/10 one amazing fig with 4 lightsabers and a new blaster. what more could you ask for? Design: 9/10 very sleek, but hardly any real texture. i like it, but others might want greebling. Price: 10/10 Overall Score: 9/10 A very cool ship with a very cool minifig and accessories. One of the best SW sets I have ever seen for its small price I highly recommend it to any kind of SW, LEGO, or SW LEGO fan. Hope you enjoyed my review, please leave feedback!

Very nice review Jim! I haven't bought this set yet, but am planning to just to get a GG fig as I don't have one already. Bought an Imperial Landing Craft instead this week as it was on sale, but after this review, GG's fighter is sure to follow soon Benny	neutral
The set no longer looks as ugly as I've always thought. Thanks for the review - I might have to pick one up now to go with the MagnaGuard Fighter.	neutral
Does the sliding cockpit come off easily? My friends brothers breaks everytime you touch it, but he may have built it wrong. It put me off the set.	negative

It put me off the set. im very sad to say that SOMETIMES it does. but thats only if you hold it from the top and bottom with your fingers and thumb respectivly. But if you hold it in your palm or from the sides, it wont break. Emphasis on sometimes. But dont try to mess around with it by removing its pieces or adding new one, or modding it in any way, because the sliding mechanism wont agree with the mods and break. But this hardly takes away from anyone liking this set because, IMO, its perfect just how it is.	negative

Hello all Eurobricks members, I will be doing the second wave of the 2008 Impulse set series, which had released recently. I bought this set earlier ago, and will like to share this comprehensive review with everyone of you. Name: Troll Warrior Theme: LEGO System / Castle Year: 2008 Pieces: 19 Minifigs: 1 An image of a 5618, Troll Warrior Let the march begin The mighty brave troll warrior, carrying a dangerous cart equipped with a "flick" fire missile. Marching into the lands of the Crown Kingdom. Crown Knights must be ready for this new troll addition. From what I see, this set has a very minimum piece count since it's an impulse set. There is no unique parts found in this set. However, this set has a couple of useful accessories, such as 2 spears and 2 wooden wheels and a grey mouse running around. This set is another alternative for Castle Army builders to buy multiple sets, to build a massive Troll armies. In addition, the flick missile really works. Use a little bit of force from your finger and flick it, the missile will fly. Well, it certainly does not impress me at all with such playing feature. Base of the cart Different angles There is one thing I dislike about this set. The wooden wheels are too big, and it is the same as the ones in the Crossbow attack. I prefer the smaller wheels that exist in old castle sets that produced smaller cart. Since this cart size is similar to the old cart size. The old wizard's cart is a very good example of the proposed wheel. Bits and Pieces Close-up on the warrior and the mouse Summary review Playability: 5.5/10 (The playability feature is not fanastic.) Design: 6.5/10 (Design is adequate. If the wheels is much smaller and the flicking thing disappear, the score will be much higher) Price: 8/10 (An inexpensive set to get a troll warrior and a mouse.) Overall: 6/10 (To conclude, this set is good only for army builders. A new range of millitary vehicle to be added. That's all) Hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine. Comments and Critics are strongly welcomed. Pictures can be found in My Brickshelf (When moderated) Edited by KimT, 10 August 2008 - 01:29 PM.	positive
It's all good... BUT!(I know, you expected a but ) It's a rat.	positive
Thanks for the review. Bearing in mind that the whole point of this set is to get a cheap troll warrior, I actually quite like it. The cart isn't brilliant, but for 13 pieces it's not that bad. The troll fig is great as always, and I guess the rats are always nice to get (not so much in real life though). The sets that contain the trolls have a fairly solid number each (I mean, Tower Raid has three!), but nevertheless I think I may have to pick up a few of these.

Its a good review but you forgot another thing. THE Troll needs a shiled like they used to in the 2007 castle line the sets always had shields for the minifigs and it could be better if it was 3.00 instead of 3.50 but yes it is a good impulse great army builder.	positive
A more affordable troll warrior for those of us avoiding the large sets (me) is always nice! Thanks for the review! God Bless, Nathan	positive

Now, will there will be a dwarf impulse set in the future? I supposed that will be much interesting. G.L.MAN, on Jul 3 2008, 12:15 AM, said: Its a good review but you forgot another thing.

If this impulse set includes a troll shield, my rating will defintely go higher. This is a troll army builder set, with minimum feature and limited weapons range. If the troll comes with an armor or a shield, I will think this set is worth it. Troll armor is hard to get by, as it appeared only in Troll Warship and Tower Raid.

Hey, your review is great (as usual!!) As for the set itself - well, it's an impulse set after all - small and cheap, nothing special.

Guys, thanks for your kind comments. It seemed most of us here love this impulse set, mainly to build army. Guess, I am a little bit too critic in my review. I was expecting a little bit more!

Give the new theme a chance. I feel TLG have made an effort to revive certain elements that are present in past castle themes. Although it is not as good as the past, but it is certainly better than the recent castle themes. Shoc, on Jul 4 2008, 01:00 AM, said: Why is mouse friendlier than rat? Well, mouse sounded more friendly, because it can associate with Tom and Jerry. But, calling it a rat equal calling it a pest.. It's just a matter of putting it in different terms. That's all. Edit: Instead of posting another post to explain why I used mouse. I will write it here. Tom and Jerry is reflected as a cartoon. Children associate Jerry as a mouse, since its supposed to be heart-warming and make us laugh. In real life, there are many different pets we raised. One of the possible pets we considered is a mouse. Mouse are supposed to be shy and friendly creatures that live in harmony. While rats lived in packs, hunt food in the dark and is widely regarded as a "pest". In this review, I am trying to illustrate rat and associate it with mouse by presenting it in a much friendly approach. There is no right or wrong answer. It's just making use of different words to represent how I feel towards a particular thing. Edited by WhiteFang, 04 July 2008 - 08:08 AM.	positive

Looking at this is making me want to build one of the favourite sets of my childhood, 6649 Street Sweeper (might do that today actually).

Thanks for the review! Poor little minifig: This guy has to haul the heavy machine all the way from the depot onto the littered streets to locate some trash, but when he has finally found some and switches on the machine everything will be launched towards his pants....

Hello all Eurobricks members, I will be doing a continuation of my Impulse set reviews. This will be the third review at a go. Hope everyone of you will find this review useful in a way. Name: Coast Guard Kayak Theme: LEGO System / Town / City Year: 2008 Pieces: 21 Minifigs: 1 An image of a 5621, Coast Guard Kayak Roll Roll, Roll your boat It seemed the coast guard has a kayak of his own, roaming in the sea, making sure that swimmers will be safe in the beach. Now, I am illustrating him as a life guard instead. This set is simply wonderful. Among the 4 new impulse sets, Coast Guard Kayak is the best looking set in my opnion. The kayak design is very simple but looks realistic . Furthermore, if you don't need it to be a coast guard kind of stuff. Use it as a leisure water spot instead down in the marina. I will think any LEGO citizen will love to have some water spot in their busy life. So come down here and wind down with this new sport. Bits and Pieces Kayak and the bouy The bouy is very useful to position it at the coast of your water to highlight the boundaries in the sea, and warning incoming ships or vessels. Oh, I did not make it tilted purposely. There is a white round base which allow it to tilt on both ends. Useful parts These parts are useful to add on in your city. Somehow, when I see that red cone, I can use it as a police stop, to inspect vehicles on the road or form a barricade with it. The bouy base shape is unique too. I like it very much. It is great to attached it by the side of the boat as a life bouy. The coast guard's life vest and helmet are very useful for water activites. The life vest was produced in past sets, and now it re-surfaced again. I am glad these vests made their way back. A look of him, without the life vest Summary review Playability: 7.5/10 (Fun to play with, especially the bouy when you see it moving up and down.) Design: 8.5/10 (Design is simple but straight to the point, especially the kayak design.) Price: 8/10 (An inexpensive set to get more coast guards and more kayaks.) Overall: 8.5/10 (A very good set to have in your LEGO town. The kayak is simply so lovely to me.) Hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine. Comments and Critics are strongly welcomed. Pictures can be found in My Brickshelf (When moderated)	positive

Hello all Eurobricks members, This will be my last impulse set review for the second wave. Hope everyone of you will find my reviews useful and helpful in your purchase. Name: Crystal Hawk Theme: LEGO System / Mars Mission Year: 2008 Pieces: 26 Minifigs: 1 An image of a 5619, Crystal Hawk Alpha 3 in Sector 5, reporting to base Alpha 3, Crystal Hawk, reporting for duty, Sir! May I present Mars Mission, latest scout craft, code named "Crystal Hawk". This spacecraft looks very sleek and cool with its usual white and orange color combination. I am not a fan of Mars Mission, but these white mini-figs simply attracted me for it. In fact, I only owned its impulse sets, and none of its main sets. Nevertheless, this set has the "swoosh" factor. I was swooshing around in my home last night. Well, I am not swooshing it like KimT though. Am I seeing double? Haha, the answer is "No". It has double sided face. I combined the pictures, to illustrate the two facial expressions. Bits and Pieces Different angles Love the way how the wings bend upwards and downwards. The only thing I find it a little bit wierd for spacecraft. Normally, I thought joystick is the typical navigation controls for a spacecraft instead of a steering wheel? I am not complaining about a steering wheel in a spacecraft. To me, it's quite an uncommon sight. Anyway, the white steering wheel is an useful part for making vehicles MOCs. Summary review Playability: 8/10 (Fun to play with when you bend the wings up and down.) Design: 8.5/10 (Design is simple, but creates a sleek and cool look.) Price: 8/10 (An inexpensive set to get more scout craft and mars mission mini-figs) Overall: 8.5/10 (A very good set to have for any Mars Mission fans, and for collectors like me whom can't afford all Mars Mission sets, this set is a very great alternative.) Hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine. Comments and Critics are strongly welcomed. Pictures can be found in My Brickshelf (When moderated)	positive
One of the better impulse sets IMO.	positive
Glad you enjoyed viewing the review. xenologer, on Jul 3 2008, 01:12 PM, said: The Hawk, it seems to me, lacks a cockpit, theres not even a seat to keep the pilot from falling off. Perhaps it they'd redesigned it to be a backpack jetpack sort of unit using similar pieces, it'd at least make some sense? These are some of the improvements which we can do it ourselves to mod it better. I think these are great suggestions. Otherwise, we can add in a white air tank to be included onto the mini-fig. xenologer, on Jul 3 2008, 01:12 PM, said: Based on the other MM impluses, Can we assume this goes for 3.5$USD? at that price it seems to me, that the Astro Fighter at 5$USD was already a superior impluse set. Guess I'd buy one on clearance, for the minifig. In S@H, Crystal Hawk is priced at USD $3.50. I bought mine at a much expensive price, when you compared it with USD. I never bought the Astro Fighter. I am supposed that it comes with a little bit more parts and an additional alien fig with it.	neutral
Thanks for another review WhiteFang! This is quite a nice set actually. It evokes some of the design elements of the MX-11, while looking different enough to justify me buying it. The head on the astronaut is one I like, so even better. I hadn't realised it was that one actually. Does 26 pieces make it one of the bigger impulses sets? I think I may have to get one, if not two... Plus it's called 'Crystal Hawk'. How can that not be considered cool?	positive
Nice Review good little set probable one of the only impusle sets i will be geting untill/if they make Agents Theme impulse sets And i like the neat double-sided face Edited by Darth_Legois_619, 03 July 2008 - 10:35 AM.	positive

IMO, Impulse set total piece count should be 30 or less. It will be ideal and more ways to construct a much better impulse sets such as past impulse sets that we came across. I may be wrong, on the 30 piece count thing. But, this is how I view Impulse sets. Brainbox, on Jul 3 2008, 06:11 PM, said: Plus it's called 'Crystal Hawk'. How can that not be considered cool?

Thank you for the nice review. This set has a very classic space feeling, so I don't care about the lack of cockpit. A nice little set with a nice minifig.	positive

I know the word "Secret" base but whats this! The Base is hardly secret with a massive laser gun and wide screen sticking out It looks good, Lots and lots of Orange! Woo!	positive
This will be a wonderful set for a Mustafar MOC	positive
I didn't exactly know where this belongs the best but i think it fits the best in here cause it's somewhat space related. I got this nifty little set yesterday from an auction ebay, new and sealed! I think the rock raiders theme was a great theme, and i wish they would have continues id back then. But anyway, let's see what we got here: Set Nr.: 4910 Name: Hover Scout Number of minifigs: 1 Number of pieces: 39 Release Year: 1999 First, a picture of the little box & instructions: A general overview of the set: And here we have the lovely (?) Miss Jet! (yes, the minifigures had odfficial names in this theme ) The little vehicle: And finally the Crystal Analysis Station. i like that very much, even if it's simple, but it does a good job and the amount of equipment also is cool: That's it, little set, little review, but big fun. I can recommend that to everybody, it's great for the parts, and the minifig is lovely. Gets a 10/10 from me	positive
excuse me but..what?	neutral
Woo! Rock Raiders! Only the best theme ever! (That's right, possibly even better than Castle `07!) Cheers for the review metalandi, hopefully you can inspire others to see the greatness of Rock Raiders too! I love how everything was so simple, yet so effective. It was loads of fun to play with and build the alternate models when I was younger as well (and probably still is ). Do you plan of doing any other reviews? Or do you have any other sets? Rapid Rider is another great small one, adding a bit of diversity with a water-based vehicle, and you get the Bandit minifig. Or you could get The Rock Raiders set, and get all of our spelunking friends (don't make me name them all ). Or, if you want a slightly bigger set, Loader Dozer could be the way to go, Axle's a pretty cool minifig too, and you get a rock monster. Sorry if the last comments were detracting from your review, don't think I didn't like it, becuase it was great! I really hope you can do more! Oh, and yes, my torso does come from a female fig... ~Peace	positive
Unfortunately i dont have any other sets yet, i think i got one of the bigger vehicles back in the time, but i don't have any sets from this time anymore. but i certainly plan to get the loader dozer and/or the Chrome Crusher soon. I found an ebay auction where somebody is selling the sets 4940, 4950 and 4970 new & sealed hopefully i have luck with that. It's only at 4 Euros right now, but it's still running 6 days... http://cgi.ebay.de/w...t...A:IT&ih=005	neutral
Great review . Man, this brings me back! I still have like 5 of those rock monsters. In response to your statement, Rock Raiders does belong in this forum, being everything space related. 1) It's on an alien planet 2) In the computer game's start and in the story (yes, there was a computer game-my cousin has it) they are in a space ship 3) There are huge alien rock monsters trying to kill them.	positive
Rock Raiders was one of my favorite LEGO themes ever.	positive
This set looks like a dandy. Is the Darth Maul fig any different in respect to the torso or head design to the original?	neutral
Nice review Jim, I think i would only buy this for Darth Maul though you definitely showcased all the cool features really well!	neutral
I got this set last year. And I think you made a mistake when you have remove a piece to access the probe droids and equipment, you just have to slide the entire main part. And I have a question, is this equipped with the new flick-fire missiles that don't fall off?	neutral
Thank you for the nice review. I like the design, although I didn't want to buy it. The new little speeder is very nice, but maybe a little to small.. Darth Mauls eyes are looking a bit more dangerous now.	neutral
I'm not real fond of slimeface. He looks too much like the joker-bombs. I was hoping for something newer. The slime printing is a nice touch though. Steve	negative

Great review, ReZourceman! Your pics really show off the sub well and it's good to see the build in progress. I also have this set but I didn't apply stickers to the sub as I was planning to reuse the nice dark blue pieces. However as shown in your review they do brighten it up a fair bit. I can't say this is my favourite Agents set; the boat is a little oddly proportioned and the sub, although retro looking, has practically no interior and would be difficult to customise to put more in (unlike, say, the clever job Batbrick did with the Penguin sub in his review). The sub kind of looks like some Jules Verneish sea creature - I would have liked it if they'd gone all the way and made it some kind of giant robot jellyfish or squid I do agree with you about Slime Face - he has a fantastic torso with all the slime dripping down which is a bit obscured by the air tank. It's really encouraging that in the last 2 Missions we've had great extra villains added in. The only thing I would add about the octopus is that the glow in the dark plastic is mixed in unevenly with the aqua blue, so it doesn't glow in the dark evenly - it's kind of like the Mars Mission jellies in that respect though much cooler! Thanks again for the great review!	negative

Darth_Legois, on Jul 11 2008, 10:28 AM, said: [color="#0000ff"] *Cough*AlphaTeam*cough* I'd forgotten about Ogel's mutant vehicles I guess I meant a bigger cross between the 8636 sub and the big squid from 7775 Aquabase Invasion - that is such a great design. Sort of keep the retro feel but make it bigger. With the 8636 sub, there's really only room for one Agent to sit and despite its size, there's just a few (not amazingly great) functions such as the hidden chest and missiles.	positive

Thanks for the review! It's great to see detailed pictures of Slime Face. The set looks good but not as good as some of the others in this line. Great review!	neutral

Nice review, thanks! TLC is really going all-out with the Agents theme. I wonder if it will last longer than one year (unlike other recent one-and-done themes). My only real criticism of the theme is those freaking stickers. My god, look at the size of that DSS in this set!	positive
Great Review!! Really Thanks I Slime Face, Even Slimey as my Slime Sense Nice That Break Jaw is also in it! Undersigned MoWo	neutral
Aside from the price, I love this set! When I saw the prelim pics of Agetns I did not like the theme, but all the sets are starting to look more attractive now I can see the cool features and details! As for this set, I really like the bad-guy boat for some reason and the submarine looks good - I love the dark blue colour.	positive
I forgot to comment on this review! Great job ReZourceman, like svelte-corps said your pics really show off the set and what there is to it. I just ordered this and the volcano base off S@h and I can't wait for them to come, so I'll comment on these reviews I forgot about I love the Inferno boat, as you say in your review it looks very heavy duty and ready to take on the Agents. The sub I quite like from the look of it, though there is the problem of too little space I will try and correct that. The dark blue is especially good. And I love Slime Face, his torso is very cool. svelte_corps, on Jul 11 2008, 09:14 AM, said: I can't say this is my favourite Agents set; the boat is a little oddly proportioned and the sub, although retro looking, has practically no interior and would be difficult to customise to put more in (unlike, say, the clever job Batbrick did with the Penguin sub in his review).

I know he has slime marks on his head, are they very apparent? Thanks again for the review! Batbrick Away!	positive
svelte_corps, on Jul 19 2008, 10:20 AM, said: Nothing is impossible to mod! Probably the easiest part to change would be the front where the missiles are and the treasure chest slides out - you could make a sizeable compartment there. However the middle section is so narrow and the end fins are just that - fins - that it might be harder to expand without changing the shape of the sub. You'll find out soon when yours arrives! Thanks for that info, I will definitely try anyway when I get the set, see if I can't loosen up a few dark blue bricks at the same time! svelte_corps, on Jul 19 2008, 10:20 AM, said: It's not really clear but since all the other mutants are evil (or at least controlled by Dr Inferno), it's probably a safe bet the squid is too. Slime Face's head is different to the Joker bombs - different eyes and teeth (although the smile is similar I guess) and the slime marks are much more apparent in the flesh (or ABS) although they don't photograph that way. Joker bomb face below for contrast: Ah, thanks for that info, I see that they are more different than I thought now. I hope the slime looks good when I get him! Batbrick Away!	neutral
Inertia, on Jul 21 2008, 12:29 PM, said: Wow, thanks for the review, that is one awesome set, I think we need some new agents, there's so many Inferno minifigures now... Maybe next year? There's only 2 Infernos out of 8 sets which is pretty good. There's way more Agent Chases and Break Jaws. I agree though, next year hopefully we'll have some new figs.	positive
Great looking set. And that glowy blue octopus is really cute, I might just get it for that. Be great in a Space moc.. Wondering, from the pdf instructions I saw, it wasnt clear what the Agent in the sub is sitting on, hows his seat work? and it looks like theres a compartment below him...	positive

Thanks for the review. This is one of my favorite space sets of all time. I even had 2 of them back in the days. My only complain about this set was that I found that the wheels where too small , I had some trouble passing the rover over the little "craters-mountains" of the space plates	positive
This is a great little set. I like how it combines two very different color schemes for different parts of the model. I have made some slight modifications to mine, adding a roof on the vehicle and a back wall on the outpost. Also, those white 1x1 headlight plates at the front are thinner than the modern kind and seem to be quite weak. I got this set off ebay a while ago and one of them was broken in shipping, even though the set was otherwise in display model condition, and the other one broke off while I was building the set. I replaced them with the newer variety. mutex, on Jul 10 2008, 11:37 PM, said: My only complain about this set was that I found that the wheels where too small , I had some trouble passing the rover over the little "craters-mountains" of the space plates The only bad thing about this set is the name.

Thanks for another informative review of the best Lego theme ever, and not in attempt to hijack your thread but to add to it, here's a pic of my blacktron 1 version of this beautiful set. the 6927 has to rate as one of the best 5 classic space sets ever along with 918, 6970 and 928.	positive
Give me an excuse to sneak into your house, and let me have a feel of these Classic Space sets. I never had a chance to have any experience with the Classic Space sets. Through your recent reviews on these, it gave me a wider perspective of space. I loved to play space as a child such as the late classic and Futuron sets. Back to the review, this 6927 is a great mobile command center vehicle suitable for all kinds of harsh terrain in the unknown space. The 6 big wheels are real solid and firm back in those days. Transparent blue windscreen at the front, is wonderful. I just love these parts, especially when it's in blue. 4 computer printed tiles. Aren't LEGO so generous back in those days, when printed parts are more commonly available unlike now. It's a real nice set. However, there is one thing I don't understand about this design. Why is the driver seat has a wide back with no cover behind? And, the command center has no door at the back? I understand that these Space guys are always carrying their helmet around, for oxygen supply. I wonder if there is a better answer to it.	positive

i've always associated this set with 6929, the Voyager. they're of the same timeframe and more or less the same style. 6927 is without any doubt my favourite ground vehicle of space. it was pretty simple, but it was such a creative set. the stories you could tell with this model... g... most defenitely in my top 5 of space sets...	positive
This set never got me as a kid. I suspect it was because of the wheels; I had mostly Basic sets so it would have been more of the same.

I added a completely new forward-cab, close to the ground, for a ground--observer to monitor the terrain. I added even larger wheels, allowing this variant to truly be "all terrain", ...besides, what good is it having a combat vehicle if it gets stuck in the middle of a firefight? The 6927-W has a five man crew: a driver, a gunner who also serves as overall-commander, a terrain observer in the very front. In the lab are the weapons systems officer and computer/tech specialist. The All-Terrain Warrior vehicle portion is armed with lasers and blaster cannons, with options for other weapons. There are short-range nuclear rockets on the lab, guided by the rader control. The lab now has blast-proof shutters on the windows protecting the crew from rocket blast. Additional protection can be added to the lab, if-need-be, such as more extensive blast-shielding. All-in-all, the All-Terrain Warrior is a beast of a machine. Two 6927s can protect an entire convoy of standard 6927 or 6927-C.

Yeah, first time that I am getting a set before everyone.^^ First of all: The package The european version has no "Limited Edition" button. Hooray!!! Sorry for the blurry back-shot. We see the hospital back, a few bubbles with set functions and a little comic. Comic: Bubbles: The figures are injured Spongebob, Patrick and the new Fish Doctor. Spongebob has a headprint... ...and a backprint (other than the normal Spongebob). Spongebob and injured Bob: The set comes with two litters. The ambulance car is a bit extraordinary. I don´t know how the car is like in the show (and I saw a lot of episodes) but it looks a bit strange, mostly because the weehls are too small. Of course we get another SS (not so D this time). The litter fits in the back, with help of this lid. I wish it would be the hinge-lid from before 2004... Now we come to the meanpart of the set: The hospital! The entrance has got babyblue traindoors and a hudge sign that shows "Emergency". The tubes are nearly everywhere in this set. I was getting insane when I came to the part, where I must put the stickers on the tubes. This parts are very usefull, but I wanted that the set looks good, because I will display it. So I stickered just two of the parts and not all four. Now we come to the interroir: The doctor has a desk with computer. Sadly it´s not very well placed and he must duck because of his fin. Next to the door, we get this little case, wash basin and two drawers. Again we get stickers... Not that I don´t like stickers. It´s just: Everytime I get to the part where I must put the stickers on, I think how I can re-use the model and if I rebuild the model, later and and and... I hate it to deside! A few posters are in it, too. The set is a great addittion to your own Bikino Bottom, but the playability is not very big for the kids. They can just play that Patrick steals the ambulance car, like shown on the package, and is hitting Spongebob. Than the drive back, the doctor gives Spongebob two medicines and let him go. I bought the set mostly because of the parts (tubes in lightbley and a few woodpieces). But I am thinking about let it stand in my little Bikini Bottom (just consist of Crusty Crab and Chum Bucket). Playability: 3/10 Figures: 10/10 Price: 8/10 Design: 9/10 TOTAL: 30/40	positive
Thanks for the review, looks like a great set. I'm surprised that spongebob's bandage has a full body headprint so kudos to lego for that	positive
oh so spongebob was the injured one. I thought this set depicted the episode wherein Mr. Krabs was the one rushed to the hospital.	neutral
Thanks for the review! The interior looks nice, better than I expected, Lots of great parts but, as you say, so many of them are stickered. After Rocket Ride, the stickers in the SB sets seem to have gone crazy - the early sets weren't slathered in them. 2 new figs though is most welcome.	positive

lots of yummy pics in the review thanks! hmm a double sidied minifig, with a painted top! thats the first time i have ever seen this done!?!? this is a great set and has recieved as evideneced by a lot of "is it new" questions, is sponge bob sets available in Auzzi land? i have not seen them in shops... Regards Cpt. PB	positive
How much euro did you pay for it? It looks a great set, great interior, nice figures and funny posters. :) It's also nice: the newest Spongebob sets are now also available in our stores and they are the coolest (Belgium)!	positive
Wow, that set looks better than I thought! I just might get it if its under $30 USD. I love all the details inside, and it seems to have a better interior than the City hospital... and the new figs look nice...	positive
Thanks for the pics, this set is necessary for each Spongebob-fan, it looks so great	positive

Nice review, NFT! I´m not that much into SpongeBob, but these two pieces just for themselves are interesting to get: container cupboard 4532 and cupboard drawer 4536 the latter not being sold for the last 6 years! Both together are an excellent way to create detailed interiors. 6 of those for me, please!	positive
There's a lot great pieces in this set, I would be willing to get the set just for them. Thanks for the great review!	positive
My fish doctor has the torso from 7902 Doctor's Car, which is unfortunate, because the other torso is more stylized and cartoonish, I think. However, I did have that mad scientist lab set, so a bit of digging through my old collection will hopefully yield the better torso.	neutral
I recently bought this set for my daughters birthday. It's the first BELVILLE set that I've bought for her so it's a bit of an experiment. The house is 5 rooms and it's made up of mostly large pieces. There still is a decent amount of normal LEGO in it though. The doorways in the house align when it is opened out. Starting with the bathroom, included is a shower, toilet, sink with vanity and a baby potty. The mirror sticker is one of the few that I put on. The open plan lounge/kitchen/dining room is well appointed as well and it has a nice glass table and coffee machine. The kitchen chairs are Fabuland parts... and don't work really well. It seems they are having jellyfish for dinner! The clock is the only printed part in the set. Upstairs is a baby room and the master bedroom. The radio and the TV (not shown) were stickers to my disappointment. Up top is an extra room suitable for reading. (Those antenna things were made from spare parts by my daughter. I have no idea what they are supposed to be... ) There are some stickers that go on the back, but I didn't put them on. As it is the set looks OK this way, but since it is a dolls house it doesn't really matter. I do think though that the fireplace should have been given a back. The BBQ is made from normal parts and is quite effective. I think it uses the same light brick that's in the 4998 Stegosaurus set. My kids were using it as a torch before my grumbling ruined their fun... Like all BELVILLE sets, the highlight is arguably the accessories. I'll be borrowing a few of these from time to time... Here is the controversial baby catapult. As you can see, it works OK, but LEGO probably should have tried a bit harder. We also bought for her 7583 Playful Puppy. It also comes with some nice accessories, but not enough to justify buying unless you want the rest of the parts. Poor puppy; where does he sleep? Here is my daughter assembling it. She made me make the house though as she wanted to play a game we bought her. (Note the LEGO drink bottles! ) I didn't take any photos of the figures as they don't seem to be anything new, but I can if people want me to. At the time I was in bit of a hurry as I took these before bed so I wouldn't be stressed if the kids broke it the next day. Overall, these sets seem overpriced to me, and hard to justify unless you actually want a buildable doll's house. (Which we did.) It's still too early to tell if my daughter likes it or not... but at this stage it seems she lost interest in a few days. She does tend to go back to toys though.

Yay! It's good to see your kids get to build some stuff too, Sinner . All through the review I was thinking 'This was a present - but who actually put it together?' so I'm glad the last pic cleared things up As for the set - it looks much bigger than I expected - I think it does make a good sized dollhouse. There are a stack of nice pieces in there - cupboards, oven, trans-blue 2x5 bricks, all the accessories, plants, flowers, food, the light-up brick, the pink roof slopes - but not enough to justify the $AUD129 retail price. Maybe on sale I'd pick it up and resell the Belville figs but David Jones hasn't even had a regular 20% off Lego sale for the whole of this year that I've seen. I think the Playful Puppy set is a horrendous ripoff for $AUD20 though. I agree with the baby catapult - the range is terrible. Lego just isn't trying any more, is it? At least they've moved on from throwing cats off three storey buildings. 2 questions though. 1) Was it a fun build? 2) Are those large figs anatomically correct under their frou-frou finery? If not, what the hell are they doing in the second pic whilst baby Sylvia explores the oven?	neutral
I was sort of hoping for a flick-fire baby. Still, this looks decent, for what it is, I guess. Obviously, it really is all about the accessories, and it's got 'em, but not enough to make me spend that kind of cash, and I don't even mind having a pile of pink parts around. If you throw in a complete turkey or some birthday cakes, it's a slam dunk, but as it is... eh. Thanks for the review, though, it's very nicely presented and leaves no doubt in my mind as to just how easy this set would be to misuse for other purposes.	neutral
Nice review, good to see your almost letting your kids play with your lego I like the functionality of the baby catapult, its good that they include some working features in a build this big! Are you not showing the figures because its really Hugh Hefners Playboy/Belville Mansion? I dont see the grotto though, must be an add on set like the poor puppy! Its just so darn PINK	positive
The LEGO lives on!! But you are one evil parent, getting your kids addicted to Belville like that! But uh... whats that doll doing on the bed? Whats underneath it...? And look what you found... a bucket!	neutral

A nice review with a nice touch of Sinner which made me laugh. The playfull puppy set has saussages I think I would buy a playfull puppy, It has nice pieces and the puppy can also be used for minifigs as a big dog. Why haven't they not made a saussagesseller for City. Maybe in the future. There are already more chickenlegs in minifigs sets.	positive

Sinner!!! You know, I had never seen a BELVILLE set in any review with such great pictures before! I just can't take my eyes off, in the Master Bedroom. The scene is quite, a little hot. Enough of me, peeping up there. Let's take a look at the interior. I am very surprised by its construction of the house. It's quite big and is nice of you to buy a great sweet gift for your daughter. I am very sure, she will enjoyed playing with it. Somehow, it reminded me of Barbie Doll products. Maybe, its too pinkish for me. The accessories is the "plus factor" in any BELVILLE sets. It offered quite a handful of great accessories to add into any types of MOCs construction to add in the plus factor in it. Sinner, you are a very nice Dad! I like how parents, buy educational toys for their children to expand their imaginations instead of sitting in a couch playing video games and etc.	positive
Thanks for your report and the pics, my sister wants this set, but she's already got the last house And she doesn't play very often with it, but the new one looks very good, too	positive
I'm confused... the finale of Big Brother Australia was last week. So why only now are we seeing pictures of housemates Brigette and Ben performing a striptease? And where is Rory in his signature g-string? Very odd.	neutral
Sinner, on Jul 25 2008, 09:47 PM, said: I'm still undecided on if it was a smart buy. She played with it a lot this week, but last week she ignored it... and I had to fix it twice! My daughter is 12, and she still plays with all her Belville stuff (mostly the fairy princess castle sets). If your daughter is anything like mine, you will definitely get your money's worth out of it. However ... as soon as my daughter says she's done with it, I plan on raiding the sets for all those great food and accessory bits. Patience .... Great review, by the way. The Belville sets are indeed overpriced, but they're probably Lego's best attempt at wooing the girl audience (I still hate the fact that TLC thinks they need separate "boy" themes and "girl" themes, but whatever). They're a very nice alternative to Barbie -- you get posable figures with realistic body proportions, plus some creativity and building aspects thrown in.	positive
I bought this today, mainly because it was 25% off, but I'd been eyeing it for a long time. The accessories truly are brilliant! There's so much here to be pillaged for other uses, as people have said. I picked up heaps of new parts I've never had, or rare ones in even rarer colours. To be honest, I was surprised and impressed by the range and versatility of the regular bricks as well. When you look at the box art, what jumps out at you are the giant pink walls and curved pieces, but there's a nice amount of white arches and lime green bricks, not to mention all the windows and the trans blue 1x2x5 bricks. And plants! It's a good thing the target audience likes stickers though, there's more here than I've seen on any set except the 7709 Sentai Fortress! I think they were aiming for one sticker per page of instructions I hope Belville returns in 2010 Thanks for the review, Sieggy! Did your daughter ever go back to it?	positive

7655: Clone Battle Pack Year: 2007 Number of pieces: 58 Number of minifigs: 4 Price: 9.99 USD Brickset Welcome to my third review on Eurobricks, I hope you enjoy! While at any store that sells LEGO (Target, Wal-Mart, TRU, etc.), you will notice that the clone battle packs on the shelf are way fewer in number than the droids battle pack. As you might guess, the clones are way more popular, and finding them gets harder and harder as the release date of this set goes farther into the past. So stock up! Alright, heres a pic of the box: A small box, as expected for inexpensive sets like these. Note the "Build your army" button on the front: TLG obviously is encouraging customers to buy multiples, and with good reason, which will be explained later in this review. Well, lets get straight to it: The contents of this set. You will notice a speeder bike, a gun turret, and some clones. Looking good so far! Lets have a look at the turret: An excellent Star Wars element to have around, especially for MOCing. It is very cleverly built, using a tire guard from CITY sets for the general shape of the turret mount. All you have to do is attach the (new mold! explained later) gun to the 2x1 plate with the center stud, and... Presto! I wonder how the clones build these turrets to fast in the middle of battle... A rear view: With a clone mounted: My only gripe about the turret is that you have to take off the gun in order for every clone to have a gun. Now, we move on to the vehicle of the set, the speeder bike: A rather sleek and good looking bike, with some useful pieces on it as well, such as the blue cones, the megaphones, and the engines. Some say it looks bare without the figs mounted on it, but I think it looks just fine. The commander drives while a trooper shoots on the back. A side view: And a rear view: My only gripe is the same as the turret: you have to remove the back gun for all the clones to have weapons while on foot. The back pistol attaches to a 2x2 round studded plate with a Technic hole in the middle. Finnaly, here are the new guns: This set comes with 1 new blaster rifle and three new pistols. It could have included one more rifle for the turret. And of course, the figs: Includes: 1 yellow commander (lovely fig), 1 Shocktrooper (comes with a pair of elctrobinouculars), and two regular troopers (so clean and white). The figs are excellent, all that any SW or LEGO fan should want. It could have maybe included one more regular trooper, but that might be pushing it. Thats all for now, folks, here is the... FINAL VERDICT: Build: 8/10, extremely easy, should take the seasoned builder about 5 minutes to complete. A fun build, though. Playability: 5/10, I guess you can get this with the droid battle pack and make them battle, but this set has no real play features of its own. But it is good for collecting troops and using them for MOCs. Swooshability: 9/10, I guess you can zoom the speeder bike around... Minifigs: 10/10, four great figs that should be bought in multiples, a great army builder. Design: 10/10, a clever turret, an awesome speeder, and four great clones. What more do you need in a 10 dollar set? Price: 8/10, not bad I suppose, but if you calculate a dime for each piece, this set should come out to 5-6 dollars. But still, billions of these are being sold world-wide, and TLG is making a ton of money off of them. Overall score: 9.5/10, a truly memorable set, one that will be a favorite for ages to come, and very popular. A great army builder for a small price, plus vehicle and turret! With only a few very minor flaws, this set is one of the best of Star Wars. And this concludes my review, and as always, comments are most welcome.	positive
I got like 5 of theses Hope we get the New clone battlepack, Do you ever think we will? We will only get 5 Clones if you buy all the New Republic sets...	positive

7654: Droids Battle Pack. Year: 2007 Number of pieces: 102 Number of minifigs: 7 Price: 9.99 USD Brickset Hi everybody, and welcome to my fourth review on Eurobricks. Today, I will review the Droid Bttle Pack set. NOTE: This set originally came with four megaphone blasters for each battle droid, but I replaced them (along with the crooked arms) with the new blaster pistols and new twisted arms. A picture of the box: As it is on the shelves of major-retail stores. A small box, as expected for inexpensive sets like these. Note the "Build your army" button on the front: TLG obviously is encouraging customers to buy multiples, and with good reason, which will be explained later in this review. An overview of the set's content: You can see a droid carrying vehicle, a STAP, and some battle/ super battle droids. A look at the carrier: A light tank. Note the guns on the front: The guns and cockpit can turn a little bit left and right from the main body. Also, the guns can move up and down, free from the cockpit: And check out the cockpit: Two 2x1 center studded plates side by side for the pilot to stand on. Now, moving on to the STAP: A small, very useful vehicle in the SW universe. These are seen frequently in both the movies and games (as well as other multimedia). The design is very clever, using vertical building and a clear stand. Rear view: The guns/ handlebars can go this far back: And finally, the figs: The figs are very good, but very common. We havent seen SBDs in a while, and now instead of metallic blue, they are metallic dark grey. The worst part of this set is that the battle droids have the old arms and guns, while the droids in the MTT and clone pack (both of the same year as this) have the new ones. I wonder why TLG decided to do that... again, This set originally came with four megaphone blasters for each battle droid, but I replaced them (along with the crooked arms) with the new blaster pistols and new twisted arms. So thats about it, heres the... FINAL VERDICT: Build: 8/10, very easy, should take the seasoned builder about 5-10 minutes. Playability: 6/10, has a few play feature, but nothing exciting. Is good for MOCs and army building. Swooshability: 8/10, I suppose you could fly around the STAP... Minifigs: 7/10, the battle droids are good, but very common, and the dont come with new arms or guns. The SBDs are very nice, and in a new color. All figs are great for army building. Design: 8/10, the STAP was clever, but the carrier was a little bulky. Price: 10/10, as fair as it gets. Overall: 7.5/10, the figs are great to have and make MOCs and armies, and the vehicles are pretty cool (the carrier is a little lame). The main problem with this set is that the BDs dont get the new guns or arms, so they dont fit in with all the new sets. Also, droids arent as cool as clones. But the price is very fair. And now, my review has ended. Unfortunately, I believe this will be my last review for a long time for two reasons: one, the remaining sets that arent done (according to KimT's index) I either don't have or are broken or have missing pieces. and two, my budget is low right now, and I wont be able to get the Clone Wars sets right when they are released, so someone will probably beat me to reviewing them. Too bad, because I would love to do an RGS review... well, as always, comments very welcome!	positive

Hello all Eurobricks members and Town Lovers, This is my first classic town review. For today, I will be featuring the 6641, 4-Wheelin' Truck which is produced in 1987. For some younger members in EB, you might not have encounter such a baby roaming down the streets, horning at others with its big massive truck. Considering this is a 1987 set, such a vehicle size is considered big in those days. Name: 4-Wheelin' Truck Theme: LEGO System / Town Year: 1987 Pieces: 80 Minifigs: 1 Price: USD$6.50 An image of a 6641, 4-Wheelin' Truck *Hello Everyone* Why the name 4-Wheelin' Truck? It is because this truck is equipped with 4 heavy duty wheels which is considered "big" among other small vehicles in Classic Town. Please take note, most of the vehicles that are produced in Classic Town era, are 4-studs wide. This truck is no exception. Meet the driver and his truck! This truck has a very good combinations of different colors that are common for most town vehicles. It made used of blue, white and red as its primary combinations. I find that this combinations is quite soothing to its eyes especially the blue bricks. In addition, the mini-fig torso is superb. The driver must be a great fan of this vehicle. I realised most truck drivers in the classic town era wear this most of the time. I wonder if its some kind of an organization? Front view There is 2 red doors coupled with the truck, to enable the driver to get in properly. This vehicle is considered big in the 1980s. However, if you compared it with the current city vehicles, this truck certainly will not outsize the current designs. Please take note of the wheels. The wheels are pretty different. I don't remember seeing these wheels in many other vehicles, maybe some members can help me on this. Most of the classic town vehicles have a window frame on top which is known as a "sun-roof". In this set, this feature is also included. Furthermore, the vehicle frame has a simple mechanism which all town lovers love. It is to lift it up and place their driver in and out the seat. Most importantly, you do not have to take off the entire window frame just to put in the driver. Different angles of the 4-Wheelin' Truck SNOT Technique? Back 20 years ago, LEGO had been experimenting with SNOT technique. You can see that the back looks very neat without the studs. In addition, it can be quite useful to place a mini-fig on top of it, or throw some baggage for some quick getaway. Summary review Playability: 8/10 (Great addition to your Town collection.) Design: 8.5/10 (Very good design. I love 4-studs truck. At least, it is able to occupy one side of the lane) Price: 9/10 (An inexpensive set based on the 1987 pricing) Overall: 8.5/10 (A must have for all Classic Town lovers, we have been complaining for more wider range of vehicle) I gave it a "4" based on my Review Score Card. What about yours? Hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine. Pictures can be found in My Brickshelf (When moderated) Edited by WhiteFang, 13 July 2008 - 12:08 PM.	positive

Love this set! Nice review also.. I had the set in my hands a few times but never bought it, though I drooled at it, I remember. I guess I didn't get pocket money at that time, it was not that common around europe in the 80s I guess. So better to say that no one bought it for me.. A few years later I got the safari truck, which is also really sweet. I like the colors of this model and the detail of it. The minifig is really classic, made only for this set (appears in some later train sets as well) and shows the exact image of the truck on the shirt, including the motor piece. One of the most detailed and loveliest little sets from a sweet era of Legoland city! PS Voted "O" for Outstanding. Edited by Zzz, 14 July 2008 - 09:50 AM.	positive

I never really liked those wheels, honestly. They're from the basic sets, mostly, and they work pretty well in those, but i'm just not a fan... the roof, on the other hand, was very popular and the blue modified bricks at the front were quite rare in those days, but generally speaking, this was not the star of 1987. I wouldn't agreed less. This set is a good to have and is defintely not the main highlights in 1987. This is actually a great add-on to your classic town vehicle collections. After seeing so many typical police cars, ambulance, fire engine and etc, I need more variety of civillan vehicles roaming down the streets.	neutral

OMG! OMG! Wow! That's simply amazing. Wow! I can't say more... Wait, I can. This is such a beatiful set. I sure hope it will be available for us to, like European people. It's so nice. It looks like the real thing, great cottage, great pieces, great van and figures. And the windthing. Wow!	positive

Wow! Managed to find a pic on Brickshelf and this is a great set. Hope it going to be released properly and not just a promo. One thing though, would it not be quite noisy if you lived in that house	neutral
That sounds amazing! A wind power plant as a Lego set is absolutely awesome and helps the Lego City to get environmental energy. Regrettably I missed the pics. When browsing through BS I didn't find them, too . Can someone please post a link or sent me the link/picture via PM ? Thanks. Klaus-Dieter	neutral
I now found pics, too. That's absolutely ! After 10188 Town Plan this is the best City set ever! I really like the neat landscape with the little hill (there are a bench and some flowers on it, too ) and this brilliant cottage ! Great idea with that power function that the wind mill turns and then enable the lights of the cottage ! Concerning the City theme I must say: In the last time TLG comes up with one great surprise after the other. Does anyone know where and when it'll be available (this year I think - otherwise there wouldn't be already pics, would they?) and how much it'll cost (I think about 70 Euros, what do you think?)? I only hope that it'll be available in Germany, too, otherwise I would be really if I am not able to get it since it is a must for every City and environment fan!

OK guys, respect TLC? crazy policy (They don´t take care about thiefs selling those sets long before official release,but they complain about one small photo on web ). If someone still needs photo, simply email me on josefzizka@post.cz, I will be glad to send you three pictures	neutral
you just bring memory's back i never had one of the space port sets, but i know that as a little boy i visited my toy store and kept on looking to the boxes. on BL those sets cost too much for what ist worth today. really, TLC should bring this theme back! Space port ON!	positive

Thank you very much for the review. NOW I remember! I got Mission Control when I was only 5 and built it with the help of my older sister. I loved it so much, I never rebuilt it but now... I just have to! Space Simulation was one I never got but looks to be a great set.	neutral
WOW!!!! I'm just surprised...I thought these were all street dated for the 26th of July. At least that's what I read according to Lucas information. Oh well, gratz on getin one of the new sets. I'm looking forward to seeing the Droid Gunship and the Twilight real, real, REAL soon!	neutral

The Figs They're possibly the best part of the entire set, all in all. Nice new head, although the glasses limit its usability. I am in LOVE with the head on that fig. It's perfect for any number of figures - a good 'scarred hero' face has always been on my want list. I'm turning him into my Viking warlord after I post this review. Again, a new head. Great stubbly beard thing going on. My second-favorite head of the lot. Great for warriors, especially with helms. The torsos are fantastic for special forces figures, if anyone's planning to do something like that. Not TOO fond of the lime green on there, but it's still extremely usable. This is actually a really cool machine gun. I like it. I think this would be a good point to note that ALL designs you see - outside the figures and dinos - are stickers. That means a crapload of stickers. If you can't stand stickers at all in a set, don't buy this.	positive
The Copter This is one BIGASS copter. The photos really don't do the size justice. Lower cockpit with cool computer. Too bad it's a sticker, although I'll definitely leave this one on. Upper cockpit with cool computer. See above. Awesome gatling gun. Yes, even the TECHNIC BEAMS have stickers. I'm actually really fond of that little canister thing. I can see using it elsewhere. Yes - that's a sticker. The rope and hook. I forgot to mention it before, this set comes with two accessories besides the machine gun - binocs and one of those little things to slide down the rope. Also, the thing that 'extends' the rope turns. The other side, because they're slightly asymmetrical. One of my favorite stickers. The door says 'SURVIVAL EQUIPMENT'. It's on both sides. Definitely a keeper.	positive
The base of the propeller. It wobbles a bit, but doesn't fall off. Very sturdy. Right side of the rear propeller. And the left (and better) side. The tail. It uses construction similar to the X-wing's nose, but on a larger scale. Definitely cool. A very neat part of the copter. The guns are constructed so that... ... they turn without turning the cockpit. The interior is rather blase, though.	positive
Another of my favorite parts - landing gear. This is the front section. ... and it retracts! Unlike most ships with landing gear, this does NOT retract without effort (coughXWINGcough). Very sleek. The back landing gear. ... and again, smooth retraction. Gotta love it. FINAL SCORE: 8.4/10 Parts: 8/10 Figs: 10/10 Dinos: 2/10 Copter: 9/10 Value: 7/10 Don't Buy If: - you can wait for Vikings - you don't like any set with stickers - you're not a space fan Buy If: - you're a space fan - you don't mind stickers/don't apply them - you're like to create cool figures Overall, I think it was worth the price, even at 605 pieces. However, I'd suggest buying Vikings even considering this. Well, hope this review (unexpected as it was ;-)) helped someone out there. Until next time, Bloody Jay	positive
Great Review Jay !!!!! Tks a lot ;) I am not that of the big fan of the copter due to its proportions - but I admit its really asome looking, better as I expected :oD The best are those MFs !!!!!! They are truly awsome !!!!!!! I wiil but some of the smaller sets just for the figs hehe (too bad that my favorite - your second best - don't come in the smallers sets :'( ). Are you going to review the other sets as well ??? That could be cool !!!!!	positive
Thanks, Bloody_Jay. Another brilliant review. I really like the helicopter. Though I hate the stickers (it seem like there are a lot of it), it won't stop me from buying it. Too bad that when will the Dino line arrive in Singapore. . . :'( Guess I've have to wait for the meanwhile.	positive
That looks like a really great set, although I don't think I'd have anywhere to put it. I don't think I'll ever be able to get the set anyway, since it doesn't come out over here.	positive
Photos are not available, but basically it is: -guns +chains +ropes +crates	neutral
Wow, great review, for a great set. Thanks Jay. I really like it, although to big for my city. :( I too really like the MFs. Because of your review, I am definitely considering it. Thanks again, LegoBmw.	positive
That's interesting news about the European release. I'd definitely be interested to see how they modify the set - chains, ropes, and crates are definitely useful pieces. Can't wait for pictures. To everyone looking for just the figures - don't skip out and get the smaller set and the tank. Spend the extra $20 and get the T1. It's well worth it. I might pick up the Steel Sprinter and the Fire Hammer myself, still trying to decide. If I do, I'll review them.	positive

Thanks for the awesome review, metalandi! Your pics are very clear and you go into detail about all the functions of the set.

I even like the helicopter better than the oversized version. Lots of great parts and a really nice build by the looks of it too. I can't wait for this to be released in Oz!	positive

Very nice review and nice set to boot. Lots of little features that increase the playability.

Good review ;) I will buy it this year :)	positive
Excellent review Metalandi. It's always great to see early pictures of new sets. This set really reminds me of an oil rig, and could probably be easily modified as one (if one wanted an alternate model). The two components that I like most are the boat crane and the control room, but other sections are pretty slick as well. Are those printed pieces in the control room, or stickers? I'm really starting to gain an appreciation for these new coast guard sets. They've come a long way over the years: 575 Coast Guard Station -Released 1978. I picked up the Control Boat & Tower (7739) a few weeks ago but haven't opened it yet). In any case, thanks for taking the time to review this set and share it over EB.	positive
Great set and great parts pack as well! I guess I´m gonna buy this when it´s on sale, just for the orange parts. Excellent for Exo Force	positive

Nice review! This is just the "Crown Jewel" for the Coast Guard theme. I love the layout of its platform. It looks real neat to have it placed it in the midst of the deep blue sea, awaiting of any emergency rescue. Sometimes, I feel that this set can used it to merge with my Aqua Raiders sets. I thought of using it as a land base, for the raiders to dock in their stuff before submerge into the ocean. Ok, it's just a wierd idea of mine. Just feel that Aqua Raiders and Coast Guard can work hand in hand, since they are naval expertise! It seemed, I can't view all the pictures somehow. Nevertheless, I can still view some of it quite well. I love the command center. The amount of computer printed pieces simply make me smile, with the monitor, keyboard, radar screen and etc. The helicopter is cute too. However, I pity the victim that is loaded at the back. It seemed a little bit too dangerous. In addition, this set seemed to have quite alot of stickers, which can be quite discouraging. I do hope to see this set soon. So far, I quite like the Current Coast Guard sets.	positive

That's a great review of a great City set! Thank you very much, metalandi! First of all I wanted to buy the 7999 CG Petrol Boat & Tower. But now I surely will buy this amazing platform instead of the 7999 if my local toy seller sells the 4210. Reason: 4210 is something very unusual set (I think we won't get a set similar to that in the next 20 years) and because of I don't like the petrol boat inside (no backwalls , nearly no interior ).

thanks! I own this set...! It was a good time as TLG released a lot of little buildings. (just look through the 63xx-setnumbers)	neutral
Paramedic Unit, does not seem to suit well for this set's name. It should be named as Clinic, Outpatient Treatment, Family Doctor and etc. From what I understand, Parmedic unit, is a stand-alone unit, that is on standby, 24/7, ready for any emergency rescue in LEGO Town. Ambulance, with a group of paramedics will be ideal for this kind of situation. I love female doctors, especially with that lovely hairpiece! The cruiser, is a neat 4-studs wide design. Just love these small car designs back then. I wonder what can be used at the back of its boot. The clinic is neat. Maybe, we can send Holodoc for some medical audit, to make sure that this clinic is up to standard. What surprised me the most, is the neat little eye chart. You don't see such details in any regular LEGO set. The red and white color combination for the building, works well for me. Most of the hospital buildings and vehicles, always revolved in red and white. I gave this a "4" Thanks you so much, Brickster!	positive
I just can't believe someone would rate this set a 1. It appears to be a trend among these classic reviews, never with a comment of why.	neutral

people giving this "1"? g... i'd give it a "4". i'd give it a "3" but added a point out of nostalgia... i think it's a nice town set from the old days. the only problem i always had is the lack of an ambulance... AND we got a female doctor! :-)	neutral
Brickster strikes again with another awesome review! Ah, one of the few hospital related kits lego made. Wasn't this the first hospital with modern minifigs? (because I seem to remember seeing an even older hospital online that had the armless, faceless figs). Regardless, this would be great as a little doctor's office in someone's town layout - although the vehicle is a little silly. And that eye chart sticker has to be the coolest decal EVER. Quote maybe a TFOL... Well, it sure isn't me. I personally love older kits, even though I'm only a teen. I like a lot of the newer sets a bit more than some of the classic stuff, but I have always agreed that the 70's and 80's were an extremely high point in lego's time (even though I don't really own any kits from the period) Edited by Grevious, 19 July 2008 - 05:05 PM.	positive

Thank you for all these reviews, TheBrickster! And: The idea with the polls is a very nice and interesting idea.

I like this set, like most i view it more as a clinic, it sits nicely in my town plan. These old sets are all very cool	positive
Wow! Old thread. Just for the record, so long as it is here. Paramedic's are advanced Ambulance technicians. Unlike standard EMT's they are trained for Advanced Cardiac Life Support. They can push drugs, defibrillate, place a breathing tube etc. in the 1980's when the set was made, it was quite common for Paramedics to respond to calls in "fly cars" or special response units. They would join up with Ambulances at the scenes that required their skills. If you ever watched the old American TV show "Emergency", Johnny Gage And Squad 51 were one of these response units. They were mostly phased out in the 90's in favor of simply putting the Paramedics and ALS gear in the ambulances.	neutral
Hello all Eurobricks members and Town Lovers, Today, I will be doing up a review on Hook & Haul Wrecker. This name is quite wierd to me. I will prefer to call it the regular tow truck. This is one of the service and repair vehicle that are always ready 24/7 on stand-by for any emergency towing in our towns. Name: Hook & Haul Wrecker Theme: LEGO System / Town Year: 1989 Pieces: 44 Minifigs: 1 Price: USD$6.00 An image of a 6660, Hook & Haul Wrecker Let the towing begins Hook & Haul Wrecker is the typical 4-studs wide vehicle that takes care of broken vehicles that is left stranded on the roads. This tow truck is pretty useful. As you can see, current City sets hardly have any tow trucks available to tow new cars design. This tow truck is catered for 4-studs vehicles for Classic Town. Can you imagine yourself this truck towing a Speed Racer car? I think it looks really out of proportion. In addition, the mini-fig which is included in this set has the regular truck print on its torso. I am very sure they must be a fan club for "Trucks". Otherwise, they should really need a change of clothes. Nevertheless, in my honest opnion. I really love this torso very much. Somehow, it makes them look tough even though their face looks very friendly. Side View This vehicle has a combination of two primary colors which is white and red. This color combination looks very good. You cannot mistook it for an ambulance since they made use of this two colors too, in most Emergency vehicles. This is my guess, I supposed the designer will have tow truck concept as a form of emergency and considered red and white as its combinations. This vehicle set-up has the typical sun-screen on the top of the vehicle frame. However, this baby has more unique features installed in it. These are the source of its brutal strength All-Terrain Vehicle??? This tow truck equipped with the best wheels. In fact, these wheels offer suspension on the roads. Even when its travelling uphill, the truck will move accordingly with its tyres. When you act pressure on the top of the vehicle, it will either be shifted leftwards or rightwards. Close-up of these unique tyres Take a careful look. These wheels have springs installed in it. That is the magic of these vehicle and is defintely suited to run on any rough roads with least problems. If any EB Members know which other vehicles has this unique features, please highlight it to me. Because, if I remembered correctly. I only remember seeing this pair of tyres in this great set. He is ready for some serious towing. The driver had finished hook up the pizza van on its back. It's pretty simple. You just have to lift the back of the vehicle and placed it onto the hook. Presto, the van is ready to go. This vehicle provides so much fun. You can really tow any 4-studs vehicle in your town. And, here we go! To the service station. Poor pizza guy. Summary review Playability: 10/10 (Superb fun. You will love to use this truck and tow any vehicles) Design: 9.5/10 (Excellent design. Especially with the use of the suspension tyres) Price: 9/10 (An inexpensive set based on the 1989 pricing. This set is made up of less than 100 pieces) Overall: 9.5/10 (Every Town must need a tow truck. If a vehicle breaks down, whom will be ready to tow?) I gave it a "5" based on my Review Score Card. What about yours? Hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine. Comments and Critics are strongly welcomed. Pictures can be found in My Brickshelf(When moderated)	neutral
This is one of my favorite town vehicles from the old time, and for one specific reason: The truck is on the guys shirt! It didn't matter that the color was wrong, or the hook was missing. I thought it was awesome beyond imagination... for some reason Thanks for the review Whitefang.	positive
i rate this a 5! one of my last sets before my dark age. suspension wheels are superb and are rare! the minifig, although smiling, really looks tough because of the tanktop. oh did i say im giving it a 5?	positive
4 stars. the suspension wheel holder totally rocks. yeah. though the Slope Brick 45 2x3 x 1 1/3 Double disappoints me a little. btw: the 6350 Pizza To Go Van looks soooo cute! thanks for the review! (and keeeeep them coming...!)	positive
Oh! Never seen that set before! Fun and strange that wheel supension system. Has it ever been used in any other sets?	neutral
Indeed they have; they've appeared in 15 different sets, in total. They also have an identical width with the wide 2x2 wheels holder which is used on cars today. They are still excellent today, since retrofitting these suspension parts onto today's off-roader trucks won't give them weird proportions or any problems, and it looks perfect. Plus they are useful if you're lazy and don't feel like constructing the pin-suspension used in the early 90's for truck-trailers, altough stability probably will suffer.	neutral
4/5. I've had this set since I was young. Never understood why a tow truck needed to be an off-roader; maybe it was used to tow the other off-road vehicles. The suspension made the truck too tall to tow some cars, so I often took the hook out and use the truck as just an great off-road truck like 6672 (which also had the suspension wheels). Other tow truck sets better filled their roles better, but that doesn't diminish this set at all. WhiteFang, on Jul 18 2008, 09:19 AM, said: I think it looks really out of proportion. No, for 25-odd years this vehicle was perfectly proportioned with all others in the town/city line. It's all these new 6 and 8 and 20 wide vehicles that are ignoring convention and making it look out of proportion. Granted speed racer sets are more of their own line, but 6660 is smaller than most of the cars produced in the last few years.	positive
Superb review of a great set!This is one of my favourite classic sets becouse of all these functions(engine,suspension)and it's great design with less than 100 pieces used( only 52 )!Congratulations for the review!I think that it's an outstanding set and surely worth 5 stars	positive
Cheers for taking the time to put together this review, Whitefang. Considering the year of release of this set, I love it. Would still fit in nicely in any city.	positive

Exxon Gas Station Set #: 6375 Year Released: 1980 Piece Count: 254 Minifigs: 3 List Price: approx. $20 One of the gems of my sets from 1980 has to be the Exxon Gas Station. It has very nice colors, lots of great details, and a high level of playability. Starting with the instructions: The backside with a great picture of the complete set: The set includes three minifigs including two gas station attendants and my favorite, the Urban Cowboy: One of the best things about this set is that it includes not one, but two very detailed 4-stud wide vehicles. Here's a picture of the red one which is a two-seater: The car has two working doors, a hood that opens, and a little holed brick on the other side for pretending to "fill 'er up". Here's another image at an angle: Isn't she a nice set of wheels! Here's the yellow car. I always liked this one better, perhaps it was the color with the black pieces in the back, although it is a one-seater: The set includes four fuel pumps that are numbered (with decals) and included a string as the hose: Here's a little accessory rack for oil and tools: And another rack for tires: The set had a nice Exxon logo on three 1x6 bricks: A large jack allows the cars to be lifted high into the air for tire and under engine repairs: I love the office with its large 5x6 window. Inside is a chair and desk. And the entire set: Happy Motoring in Legoland!	positive

Never got this one, but it looks like a typical Lego gas station ... once again, i just don't know how you were able to keep stickers and prints in such a great condition! i am sooooo jealous! the tires of the cars are a problem though... it was difficult and painful to put them off the wheel and back on later... the black hat... g... i would have looooooved to have that when i was a boy...	negative
I much prefer the Shell version of that station which had the full awning over the roadway, and the special road plate with the extra lane to pull into to fill 'er up...	neutral
I love this set, it's nice and simple. Maybe it's because I build this set by myself by ordering all parts and buildinginstruction. And I made one extra tanktransporter :	positive
Excellent review, it's nice to see review of old sets that I don't own I hope to see many more. Was this released under the Esso name int the UK?	positive

Brickster, once again, this is another excellent Gas Station, awaiting to be in the limelight! I don't understand why I always loved these Classic Gas station such as Shell, Exxon and Octan. They just look so lovely. No City or Town could ever survive without these important key installations around, to pump gas/petroleum for all vehicles, that depend it for fuel consumption. As always, all Gas Station will always inculde a road plate, and I am glad I am still seeing roads included in such sets, such as the recent 7993, Service Station. However, Town Plan's Gas Station, did not include a baseplate though. Nevertheless, let me continue with this review. 3 Lovely mini-figs, included in this set. It's not common to see Exxon torsos these days. I just love that lady staff very much, especially with its classic hairdo. 4-studs car just simply rocks, with such fabulous simple design. Furthermore, it gave you 2 cars instead of one. What more can you ask? You don't see TLG giving more cars in recent sets these days. What surprise me about this cars, is the ability of opening the front engine column. I remembered vividly that only trucks or massive vehicles, does have this playing feature. Nevertheless, it's an excellent addition. For a 1980 Gas Station set, this is a perfect set, even when it's going to fit into my current Town buildings. I am sure, it won't have a hard time to match with the rest of the facade. I can use this gas station and stationed it near the country side. This set is so hard to resist, with such elegant design of its fuel pump. There are a total of 4 pumping stations. The vehicles won't be fighting against each other, for slots then. The reparing area is very nice, it will be even better if it include a shelter on top of it. The office is simple and nice. I had never expect an office to exist in Gas Station. Most of the time, there are groceries stores, for the consumers to get off, buy off some stores and load it in the car. No major complains from me. I am not trying to be selection bias. I had demostrated key points which is good enough to justify my score. And, I gave it a "5". Outstanding Classic Gas Station set.	positive
Again great topic/poll, TheBrickster! I gave this set a 3: Which is on the one hand negative is that it's really old-fashioned for today . Which is on the other hand positive is that it includes very nice and authentic details (like e. g. doors in the cars ) which is imo for that time a feat . Klaus-Dieter	neutral
Okay guys, I have built the set! So let's review! Set Name: 7649 MT-201 Ultra Drill Walker Price: $69.99 Pieces: 759 Bought from: Tor R Us in Michigan, US. The Box: First we have the front. It shows the Set, it's functuns, and the Limited edition sign. The box is huge, about the size of the Dino Attack chopper set or the Mars Mission Base. Nowadays, most set that are $50.00 or more have a flap displaying the sets functions. Opening theflap on this box Reveals a GIGANTIC picture of the set. And the back. The bags, numbered: Next, the manuals. They have piece call outs, page numbers, etc. There are 2 manuals with this set. Sticker Sheets: They actually aren't all that bad. Random Manual image: Build: First, we open bag 1. This will build the Alien Craft and the minifigures. Now here we have some interesting parts. A green spine from Exo-force, and a black rim for the set Container Stacker. Next we start the build on the alien craft. It is pretty sturbdy, but has no cockpit for the alien. The alien stickers are really cool. They are rainbow-ish, and has a silver back. Next come the build on the wings: And the finished craft. It is pretty good, and has a nice sleek design. However, I think I will use the large ship for the commander out this year to fight the driller instead. Next is bag 2, which builds the rover and Astro Ship. First is the Ship. It starts off with Doctor Inferno's colors. It builds up very nice, and the detail is absolutley amazing. Next the roof is built. It has some speed racer slopes. The hinge piee now has a hole through it. Sorry for the blurry pic: More is added: Then comes the bottom piece. The detail is very nice, and the hinge piece has a use later on. Then you build the crates. Each one holds two crystals. Added to the ship, also a pic of the finished ship. Here we start the rover. It sports anice detail- The orange studs get coveded by the grill to look more like an engine. The detail in this thing is pretty good. It has a gun and shovel. Here is how it fits into the ship: It slides in... And is secured thanks to the hinge. Okay, so next we open the number 3 bag, which builds the body. Here are some interesting pieces: Then we start the build. It begins nice and study: I just love these stickers with the bulldogs on them: More of the build, with the stickers added: Next we add in the front part. The detail is again, outstanding. With the turntable added. It can move down as well. The next step is to build the water tank. It utilizes the bionicle boosters(big white things) And added to the walker: Then we build that drill. It uses a lot of rims and such. With the gears added: The front part uses a lot of those new droideka 3-prong things. And bionicle eyes. The drill can spin thanks to the gears. And added to the vehical: Next is the cockpit. It has a nice space for the Astro's bckpack. Added: The final stage is the legs. Thank god they aren't like Striking venoms. They are all the same, however. See those two rubber parts? Those keep it in place when on surfaces like glass. Next come the large part of the legs. These are similar to the Assault Tiger's legs. The final result is very sturdy, thanks too... Notice the amazing classic space sticker? So we finally come down to this: The final result is amazing. It is sturdy, and has great detail. It is very realistic. And, when the ship is removed, the drill goes down, and the turret is aimed up... Hope you all enjoyed the review!	positive

Is it seriously? This set was a must-buy for me in the first place, but now that I see it in so much detail, it's just perfect... even the alien ship is better than usual.

OK, minus ten for the placeholder, but plus about ten million for the review. This set is just amazing. It's really earned it's colors, and I'm sure no Classic Space fan can complain, even Snefroe . I didn't know it had the tilting function for the drill- S@H is so pathetic with its pictures, and they really missed this amazing function. The detachable ship is so cute, it's almost Classic Space in it's design. Major thumbs up to TLC. Hell, make it a hug, even.	positive

There are so many indications that the designers took care in designing this kit - like the space for the pilot's backpack, the compartment for the mini flier, the sturdy leg design - etc etc etc. Kudos to TLC for making Mars Mission go out with a bang. I have high hopes that whereever the space theme goes next year, TLC will make it worth the wait. Thanks!

Today i'm gonna review the bigger of the 2 castles from the fright knigh theme. I got this one last week at a pretty fair prive at ebay, new and still sealed. I love opening boxes that had been lying arounf for years and being the first to build an old set. Since i know this castle theme is not liked so much by the general public, i'll try here and change their minds, cause i really think this is a great set. This time i have to say my pictures turned out pretty amazing, even if i am still using just my cellphone cam, but i'm really pleased now with the quality. Here we go! Set Nr.: 6097 Name: Night Lord's Castle Number of minifigs: 7 Number of pieces: 598 Release Year: 1997 Let's start with a few box & instructions pictures: The inside od the box, with a few alternate models: The back, with another possibility how to assemble the 3 main parts: Instructions: Next, the 6 minifigs, starting with the witch on her black dragon: All 5 figures of the fright section: And the poor royal knight: We go on with the set itself, first a general overview (it's really high!): On the "first floor" there's a trap with which you can drop stones or other things down on unliked guests, the pot comes originally from fabuland i think, i love this thing: In the same floor there is a second trap, if you pull the bar, the door opens: We move on to the tower itself (did i mention it's really high?), on the ground level there's the place for the witch to do her spells: The wall is a secret door, which reveals a skeleton when turned over: on the next level there is this little thingy, first it only seems like a barrel.... ...but when you pull the two 1x4 tiles on the back, a skull is being revealed, scary, huh : I don't really understand what this is for but i assume it's a telescope to watch and observate the dragons, i do find that a bit senseless since there haven't been telescopes in medieval times (or have there been): The back of the tower with the prison and the room for the treasure chest: The prison opened. It's secured with a chain, which i like very much cause you really can lock it with that: Treasure chest: From the highest peak we now go down to the very ground level, at the back of the castle there is another secret wall-door, flanked by two shields: At the back half of the inside there is the throne hall for the Bat Lord, with a nice warm fireplace in the back (this is, where the secret door is placed): The second half is pretty empty, except for these two baskets. i don't know exactly what they are for, but i ike the idea for using them as water places for the horses: One thing that might be a bit stupid is that 2 of the 4 side entrances do not have doors, so they are open and a guard would have to stand there the whole day. You can see it in his face he isn't very happy with that : That was my last review of the sets i got the last weeks, but i'm looking forward to make much more in the future. Overall this is a pretty good set, i don't know any other one with so much details and playability. The minus point is, as already said, that it is too open on the sides, but that can be solved easily with a bit of modding. Also i must say, this set isn't that much juniorized as many might have thought, though the design is a bit unconventional, but exactly that's what i like most about it. All in all it gets a 9/10 for me hope you enjoyed the reading and the pictures, can't wait to see your response. Edit: Oops, i forgot to put one figure of the fright knight faction on the photo, but it's the one in the last picture. Edited by KimT, 10 August 2008 - 01:28 PM.	positive
Nice review, good close-ups and a good, unconventional choice of a set. As for the set itself, it has it's pros and cons in my eyes. I like all the minifigs, but especially the witch. The Fright Knights are probably the closest you can get for an evil human Castle faction. As for the building itself, on the other hand I like the fact that it can be modified, but some of the design choices are just stupid. The holes in the wall, the one huge tower (as opposed to several smaller ones), the huge empty space in the center, and the excessive usage of bright yellow. I guess for a smaller kid the play value is great, it's easily accessible and it looks sturdy enough, but to an AFOL, it's not much else than a source for bricks and figs, in my opinion. Oh, and they did have telescopes in the medieval times (the witch most probably uses it for astrology). And even if they didn't, we're talking about a castle with a dragon and a wicked witch in it, so it's not exactly a good example of accurate history.	negative
I love the reviews of older sets that I never had. Also, tiny thing, but you said it has 7 minifigs, but the group shots only include 6. The last guy isn't shown until the very end.	neutral
@iamded: yes it seems the dragon is used as such in the picture of the alternate model, but i guess bad and evil knights also wanna have some fun sometimes you are right with the green plate on the second floor, it does look a bit disturbing. but that can	negative
I thoroughly enjoyed your review Metalandi, thank you especially for taking photos of all the contraptions and detailing exactly how they work. As a member of classic-castle, the census always seemed to be that fright knights were a class 4/10 or 6/10 but as Sandy stated above, it is one of the closest you can get to an evil faction. By today's standards, the contraptions seen here are much much more sophisticated and well thought out and are definitely missing in 2007's King's Castle Siege. I enjoy the design of this castle much more even if the towers are taller simply because the design in the King's Castle Siege left builders with an empty space right in the courtyard without even a base plate! AND it's nearly impossible to get your hands in and play in the enclosed space (why would anyone unless you're simply posing figs, and even that was difficult). This Castle instead, had a variety of trap doors and surprises, so despite the varied colors used here, it's not that hard to realize that the designers for this Castle really took time to think things out and tried to make the Castle enjoyable for the children that will play with it whereas our 2007 Castle was strictly built to give kids the impression of an enormous magnificant Castle with little to nothing inside. It's like comparing beauty (2007) to brains (this castle). Edited by legobear, 20 July 2008 - 01:32 AM.	positive

Metalandi, thanks for doing this Fright Knights review, by opening up a MISB set which you have bought recently. I am very sure the feeling is very nice, especially touching the bricks which is preserved for 11 years sealed in bags. I am quite fond of the Fright Knights theme. Unfortunately, this theme was released during my dark age. I never really bought sets from Fright Knights. Instead, I bought plenty of minifigs to build an army. If I could turn back time or find another MISB set with a reasonable price, I am very sure I will get it. My soldiers need a castle to stay in. I will be looking forward to your next review. Keep up the good job	neutral
Ah this brings back memories, i have this set and i loved the playabilaty factor opposing to older castle sets i have! In medieval times there actually were primitive telescopes, you can read about it here. Thanks for this review, great storie, great pics!	positive
My first post in this topic looks foolish now that I bought this set from Ebay. I just really wanted the minifigs (although I already had the Batlord and the black dragon) and the parts. They will help me greatly in building the Impenetrable Fortress of the Dragonwarriors for my Princess Quest comic. By the end of this week, this set will be in my clutches!	positive
Well, that the bricks look new comes from that they ARE new. I got this set new and unopened	neutral
Good review - the photo from above shows off the scale of the castle much better than the box photo. I was one of those who always thought this set looked lame, ever since first seeing it in the catalogue. A couple of my siblings had smaller Bat Lord/Fright Knight sets and enjoyed the accessories and style of the minifigs etc. So last year having not only ended my dark ages, but done so for some of the rest of my family, I got this set off ebay for my sister for Christmas. I of course had to build it to make sure all parts were there before leaving ebay feedback and ending the transaction. First impressions were of how much brick there was to the set, as well as really useful large structural elements. And to be honest, while perhaps a bit childish, there's no doubt the style of the minifigs is kinda cute and useful for customs. It was really enjoyable building this set, and the scale is impressive when built, empty spaces notwithstanding (but hey, Lego has always had buildings with no back, etc. - just use your imagination and enjoy the access to playspace offered). The traps etc. are neat and more like the kind of "action features" modern sets come with (I for one am in favour of these, for kids they are fun and I think for builders they give ideas cause they are often done with minimal parts or impact on the set design). Anyways, needless to say my sister loved the set. Indeed she's currently rebuilding it for the second time. If I see it as cheap again, I will pick up one for myself. I got the first one at €30 incl postage I believe.	positive
Ahh... I remember how badly I wanted that set when it was new... oh well... Definitely one of the most original castles, if not THE most. I actually liked how the 1st floor was made into a throne room. The tower looks pretty impressive, too. Of course, the castle has a flagrant flaw -- the walls on the sides are open. I also think it lacks in the minifig count, though that is understandable for a castle with a dragon. Quote The Fright Knights are probably the closest you can get for an evil human Castle faction. Totally agreed.	positive
Quite the topic bump, but dang, what a cool set, and so tall. This is the kind of sets I had as a kid, but I don't remember this one. I'm jealous.s	positive
I got a couple of the small sets from this line when it came out. Recently, I acquired several more from Bricklink because I just really love the way they look. This theme really had good intentions, but the execution was flawed. I hope one day Lego returns to a darker tone, but maybe next time it could be more Castlevania inspired. That would really turn some heads! Plus, vampires and gothic aesthetics are really popular now. It will probably have run its course by the time Lego would be able to develop a theme around them, though.	negative
This is a great set and a great review - Thanks for doing these! I remember my brother getting this set (I got the police station 6384 on the same day). Truly classic sets - It's a shame that I don't have them anymore although I do have the two immediate descendants of the sets... Cheers Rog	positive
Lovely!! I can't stop making comparisons between this fire station and last year's, which is also very well detailed, with great features and awesome playability. The concept design of the second one it's very much like the one reviewed here. This is good as TLG is taking back those great values to make the new excellent sets we all are enjoying by now!	positive
A 5/5. the set is beautiful, both the remake and the original. a classic and a beautiful thing, like DOS. Edited by maiq the liar, 20 July 2008 - 09:45 PM.	positive
I have a slightly different version of this set, and i must say it is great! Boy to these reviews bring back memories, thanks!	positive
I am a proud owner of this set this is one of the best fire stations ever. What amazes me is what the designers made with only 368 pieces. You get a very nice looking building in good size, a good baseplate, 2 cars, 4 minifigs, accessories... and great alternative ideas in the back of the box (like the fire boat or helicopter). This is a great example of Lego design.	positive

This pretty sums it up! The firestation was one of the few sets in my childhood I owned and was NOT classic space! I especially liked the roller doors, this was one of the first sets they came with. In the late 80´s I sold it to my nephew. Darn, I really regret it. When I asked him a couple of years ago if he still owned it (and I could buy it back) he also had made cash out of it. I gave it a "4". There is always room for improvement, like the helipad mentioned. So it can´t be a "5" in my opinion. Take off you rose coloured glasses.	positive

Good, but I like the heli of set 6571 better: Another "4" from me.	positive
A nice little model with some neat features for it's age plus the all-yime classic fireman as a bonus. However, this design of chopper (the police station around the same time was the same design) I think dated very quickly. While is was good to use the hinged car roof - which was relatively new at the time - together with the inverted screen it was superceded very quickly by designs that stood the test of time far better (for example 6657). Also, I don't think I could everbuy a Lego fire helicopter because it is not something we have in the UK/Eire. Police, Coast Guard, Ambulance, military, etc, etc but no fire helicopters. Not something I would therefore want in my Lego Town. Great review though. Many thanks again for doing these. Cheers Rog	negative

Snorkel Squad, in simple english terms, it refers to Fire Engine, fighting fire, always on standby, ready to save the citizens from crisis. Trust me, you will understand why this Snorkel Squad is superb impressive by the end of this review. On a side note, there is only part that is replaced by another color. Can you find the difference? Name: Snorkel Squad Theme: LEGO System / Town Year: 1987 Pieces: 151 Minifigs: 2 Price: USD$13.50 An image of a 6358, Snorkel Squad Looking smart on their stand-by This snorkel squad is a fanastic fire engine, that is ready to save people from the fires. It's primary color "red" is used in all fire emergency department and vehicles. In case of any emergency, this snorkel squad will be activated and arrived at the scene as soon as possible. No time to waste! Personally, this is the best fire engine that I had ever seen. Meet the Fire Fighters It comes with two brave fire fighters. Both of them wear the standard fire fighter outfit that is present in almost all Fire Station sets in Classic Town. The torso is very nice and formal, and looks real impressive onto them. I love the buttons on them. Furthermore, these white helmets are a symbol to the world of Fire Fighting. These are the people whom save lives by risking their own lives in dangerous situations. Water Hose compartment The water hose is a string that is stored in the front. It can be rolled out, and the fire fighters are able to use it without much difficulty. They will just pull out the hose and spray onto the fire. The next picture, shows a much clearer look in its interior. In addition, the fire logo that is on the compartment, is actually printed. Yes, it's not a sticker, and that is great news for us! Interesting features These clamps on both sides, is supposed to stablise the fire engine when the ladder is heading upwards. It is a simple mechanism, which illustrate clearly what it does. This feature is recently seen in Construction vehicle such as the Mobile Crane. Of course, it is not a complicated feature. It just made use of three quite common white parts. Swivel Mechanism These swivel mechanism, in my opnion are very fun to play with. These connectors on the front and the back, enable the long fire engine, to make sharp turns on any junctions, arriving at the scene fast enough. This is not a fire engine that only travel straight roads. Try it onto your base plates, and you will be surprised, how well it can turn. Best Playable mechanism in 6358 The driver will be activating the ladder at the back of the vehicle. In order, to adjust the height and making sure that the ladder do not fall short, the tiles on the plates are acting like a stoppage. The ladder are able to rotate 360 degree without much problem, if you removed the driver out of the control panel. It goes up as tall as 30cm! Look at that amazing height. Too bad, I have not constructed my Cafe Corner yet. Otherwise, I can give you a better feel of how amazing this baby can go. I used the old road baseplate as a guide, and roughly it can goes as tall as 30 to 35cm. Look at the black hinges below. By shifting it to the last, that was the maximum height it can move. This is a very good way to adjust the height. Oh, and I forget to mention that there are 2 storage compartments for the fighters to place their equipments behind. Quite easy to access. No doors? Apart from the standard roof top on the driver's seat, there is no doors present at both side. I am quite sad to see that there are no doors. Maybe, these fighters are supposed to jump off the seat, instead of opening the doors? Well, I guess this is the only major flaws that I had found in this set. Heading off *Got you* Meet the Model 6358 Fire Engine Summary review Playability: 10/10 (Superb fun. The ladder and swivel mechanism is really very fun to play with.) Design: 9.5/10 (Excellent design. It got an almost full 10. The lack of doors, dropped my ratings slightly.) Price: 8/10 (A very mid range price. I don't think it cost very expensive. But, I am not sure how much it cost now.) Overall: 9.2/10 (Best Fire Engine ever, and one of the great looking one too. Get this model now.) I gave it a "5" based on my Review Score Card. What about yours? Hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine. Comments and Critics are strongly welcomed. Pictures can be found in My Brickshelf (When moderated)	positive
thanks for another great review. I can remember the 6358 very vividly. My parents bought the 6340 for me and a girl friend got the 6358. I'm quiet sure it's my envy because until now I want to believe that the 6340 is better. My reasons were these: I own the 6340 (and on the instructions of the 6358 stood "LEGOLAND" which I thought of as old.) But this review induced me to get over this humiliation from my childhood ( ) and check ebay for the 6358. Edited by BerndDasBrot, 21 July 2008 - 04:07 PM.	neutral
A great review, I like this set it captures the classic town feeling well, and the ladder is cool! I can't help but feel thought that these reviews are being churned out to quickly, you should leave a gap, I am being flooded with all these great reviews!	neutral
This definitly is a nice set, i think this was also the first set to use that white basket Nice one Whitefang!	positive
What an awesome little set! I really like this engine but don't remember seeing it during the late 80s. It must have been out during my Dark Ages. I love the basket/section for the firemen. Equally nice is the fire hose which extends a good length. The color combination of red with white and the trans. blue windshield looks goos as well. This is a great engine and one that would look perfect in a classic tabletown - and it's 4-studs wide! Very nice review WhiteFang. I look forward to seeing more of your Classic Town reviews.	positive
Guys, thanks for all of your wonderful and encouraging comments, towards this set. This was one of my most favourite set in the late 1980s, and I am glad to restore it somehow, with a small little part missing, which could not be that hard to replace.

Captain green hair, on Jul 22 2008, 02:07 AM, said: This definitly is a nice set, i think this was also the first set to use that white basket CGH, you are absolutely right. This is the first set that made use of the white basket component. In fact, there is only 2 sets in the entire LEGO theme which have make used of the white basket. It is the 6477 which is released in 2000. I am quite surprised after 13 years, they are able to produced it again. TheBrickster, on Jul 22 2008, 10:10 AM, said: What an awesome little set!

Nice reveiw it looks like a great set i think i know what i will do tonight- rebuild my LEGO fire department it has- [Fire pickup truck, fire truck [from 2005 sorry cant remember set number] and the most recent fire station if i can find all the pieces......	neutral
Nice review, WhiteFang, with lots of photos - exactly as a good review should be! As for the set - I own it and it's a very good one! The Fire Squad vehicle is a nice addition to my other Fire dept. vehicles. It offers very good playability and this ladder is so long! You can have so much fun with it.	neutral
That's a great review/poll, WhiteFang! I gave this set a 5: It's simply ! The only thing which I miss are the respirators for the firemen since they already own air tanks. But otherwise this set is brilliant! I like it much more than the new one from 2007 since it's not that big and juniorized. Klaus-Dieter	positive
Great set. I found only one major fail - this - the hands of robot arms gets easly broken.	positive
Thanks for the review. This set was outstanding for its time with all the features and detail. The extending basket is just wonderful. However, I honestly wouldn't consider it the best firetruck ever. I actually like the one from 2005 even better - becasue like most of the City vehicles, it adds the needed bulk big engines like fire trucks need. Many of the older kits, while awesome, were honestly a little too skinny IMO.	positive

I owned the 2007 Fire Engine as well, as this set was not restored back then, and I needed a Fire Engine very badly. I managed to restored it somehow, and I compared it with the 2007. The older design is still the best. osakana, on Jul 25 2008, 04:03 AM, said: Great set. I found only one major fail - this - the hands of robot arms gets easly broken. Yes, this is an interesting finding. I remembered when I was a child. That robot arms always come out of its own, when I fiddle with it. I was so annoyed by it and I just kept it there whenever I deployed it for rescue missions. Grevious, on Jul 26 2008, 02:00 AM, said: However, I honestly wouldn't consider it the best firetruck ever.

I agreed with you, that Fire Engines need to be big and sturdy. On the other hand, it can be nice to have the fire engine to look slim as well, to cut through the traffic easily. I am not against with the newer sets. It just that, part of the reasons which reflected in the review had fufill the basic key factors of a typical Fire Engine. In addition, it was my all-time favourite under the "Fire-Fighting" theme.	positive

In addition, it was my all-time favourite under the "Fire-Fighting" theme. Yes, I agree! This set is wonderful even today, and is one of the best fire kits ever release. And actually, realistic scale is not really a necessity in lego - it's just my personal taste. For example, I've never liked the tiny planes in the old airports that much, but I can see why a lot of people like them better than the new ones. Edited by Grevious, 28 July 2008 - 03:17 PM.	neutral

This sounds very similar to the first one. I'm glad I'm saving this one till later in my purchasing cycle. All the SW walkers have a skeletal fram with almost nothing inside. It's very disappointing, but I guess filling them in would up the piece count considerably. Does this beast have any good handholds for picking it up? I seem to recall a handle or something coming out of the top in the pre-release pics.	negative
So basically, you cited as faults what everybody had been complaining about since the first information of the set arrived? Skeletal interior and lack of clones? Although I didn't realize it didn't have numbered backs. That really is just ridiculous. LEGO finally comes up with a very intelligent solution to the frustration seen when building large sets, but then they neglect to implement it. WTF? Lame. Still, this may be the only Clone Wars set I buy besides the exclusives. The exterior, which IMO is the only part that matters, looks so fantastic. I don't care about clones, I have enough of those already. And at 90$ it's still a better buy than the RGS. The Torrent is cool but not as cool as the Fighter Tank or DGS imo. Awesome in-construction pics.	positive
Just picked this set up, and just took a break from building to go to Football Practice. I have just finished building all of the legs, and so far it looks like it is going to be a great set. I would have like it if more clones were included, but whatever. I find it interesting how many clone accessories they give you. I don't like it only because I can't decide what I want to use. I find it interesting that at lease 2 people are missing pieces. I have had multiple times where I thought I was missing pieces, only to find that they were in the bag somewhere. Other than the fact that there is a lack of minifigures, I love this set and can't wait to finish it later tonight. Edited by SWMAN, 04 August 2008 - 08:33 PM.	positive

7676: Republic Attack Gunship Number of Pieces: 1034 Number of Minifigs: 5 Price: 119.99 USD Brickset Hey everyone, I just got the RGS yesterday at TRU after I came home from camp. I saw all of the topics that I missed, and noticed a mini-review and a review with one pic, so I thought I'd make a huge, shiny new review that has lots of pictures and all of the requirements of KimT's index. NOTE: I did not apply any stickers to it, as a personal liking. So, lets start by looking at the box: A shiny, clean, and futuristic box, quite different from the other Star Wars box designs before this. There was so much Clone Wars merchandise with this font and design in the huge display at the front of my local Toys r Us store, and not just LEGO. It so beautiful, with the white and sky blue... anyways, for some reason, the boxes of the new Clone Wars sets seemed more shiny than usual. Maybe it's because they were just shipped, but once you pick up the boxes, they will feel really good in your hands, despite the fact that only about half of the space in the boxes are used... The back of the box: The back shows all of the main features of the set, plus pictures of the three other Clone Wars sets meant to be released alongside this one (although I did spot the Twilight and Homing Spider Droid, which were supposed to be released in September or October). So, on to the Gunship: Built straight from the bags. It took me about 4 1/2 hours, with breaks. It has an overall great design, but somewhat fragile, especially when building it. The cockpits always fall apart when opened, as well as the bubbles on the wings (which I will get into more later). The color scheme is very well done. You can always find the piece you're looking for thanks to the color diversity: Red, Dark Red, Lime Green (ooh!), Blue, Black, Tan, Light Bley, Dark Grey, Yellow and White. Also, split down the middle vertically, the ship is almost all symmetrical. Front: Side: Now, lets start with the many features that this set is hiding. The front has lots of lime green, a rare color. But more importantly: ...a rotating gun is found on each side. They rotate in a pretty wide range, although fragile. Cockpits: There are two main cockpits, right next to each other. Not very detailed, and are the same. And for some reason, the whole cockpit element flips up to reveal: ...nothing. Just the skeleton of the ship. Probe droid storage: Above the cockpit lies a plate that can be flipped up to reveal a storage area that holds: Two of these probe droids. At least, that's what I think they are. Hull: In this pic, two features are hidden. Mobile Command Center: The first of the two is a Mobile Command Center, but essentially just a hover chair. It is found by flipping up the two panels on either side of the hull. Bacta Tank: The second is the bacta tank found by just sliding it out of the storage area behind the MCC. One half of the tank opens: ...so a minifigure can go inside and heal his/her wounds obtained in battle. Cargo hold: Now, this is probably the main feature for this set. The two sliding doors (two on each side) slide open thanks to a clever Technic mechanism. Not much in here, just a gun holder and a place where the passengers wait to be dropped off in battle. Speeder Bike: I guess you guys saw it, the speeder bike. It is found by opening the rear flap. The bike is very cleverly designed by using a brown trike body. It's only a few centimeters shorter than the bike found in the Clone Battle Pack. Rear gun: Just a gun similar to the front ones. Engines: Huge engines (or are they cannons?) that are really fun to build. They really give that cartoon feel to this set. Missiles: In between the engines are two sets of four flick-fire missiles. Bubble cockpits: There is one bubble cockpit on each wing that supposedly control the turrets at the front. Very fragile. Storage containers: Two storage containers on each side hold the clone accessories. But, I wouldn't recommend putting them in there, because the antennae can fall out, or you might forget about them. Sticker Sheet: The Dreaded Sticker Sheet (DSS) has all of the stickers you need for this set. Unfortunately, mine was crunched up. I don't like stickers much anyways, but I might still apply some. Note the Republic symbol stickers, why couldn't TLG just use that printed piece from a few years back? Also, you get to choose between a bird-rat thing or a sleeping Twi'elk as your hull decal. What they're for, I don't know, looks like the movie or show will explain it though. Minifigs: Finally, the five minifigs of this set. They are all great figs, including: Commander Cody: Amazing, especially with the gear. The orange is nice, but I thought he was yellow. Clone Trooper: Again, amazing. The gear is great, and the new helmet and torso are great! All of the clones in the Clone Wars line have the same heads. Also, you can see the flesh beneath the helmet. Asaaj Ventress: Not so happy about this one. The torso and dark blue legs are cool, but the dress is pretty ugly. The head is alright, but could do without the cartoon-y face (yeah I know, its from a cartoon). Also has purple markings on back of head. Obi-Wan Kenobi: Pretty cool, besides the face. Cool hair and torso, though. Plo Koon: Beautiful! The true gem of this set, in my opinion. The head is the same material as Kit Fisto's. And the tosro is awesome, good for making a custom Ki-Adi Mundi. Well, that's about it, here is the... FINAL VERDICT: Build: 8/10, very fun and easy, should take the seasoned builder about 4 hours. Somewhat fragile. Playability: 9.5/10, Lots of fun features, although some can break easily. Swooshability: 3/10, I wouldn't recommend flying it around much, as you can barely pick it up safely. But with two hands gripping the bottom firmly, it can be moved around, but not spun or swooshed, etc. Minifigs: 8/10, all very great figs, especially Plo Koon, but could have included more clone troopers. Design: 7.5/10, some excellent ideas included in here, although some spots are very fragile. Price: 7/10: Should have been only 100 USD if not for the new molds. Plus, at TRU, it was 130 USD. Overall score: 8.5/10, a great set to have for your star wars/ clone wars collection, with some flaws. Save up for this one. So, how did you like my review? Your feedback is much appreciated!

Thanks for the review JimButcher . I really like this new gunship but I can´t own one until like two or three months and this is with all the clone wars sets .	positive
Thanks for all the feedback so far, guys! I meant yellow for cody's color.	neutral
JimButcher, finally I had seen something that is worth reading and viewing. IMHO, this is your best Star Wars Review I had ever read. Most importantly, it is a complete review which has substance. You have my thanks! Keep up the good job Back to the RGS, this is the next Star Wars set I will be getting. I can't wait to lay my hands on this set, and start building. Basically, how bad this set can be, it can't be worse. Republic Gunship is one of the all-time favourites, in Star Wars Prequel and OT. I can't find any faults, except being too expensive due to the licence cost. In addition, the mini-figs are the next big thing. Seriously, I am quite impressed with it. On the down side, my rating will go up if there is an additional Clone Trooper instead of one. Nevertheless, this is a "MUST GET" set, no matter what!	positive

And I agree, you should try to get this one ASAP, you won't regret it.

Hey everyone, My wife took me to Legoland for my birthday just last week. We had a fantastic time and it gave me the chance to pick up some of the new Castle sets and battlepacks I was really impressed by the sets I bought and decided to do my first review... let battle commence! Set name: Tower Raid Set number: 7037 Price GBP: £19.99 Pieces: 364 The Models Here's a shot of the complete set: The set is made up of two models, the Crown Knight's tower and the Orc's siege tower. Let's start with the Crown Knight's tower: A knight readies himself for battle! My favourite model from the set, the wicked Orc's siege tower: Please note that for the purposes of display I mounted the Orc's banner onto a small cone set on the top platform of the siege tower. This doesn't come with the set but saves any Orcs having to hold onto it all he time! There are other areas it can be placed without using extra parts. Features Both models look great and have excellent features. The set as a whole has great playability and seems to have been concieved with a storyline: the Crown Knight's have a captured Orc within the walls of their tower so the Orc army has been sent out to recover him... or are they merely after the gold the knights keep horded away?! The Orc's siege tower has a powerful ram - spring-loaded by the simple arrangement of an elastic band - so pulling it back sends it flying out the front, knocking down the wall on the side of the knight's tower... ...and releasing the captive Orc! The floor panels inside the prison are laid over a lip on the inside of the collapsible wall, so fall in when they're not supported. There's a string at the rear for extending the boarding ramp... ...and letting a fearsome Orc warrior charge across! Flick-fire action! The battle heats up as the Orcs close in! The Minifigures The Crown Knights: I really like the Crown Knights. They're metallic helmets look great and they come with nice accessories. The archer has a double printed head with a frightened look on the other side too! I'm not surprised, I'd be frightened when staring over the ramparts at these... The Orcs: These guys really do look the part, worthy advesaries to the Crown Knights! The details are superb: the printed elements, weapons and helmets, all set the Orcs aside on the battlefield. The set comes with a great new molded armour neckpiece too. The mighty Orc leader looks wicked in his full battlegear! Overview There's so much to this set it's hard not to be impressed. The Orc's siege engine is a thing of beauty (or terror!) and would look great on any battlefield. The Crown Knight's tower although basic, looks good and has great playability. I'm a big fan of the new Castle knights and fantasy minifigures and the inclusion of five of them is just enough for this set and as a booster to any army. At £19.99 in the UK this set is well worth the money for content and quality. I'd highly recommmend this set as a must-have purchase for anyone A final shot of the siege tower with a host of Orcs ready for battle: I hope you enjoyed my review, I'll be posting my next one for 7040 Dwarves Mine Defender soon!	positive
I Scream Clone, on Jul 29 2008, 04:42 PM, said: Very nice review Pedro! You beat me to it. There was a review done about January, but i wanted to have a go, just haven't opened the box yet..... Great pics and well demonstrated action elements too. I rate this as one of the coolest Castle sets just for its playability and 5 figures. This will def add to my Orc army, and i may purchase more of this set if they dont release a Orc BP. Keep up the good work! For now, there is the Impulse set... Great review and excellent photography, I love this set, as it has many good features and the Siege tower is the best TLC one yet! Thanks again!	positive
When I first saw this topic, I thought, "Oh, great, another review of this set..." However I'm glad you posted it now, your pics are great and, well, it was just a generally good review! I'm looking forward to seeing more... ~Peace	positive
Thanks for the review! From this set, I prefer the Crown Knight's tower - it's a very good-looking structure!	positive
Pedro, for your first review, you have amaze me with your photo session and the strucutre of your review. I am very impressed by your high quality pictures. You have done an excellent job! I love the Tower Raid very much, as it offers high playability. With the wall and flooring, falling down, when the ram hits the wall, it's quite interesting to play with. The mechanism of the ram is very fun to play with as well. I will try and pull back and released it, to knock a row of soldiers. This is one of my favourite sets in Castle 2008. Well done.	positive
WhiteFang, on Jul 30 2008, 12:56 AM, said: Pedro, for your first review, you have amaze me with your photo session and the strucutre of your review. I am very impressed by your high quality pictures. You have done an excellent job! I completely agree. This is an amazing review - bits of humor, great photography, and detailed descriptions/photos. Based upon this review I've placed an order for this set (along with some convincing from Amazon's 20% sale ). The only drawbacks in this set that I can see concerns the tower with it being 1) small compared to the seige tower and 2) missing a few walls. However, this is also the joy of LEGO as one can simply purchase a few bricks and build their own walls and/or expand the tower's size (or even attach it to a castle). Of course, this increases the price of the set, but considering how cheap bricks are on BrickLink, Tower Raid is still a very good value. I hope you continue doing reviews, pedro.	positive
Th set was fantastic becuase it was cheap and supplied a very good amount of pecies and had rather good minifigures.	positive
I have one of these and must say that this is THE best Castle set in the theme, and the most useful parts pack for its size yet.	positive
Name: Jungle Duel Set ref: 7624 Number of minifigs: 3 Number of pieces: 90 Price: $9.00 A basic review of 7624 (my apologies for the blurry and grainy pictures my camera is acting up ): The build is nothing speicial on to the figs Indiana Jones, Mutt Williams and Irina Spalkoi, nice array of minifigs although I think they should have included a russian soldier or two. If you look to the right on Mutts jacket it has his name in script, the tent is great aside from the fact that the fabric bends easily a nice amount of speicial pieces the weapons rack is pretty nifty so is the table when you swap the white piece with a black one overall it is a very nice set, the $10.00 price tag isnt so bad either, thanks for reading. Playability:10/10 price:8/10 figs:8/10 build:5/10 overall rating:8/10 I recommend this set to all Indiana Jones and lego fans. Edited by wulf, 29 July 2008 - 02:50 PM.	positive
Nice short review, although a little hard to read. I agree that this set is a really great one.	positive
The only Indy set I considered worth purchasing so far. Great source of various parts - plus you gotta love Spalko's hair! Edited by Dreamweb, 01 August 2008 - 09:55 PM.	positive
Good review. This is my second IJ kit that I got and I think it is a great deal. Only 10$ and get 3 figs and great parts to use. I may pick up 2 more so I have penty of ants and other goodies that this comes with.	positive
I picked this up last weekend, mainly also for parts. It came with two Mutt heads instead of a Irena Head. :( But anyway, it's a nice little $10 set...We need more sets like this that include these myriads of "detail" parts.	positive
Time for my first review! 7673 MagnaGuard Starfighter Peices: 431 # of figs: 2 Price: 44.99 USD THE BOX: Pretty decent size box for the price. MagnaGuards: The Normal Box Stuff: Front of the ship: Back: Open Cockpit: Back of the Box: Contents: DSS (dreaded sticker sheet): First Manual Page (because it's super important not to build on carpet. ) Fig Build: The Magna Guard Head: (IMO it's beautiful! ) The Purple Cone! Cape Box: The Capes!: Just One: The MagnaGuard: Back: The Parts (nicely sorted!) The new Windshield Piece (Beautiful!) The First Step: Seccond Step: More Steps Of The Main Body: The Wing Assembly: (Sorry for the blur) Attached: Opposite Wing: Both Attached: Rear Engine Build: The Staffs. I have mine set up differently than in the instructions. I put one cone over the hump on one end of the staff, and the other in the original spot. Then, to load them onto the fighter, all you do is push the original placed cone down and put it right in. This way, the staff looks better and it works the same! See? It slides right in: Skeletal parts of sides attached: Close Up: Bottom: Both Wings Attached: Hidden Missle Launcher: Raised Up: Another Shot: Staffs Attached: Complete: Side Panel: Side Pods: Complete: Swooshable!: Finished!: Time to complete: >2hrs. Okay, Overall rating time! PRICE: 9/10- Could have been 40.00 USD, but due to new molds, this is understandable. PARTS: 9/10- Could have hade more Dark Red, but thats IMO. Plus, I love Dark Red! BUILD TIME: 8/10- I took my time on this and enjoyed the techniques the designers intricated. Also, taking pics added to the time quite a bit. PLAYABILITY: 7/10- The main playability functions are the missle launchers in the back and the sliding cockpit. My only gripe with these is they don't set right with the other slopes on the top. Also, the inside of the cockpit is easily modded for regular size minifigs. Just pop a handlebar piece in the already provided arm in the cockpit and bam, your favorite figs can have a ride! It also helps keep the Magnaguards in place if they hold it. MINIFIGS: 10/10- IMO, the new molds are great! The only downfall is the right arm on both is less moveable due to the hard plastic turban-thing connected to the head. SWOOSHABILITY: 9/10- The starfighter is pretty sleek, and very swooshable! DESIGN: 9/10- The most important aspect, and this one's a winner! It's only a nine because it needs to have smoother edges in a few spots, but they are easily MODable. OVERALL SCORE: 8.7! I think it's an awesome set. Very satisfying! 2008 SW ON! DSR DSR Edited by KimT, 04 August 2008 - 11:49 AM. indexed	positive

Hmm. A tougie. I really like the World City one, yet the Dino one is a better deal. I'll vote for the Dino, because I (regretably) don't even have the World City one...	positive
, that was a weird race! Anyway, I love the look of both sets, but i'll have to go for the Dino Attack Quad for a couple of reasons: It is post-apoc, which I love, features tan and dark red colours which are far more useful than yellow, you get more "bang for your buck" with the Dino set, you get a little dino (sure you can hate it but better than not having one right?), and the fig has much more useful pieces and a better face. Thanks for the face off TheBrickster! Batbrick Away!	positive
It's definately the Street Sprinter for me! There are many reasons for that, most of which have been mentioned by others already: I hate yellow, it's the most useless color, but I love tan and dark red. It's bigger and more detailed than the Coast guard one. Plus, I think there is a hinge in the back of it, so there is apparently some more playability to it as well. I love the post-apoc style fig! It's detailed and simply looks cool! Also, while the Digger fig has quite an individual look to it, the Coast Guard driver has the generic hero head and Coast Guard uniform. It's an overal better deal, especially if you count the LUDP which gives the set a whole lot more playability, no matter how U the LDP may be. Tan & post-apoc figs ON!	positive
that was an intresting race And i was split between the two until i saw whitefang`s reply and the fact you can use the sprinter as a militery thing(which you could do for both but sprinter just pulls it off better) and i like the radar on the back of it so i`ll have to go with the street sprinter. thanks for the nice topic brickster	positive
I vote for the Dino quadbike, definately! I wish I had that but I'll have to make do with the much less violent European Version (Dino '2010' not 'ATTACK') Here's a comaprison... European Version: USA etc. version: There's a subtle difference, but I prefer the US one As for the Coast Guard Quad, I think it's OK but not as good as the new one.	positive
Dino Attack for me! You just cant say no to a huge Bazooka! Though the tan and dark red works for me too	positive
Dino Attack quad for me. No, this isn't because I own it and not the other one, but because I think just about everything is better in it - the design is better, the colors are cooler, and it has a better figure. I don't like the figure in the coast guard quad at all - but since it was from World City, I'm not suprised. I also kinda like the dino, actually. It's flexible and fits in with the previous dinos a lot better than the cruddy bigger ones with bright red, yellow, and green highlights.	positive
ooooooh! this is a very hard choice,i like this new coast guard theme but i LOVED! Dino Attack.The Dino Attack set has a weird looking gun,but IMO the Coast Guard set looks.........cleaner if you get what i mean.The little Dino/lizard thing is practically worthless (thats why i have a bin full of those little guys).I want to keep liking Dino Attack i just can't.So i know your like "just get to the point already!" so i guess i have to go with coast guard. TheBrickster, on Aug 3 2008, 09:41 AM, said: I did not know that Europe had a different quad (or at least one without the bazooka). Interesting that the gun was removed from the European sets, or added to the US sets. I sort of like the chain. I also notice a big difference in the boxart. Destroyed city to prehistoric volcano. I wonder if the story was different as well? Thanks for sharing a good picture. ----------------------------------------- Well, it does look like the Dino Quad has the upper hand; almost double the votes. wow i would have so much wanted the european one more than the US one, i mean that bazooka or as they called it a "sonic screamer" looks very silly	positive
I know it would really go well with the RGS but it is not enough for £50. Ill wait for the Sales at Christmas.	negative
Dovchenko, on Aug 1 2008, 07:47 PM, said: Finally a review of this, thanks! 120 bucks? This tank looks tiny and though it's amazingly detailed it should have been smaller and only 40/50 bucks at most. It just doesn't play that big a part man. Good pieces and mechanisms but no one's going to both buying a 120 buck tank, no offence, not unless it it's the AT-TE. $120 is the price here in Denmark. It will most likely be the same price as the V-19 Torrent everywhere else, so you dont have to worry about that	neutral

This and the AT-TE and the Spider tank and maybe the droid gunship are the few Clone wars sets I'll buy. I loved playing as this tank in the Clone wars video game( even better with cheat codes for EXTRA MISSILE SPAM ), so this is a must get.	positive
Thanks for posting the review, I’ve been wondering about this set. To me it does feel a bit fig light, for £50 I’d expect maybe one or two more clones. I’m not to sure about the oversized issue, it seems to me it’s better to have something a bit to large and have a better level or features than something smaller will less.	negative
Christian, thanks for this outstanding review! I have been waiting for this moment for someone to do up an excellent review like this. Republic Fighter Tank is my 2nd favourite set, in my Clone Wars list. The 2 Clone Troopers could be easily add up to your RGS, since it offer only more trooper. However, I felt that this set is quite overpriced. In fact, all Clone War sets are very expensive. The Fighter Tank, has a very great color combination of red and white to represent the Republic. The wheels below is the most impressive feature, which enable the hovering feel. The hatch is a neat feature as well. However, I noticed there is a rubber band within the control panel. May I know what is it for? I really enjoy viewing this review. You had given the insight which will eventually determined whether to get it any sooner or later. pr0visorak, on Aug 2 2008, 05:35 PM, said: This set costs a S$100 in singapore.I went to Hng Kong too see lego and the shops there are more expensive by a few dollars.However,I went to Australia before and everything there is the same price but when there is a sale it becomes very cheap! Hello pr0visorak. You are from Singapore as well. Welcome to Eurobricks! I hope you will do an introduction to the rest of the members in this forum.

I personally think this is a great set, but a little pricey. I wish it was available in the US though.	positive

I wish they made more sets with those colored Droids as well. We should have got them with the Hailfire droid and Dwarf spider set I think. I also just noticed look the ball turret on the manual there's no markings on it.	neutral
Nice review. Sadly my dark ages came right before this set was released.	neutral
Thanks for the review. I love these affordable little sets. Not so affordable now because of the cool figs but i'm going to have a look on eBay and bricklink right now just in case! An army of tan red droids would look great. Maybe we'll see some if Geonosia appears in the new seires somehow unlikely since the Confederacy was defeated at the Battle of Geonosis. I wish I could have bought this set when it came out but i'd just left university so I was super skint and had to miss all the Ep.II sets now they all cost loads even in used condition. At least now there has been a re-design of the gunship and AT-TE from the Clone Wars series that I can buy.	neutral
Great review! Man doI wish I had those red droids. I'm using the Dell XPS-1, and holy crap is it clear. Those pics were beautiful!	positive
~VBBN~ the pics were 12 mega pixles which is quite a lot I think, although I had to scale them down to 800x600. I used to dream that TLG would bring out these sets of the Geonosis arena and you could join them together to make a massive arena but I doubt they would ever do that. Also look out for my forth coming reviews of 4500 Snow speeder, Some TIE fighter with a LUL DV, and GG wheel bike chase. I have taken all the pics all I need to do is upload them. Also I would review the Jango Fett's Slave 1 but I have customized it so much I don't really want to revert it back to it's original state. Edited by Skipper 24, 02 August 2008 - 07:18 PM.	neutral

I always thought this looked liek a cool set, with lots of nice (and sadly unique) pieces. Unfortunately the only Attack of the Clones sets I got were the Jedi Starfighter and Yoda vs Dooku. Amazing sets, but I would love to have owned them all. I'd never really looked into this set very much, so thanks for the review!	positive

I am fairly confident that something involoving geonosis will be released in 2010 but any way I had this set ( one of my first ones) but i droped the ship and it blew up. I found all the pieces but in never rebuilt the ship. Although I still have the figs ant the canon. Overall this set was above average in my opinion. Great review!!!	positive
Thanks for the review. I actually like the older Tie better, since it had a stand for the Tie. Not really a fan of the LU figs either. No matter - a Tie is a Tie and this is a must have fighter for any LEGO SW fan out there. Never can get enough Ties, except the Tie Advanced or Vader's Tie...they don't rock... KimT	positive
And now for something completely different: Tiny Turbos belonging to the racers line! When I saw 8147 bullet run on S@H for half the price I couldn´t resist buying it. We had a lot of fun celebrating a bag-build at our event using the 8150 ZX Turbo of that theme so I knew what would expect me with this "extended" set. Price: normal 49,99€ now 24,99€ (well I paid 34,99€ in a Lego store but that´s another story...) Bricks: 796 Minifigs: - Hey, this is tiny turbos, stupid! Stickers: Don´t ask (or read further) The open box reveals seven polybags, some with more smaller polybags inside, the instruction booklet, 2 ramps and the sticker sheet. Of course I put all of the bags on the table and not on the floor Hey, TLC didn´t print this on the first page of the building instructions! And you won´t see any piece callouts as well. On the other hand this is not adifficult build, so why show them? Still there is an inventory list of all bricks at the end of the instructions. Note the giant sticker sheet! We all now the DSS, but that is a new kind of extra super large sticker sheet. It holds 82 stickers! More to that later on. The build is quite basic. The only non-conventional parts of the build were the two slammers. And the most annoying part was fiddling the rubber band of the holder without destroying it. Bag 1: Easy beginning: Building the lime car, the limo and the two slammers. Nothing exciting about the lime car, but the limo was neat. It´s an 18 studs long car! The normal racers are abot 10 studs long. Nice way to put the horns on the back! The slammers. Mmmmh. Nice invention if they would actually DO something. They are supposed to give the Tubros a kick in the butt to speed them up, but the result is a 80 cm long "run" and that´s it. I had expected more acceleration from the slammers. But it´s also fun to play with the cars without slamming them. Bag 2: Convoy time: The tow truck and the fuel truck The tow truck is a great idea and a good addition to the set. The cars are supposed to crash - how do they get back home? Well, here´s the answer. Quite american layout of the truck and it´s very well done: Horns, 5 flashing lights and a right color choice. You can move the arm up and down and pull out the hook. Note the metallic silver antennae. The fuel tank has got a "secret" function. It may break on the middle of the trailer. Therefore it has a hinge build in the bottom. City fire mayhem! And there´s no fire engine... Bag 3: Long, longer, how long can a "tiny" truck be? The pipe truck, an unexpected buggy and the red racer. 36+ studs long: The pipe truck breaks every convention. The cabin is almost the same like the tow truck and the fuel truck and that is the good part of it. The trailer has to carry pipes and is functional as well as it can commute sidewarts. It looks quite unrealistic as well and you cannot drive this beast on tiny roads. Good for another crash. But there are more cars in this bag. Now this was a surprise: A buggy? This is the only 6(+)-wide car, but just because the wheels are large. Monster truck madness? I don´t care for those cars. Personally a disappointment, I would have preferred another racer. + for variety though. Did I say another racer? Here we are: The red devil. Great looking, a real fast shape and red. The best racer in this set. Vrooommm! This is the most "played with" car of the set. (Not only from me ). As you may have noticed I didn´t put any stickers so far. I don´t like stickers especially when placed over two or more bricks! And here you are supposed to do it several times. Of course the cars look better with stickers on, but they are also great without stickers. Only the fuel truck looks boring without. My sons didn´t know there were supposed to be stickers and they didn´t ask for them. So everything is allright! Here´s a closeup of the sticker sheet (did I already mention it was 82 stickers? ): The only exception I made using sticker was for bag 4: Bag 4: You go here? You pay! The highway toll booth. The only immobile part of the set, but great to brake though the barriers. That is fun! I only put on stickers on 2x2 plates where I had the idea to use those plates further on on different other MOCs. This looks a bit boring without the other stickers I admit. But still no cut off to the playability! There are also two ramps belonging to the set. These only make sense if you are able to speed up the racers with the slammers and hit the ramps correctly. I had problems with that, so they are on the shelves now... Could be a lot fun making a contest though. Like this (picture of the inventories frontpage) All cars put together: The usual leftovers: All in all this is a great set to call ones own! I did not regret buying it, especially when it was 50% off! Even normal price would not have been too much. Build: Great for smaller children, boring to AFOLs: 5/10 Special bricks/colors: None, all basics: 3/10 Design: I love the tiny turbos´ size and design: 9/10 Playability: -1 because of the slammers, another -1 because no minifig-scale. But that is not the intention of the set: still 9/10 Price/piece ratio: Dang! It´s not on sale any more. But if you hurry you could still grab one in the Lego stores. 10/10 All in all: 8.5/10 and a clear recommendation! It was and still is a set to play with your children. The size fits perfectly to Matchbox cars and that was exactly what my younger son did: Can you find all of the cars included in the set? P.S.: After buying this set I won an ebay auction with another tiny turbos set - 8135 bridge chase. This is even more fun! I will soon care for a review with some never seen photo-tricks as well. Stay tuned! Edited by WhiteFang, 23 May 2009 - 07:02 PM. Indexed	neutral
Thanks for the review. I'll definately get this set sooner or later. IMO the Tiny Turbos are awesome. I actually bought nearly every set so far, built the models, added the stickers and packed them away in zip-lock bags in the attic. Sadly I don't have display room for them (yet). A fine set, carwise.. Dump the slammers and buildings into the spare bag and keep the cars. KimT TINY TURBOS ON!	positive
Tiny Turbos are good for parts, but I'm not so keen on them as they have no minifig drivers. So, I wasn't sure about this set. But your review has made me like them more, I probably won't buy the set but I appreciate it more. Thanks for the review!	positive
Thanks for the review! I have quite a few TTs.(tiny turbos). I never got this one, but if it's on sale....	positive
Looks like a pretty good set with a some nice colors. The spider is probably the best model in my opinion, but I mean look at the wasp kinda weak it you ask me. Nice review .	positive

Always CREATORS ON!	positive
There isn't much difference apart form it has stickers on and is grey. Also the guns and tow cable gun are different as well as the engines. But if you look at pictures of the Hoth base speeder not to much is noticeable.	neutral
I have mixed feelings about this set. It's one of the sets that sent my into a dark age (the birth of my son contributed heavily). When I first saw this set I was convinced that the earlier Snowspeeder (7130) was superior in every way. I liked the look of the 7130 version better, I liked the coloration of it better. The turret was better (it used a webbed 6 x 6 dish). After seeing this review, I realize I was wrong on some accounts. The cockpit is much more movie accurate. The 7130 version had two separate compartments. This version also came with a tow cable, something that was lacking from the previous set. While I still am unimpressed with the overall look of this set, it is much less blocky, which is always a good thing. Overall, I still prefer 7130 to the 4500 version. But the 4500 isn't nearly as bad as I first assumed, and I regret never buying one of these when I had my chance.	neutral
Podracer not sure where you got that from (I didn't have them out)? The set with treads is a Dino 2010 thing which fits in well after a bit of modding. Also there are some of the old EXO-Force sets out there like the Fire Vulture because I always saw them fitting well with Star Wars.	neutral

You have to love the originals, well I didn't like the very first snowspeeder so this is the original to me. I like it more then the new one that comes with the Echo Base, beter color scheme and more realistic i think. I got this set in stores and still love it to this day =]	positive
Good review, I like it a lot. Nice Job	positive
This is one of my favorite SW sets. It is a good size to the HOTH base and the AT_AT.	positive
7255 General Greivous Wheel Bike chase review Parts: 111 Figs: 2 Price: £10.00 The first set to include GG. 1. General set and Minifigs (not manual because I don't have it) The contents of the box after being built. Both minifigs. The set includes 5 Lightsabers! My own design GG. GG's cape on the outside. GG's cape on the inside. 2. The Wheel bike Front view standing on legs. Side view. GG can't hold the controls because of his arms. Roller mode. The legs are a bit to chunky so to roll it has to be tilted forward. 3. Boga The lizard. Grey tip to the tail. The front back and saddle split in to three sections. 4. Overall Build: 4/10 There isn't really much to build. Minifigs: 9/10 It comes with GG with the special cape and Obi-Wan in ROTS gear which is hard to find I think. Design: 5/10 Not really to scale but otherwise okay apart from Boga which just looks like any old dinosaur. Also the controls on the Wheel bike aren't really right. Parts: 6/10 Comes with some Dark Green bricks and lots of rods ( the guns on the wheel bike) the Boga feet are also nice. Price: 8/10 £10 for 2 figs isn't bad it could have a few more parts though. Playability: 10/10 You can easily recreate the movie scenes with this set. Overall 7/10 It would be better if the bike and Boga were more to scale and more accurate as well as the set having more parts.	neutral
Not one of my favourite SW sets. Kinda boring and the set is poorly designed IMHO. We do get the general, but that's not nearly enough. Thanks for the reivew and fine pics. KimT	negative

7153 Jango Fett's Slave 1 Review Parts: 358 Figs: 2 Price: £20.00 (I got it on offer I think the RRP was £40) The only set to include Jango Fett and young Boba. Also the decals on Jango are from Fine Clonier. (I'm trying to say they don't came with the set) 1. Manual Worn manual. Random page. Another random page. Looking at this page you can that this set has numbered bags. Back cover. Look how old Yodas computer looks . 2. General set and Minifigs The sets contents. Jango With his hair on. Jango with helmet on with front view of face. Twist Jango's head to initiate super bounty hunter mode. Jango's doubled sided head. Boba. Nothing to special although I think the torso and head are exclusive to the set. 3. The Ship Not really scaled up right as you can see. The guns can rotate. The central sections interior. Not sure what this is. Is it a hyperdrive or a bomb or something? There are these side panels on both sides. Behind the panels. A secret compartment. Trans orange minifig heads in the compartment. I think they're supposed to be saturnic charges. Side storage compartment. The back of the ship. How those trans orange minifig heads fallout. There is a magnet on the inside of the ship. But for what... The secret prison which also has a magnet on the top so it can stay on but easily come out. The doors on it can lift up to put prisoners inside. 1 of 2 identical wing things. They can fold for flight mode. The controls. Bottom jet thing. LET ME OUT OF HERE! The prison is great for capturing small children. 4. Overall Build: 7/10 Impossible to build without a hard stable surface. Minifigs: 10/10 2 Exclusive figs. Design: 7/10 Nowhere near to scale but has some nice features. Parts: 8/10 Good parts like that big cockpit canopy. Price: 9/10 For the price I got it was pretty good especially with the figs it comes with. Playability: 7/10 Lots of features but it would be better if it came with a JSF. Overall: 9/10 Lots of features and comes with exclusive minifigs.

Thanks for the review. It looks like an interesting set, even if not as good as Boba's. Skipper 24, on Aug 3 2008, 08:11 PM, said: I never got the original Boba fett's slave 1. I wish they would make one to scale with the minifigures. I would be so cool. You mean it would be so cool?

Nice Review! I will say i like the latest Slave I the best as it is longer than Jango's. I haven't seen the first one so i cant really comment.	neutral
That was indeed a set that never appealed to me. Its build was just plain wrong and awful. I only bought it because I found it on clearance at around 15€ (and they had 4 of them. If I had known better then, I'd have bought all 4; Seeing how much that Jango Fett minifig is worth now... ) But I ended up heavily modifying it in its propoions and now it looks ok next to the new Slave One (which is the best one of its 3 incarnations, I think)	negative
I got the Original JSF for Christmas, which I might buy and review. Wonderful set, the Obi in this one is really awesome and it's really just a great ship, sticker free. Probably my favourite, I'd fly it if any ship from Star Wars. Maybe I should get it and the Slave I from Episode II... after all, I like Jango despite having a crap story.	positive
Okay I have fixed that pic (thanks Oky wan). I have modified this but then yesterday I built it back to its original state to review it.	neutral
you added some decals to the Jango figure, right ? They seem to be suffering a little. I remember buying this set from the discount tent after my first visit to Legoland Windsor. I wasn't sure whether to buy it, even in their sale ... but I was glad I did once I'd built it :)	neutral
Yep those decals are suffering. I am going to apply some new ones now with proper paper.	neutral

Outback Desert Racer G'day Mates! Today from the Legoland's Desert Down Under, I'll be sharing an image review of Outback Set #6550, Desert Racer Set #: 6550 Theme: Outback Year Released: 1997 Piece Count: 48 Minifigs: 1 List Price: $4 (USD) Starting with an image of the box: And the back side with three alternate models: Instructions and decals: The pieces: A side view of the vehicle: Diagonal view: One minifig: And the complete set: PROS: - Price is under $5 ($4 USD retail) - good impulse set - Goes well with other Outback sets - Combination of yellow and green pieces - Working doors and liftable top for playability CONS: - Stickers on doors, hood, and 1x4 tile. No printed pieces - No accessories (a wrench, gas can, and other extras would have added to the set) - No extra tire for blow outs SUMMARY: I picked this set up new a number of years ago as a true "Impulse Buy", after buying one of the larger Outback sets (Amazon Crossing or Outback Airstrip). It's a neat little addition to the theme with its working doors and playability factor. Although I only built it once before today, I would buy again if I had the opportunity. Hooroo for now! Some good Aussie music to leave you with: Down Under	positive
This set looks liek a good buy for $4. Wish it was still around, but Like you said, it needs accessories.	positive
I remember having this set (actually i even still have it, at least the pars are SOMEwhere ) when i was a child, and i used it for making races, as it is there for. All these many reviews let me think again at that i also planned to make some reviews for the town section. I got your message TheBrickster, don't worry! I got a lot to do at the moment, but i should find some time this upcoming week.	neutral
This little set really makes my point small playable inspiration to build the set into a few other models, Great set I wish I had it my town is going to need more vehicles. I really miss main model instructions with alternate build idea's.	neutral
I can prodly say I own this little bugger. It's not much, but it is a nice addition to the series. They are also easy to build, so you can get a rally going quite fast. Stauder.	neutral
7261 Clone Turbo Tank Parts: 801 Figs: 8 Price: £70.00 (ouch! ) EDIT: new box pics added. My version of the set comes with a normal Mace Windu figure and an extra clone trooper. Also the Mace Windu, BARC trooper and jet trooper minifigs were exclusive to the set (Well you could make the jet trooper yourself) . Also my set came with 4 extra blasters (you'll see them later) and Baby blue vent things instead of trans blue. 1.Manual & Box The front of the box. The box compared to the motorized AT-AT and the hailfire droid and dwarf spider droid. Minifgs. The back which has pics of the sets functions and alternate models. Inside the box it has a white cardboard divider probably for strength seeming as the box it so flimsy. Pretty hefty manual. The TT manual compared to the one of the AT-AT ones. Random shot. Another random shot. Poster at the back of the manual 2. General set and minifigs The whole set. I accidentally left one of the plates up when I took the pic. Close up of the figs. Two battle droids come with blasters and a mini turret. The republic. From L-R: Jet Trooper, Mace Windu (not LUL), BARC Trooper, Normal Clone, The Commander, Look out. Jet pack. Mace's torso. BARC trooper legs. BARC trooper torso. He has got to be my favorite clone trooper by TLC. The mysterious commander. On LSW he was called Cody (right) but he has star corps Armour making him commander Bly (left) . Normal Clone and the look out Clone with electro binoculars. 3. Speeder Bike Side view of the BARC Speeder. Menacingish front view. (is menasingish a word?) Printed back engine piece. One of my shield things came with a crumpled handle it is worse than it looks in the pic. 4. The turret The turret. It can rotate and point upwards. But what if you want to blast all those Battle droids that are shorter than the height of the turret blasters... add another hinge in! That extra hinge in action. 5. The Tank It's to big to get a decent side view pic Johnny the cabin boy on the crows nest. Front 2 seater cockpit. The 2 seats. Better be careful you don't fall off your seat there are some pretty big gaps down the sides. Back cockpit with dual missile launchers. The back seat. The engine. The large central storage. The turret controls fold down to lock into place so it doesn't fall out when driving. You can put 2 minifigs up top. Mace and a Clone driving. you can see those 4 extra blasters, 2 orange at the front of the pic and 2 between the chairs. The turret and jet trooper. BARC trooper on the BARC speeder. The commander on the lift chair in the back cockpit. Another shot of that chair. 6. Overall Build: 8/10 Quite enjoyable because it incorporates Technic and system parts. Minifigs: 9/10 On a set this size it has quite a lot including some exclusives such as the BARC trooper but it could of had a droid or 2 more. Design: 7/10 way out of scale but generally pretty strong due to the technic frame. Parts: 7/10 Lots of plates and nice minifig parts. Price: 6/10 Justifiable because of the amount of figs in the set. Playability: 7/10 Includes some CIS units to fight the clones. Overall:8/10 Needs more droids and it could be bigger. I will also probably have a break form reviewing for now seeming as I have just put out a whole load of reviews. Edited by KimT, 09 August 2008 - 08:51 PM. indexed as 7261 Review 2	positive
Nein! You rejected LUL. LUL's are awesome! Thanks for the review! I like the set a lot, Mace is only featured here. Great fig of him too, I like the grey Jedi Robes torso. Cody is great as with the other figs. The tank's probably a second favourite, next to the mighty AT-AT of course.	positive
I hate how the original release had the light-up Windu, which was really lame, and one less clone trooper. I bought it when it first came out, so missed out on a good Windu and another clone trooper.	neutral
Thanks for the review, I'll index it later. I've added a poll, so that members can vote their opinion and refrain from useless comments like "awesome!!" (This has been done to all reviews in the SW review index). Keep up the good work. This is one of my favourite sets - I have both versions and as it is known, the only difference is the minifigs. I really like the tank, it has great playability and if it had wings, I'd definately swoosh it. KimT	neutral
Did your version without the LUL mace have trans blue grill things (like the ones on the back of the speeder) ? Or was my set a one off.	neutral
I got the original version of this set with the LULS Mace Windu figure. When TLC released the non-LULS version I managed to swap - they sent me the new version (and a Clone Trooper IIRC) and I mailed them back the old version. This was a great set; the suspension worked great and it rolled magnificently. Nice review with good photos, but again your price is a little off: £69.99 is the RRP (unless the price you paid was £80). TK	positive
Skipper 24, on Aug 4 2008, 04:04 PM, said: Did your version without the LUL mace have trans blue grill things (like the ones on the back of the speeder) ? Or was my set a one off. I bought mine online, thinking it was the new version but I ended up with that very lame LUL fig. I just hate that fig... It's completely useless, we can't use any part of it for anything (although, I only discovered yesterday that the lightsaber blade was a standard one and not glued, as I always believed, so all isn't completely lost) In the end I still was rather disappointed by the set. It's too full of holes ( Hum; I think there's kind of a paradox in that sentence...)... But the BARC Speeder and green clone are indeed fantastic. Oh, and yes, mine came with sand blue grill parts instead of the trans-yellow ones... didn't realise it at first, and I spent half an hour cursing, thinking they forgot to put them in the box. But in the end, I don't know if the replacements are any better , since they're supposed to represent some kind of thruster light or something... All in all, I think it's my worst set... Not necessarily for the set itself which is OK, but psychologically, there's too many things that went wrong with it...	neutral
Nice review AGAIN, Skipper. I passed on this one because of the price, but it's a nice set. Good for you for getting the newer version with non-LUL Mace and an extra clone. That purple blade sure is a beauty. The tank itself is alright, just an AT-AT on wheels, in my opinion. The turret is great, though, and so is the speeder bike. I didn't realize that the jet pack had two "nailguns" (harpoon guns) on it. I thought that the nailgun was a new piece... but the jetpack is very cool.	positive
6701 Space Minifigures Review Set#: 6701 Set Name: Space Minifigures Released: 1983 Pieces: 36 (including minifigs) Minifigs: 6 Brickshelf Gallery Peeron.com Bricklink Brickset.com Introcomment: As I reignited my love for Classic Space a few years ago, I decided to start hunting sets I didn't have. This small one fell into my lap very cheap. With box and minifigs in great condition. So now I've resized the pics and done the review. And NO I am NOT envious of this forum...really...I'm not.... The Box. The box is pretty neat. It has a very comfortable size (compared to modern boxes) and the back of it shows what you get. I like the way they (TLG) split the minifigs and arranged everything neatly. Front: Rear Sadly the box has seen better days. But it's age taken into consideration, I think it's just fine. The figs: A fine collection of red, white and yellow space figs. Some great accesories to go as well. Not much more to say, except this was a great "army-builder"-set. A true must have for most Classic Space fans. The verdict: It's kinda hard rating this set, since it's a minifig supplemental set. No design or colourscheme to comment on. It has a lot of playability since figs will always come in handy when building/playing with your Space sets. KimT	positive
Thanks for the review KimT. I gave this "Above Average". I believe I had this one, but it was so long ago... I'm still a bit freaked out by the yellow ones! When I emerged from my Dark Ages I kept thinking "gee, I miss the people packs", but now that I have over 500 mini-figures I don't feel that way anymore. Even so, I wish they would re-release some of the classic old ones.	neutral
Pretty nice set, but the newer minifig packs had greater variety in both the figures and equipment. My favorite one among all of them is 6704, which is also the only instance of both Blacktrons appearing in one set. Quote I wonder why this set had no blue or black astronauts? Whatever the case, I always loved the small minifig sets that Lego released, as I could never get enough astronauts. My favorite was the set of Futuron astronauts. I think the blue and black guys hadn't yet been released at the time of this set.	positive

7674 V-19 Torrent Number of Pieces: 471 Number of Minifigs: 1 Price: £49.99 The V-19 Torrent starfighter was an assault fighter with exceptional speed and maneuverability used by the Galactic Republic during the Clone Wars.It was a predecessor of the Alpha-3 Nimbus-class V-wing starfighter, in terms of purpose and usage. It first appeared in the Genndy Tartakovsky?€™s Clone wars 2D series. Basics Box front: The box art shows the torrent flying above Tatooine, with the new blue and white ?€œclone wars?€? style packaging, Box back: The back shows some of the features of the set including the lifting mechanism and adverts for 7679 Republic Gunship, 7675 AT-TE and the 7673 MagnaGuard starfighter Inside the box, there are 2 instruction books, a very small DSS and 9 bags that are not numbered. Bags: Instruction books Random manual shot Parts list Book one is mainly the construction of the body and one of the engines, Book 2 is the other engine and the wings. For better pics of the manual look on lego's website. Sticker sheet: A very small sticker sheet is included, which includes 2 republic insignias and a nose sticker. Minifigure One minifigure is included, a clone pilot. The whole "OMG only one minifigure in this set" and "Its not movie accurate, i hate you TLC!!!11one2" has been beaten to death, so please don't make this review turn into that and to be honest i don't care because its an awesome figure. TLC have made the effort to print the life support device onto the chest plate so props to them. He has the "clone head" like the rest of the clones have in the CW releases, there are no extra clone bits apart from a long blaster, that's not included here. Interesting/other pieces Printed piece! Rare/unusual pieces: there are 2 pistons included, as well as 2 weird looking technic pieces that serve as the landing gear during the build. which might explain why the set is quite expensive, it musn't have been cheap to manufacture them. The build It starts off relatively simple, the first 16 steps is getting the basic shape of the cockpit and the mechanism to make the middle wing move up and down. After that the next few steps are getting the landing gear/wing folding device done, it's actually the same thing so when the wings move into attack mode the landing gear retracts. This is then locked into place by the white beams that form the basic shape of the fuselage. Up to step 46 is the fuselage, as well as fitting the hydraulics. This is what it looks like when the fuselage is complete. The cockpit is not "air tight", there's is quite a big gap Top: Bottom: The final few steps of book 1 is the construction of one of the engines, here it is attatched : The yellow bar is not permanent, its used to keep the white bit at the top from moving downwards. The steps are repeated in the second book so that both engines are now in On to the wings! First one attatched, The middle one is attached now: and finally the last one: It is now finished! The pieces that are left: So, you're probably wondering, how does it enter attack mode? well can you see this bar? push that bar to the center, and pick it up, the hydraulics move the central wing downwards as well as the side wings to enter attack mode: The outer wings have flickfire missiles on them, they obviously don't work, but it increases the playability of the set. The cockpit opens in a similar way to General Grevious's starfighter released last year, using a sliding mechanism For other pics see here : http://s25.photobuck...eview/?start=20 and i'll be taking other requests for pics, maybe a video of it switching between modes. Build: 7/10 very symmetrical build, the mechanism to move the wings might annoy some people. Minifigs: 5/10 1 fig in a £50 set, however it is a starfighter Design: 9/10 very accurate to the source material, Lego have really made the effort to make the movement feature work. Parts: 8/10 lots of technic, white and dark red pieces Price: 7/10 could be slightly cheaper, Playability: 6.5/10 need to buy some enemy sets to get the most of it, flick fires don't work. comments, requests, questions and criticisms welcome.

Thanks for the review, simonjedi. This just re-affirms that the V-19 is my highest priority this fall. Behind the RGS, of course. Is that new printed piece a 2 x 2 Tile? It looks like an excellent detail part for MOCing. Those black pieces used on the landing gear look very Bionicle-like. If they haven't been used before, I'd suspect they will be. Not that I'm a Bionicle expert or anything. It is a shame that this set only includes one clone. That seems to be the only drawback to the set. Everything else looks spot on.	positive
First, thanks simonjedi for a great review. I'm interested in what you think of the hydrolics. I could spend hours just deploying and undeploying the wings and landing gear. I'm a little worried, the very first batch of the hydrolic piece for, umm, I think it was the off-road 4x4 Technic set, was very fragile and broke after a few uses. These seem to be holding up but I'm anxious to see if they hold up after 100-200 uses. quote name='Walter Kovacs' date='Aug 4 2008, 11:47 AM' post='337841'] Those black pieces used on the landing gear look very Bionicle-like. If they haven't been used before, I'd suspect they will be. Not that I'm a Bionicle expert or anything. [/quote] Right you are. They are Bionicle Bohrok head pieces. So pretty old in Bionicle terms and fairly useless in my opinion but they do make interesting looking landing gear as I deploy and redeploy the wings and landing gear. Hopefully, we'll get a pilot in the battle pack to help mitigate the fact we only get one here. -Tohst	positive
The printed part isn't new it came with 10178 motorized AT-AT walker. Also nice review, I would get the set if it was a little cheaper or came with more than 1 fig. Whyhas it got 2 instruction books the set isn't particularly big?	neutral
Thanks for the review. I've added it to the index and added a poll in which members can vote their opinion on this set. I think this is a very good set. I like the colours and the very playable feature that allows the wings to lock in attack formation. Now all I need is to buy this baby. Edit: I gave it an Above Average rating, since it's well designed, looks sturdy and fits the SW theme sets perfectly.	positive
Nice review Simon Jedi. The V-19 has been one of my favourite ships since the release of CWA and this is one of the sets I've been considering most about buying. It's great to see TLG's treatment of it. It looks like no expense was spared making it as aesthetically and functionally accurate as possible - though I think the cockpit windshield could maybe have been slightly bigger, but that's just me I'm sure. It looks pretty big compared to other starfighters too. Did it take a long time to build?	positive

Thanks for this excellent review simonjedi . This looks like an awesome set and this is the set I am most looking foward just as well as the Separatist Spider Droid (7681) .	positive
the ability for it to fold in and out of attack position has wowed me. This is my top priority now. Thanks for making up my mind.	positive
In addition to my last comment am I correct in saying that the left over yellow technic part was merely to hold parts together while building? Edited by Skipper 24, 10 October 2008 - 09:10 PM.	negative
I built mine today. As soon as I tried to put it in attack position, the thingy rotates the wrong way and it falls apart. What a waste of $55	negative
Rayman, on Nov 29 2008, 10:16 PM, said: Yes I believe that the yellow technic is only used for the building. However I didn't find it neccessary. What a strange step... Its to hold the wing connectors in the the same place while the wing is being attached.	neutral

Also, I don?t think it is a waste in my opinion, the ship is very well designed and is actually pretty strong (Or at least mine ) and the pilot minifig is fantastic even if there is just one of them.

I love this set and I gave it "Outstanding". I might note though that the cylinder is just there as a dampener; when disenegaged the wing function still works, just not as smoothly. Interestingly though the cylinder is an old piece, (I have a few others) it's just that this is the first time it's been used without a spring... I had no problems assembling this set.	positive
Having just bought myself a copy of the wonderful metroliner (4558) I felt like doing a review. Before we start I'd like to thank Greenhair for selling me one of his metroliners for a mere 80 euros. Granted, the motor, "trainstation" and tracks weren't included but I did get an extra railcar instead. - * (please note that I have included the fourth wagon in the final pic but that the official set includes just three wagons.) The metroliner was released in 1992 and was extremely popular amongst lego fans. The set A picture of the box showing the set completely. (pic taken from peeron) and one of the minifigs and the accessories.: As you may notice, TLC was extremely generous, supplying us with a grand total of 11 minifgs amongst which no less than 4 female minifigs. Ah, the population crisis is finally over We also have three suitcases, three cups and a small freight parcel and freight handling thingy. Normally this would include two bicycles; a red and a black one. A general side view of the three carriages. (thanks to Greenhair and the Brickster) And here's one of the extra carriage. (thanks to Greenhair and the Brickster) Moving onto the front and back carriage, which are externally identical. Please note that Greenhair changed my back carriage's headlights. These would be yellow in the normal set. All the doors in the entire set are printed pieces. (sorry for the bad picture quality in this one) The interior of the two however is laid out a bit differently. The space in the front carriage is occupied by a cockpit (or whatever it is called in trains) and some space to store your cable connecting the front lights with the engine. I can imagine it must get quite cramped and dangerous for the minifig driver with all the cabling. Further back we have a quite random, weird looking engine. One part reminded me rather of a jet engine on a commercial airplane. The engine is accessible by means of the two side cargo doors. At the end of our first carriage we hit what looks like the train's restaurant, two tables and no chairs. The two middle carriages are identical, both have a small sink nicely hidden from the intervening and impolite looks of fellow passengers. The carriage further contains two tables and four seats. Two cargo spaces are nicely tucked away from view below the tables. Our final carriage has a back cockpit as well but differs from the front carriage in the central cargo area - where our train employee is hard at work earning his lego nickels - and the rear sleeping area. The bed is a double one, the upper one able to be flipped up for somewhat difficult access to the lower one. The train station I could not take photos off since it was not included in the purchase. Judging from the building plans however I feel it was thrown in at the end just to add 'something' to the set. Its construction is very simple, consisting of a few grey plates on top of a few pillars. Access is provided by a plate which is connected to the platform with a few hinges. There are however two lamp posts, a timetable and a few chairs so if you don't like the platform you can still use these parts in a variety of other constructios. To end off I took a pic of the complete set (with extra wagon) and a friendly surprised train driver opening the door and greeting the camera man. Conclusion Being a '90s set, the train basically builds itself. The entire build cost me two hours and a half (I lost quite some time simply admiring the set) and was extremely straightforward with no suprises at all, but I need to admit it has its charm. The exterior is simply amazing. The sleekness of the design, the colours, it matches perfectly! I believe however that a width of 8 studs would be more to scale but 6 wide still looks amazing. The interior is somewhat simplistic but is easily moddeable with a few extra pieces. I basically bought the train as a parts pack. The standard set (three wagons) includes no less than 8 train doors with windows, 14 train windows, 4 smaller longer ones and 4 freight doors. The front and back of course count as unique pieces as well. One feature I am displeased with are the printed doors. I like printed pieces and while the blue-white-red stripe looks beautiful on the side the printed doors kind of limit MOCing capabilities to carriages with a stripe on the side. I considered simply removing the stripe but I found out I could just get normal grey ones from bricklink for a fair price. I am very pleased with the train but since you already know my opinion, feel free to tell us yours of this fabulous set! Edited by TheBrickster, 09 July 2009 - 01:51 PM.

I voted outstanding, this is simply an amazingly good looking train and comes with indeed 11 minifigs! I sold this one because i need a budget to build my ship, but i kept one because i love it! Not bad for a first review Ruben!	positive
Ah, i wish modern trains had 11 figs... But seriously, why is there a civilian train stop in a CAVE?! did 1 too many people get lost playing ZORK? Edited by maiq the liar, 04 August 2008 - 10:21 PM.	neutral
Oh Ruben you lucky so and so this set is one of the most beautful i have ever seen! Splendid looking build and 11 figures, all the same faces like but still you get that old woman pig-tail head piece which is just great! I thought you meant the monorail set when you told me about this but guess i was wrong (don't laugh i've been away from lego for quite some time) and for 80 euros it was a real bargain from a great friend! Really nice review hope this sets brings you years of joy!	positive
Cool Review. I actually have two of these. I got one for christmas when it was rereleased in 2003 and another one in a charity shop a few months later for €5. I love the minifigs even if they all have smileys, and having two sets of them can really fill up a town.	positive
Nice review I collect all metroliner i can, i have 3 metroliner and when i can, i buy a other . My aim : Have the more big metroliner collect, in France ( in first time ) It's my favorite set	positive
Really Nice Train, I always wished TLG would have made the passenger IR train longer and maybe used some of the nice features of this train, I still love that faucet piece.	positive
This is a great review of a great set, Hairy Ruben! I voted for Outstanding since the only thing you can say about this train set is that it is outstanding. It has been the best passenger train in all the time from Lego's beginning on until now. I bought the rereleased version of it in 2003 - and I really, really do not regret it! Klaus-Dieter	positive

At the end of our first carriage we hit what looks like the train's restaurant, two tables and no chairs. There shouldn't be so much of the light cable in the front section or "cockpit." Most of the cable should be in the central part of the train. Then it is not so crowded for the engine driver. I have never had a problem with the cable and the space available for it. The only problem I had was that the cable had a loose contact after some time. When the train went into a curve (can't remember if it was a left or right curve) the light went off. I have now got the same problem with the cable that I put into my Santa Fe Super Chief. Always when the engine turns into a right curve, the light goes off. My dad could repair the cable for the metroliner. Even though he is quite skilled at repairing electronic things, he found it very difficult to repair since there were no screws to open the electronic plate. It annoyed him a lot. So I've been asking myself if I should really bother him with a second cable with the same problem. The train set itself is outstanding (and that's what I voted for). I only have the legend 10001, but it's 99% identical to 4558. I also have club car 4547. I don't have the legend club car 10002. The reason for this is I always had the choice between one big LEGO set or several small ones for Christmas when I was a child. I always went for several small ones. Metroliner 4558 would have been a big train set, but I really wanted a passenger car. So I bought 4547 with my savings without having the metroliner. I was quite happy when the metroliner was re-released. I bought it with my own money. Then I could finally use the club car with the train it was created for.

I don't like the set and I do like the set. The reason why I like it: it looks good. The reason why I hate it: this train was the first train for the new 9v system and it means to me the end of the beautiful 12v series. For this last reason I own this set. I voted average. Only strange they named it metroliner. In Holland when we speak of a metro, I need to think at short distance trains only used in big cities like Rotterdam. And your minifigs at pic ain't right according the instruction .	neutral
My favourite, favourite, FAVOURITE old set. It's too bad I was born 2 years after its release, I would have had a major interest in Classic Town. I might actually get this one on Bricklink... not that it'll go for a good price (I'll only buy if it does you see). An "Outstanding", a highly useful and well-made set that really just stands out from its counterparts. Edit: NEVERMIND. Edited by Dovchenko, 16 August 2008 - 10:25 AM.	positive

I never got this set I spent a long time after one Christmas trying to get and failed miserably, admittedly I was much younger then. It has however remained one of my most sought after items but I’ve still never got around to getting one. The set generally makes me rather nostalgic for a time when the trains were painted in simple liveries like that one! Anyway it seems an excellent set from what I’ve seen and the figure selection is amazing. I hope Lego produce something as good as this when the new trains are released next year.	positive
Super review, thanks. Simply put, I'd have to admit this is one of the best Indy sets. And in such a small package. It's a very detailed lil' jeep, and that's why I like it. I have this too, but I don't want to open it since it's exclusive. Wait, I thought we were calling it "rown" and not "frown"	positive
Thanks for the review Hinckley! I love this set! I still haven't renewed my BM subscription, but i'm sure I can find this on ebay or bricklink. And what an addition this would be to my army. Edited by ~VBBN~, 05 August 2008 - 01:32 AM.	positive
Nice review Hinckley. I just got mine as well by paying quite a high price for it since its exclusive to US. However, I had not opened it yet and I left it in my friend's car. I gave it for an above average for that cool little jeep. For an exclusive BrickMaster set, this is certainly one of the best vehicles I had ever seen. I like its construction built. If this is ever released in the main stream, I am sure it will be a hit to get a small sized Indiana Jones set.	positive
Outstanding set and review, thanks for presenting it! I've had this since it first came out, but didn't think it would be that impressive, so I didn't bother opening it. Now, I'm tempted. Aside from the slight size issue, I can't find anything here to gripe about, except for the limited availability. I want 5. I think that makes me a parts monkey. Eek eek. You're exactly right about this selling like mad. It's another one of those missed opportunities for TLG. Sure, it's nice to get people to subscribe by offering it as part of BrickMaster, but in the long run, put it in the stores for $6 and sell a million. Just give us Indy's manbag, we need it for postal employees and such. As is the running joke whenever I comment on one of your reviews, I'd give this a solid 985. Not out of anything, just 985. Or, in clearer terms: + 1/2 (though I voted 5)	positive
Nice review! I would like to get this set... unfortunately I don't get Brickmaster mag, and the prices on BL/ ebay will most likely be ridiculous. I wonder why Indy doesn't come with his murse (man purse) in this set? Thats the best part of the fig. The jeep itself is very nice, especially with the dark green. By the way, what is frown? Brownish... something, I guess. Oh yeah, and funny comic.	positive

This is by far my favourite Outback series set! I loved the fact that you can bend the bridge in different directions so that the suspension of the car really worked to keep the car levelled, like you placed it in your last picture. I had lots of fun with this when it came out eleven years ago in 1997, the bridge scene could also be used in the Adventurers serie of 1998. Classic, highest rating, buy it if you don't already have it!	positive
A nice set to go with the outback theme. I am kind of dissapointed they they didint continue the theme, as I only managed to grab 6487 and 6550, none the less, this set is very interesting as it's one of the few to feature working suspention. Stauder.	positive
Great review Brickster Why exactly did the outback, Adventure etc. themes never quite catch on......Just a thought. What a great set! I wish I had it, But in 1997 I was just back from my whirl wind trips around the world and had drifted away from Lego I don't know why. But I will say this I love the actual suspension that came with this set and the trains sets I have been trying to buy up as much of it as I can, And now I see I need to add one more set to the "I need to get that"	positive

Thanks for the reviews once again. It looks like qite a nice set to me, although the European version will lose the big gun.

This is my first review, so I thought: the smaller (the set), the better! 6626 Snowmobile Year: 2000 Subtheme: Arctic Pieces: 20 (+1 extra) Note: Polybag; 6577 is the boxed version Price: €.1 + S/H on eBay MISP (Mint in Sealed Polybag!) Building time: less than 2 minutes. If it came out in the last months, if would be called an Impulse set. It actually came out a few years ago; being those my "dark years", I missed the Arctic line. Now that I'm back into business, I wanted some! But not all of the sets were good (or easily available). I had the chance to buy this one, and I0'm happy with it. As you can see below, it consists of a figure on a scooter; the only accessories are those chainsaws that lie on the sides (unless you take the skis from the scooter and have the minifig wear them!). The extra piece is a TransYellow 1x1 round plate. According to Brickset and Peeron, the difference between box and polybag is the sticker "sheet". You choose whether the nose is better with or without the sticker: I'd say "with". The judgement: it's cheap, it has a cool minifig with a cool head accessory and a nice torso. I don't think I like that orange colour that much (and I can't understand why those blue pieces have to be... blue; I guess it's beacuse the whole line uses blue with orange!), but I have to say this is definetely a good set. I'd give it a 4 out of 5 in its category. If you want to own at least a set per every theme, this could be your Arctic one.

Nice review Cobra. Thanks for sharing. I think Arctic was one of those neat themes that never really took off. I like these little poly-bag sets as they make great starters/introduction sets for themes (or) serve as a nice supplement or add/on to an existing collection. I've always liked the thick green hood piece used in the Arctic theme and have thought about using it in a SW Hoth scene. In any case, nice review! I've got an Arctic set that I built recently and will share a review soon.	positive
Nice review AgentRick.$30 is a good price, but TLC think thats €40 so i'll have to pass. BTW I thought this ship was supposed to hold many droids like in SW Battlefront. Oh well, its good for show. Edited by Skinny Boy, 09 August 2008 - 09:31 PM.	positive

I don't really like this set because it isn't my idea of the droid gunship, which is from SW Battlefront, which can hold as many droids as a RGS can hold clones. If I buy this, it'd be for the dark blue pieces, which is the signature color of one of my Castle Nations ( Dark Red and Dark Blue ).	negative

Emergency Evac Set #: 6445 Theme: Town Res-Q Year Released: 1998 Piece Count: 97 Minifigs: 1 List Price: $8 (USD) In 1998, Lego introduced a new theme called Res-Q. The theme was really a quasi-Coast Guard sub-theme of Classic Town. The theme included boats, helicopters, emergency vehicles, and even a water hovercraft. Most notable was the black and yellow color combination that predominated the sets. I only picked up a couple of sets from the theme including this Emergency Evacuation vehicle that I consider a van. I never got into the theme, but looking back at these sets, I have gained a better appreciation for their value in Classic Town. Let's take a look at 6445 in greater detail. Starting with the box: The back of the box providing a few alternate models: And similar imagery on the instructions: The set includes one small sheet of decals for the van: 6445 has one Res-Q minifig that I find pretty nice. I like the neon orange reflectors: He has a nice printed backside with the word RES-Q prominently displayed: This little set includes an abundance of tools: A black walkie-talkie is not pictured Here's the emergency van: I like the back section that has a nice winch with turning wheel and a few hooks for tools: Here's the minifig pulling the grappling hook for some Res-Q action. This is my favorite part of this set: The van isn't too fancy but has some neat features: While I like the blue windshield piece for maybe space sets, I'm not really fond of its use for the van: The van has no steering wheel, but rather two levers for steering: On the top of the vehicle are two emergency alarms and some extra lights: The back of the van has a large opening piece that allows wide access to the back section: It comfortably fits a long gurney/stretcher: Here's the driver resting on the gurney: He should never have tried to pick up the gurney without a 2nd Res-Q minifig. And a shot of the back section without the gurney: Lastly, a picture of the complete set: Final Thoughts Res-Q is really a neat theme that has great play value for kids. While it's not one of my more favorite town sub-themes, it does offer some nice pieces and an abundance of black and yellow pieces. I think a few of the Res-Q sets go nicely with the Divers theme released one year earlier in 1997. I had a chance to purchase the largest set of the theme, 6479 Emergency Response Center, at half the price, but passed back in the late 90s. I'd be interested in finding out what other EB members think of this set and the Res-Q theme.	positive
Wow, and people complain that a military type line would be to violent. Here we have half dead soilders and a space shuttle bombing people with severed skeleton heads! i have to say this is the first time i've heard of this theme. I like the colors as most have pointed out. The base plate is preety cool two. Could use it to moc up some garages.	positive
That's IT! Thanks for the review but now you make me want to build my own one! THANKS A LOT! ON a more serious note, I really like this set and have always wished to aquire it. I have two broken Tie Interceptors, so this should be a easy build. And as someone in the pirate forum, I think, said, It would be a great baseplate for building cave to hide the booty! Thanks PMG and welcome!	positive
Thanks for the welcome everyone! Though I'm still wondering where the Drone Minion/Commander idea came from.	neutral
Thanks for the review PMJ . I like the play value in this set even if I don´t own it . The way the orbs are put into the rocket is awesome and I really like it, but at the end the set have some lack of detail .	neutral
Set: 7680 - The Twilight Theme: Star Wars Year Released: 2008 Piece Count: 882 Price: $AUD149.99 (or $159.99 if you buy at TRU!), 99.99 Euro, $US99.99 Pity the Twilight. When rumours of the set name first circulated, speculation was swift: 'Twilight - that suggests something sleek, elegant and mysterious.' Anticipation mounted! Fan-frenzy grew! Finally a pic leaked! And the verdict was... 'clunk-a-dunk' It appeared that in the Jedi off-season, Anakin was running something that looked like an intergalactic garbage scow, like Roger Wilco in the old Sierra Space Quest PC games. Blocky and bley seemed to sum it up. The set went from being one of the most anticipated to one of the least liked of 2008 pretty much instantly. It's a mark of that dislike that in the EB Clone Wars review feeding frenzy nobody has so far even bothered to post a few pics of this set even 2 weeks after it's official release! I'm here to redress that imbalance now and find out if 7680 is as horrendous as everyone originally thought Part 1: Box & Parts Front of the box. It's quite big, same size as the 10144 Sandcrawler. Annoyingly, it's the old style with the perforated corners that you have to tear to flip open the lid. Detail of the back, showing set functions: Interior of the box - a lot of wasted space. The set comes with 2 instruction manuals, each 76 pages. And no DSS sheet! Polybags! 13 of 'em. Like the other CW sets, these are unnumbered. Parts ahoy! You can tell at a glance that this set is comparable to the AT-TE, although there a large proportion of the 800+ parts here are technic pins and bley plates. Part 2: Minifigs and Build The set comes with 4 figs (or 3.5, depending on how you look at Rotta ): Anakin, Ahsoka, R2-D2 and Rotta. Very disappointing that there's nothing new here for such a high-priced exclusive, although I guess it is maybe movie accurate. Anyway, to paraphrase the wise Patsy Stone, you can never have enough hats, shoes or new Anakin/ Ahsoka hairpieces so it's not too bad. Pics of the build in progress. A quarter of the way through we can already see that this is one of those 'convoluted technic frames with some plates affixed' type builds: Half-way and the smaller wing is added: At the three quarter mark the giant single wing is added: And voila! Done! The final quarter is a race to attach all the exterior surfaces and details such as the engine and escape pod. The build itself is a mixed blessing. It is VERY technic oriented. I'm not a Technic-ally minded person and don't really have much of a conceptual grasp of how everything functions until I see the final result, so I find these type of builds a little uninteresting. Pins, axles and beams? Give me bricks any day! I really liked the 7676 Gunship and the 7679 Fighter Tank although they do contain some technic framework, they are largely brick-built ships, especially the Fighter Tank which is solid, largely brick built and full of neat functions. The 7680 build is one of the most technicy builds I've ever undergone in a System set, akin to the experience of building the 10178 Motorised AT-AT. But whereas with that set you could understand the need for a technic framework (the thing walks!) a lot of this seemed excessive. Yes, the Twilight does some have nice functions, and it is so large and heavy it does need a strong skeleton, but to me it just seemed too much and aesthetics have been sacrificed for (in some cases limited) functionality. I will discuss in more detail what I mean as I look at different parts of the set. On the upside, this is the only non-symmetric set in the CW range, so at least every page and new step brings something different! Part 3: A Closer View Close-up of the main body of the ship: Front-on. It is well-designed how the figs appear in line of sight (unlike the 6211 where Jabba and Leia were photoshopped in to the box art). Don't ask what Rotta is doing out of the line of vision there. Some things are better left unsaid. Side view, showing escape pod (smaller cylinder) and drive: Top view: Rear view, showing back door. The rear deck is huge. Indeed, the whole ship is huge. Oddly so. I don't know if this is movie-scale or not, but I've seen people complain the fighter tank is too big (!) and that set is nothing compared to this baby! It's wider than the Gunship and in wingspan and length is almost bigger. Here's a few pics next to an MTT for comparison. Pretty big, hey? Turning to the dark side must be good for business. Even if all you can buy is a rusty old beast like this, at least you could comfortably squash pretty much every vehicle in the opposing fleet just by landing on it. At least now you can see why it costs so much. The official pics make it look smaller, somehow, by truncating the rear and wing. The ship is in fact so big you can't really pose it with wings open - only hold it that way. I was too lazy to build a giant trans-clear support strut so propped it up on a shoebox instead. The wing opens very neatly - you push a technic lever and a pin holding the bottom wing pops out quite smoothly. The little top turret can move up and down as well to get the full cross-shaped effect. Part 4: Features and Functions The front cockpit folds down very neatly, although I find the build here a little weak. Whee! It goes all the way down to the floor. The mechanism is cool, but it takes up an awful lot of space. Basically the whole front is cockpit and all Lego could manage for controls is 2 printed 1x2 tiles as well (not pictured here, but they're attached to the part that folds up and down). There's also no way for anyone to get in or out of the cockpit. And an invisible windscreen! Technology has come a long way. Side view, looking from wing. R2D2 is here as well as some tools. You can also glimpse here one of the main problems with the set. Despite being a huge boxy ship, there's no interior! None! The Twilight doesn't even have an internal floor. All the room inside is taken up by the landing gear which folds up - again, a clever function but it really gets in the way of the set as a whole. Kudos to the designer for coming up with stable, working landing gear, but too clever by half if it means that this giant ship ends up basically being one tiny cockpit and a rear door at the back that doesn't lead to any interior! Underside showing landing gear when open: And closed - when the wing is folded down, the gear is locked in place, which is pretty neat. Space-consuming, but neat. The rear section. The door, when opened, reveals an orange cupboard and a tow-line, as Ahsoka uses in the box art. The door clicks into place when open and can be released by pressing the technic bit at the top. Again, clever, but pointless as you can't get inside! Ahsoka can indulge in a little recreational bungee-jumping if she so wishes: The rear deck is so large that it is wasted just being used so Ahsoka can bungee-jump. I came up with a much better use for it. Outdoor garden! Despite having one roboticised hand, Anakin was still quite the green thumb. And his light-saber was very useful as a hedge trimmer. So much so that he set up a side business between Rotta-rescue missions. Here's a promotional postcard: A few other bits and pieces. The gun turret on the enormous mega-wing can only hold one flick fire missile at a time (you do get two, though ) Rear engine detail: The escape pod sits neatly on the side and is basically built the same way as the Gunship bacta tank: The pod sits on these tehcnic pins and is held in place by the light bley parts: Part 5: In conclusion The Twilight is a huge ship, with a huge amount of great functions - folding wing, folding cockpit, rear door, escape pod, retractable landing gear! But this functionality comes at a price - a very complex technic build and zip interior. Compared with the Gunship, for example, which is stuffed with nooks and crannies, the Twilight suffers in this respect. I also think it is just too large - it doesn't really fit with the other craft and vehicles released with the Clone Wars line. I may be wrong and it is movie-accurate, but when you have all the CW sets laid out it does stick out like a poor thumb. Part selection is OK, with the only interesting things being a few dark orange plates, the orange cupboard and the big trans-neon green radar dish. Don't get me wrong, I don't think this is a bad set at all. It's just the other CW sets are so sweet! I would say it's an above average set in a field crammed with excellent ones. If you're a completist, buy it, but if for example you'd rather invest in another AT-TE to upgrade your Republic Army, then I couldn't really disagree with you either And to finish on a light note, I'd like to remind you that you do get another Ahsoka hairpiece, which can be used for all sorts of things. Ugha warrior upgrade: Dr Inferno hair transplant: And finally, attack of the deadly blue-ringed octopus, native to Australia's beaches and oceans! Thanks for reading!	neutral
Really awesome review svelte_corps . You did a really complete and in-depth review of this beast and with your nice pics is really enjoyable reading your review, so congrats . I like this ship even if it looks so bulky but I need to buy first other sets, so maybe this beast will be landing in my collection the next year (Or this one if I am lucky ). I can just ask for something, can you post a pic of all your clone wars sets together with this one (all the sets in one pic, not many pics with this an each set ) please .

I think a lot of people feel the same way - there was so much good stuff to get in the first wave that this is probably a backburner set for a lot of people, and some are probably waiting to see the movie to see how prominently it features. I will try and take a pic with some other CW sets, I don't have all of them though and some need to be reassembled as I built them on holiday and then had to pack them away I do think this line of sets has been the best SW Lego wave released though. All of the recent releases have been amazing in their own way.	neutral
I read the Visual Guide recently and learned a bit more about the Twilight. I won't get into spoilers but it seems that the ship becomes a sort of endearing family van for the characters which is neat. Big bulky, uncool, but it gets you from one place to another. If it factors into more than just the 90 minute film, I may pick this up. It seems that there's room for a lot of personality in this ship once you see the film. It is a Corellian freighter smuggling spice for the Hutts. That's cool right?	neutral
This is probably the best review I've ever seen. Why? It put the set in context with people's changing thoughts about it. It commented on the box, why do such expensive sets have such ordinary boxes? The photography was outstanding. Every issue that a builder could have with it was discussed in a calm and rational manner. I have the same issues with technic structured sets, and svelte_corps summed up my feelings on this beautifully. This was an even handed review, so thoughtful. Finally, you gotta love a bit of humour in a review, that gardenis brilliant. I was probably never going to get this set anyway but it sets a new world's best standard for reviews. I strongly encourage anyone that's going to review a set to have a good look at this to see how well it can be done. Thanks for the magnificent review!	positive
Zzz, on Aug 12 2008, 09:00 PM, said: And I simply LOVE that there is space inside. You said there is not really some cause of the landing gear mechanism, but it seems it should be easily fixed. Do you think there is enough space to put some plates over the landing gear and add some beds, kitchen und TV? I think this set is so perfect to mod it into a Clone Wars mobile home, your back garden ist just perfect for this. It does have that homely feel! There is room inside with technic beams to lay plates etc on, the only issue is that it's kind of fiddly to access. You could do it from either the side door or rear door though, maybe move that tow line at the back. I have to say, it is a set that grows on you	positive
Seems like TLC has done a pretty accurate representation of the ship. The real fault for the ship's messy design has to go to Lucasfilm, not TLC. My guess is Lucasfilm is trying to recapture that "what a piece of junk!" magic of the Millennium Falcon. I guess we'll have to wait to see the movie to see if they succeeded or not. The idea of a "space mobile home" reminds me of the Winnebago from "Spaceballs." Great review!! Informative, entertaining, and opinionated. So many people shy away from stating an actual OPINION in their review for fear of offending anyone. What's the point of making a review if you don't state what you think about it???	neutral

Having plenty of time on my hands this summer I did some reviews. Yes, I'm aware this has already been done, but I'll just do it once more. No harm there Set# 5615 Set title: The Knight Price: 2.99 Euro / 3.49 USD Pieces: 21 (yes a whole 21 bricks) Release: 2007 The Box: A neat little box that has a great size for dropping into your shopping cart. For once TLG didn't shove the bricks into an oversized cardboard box ;) The Knight: This is a great minifig. Though he looks a little unsatisfied...might be because his head isn't put on "all the way". A great army builder fig. The only thing that I find a little annoying is that the "collar" isn't completely rounded. It looks too much like an animation and left-hand work. The Weapon Rack: YES! Thumbs up for this. Plate mail, sword, shield and jousting helmet. Plus the spear and open helmet on the fig. So many great additions to put into use. Bring it on pesky skeleton army. The all in all verdict: A great set. A little too expensive compared to the Crossbow Attack in which one gets 2 knights and a skeleton plus bricks for 5.49 EURO / 5.99 USD. But still a great army builder set. And the 7090 set, does not have the same Knight fig. KimT	positive
Very good set. Indeed the possibility to alter the knight's appearance hugely boosts the value! Very smart thinking of TLC. Got one of these so far, but if I ever do a Castle-related comic or animation, this will be the set I buy tons of.	positive
Argh! What I was typing kept getting deleted by my stupid keyboard!!!!! On Topic: This looks like a great little set, I could use a few of these, but I haven't seen any at a local store. Too bad for me I suspose . Great review, and I like the green plate on the bottom, never can have too many greens for my small but expanding swamp I'm building. Hope I can pick some of these up eventualy.	positive
Time for another of the great Castle sets. And yes this one is a great army builder set as well :D Set# 7090 Set title: Crossbow Attack Price: 5.29 Euro / 5.99 USD Pieces: 54 Release: 2007 The Box: And as the other two sets reviewd so far (7009 and 5615), this one has a fitting box that is too easily snatched from the shelf and put into your shopping cart. - Not sure it's a great thing...too expensive in the end :D The Crossbow Attack Cart: The cart is a neat little build that actually works. And for once we're not given that awful technic launcher, but a "build-it" launcher! It actually works just fine for it's purpose. The addition of two crossbows makes it worth buying. Never can get enought weapons for the evergrowing Crownie army. The Figs: Oddly I've not taken any pics of the figs and therefore I'll illustrate using the S@H pic. The figs are great. I love the silver helmets and in this set you get 2 crownies and a skeleton plus a white skeleton horse. That's a lot of figs for a set this size. A true army builder. Thumbs up for that. The All in All verdict: Another small, yet super set in the Castle theme. I bought several of these to make a fine little army. It's cheap and often found on sale! I can hardly resist buying it when I see it KimT	positive
This is an awesome set in my opinion. I scraped my crossbows for MOCing recently, but the set is still an amazing army builder. For the price for the SW battlepacks, which have 4 minifigs and a cheap vehicle, you get 4 knights ( this is 2 sets to equal the price of a BP ), 2 Skellys and 2 skelly horses, plus 4 crossbows, 4 good wheels, and some other good dark blue and brown pieces for my ever expanding castle town. Great Buy.	positive
And another set enters the scene: Set# 7009 Set title: The Final Joust Price: 8.29 Euro / 7.99 USD Pieces: 62 Release: 2007 The Box: And yet again TLG has put the bricks in a box, that somehow corresponds with the amount of bricks in it. The Castle theme has got well designed boxes :) The whole set (build): 2 knights, jousting fence and weapon rack. The Weapons Rack: Another great addition of weapons. Flail, halberd and skeleton scimitar. Super weapons for those close encounter melee battles fought when tipped off the horse : :grin:P The Jousting Fence: Not much to say. It's a fence. Simple, yet it serves it's purpose very well. The Crown Knight: Gotta love that guy. He looks like nothing can hurt him. He even got a selfsufficient smile on his face. I'm sure he's convinced that no skeleton can defeat him. Also the horse, it's barding and the headcover looks awesome. A great old school sword and the ever cool normannic shield. What could possibly go wrong for this knight? The helmet I really love. IMO it's a lot better than the old knight helmets (see review of 5615 The Knight for a pic of one of those). The Skeleton Knight: The black skeleton horse ROCKS! I love that design and in black it's even badder than than the white version. The shield reeks of dread and the knight is one bad skeleton on the rampage. I do find that the helmet is a little off! I'd rather have a black knights helmet instead. The KK helmet doesn't really do it for me. The All in All verdict: This is another great army builder set. It holds a lot of great weapons, some cool minifigs and great pieces. The only thing that puzzles me is; why would a Crown Knight joust a Skeleton? Doesn't really make sense. KimT	positive

This set is a great little bundle, the kitted out knight, skellie knight, weapons, and the few bricks for the fence and weapon rack. The Castle 07 barding here is very nice, indeed the colour scheme of the new Castle guys is great IMO, the light blue and blue work nicely together and against the grey background. I don't really like the pearl grey helmet - it would be nicer in metallic silver like the visor I think. Interesting comment re: the skellie helmet - I guess black normal knight's helmet with visor would be quite nice for him. I got this set as part of the Complete Castle Collection from S@H. However, I have extras of all the smaller sets and Skeleton Tower, except I don't have another one of this set. It's on my list of sets to buy. Unfortunately it wasn't on S@H for Ireland when I was making later orders - quite an odd omission. Also last year Castle '07 was exclusive to Argos (UK catalogue retailer) who only had three sets (not the joust). I should see if the local toy store has it now though, as they did stock some '07 Castle in addition to '08 at the start of the year. I think small sets like this should be well stocked in shops for a year or two - it surely doesn't do their sales much good to be so sporadically available? Sorry, turned into a bit of a ramble. Anyways, the point is that this set is good enough I'd pick up another. The Cobra: that sucks about customs. I try to keep my orders to within the €23 duty-free limit for here in Ireland. If your imports are waylaid you pay 20% import duty, 21% sales tax, and a postage fee for the diversion to customs. NASTY! Edited by brickzone, 13 August 2008 - 11:15 AM.	positive
You know what I think this set has? Charm. Lots of it. I'm not a big fan of castle, having very few sets, all of them spanning different nations/armies, but I couldn't resist this set. And while not obvious at first, it really is backwards compatible with every castle set with a horse in it. Nonetheless, I think this set is great. It's simple, cheap and has charm. That's good enough for me. Plus it has that fantastic grinning knight and the black skeleton horse. Those just made it better.	positive

Good review KimT. Pictures are clear and show each of the pieces in great detail. I agree with your comments as well. I'm a bit curious, does the knight's helm have a hole for plume? I've been debating whether to purchase this set or not. I'm not a big fan of horses so I'll likely barely use them, but I do like the unique minifigs, weapon rack/weapons, and the fact that the divider has a few useful pieces that can be added to other sets. However, I just don't feel the set is worth $8 when compared to Crossbow attack and the Knight's Catapult unless the buyer is really wanting some mounted minifigs. Luckily, Amazon just lowered their price of this set from $8 to $6 (along with another 20% if using Bill Me Later... just in case anyone was also in the same situation I was in).

Yes, there is a hole for placing the knight's plume. Do correct me wrong, if I had answered wrongly. It's been awhile since I last touched my castle sets. Thanks KimT for this fine review. This is one of the castle sets which I had bought high volume, mainly for its horses, barding and the weapons. A great army builder and accessories for your castle armies.

INDEXED Name: Holiday Villa Theme: LEGO System / Town Year: 1988 Pieces: 197 Minifigs: 2 Price: USD ? There were quite a few sets in the 1980's that weren't sold in the US. I remember reading once that it was because they contained wine glasses and TLG felt they wouldn't be able to market a toy that encourage the drinking of alcohol. This set was one of them. I remember seeing this in a catalog that came with a Fabuland set and wondering what it was and where I could get one. I wrote to LEGO and got an overseas catalog which had the Futuron 6990 Monorail Transport System in it before it was available in the US. I was amazed. I ended up buying 6349 Holiday Villa from that catalog but, for some reason, gave it to my best friend for his birthday. I've always wanted this set and finally bought it from Bricklink this year.... My purchase included everything except the box. I really like the boxes. But, in lieu of a boxshot, here is the instruction manual: I imagine this was the image on the front of the box: The parts One of the things that appealed to me about this set is it's abundance of rare parts. This base plate is an excellent piece and was only available in two sets: Classic LEGO telephone: Technically, these blue windows 1 x 4 x 5 windows are only available in this set, according to Bricklink. It was available in different form (with and without fixed glass, trans blue glass) in other sets. Regardless this size and color window is rare and the blue door was only available in 4 sets. This was a huge selling point for me as I'm a window monkey. Never heard that term? It's like a parts monkey (a collector who buys mulitples of sets just for parts or large lots of bulk from BL and sorts them into bins) but just for windows. Tell your friends I coined the term: These sloped windows have endless possibilities in many themes (maybe not with the curtain decals applied) but are another great rare part that appears in this set: The build Remember this piece? I'd like to see a badass Agents car built on this car base! : I am a fan of the six-wide car but I see the appeal of the four wide. It has a very nostalgic feel to it: There's no denying that this is a beauty of classic LEGO 4-wide cars: This set comes with two mini-figures, one of which appears to be a painter. Classic vintage LEGO figs: Onto the house which begins with the basic floorplan: A kitchen that's open to the rest of the house and a little oven and hood vent is one of my favorite touches. It's one thing to throw an oven into a house set, but the designer of this set made it a cool part of the architecture of the house which gives it a unique feel: The completed first floor and carport: I do wish the sides of the roof were white with a little overhang like an actual roof. This method of white on bottom, red on top looks more like a child's drawing than a real house. This is easily fixed with some modifying. Still, you get a lot of roof pieces in this set: Here we have the completed set. The husband cleans the yard while the wife gets plastered on wine. Don't tell the American kids! Another angle: Working in the kitchen: Getting smashed before dinner. I think she may have a serious problem: The bedroom. A little stark, but the bed looks comfy: Overall shot of the interior: Rating Playability: 9/10 (The possibilities are endless with Drunky McWine-Wine and husband. Really, playability is up to the imagination of the player. It's a house, not really very action-packed.) Design: 9.5/10 (Great design with plenty of rare parts. Love the classic car, too! Loses half a point for the all red roof...) Price: NA (I believe this was inexpensive, but since I have no proof, I will have to leave this factor out of the overall rating.) Overall: 9.25/10 (Classic sets like this all deserve 10s in my book, but looking at it with an objective eye it's Excellent, but not perfect.)	positive
That's a great review of a great set, Hinckley! I voted for Outstanding : This set is simply amazing! I regrettably don't own this set since it's very hard to find on Ebay and/or the stickers are missing. But nevertheless I hope that I one day will be able to get this awesome set - or even better - see TLG releasing a new City villa in a style similar to that brilliant set .

Great review, and great set! I just wanted to comment on the beauty of the car included in this set. It gets no better than a four-wide car and hinged roof (with sunroof!)	positive
Great review! I'd give this set an 8 at the least. It's just a tad too simple for my liking but other than that it looks great! While I'm a 4 wide car man I actually think this car looks rather horrendous. The main body seems way too low in comparison with the windows. The rare parts however do make up for it.

Isn't it in the movie, though? Right before "Blame Canada?" On topic, I find it funny that people find that car so great. I don't like 4 wide cars but I also think it's beautiful just because of the nostalgic feeling I get looking at it-like hot cocoa on Christmas morning with a new teddy bear in my stocking. Get out of my socks teddy bear! My feet are cold! Is that Santa's boot dangling from the chimney? What's that smell? Anyway, does anyone long for the days of 2-wide cars with 2 x 2 slope windshields that were more suited for a skateboard than a car? I suppose someone has to have affection for those things. Who was around back then? CopMike? Gylman? Hobbes? Do you like 2-wide cars? Seriously though, anyone? My point is, as much as I like the realism of the six-wide and wider cars, the 4-wides make me feel all warm and fuzzy.	positive

This is my favourite house which I owned during my childhood. Although it's in the crypt, but I hope to build it back one day. Looking at your review makes me so envy of you to own a complete set. The baseplate is very unique especially for its stoned pattern. Classic LEGO telephone is just so lovely especially when its printed. The entire house layout is simple and very nicely constructed. In fact, the simplicity just showed how much LEGO could do with such parts. There are many nice furnitures included in this set such as the little oven/stove, dining table, bed and car porch. The little black car is a classic example of a true 4-studs car. I love this house very much, and my verdict is a full "5". No doubt about it. Thanks Hinckley for this lovely review.	positive

Thanks for the wonderful review. This is really a beautiful set - I love the old lego houses from the 80's and 90's - they were always very quaint and well designed. Actually, I like the old car designs too, but only for their nostalgic value (in reality, they are very unrealistic and look more like go carts). That said, not all four wide cars are silly looking - the 4-wide cars in these city sets are awesome and fit in with the modern CITY style great.	positive
Cool review! I never knew that those wine-glasses could be the reason for this not being sold in the US!	neutral
I wish I could find this set some day (including the right baseplate). Some of my House MOCs are styled after the classic 6349. And sometimes I've rebuilt it after Instruction Scans exchanging the baseplate (I don't own one of these) with 2 at 16x32 each. And this city house out of an older thread of mine. It's offensive, that I've used styling elements of 6349's just enlarged. In terms of interior details: Not much, but still enough for classic town.

This is an awesome set, man... and a great review. Just too bad it is so rare! I voted 5. By the way, does anyone know if there is a review for this? Or other sets that come with a camper, perhaps?

Hello all Eurobricks members and Town Lovers, Today, I will be doing up the third item in the SHELL Promotional series in 1998. Three out of the eight promotional sets are under Town theme. The third in the line is the Exterme Team sub theme which is promoted in 1998. Extreme Team is a bunch of adventurous, daring, breath taking individuals that risk their lives for an unforgettable excitement of the lifetime. Their vehicles range from land, air and sea type of extreme taking types. Extreme Team is one the unknown themes ever released in my "Dark Age". I only had this small lovely set in my Entire Extreme Team collection. Hope we are able to see more interesting reviews under Extreme Team as well. Name: Extreme Team Raft Theme: LEGO System / Town / Promotional / SHELL Year: 1998 Pieces: 19 Minifigs: 1 Price: USD$2.00 An image of a 2537, Extreme Team, Raft This will be an exciting water adventure! This is another great addition to your female population count. She is one of thhe daring individuals in the Extreme Team, that take her raft beyond limit, into the rough waters where she might face possible dangers. Look how confident she is, with those witty eyes of her. I am very sure she will survived the course of her entire journey. Raft's Design This is a very simple design, with just a big piece of wooden plank and a couple of logs tied together on the side, and it is ready to take it down to the water. Speaking of some real adventure, do you dare to take this raft in the unknown waters? There is a small holding area, where she is able to place her critical equipment to ensure her safety throughout the journey. Bottom of the raft Excellent range of equipment This set actually provides very good range of equipment. There is a pair of oars, hammer, life vest and backpack. The most wonderful piece of equipment is the pair of dynamites. First of all, they are printed. Next, they can be used in Wild West or any playing possibilites which involved in explosives. This is a very good impulse set to stock up these accessories. I wondered what she need to use these dynamites for? Her Extreme Team black jacket is very nicely designed, with their logo "X" or another way of saying "Xtreme". I find the green arms and black jacket matched pretty well, with that blue cap. Front view Relaxing herself, listening to the calm sea To summarise, this is one of the better impulse sets ever produced. It comes with a simple raft with tons of good accessories, and a very cheap way to obtain dynamites. In fact, these are my only 2 piece in my entire collection. Somehow, this set managed to find its way to my collection in my Dark Age, and I am very pleased to have this. No major flaws on this set, it fufill the conditions of an excellent impulse set! Summary review Playability: 9.5/10 (High playability involved. You can used it as an Indy, Adventurers or whatever purpose for the raft) Design: 10/10 (Very very simple design with superb great accessories. For a promo/impulse set, it's very good) Price: 9.5/10 (A very inexpensive set based on the 1998 pricing. Great way to buy this to add in some adventures of your own) Overall: 9.7/10 (This is a fanastic set, mainly for its accessories. Get it if you still see any of these. It's defintely worth the money, if its reasonable) I gave it a "5" based on my Review Score Card. What about yours? Hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine. Comments and Critics are strongly welcomed. Pictures can be found in My Brickshelf (When moderated)	positive
This would be great for any Pirate fan, the extraback pack for the soldiers, some spare owes for the row boats, a female face for a wench, and a rather simple raft for that unlucky pirate lost at sea! Over all a nice set, I am a little confused by the dynamite though... perhaps an easy way to go fishing or perhaps to clear a rock in the forseen future? Or is it that she is just a suicide bomber attacking the white house water (joke not ment to be tasteless or offensive to those lost in the act of terrosim, greatest respect to those who have lost loved ones) Great Review, Regards Cpt.

Aerial Recovery Set #: 6462 Theme: Town Res-Q Year Released: 1998 Piece Count: 201 Minifigs: 3 List Price: $25 (USD) My personal favorite of the Res-Q theme released in 1998 was this helicopter, 6462 Aerial Recovery. The set offered a pretty modern helicopter, raft, three-wheeler, rescue gurney and net, and three figs including a diver. The set is action-packed and offers a high degree of play value. Starting with the box, front side and back: Front Back I always liked the rough ocean/sea water pictured in the boxart. The same image from the front of the box appears on the cover of the instructions: But the back of the instructions picture a plain view of the copter: One sticker sheet with a few "Res-Q" stickers is included, mainly for the tail section of the helicopter: Interestingly, the set includes three figures, one being a diver. What I always found strange is the inclusion of an "X-Treme Team" Diver who has the logo on his torso (although it's a very nice fig): Back shot: I think this was my first set with a Lego three-wheeler. I always liked it a lot: The set includes a yellow raft (also found in the Divers sets) and some scuba gear: NOTE: the raft has a black piece in it's center for lifting up by the helicopter For sea and emergent rescue, a gurney can also be lifted by the helicopter: The set also includes a net with hook to lift the three-wheeler and other items. An extra string pulls the net closed: Here's a shot of the helicopter: The front section has a large trans. blue piece enclosing the cockpit: Inside is a printed radar slope: A smaller trans. blue piece appears a bit higher for access to the middle section of the helicopter and/or a small storage area: In the middle section is an place for the gurney and a box for storing some of the adventure gear: Here's a picture showing the gurney: On the side is a pulley mechanism that swings to the right when not in use: On the opposite side is the winch to raise and lower the grappling hook: Here's a picture of an open storage box: I like the tail section with propeller: Decal is not shown Here's another shot of the copter from a different angle: And the final image, the entire set: Final Thoughts Personally, I think this is pretty nice set. I like the thought of using the helicopter to rescue people at sea using the working winch. Extras like the trike/three-wheeler and the rescue net make the set even more fun. Hope you enjoy this Res-Q review.	positive
Thanks for this review TheBrickster, i also have this set and think it's one of the best helicopters TLG made in the 90's. It's quite big and has got place for 2 minifigs in the cockpit. I also like the fact that there's a victim included in form of the x-treme diver, which also is a theme i always loved as a kid. Do you have any other Res-Q sets left to review? It would be an honour for me to also do a review of one or more sets which are left, but unfortunately i got not much time at the moment.	positive

Cool, then i think i'll do a review of 6451 River Response later today or tomorrow, stay tuned!	neutral
Looks like a nice helicoptor, I love the 2 cockpits. I love the diver's head, I really need one of those.	positive
This helicopter is so cool and I agreed with you that this is a high playablity set. It's not common to see such a big scale helicopter which has two cockpits back then. The color scheme works well for me. With so much features such as the lowering of the grappling hook, storage box, storing of the gurney and etc. One thing which can be improved onto the helicopter is the rotors. It could be extended a little longer as the size of the helicopter is too big. It makes the rotors rather weak as it is not able to support the weight. I am confused why there is an extreme team personnel there. I thought he was supposed to be recovered from the Res-Q team? Although there is so many questions in my head such as why include the black tri-cycle bike, Extreme Team, and etc but this is still one very good set to play with. Too bad, I had never seen this before. Somehow, through your review, I like it very much. The only big scale helicopter which I owned is the 7738 Coast Guard Helicopter and Lift Raft. Neverthless, I gave this a "4". Thanks Brickster.	positive
A neat set with lots of accessories, but I never liked any of the LEGO helicopters with long streamlined canopies, as they are obviously more influenced by military helicopters and space ships, than by real civilian transport helicopters. I'd give it a 3 at best. Very good and thourough pictorial review though!	positive
I've always wanted this set and the hovercraft... too bad I never did. Great set.	positive
I stopped collecting LEGO sets in the early 90s because of this kind of sets. I've always been a classic town fan and I really didn't liked the futuristic design of TLC's newer sets.	negative
I think the set is too unrealistic, I like the new ResQ sets better (and I'm somewhat a Lifeboat freak so I'm always following such a sets with interest). I would like to see some rigit inflatable boats some day ;) but about the chopper, I like the accessoiries.	negative
metalandi, on Aug 24 2008, 04:17 PM, said: What exactly makes you feel this set isn't realistic? Since the question was asked... 1) tiny rotors 2) dual cockpits (only seen on a few military copters) 3) stretcher extends beyone edges of fuselage when inside the vehicle 4) Extra long canopy (really only seen on military helicopters), and "military" design. 5) Black colorscheme for rescue vehicle. The the stretcher, minifig designs and rescue logo are the only things about this copter that really suggest that it is a civilian rescue aircraft. It's a toy set with alot of play value, but I agree with Karto that these kind of desgins really turned me off to alot of the TOWN and CITY sets of the 90's. On the positive side, the new CITY sets, with thier realistic non-futuristic designs have really tempted me to buy more vehicles.	neutral
It took quite some time, but now i'm finally continuing with city reviews. This one beeing about a really good set of the RES-Q theme, and also one of my favourites of this theme. It brings a lot of playability and an incredible amount of useful pieces, even with only 145 bricks in complete. Set Nr.: 6451 Name: River Response Number of minifigs: 3 Number of pieces: 145 Release Year: 1998 Price: ~20 USD (Back then, when it was new) Unfortunately i haven't got the box of this set anymore, but the instructions are still there in good condition: We get 3 RES-Q minifigs in this set, from which i really love the detailed torso's: A shot of the complete set with both the boat and the little car off board: The before mentioned car is really, really little, but it still got enough space to transport 2 minifigs: A closeup of the rubber dinghy: The speed boat as stand-alone: As already said before, this set brings a big count of equipment and accesoires with it, which is really good for a set this size: In the middle section of the boat there is enough space for a minifig to sit in and put on his diving equipment: And last but not least, a shot from the whole set wirh everything attached, at the front section you can see a wench which also adds a lot to the set: When i got this set back in the day, i was really happy about it and for sure spent a lot of tie playing with it, because of it's great features as the wench in the front of the boat, or the car the boat can transport. I hope you like my little review, stay tuned for more in the next days! edit: I forgot the poll, can sombody add it please?

This is one of my favourite sets. I remember getting it in Tesco soon after it was released. Those were the days... The res-q line was good, and this set made it better.	positive

6004 Crossbow Cart Review Because I may start collecting Castle here is a review of one of my few castle sets. Please note I hurriedly put his together meaning some parts are the wrong color, look out for them! This review will also be done in my Star Wars review style. The lighting is also particularly bad in the pics. On with the review... Parts: 20 Figs: 1 Price: ????? 1.Overview and fig The whole set. The Fright Knight's knight. The disemboweled knight. The head printing is just longer then the helmet visor. 2. The cart The cart has 3 crossbows and 2 Norman type shields. The cart's advanced defense and weapons systems. All the parts from the cart. (Forgot to add the fig in) 3.Extras & overall Here are all my Castle figs. Remember I don't collect Castle. (yet ) Oh yeah I forgot to put one of the old skellies and a ghost on there. Could a castle fan tell me if any of these minifigs are rare. I have no idea because I don't collect castle. Build: 6/10 Pretty standard for a impulse. Minifigs: 7/10 Nice minifig with lots of accessories. Design: 8/10 This set made way for some of the new castle carts of similar size. Parts: 10/10 3 Crossbows, 2 shields, arrow quiver, and spear as well as cool minifg in a 20 piece set! Price: 10/10 Well I don't know but LEGO was cheaper in '97 so it gets 10. Playability: 5/5 Pretty much standard for a impulse set. Overall 8/10 Good parts and price as well as minifig scores this set an 8. Thanks for reading.	positive
Very nicely done - this cart is a striking resemblance to the crossbow cart we got in 2007.	positive
Nice review I agree with Thok it’s quite similar to the more recent crossbow attack, though this one has the added benefit of two shields. This set would I fleet be more useful to army builders than most of the modern castle sets, even though many people don’t like frightknights.	neutral
Looks great, and the figures up there are old, and kinda rare. I don't really like fright knights though, so I probably won't get this set.	neutral
Thanks for the review. I've added it to the index. I'm not a fan of this theme. But I have to say that this is a neat little set, that does hold some good things. Figs and weapons are always welcome and one can never have to many wheels. So I rate this "Average."	neutral
I gave it Above Average. It was a nice set and included some nice pieces, but it is only an impulse set after all. Edited by NewRight, 19 August 2008 - 01:06 PM.	neutral
Originally shared in the History & Adventure Forum for its adventure attributes, here's my favorite of the Outback collection: First, let me say that this little set is one of my all-time favorites because it can be used to sumplement a number of different themes. 1) the set makes a great little adventure airstrip for Adventurers and more recent, the Indiana Jones theme (see also German Headquarters and Port Adventure). I've also used the set as an addition to my Wild West town. The tan baseplate and windmill works great, just subtract the plane, modern equipment, and figs. And lastly, as the set was intended, as an Outback/desert airstrip. Set Description: Outback Airstrip Set # 6444 Pieces: 157 Minifigs: 3 Release Date: 1997 Original Price: $20 (USD) Starting with the box: And the backside. Notice the alternate models. I love the swamp boat: The building is my favorite part of the set. It is simple, has a little detail, two great roof pieces, and a single green window (great piece!): Check out the great windmill piece. It's my only one and makes a great part for Wild West and that farm you always wanted to build. I used it for the Barnhouse of Barnabas Higgens and Spring Valley Ranch On the side of the building is a great radio and a clear glass: Unfortunately, no furniture can be found within the building: And now the airplane: Front view; I love the twin propellors: Side view: And the rear section: The back has a small cargo hold for some boxes/freight or some gear needed in the Outback: The set includes three figs, two with cool shades: And some great equipment. I love the boom box: A shot of the whole set: And another: Summary: As I mentioned above, this set is very versatile and can suplement a few different themes. It's my personal favorite of the Outback collection and I'm really glad I was able to find the set in the late 90s (I almost didn't buy). Sets like this are timeless and so much fun to build and display. Hope you enjoy the review.

Great Review! This set has cool features. I just wish that Lego would release this as a Lego Legend and release it to Australia too, since this is a set about Australia. I would've bought two if this were a Lego Legend. That is how good it is. I like the building with latticed window and windmill. I also like the cargo airplane, windsock, and radios. Plus it looks like it's got great minifigs.	positive
This is really an ideal small set. In spite of its size, it has nearly everything: • Three minifigs • A vehicle • A building • Numerous minifig accessories • Numerous rare and useful parts • Nice model design (especially for the time period) Too bad Outback came out during my dark years.	positive
This is probably my all-time favorite LEGO set. It was originally given to me for my birthday by a close friend of mine back in the release year of 1997. The cargo plane was, by far, my favorite vehicle ever. Unfortunately, someone stole the plane from me when our families went on vacation and the rest of the set was given to my cousin's oldest son when I was no longer interested in my LEGO collection. Now that I'm back into LEGO, I use that building's construction for various projects, especially as a Dr. Inferno look-out shack using parts from extra Mission 3: Swamp Raid. The shack compliments the original set greatly. Edited by Skorpius47, 19 August 2008 - 01:44 AM.	positive
This was a cool set I thoght of it as i was building The post plane.	positive
The Building is great and detailed, with a few mods it could be added to my Castle town. I don't really like the plane though, seems kind of abstract, not really good in my opinion, but I bet it would be easy to mod to look better.	positive
One of the best in my humble opinion. As far as I know it was never released in the UK so the only reason I managed to get my hands on it was on a family holiday to the US, I think they’d only recently opened the Lego store in Disney. Arguable the best feature is that it seems to fit into a wide selection of themes, is it a airstrip in the middle of nowhere, is it next to a only mining town that’s not deserted the possibilities are rather open and that’s truly great.	positive

Set#: 7103 Theme: Star Wars Set Name: Jedi Duel Pieces: 74 Release: 2002 Price: 10 USD Minifigs: 2 (Count Dooku and Yoda) Links: 7103 Brickshelf Folder Bricklink Reference Catalog Peeron.com Introcomment: I remember getting this set solely because I collect Star Wars. As I rebuild it and took pics of it, I found that I actually like this set for different reasons. Dooku's speeder is pretty cool and the lightsabre rocks. The Dooku minifig is also great. What's not so great is the flythingy and getting another Yoda. Though that's kinda hard not to get in a set focused on their duel "You can't see the wires, because they digitally removed them." "Be careful or I'll digidally remove your head" - Steven Seagal [I hope I quoted that one right ] So to get the review on the move, I'll impress you all with a box picture: Neat, huh? One of the smaller boxes, but still kinda big when consider that you only get 74 pieces and 2 minifigs. The instruction isn't that big As I said, the Dooku minifigs is awesome I love the print on his torso that combines the brown cape with the torso and also the head is neatly designed. Not a fleshie, though. This was before the flesh-license-facelift A sideview of the light blue speeder. Mmmm that crome light sabre hilt is nice The design of the speeder is also ok, and without the usual off-colour-scheme bricks. No tan or yellow sticking out there Yeah, I'd panic too if this came right at me...who wouldn't when noone's driving? And a rear shot. I think the design is a little off. The shields makes it all a little too open in my opinion. The printed bricks are a kick and thus evens the score here. This hideous design is meant to flip Yoda around the air. Put him in this funfair from Hell thing and give him a twister he and Dooku will never forget. My guess is that it's there to add some playability, but it's just odd and quite useless. Much like the playability soccer thingies in the Ultimate Light Sabre Duel The Verdict: Ups and downs. This set offers both. I rate it as "Average" since the size and price of the set make it acceptable to have odd things. Confused? Good so am I Making a small set isn't that easy and remeber this set is from 2002 and a lot has happended since then, designwise that is. What do you think?	positive
Whats wrong with another yoda and some nice light blue bricks? I probably would destroy this set, and keep the minifigs intack tough, chrome lightsabers on!	neutral
Thanks for the review KimT! Oldies reviews(old sets ) Are always appreciated. I feel this set isn't that great. 1- Yoda: He is by far the best part of the set. Although, is his weapon blue? 2-Lord Tyrannus: Pretty nice! I feel the middle part of his torso is a bit bland, but that isn't a problem. I wish they would make a fleshie one too. 3- Speeder bike: I always hated this design. The back looks terrible to me. Way too bulky in my opinion. It jusn't give me the image that it's the same as the movie. The lightsaber is amazing! Why is it only in this set? 4-Yoda-Lifter: What? That is terrible. But at least it has some nicely colored parts.... A fine set, but not the best IMO.	negative
Nice review I realy like this set, two nice minifigs in an affordable set and i do like the speeder but that lift thing is strange, but now at least i know what it is, thanks for letting me know!	positive
Thanks for the nice review KimT . I like this set especially by the fact that it is the only set containing the Dooku minifig and the curved lightsaber , I also think that the minifig is cool but I also own the Dagobah x-wing and the wookiee catamaran sets so I have enought minifigs (A clone wars version would be very cool ) and the extra-thingy is well, just OK. The bad part is that I don?t buy the set when it is out and now is go for $40 on ebay and bricklink . Edited by darkrebellion, 18 August 2008 - 09:51 PM.	neutral
Oky Wan Kenobi, on Aug 18 2008, 02:41 PM, said: Wasn't this the only [Yoda] that was ever released except for the one in the Dagobah/X-Wing set? Sure, he is not the best fig with the unmovable legs and all, but still: It's Yoda! Edit: I'm pretty sure we got a Yoda in the Wookiee Catamaran set from Revenge of the Sith ...runs to check Brickset... yep, there's a Yoda in that set, as well. But the Jedi Duel is the only reasonably priced set with the green Force-guru. Nevermind, looks like a couple of other members already covered Yoda's availability in other sets. Back on topic: Great review, and a real blast from the past. I never did get this set, just didn't care for the speederbike or the weird piece of equipment. Thanks for explaining that it's supposed to be used to "force-jump & spin" Yoda all over the place. I never knew that's what it was for. Anyway, wish I had known Yoda and Dooku were going to be impossible to get later; I may've picked this set up just for the minifigs. Edited by bamaker, 18 August 2008 - 10:39 PM.	neutral
I missed out on this set but it looks pretty good IMO. Thanks for clearing up what that thing was I thought it was something they flung at eachother in the movie I like the lightsaber also but why did they stop making chrome ones	neutral

I was very lucky to get this set and I love it, I dont have it built cause i bought it for parts but it was fun while it lasted. .	positive
I got this set a long time ago. The review pretty much says all there is to say about it. (Never knew what the red/brown thing was anyway, I used it as a canon.) Isn't this also the only set up until now that had Count Dooku in it?	neutral
Thanks for the review. It's always good to have a 2nd opinion on a set. I've added the usual poll and I'll index it tomorrow (must sleep). Super pics and great to have "in-build" pics A fine set which I'll surely buy when I find it.	positive
Very nice review. One thing you have to consider: when lego sees pics of the star wars universe, they have to decide which would be the easiest set to make with the most playibility. Therefore, they chose the HMP. Quote Thanks for the review. It's always good to have a 2nd opinion on a set. I've added the usual poll and I'll index it tomorrow (must sleep).

Excellent review Metalandi! I really think this looks like a fun set. I esp. love the mountain, bridge, and baseplate. It has adventure fun written all over it. Thanks for taking the time to review this set. I've always seen it in pictures, but never close-up.	positive
Thank you for that very interesting review, metalandi. A cool set with a lot of features and some nifty vehicles, very playable and well designed indeed. Perhaps a bit too colorful for my likings, but pretty impressive in its conception for sure. I wish we could see some more landscaping coming along with todays vehicle sets as well...	positive
Set data 4920: The Rapid Rider Year: 1999 Subtheme: Rock Raiders Pieces: 37 (+1 extra - TrNeonGreen Plate 1 x 1 Round) Price: Euro 3,50, used, not including S/H, on eBay Building time: less than 10 minutes. More info: Bricklink - Peeron. I could have owned the 4910 Hover scout (see Metalandi's review here), but while I was buying some used sets, I forgot to buy that one too! So, here's my only RR set, the second smallest one (if we don't count Japanese promos; sweets are surely sweeter if they come with a Lego set!) Pieces: Face and torso closeup; I like the torso, the face is good except for the bandanna. Building is based on two big pieces: Landing Skids and Plate 6 x 6 x 2/3 Cross with Dome. Let's go! Building is over: Review: Pros: Small set (= cheap), 1 fig, two accessories, some interesting pieces like the rock and the Crystal. No stickers but 3 printed pieces! Good color choice. Cons: Tipper Bucket is fixed, no hinge. No levers or steering wheel, it probably moves by using the buttons on the 2x2 tile. It deserves a 4/5.	neutral
This was the first Rock raiders set I got. I really like it, and I think I got all of them except the huge cargo airlift thing. I remember these sets coming out and getting the big base for Christmas, though they are all destroyed now... sadly... . Nice Review.	positive
When I first saw this review title, I thought it said "Rapid River Review" thinking it was an Indian set (6766). Nice review though. I never got into Rock Raiders. I would have loved the large drill bit piece for set #s 4970 and 4940. This set looks like a little boulder hawler, and a nice set to introduce someone unfamilar with the theme. I esp. like the fig and the little 2x2 drill bit tile. The overall set looks like it has some very useful mining-type pieces. Nice review and thanks for sharing.	neutral
Rock Raiders was the shit back in the day. Awesome theme! I had this set as well as the Tunnel Transporter, which was amazing.	positive
Thanks for the review! Rock Raiders was one of the last new themes i knew as a kid before my dark ages came. Unfortunately i never managed to get any sets from it, beside a few months ago the 4910 The Hover Scout, which i review a while ago. Wish i can get some of the bigger sets in the future.	neutral
Easily one of the best town sets ever (and pretty expensive for its size too, is/was it that rare?). I hope I still have all the pieces from mine, unfortunately, my stickers are in pretty bad shape (took them off because I needed the bricks, stupid stickers covering multiple parts , only downside to this set). The design is simple, yet so detailed, and the pizza van looks great. 5/5	positive
I do like the set, although I don't own it. I do remember lusting after it when I was a kid, though (mainly because of the female minifig and the colors). It's a bit simplistic, but comes with a few great parts. You also did a great job on describing the set, and the pictures give the full impression of the appearance. For the review, I just have to point out a few things, to give you constructive criticism: first of all, it's chef, not "chief" (entirely different professions), and secondly, the scale you give in the poll isn't very even. "Above average" jumps to "outstanding", which is a too big of a gap in my opinion. You should've used "Good" or "Great" in between them. But these are only minor faults, this is a good review anyway!	neutral
I rate it a full 5 too. And I wish Lego would make a set like this in 2010. A town needs pizza! Edit: don't always trust Peeron. Sometimes they miss some pieces, and sometimes they just can't count them! Edited by The Cobra, 24 August 2008 - 11:41 AM.	positive

got this one as well, not much surprises in such a small set, but the fast-food pizza idea is pretty cool. as far as i know only the small mcdonalds promo and this set are related to food/restaurant thing (until the cafe corner that is) But since i have a classic lego city i can't miss this set.	neutral
This set looks really cool, especially for one this inexpensive. The van is neat, and the hidden storage compartment i back is the icing on the cake. I like the back with hidden oven as well, and the rare sink piece makes it all the better. With five pizzas and three minifigs, it's and excellent set to behold.	positive
Excellent review White Fang! - and a great set to commemorate the establishment of Classic Town.net. I almost ordered this set back when it was re-released by Lego, but passed on it. I'm so mad at myself! This has all the terrific qualities that Classic Town sets exemplify. I love the delivery truck and the pizza oven. A great review from one of the "Master EB Reviewers" - outstanding!	positive
Excellent job, and one of the best sets in history, if you ask me! 5/5 all the way. This is what we need more of. WhiteFang, on Aug 24 2008, 05:22 AM, said: Devoted "PIZZERIA" staff On the left, we will have the Pizza Boy, whom is wearing the regular blue dungarees and its white cap. I wonder who is that boy? On the middle, we will have the Pizza Girl. She looks like any typical sweet girl in town that the boys will look at. She is wearing a suntop strapless on her. She reminded me of one person though, I think her name is called Alice. Taking a careful look, I wonder if ImperialShadows is the Pizza Boy back then, without that black patch on its left eye? On another note, this mini-figure was my favourite. Female mini-figures are very uncommon back then. I am glad I have this figure, adding to my town population. Hmmm... He does look a little familiar, and I definitely recognise the lovely Alice. Now stop staring at her.

nice review,3 or 4 years ago my Dad picked up two large boxes full of classic era legos (classic town,some pirate,and alittle episode 1 star wars etc)i couldn't find the building in this set but i had the little van from this set.Its very sturdy, i should know my idiot friend dropped this from my second floor window and it styed togethersure the pizzas fell out and they probably got cold thanks for the review!	neutral
I got the original version as a surprise one Christmas. My parents liked the design so much they got it for me. This is one of the best town sets. If it didn't have the delivery van it would have been on par with 6683 Hamburger Stand, a great set in its own right. The van, and they way the back holds the pizzas, is ingenious and bumps this set up to the highest levels.	positive
This set is great and so is this review! I really like seeing reviews of classic sets like this and hope to see more in the future. The chef in this set is the base for my Sigfig in fact! The classic sets have a totally different feel to them than the newer sets. They look more human. Great review!	positive
I used to want this set so badly and I almost got it when it was rereleased. I still wonder why I didn't because with a building, van, 5 pizzas, and a then very rare female fig. this set would have been perfect for someone with a smaller collection like I had then. What surprised me the most is how well this set still holds up to others today. Off to bricklink!	positive

Too bad I had it displayed all these years on my windowsill so the pizza delivery van and pizzeria have become yellowed. Is it possible to restore it by getting those bricks or parts again? Yellowed bricks is really very saddening. It reminds me of my Breezeway Cafe. Those were the days where we are too young to know how to take good care of our toys.

INDEXED Allright, hi everybody again! Today, i'm gonna review the biggest set of the RES-Q Subtheme, 6479 Emergency Response Center. With this one i think, the reviews of all the RES-Q sets are complete now, and while i'm in a reviewing mode right now i thought i'd bring that up. This set hast got many nice aspects and also some very rare pieces, and comes with a wonderful amount of vehicles, including a speedboat, a tow truck, a helicopter, and a trike which can pull a little boat. So sit down, get your popcorn and beer, we're off to stormy weather at the coast! Sub-Theme: RES-Q Set Nr.: 6479 Name: Emergency Response Center Number of minifigs: 5 Number of pieces: 420 Release Year: 1998 Unfortunately i don't have many of the boxes of my res-q sets anymore, so i'll start right off with the instructions this time: On the backside there is no alternate model as usual this time, but only a different shot of the whole set: Next, a general overview, sorry about the slightly bad picture quality on some pics this time: Originally this set has 5 minfigs (which all are really nice!), but the guy who drives the tow truck has been lost in the flood Here's a picture of the missing fig: Let's move on to the vehicles, we have something for the water, the ground and the air in this set, first the great tow truck: I love the mechanism with the hooks in the back: Next on, da Speedboat! At the rear, it's got a stretcher and a wench, which adds a lot of playability: If there's a a little accident near the coast, the trike comes to appearance: For more complicated stuff, we have a little helicopter (i broke the rotating piece at the top yesterday, ouch! : ) No space for a victim you say? Well, not really, but the helicopter also got a wench with a hook in the back: Now it comes to the station itself, at the docks a neat life belt sign is mounted (remember, at this time there weren't real ones as today): A little more right an equipment holder is placed, with various tools on the front... ...and fire fighter equip at the back: At the very front a little lighttower secures the shelter: I haven't quite found out what this thing is supposed to be, maybe somebody knows Another equipment holder, this time with all the stuff you need for diving: More equipment... ...and even MORE! We come to the hear piece of the station, the control room with lots of buttons and scrrens: Last but not least, a quick shot of all the accesoires and tools that you get, which really is an A-MA-ZING amount! This set might have a few junioriced pieces, as the big window in the front or the "briedge" on the roof, but that doesn't matter, because there is nearly one other set in which you get so much rare pieces and such an overwhelming amount of accesoires, so i can recommend that for everybody who is a pieces-fanatic. Not to forget the playability, the great figs and the, in my opinion very good color scheme. Once again thanks for taking the time reading and looking at my review, i hope you liked it.

I own this set and it's one of my favourites, simply because of the cool colour scheme which you mention, plus all the vehicles and accessories. The Res-Q theme is one of my faves of all time actually, I own nearly all of them (missing a small set that was only available in the US or Japan, I think). Dr. S.	positive
Do you mean this one http://www.brickset....aspx?Set=2962-1 ? I would also like to get that, alone for the fact that it's the only Res-Q set with a female fig	neutral
I have this set and it's pretty nice. I love the Res-Q theme in general. I think that tow truck is easily the highlight of this set and is probably the best such vehicle I've seen in any City set. The other vehicles are also great. The base itself is lacking though, as it basically consists of one room that doesn't even have side walls. It does include a cool 3x6 computer sticker and a vast array of minifig tools and equipment though. I have some plans to modify the building and make it larger but have never gotten around to doing it.	positive
I just built this set in MLCad as a requestfor a fellow Eurobricks member. Somehow I missed out on this set completely when it came out. I was really suprised how long it took to build (virtually). Despite its size this set is packed with details, minifigs, vehicles and tools. Thanks for all the pictures!

Hi everyone, this is my first review on LEGO sets here. Hope you guys like it. And I would like to apologise for the bad quality pictures. Hope you guys don't mind. First I will start with the box art. Box art: I guess this is the first time that LEGO Star Wars sets use white and blue colour for their box. I like the new colour scheme, a nice blend though. Here's the front: The back: Not to waste space on the box LEGO do some advertisement to attract us to buy more sets. :grin:the more The side: At the top side there is this minifigs scale picture. It is great as we get to know the real size of a minifigs. Contents: The contents consist of a sticker sheet, instruction book, and 8 packet of bricks. The packer are not numbered. But it is ok as there is not much pieces. Instruction book and random page: As usual the instruction book have brick checklist, other sets pictures, and tutorial on how you should assemble your set (I mean the very first page). Sticker sheet: There is not much sticker sheet and is a great news that the Republic logo on the round plate is printed unlike Republic Gunship. Anyway, I didn't apply the stickers. The Commander Gear: This is a new thing to minifigs as well. Well is like Batman accessories, they pack it in one small packet. However, you only get one commander gear pack in this set. Anyway, i didn't use them. The minifigs: Well, we get the the new minifigs. The ugly face clone, new printed torso and new mold of helmet. However i not really like the new head stud, i prefer a black one or at least the one like Jango Fett, black colour with face. The helmet: Everything is printed, no holes at the visor there, but there are hole on the both side. This new helmet mold also made the headgear turn 360 degree freely. Without helmet: With helmet: You can see the flesh tone at the hole beside. The blasters: @ short blasters were given instead of long one. Is great, at least they give us two blasters instead of one. The tank: Here is the pics of the tank. It was not badly design nor nicely design. But it looks great if you didn't saw the beneath or under the tank. View from front: View from side: View from back: What's beneath? Under it was 4 wheels, to make it move fluently. It is made by the thread supporter like the one we fet from TIE Crawler or Bat-Tank The functions: Well firstly, you can open up the hood (I guess) to see the engine. Secondly the side cannon that can move upwards. The thing is quite tight (see random instruction page) and there is barrier to block the cannon from going downwards. The cockpit: Well the cockpit is small and the space is limited. The monitor stuff is printed brick and is another great news. You have to remove the piece (pic below) to reveal the cockpit and put your clone to pilot it. Pop-up gunner mechanism: Well the backdoor have a thing to attack to the seat of the gunner. The top hatch is very loose. So it there is a clone as a gunner and you open the back door, the clone will pop-up and automatically open the hatch on top. This is how the top looks like without a clone. There is this movable cannon (upwards, left and right) and a little keyboard thing with it. But the cannon fall off quite easily. The flick launching missile mechanism: The mechanism is on both side and you need to turn the thing inwards to reveal the flick fire mechanism. Below are the pic of how it is turned. You can keep you blaster at the front of the side. There are place for you to store them. It close nicely. Completion: This is how it looks like. Extra parts: There quite a number of them. Overall: This set is not bad. The price is quite expensive but you will like it. The pop-up mechanism is something new (to me) but this set have more function and 2 Clone Trooper with a pack of Commander gear. Pros: -2x Clone Troopers -high playability -nice design Cons: -a little expensive -sticker sheet -cannon on top falls off quite easy Edited by KimT, 27 August 2008 - 12:16 PM.	positive

Wow, this is one great review! Fantastic pictures, this looks like one cool set with heaps of neat functions.

bad quality pictures? What's wrong with them? This is a great review and thanks! I was planning on buying this set and no others but the price stunned me. Thus I bought the AT-TE and the RGS.... The set is better than I thought though; I might do as Mutley did and make my own!	positive

Splendid photos and well written review! I love it. I've owned and built mine and must say it's a good set and the tank don't disappointment in terms of design and playability. I got mine stickered, well been a perfectionist I am :p Thanks again for the review that it should deserved :D	positive
Baby, I will like to take a moment to said "Outstanding piece of review for your first attempt!" You have done well with the pictures and its flow.

Well, if I have the spare cash, I will defintely get one of this. Keep it up.	positive
Thanks for the really cool review baby . I think this is an awesome first attemp for your first review: It flows well, really good pics and many pics .

What with the expenses-trimming and all, it's apparently one of the many little quirky things they've discovered in the manufacturing and packaging process that people have done for years without thinking (in this case, putting the heads on the torsos) but that turns out to be a surprisingly significant expense (timewise, I suppose). Think it was in one of his blog posts, but not sure. Too tired (ie, lazy) to go hunting for it now, sorry >-|	neutral
But does this mean that they add to the piece count? Is it a super secret clever way to make the piece count seem bigger than it is? HMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM |:| Addition I've built it, review up later tonite but here's this to wet your appetite.	negative
It's a shame it only comes with two figs. It would be great for my ancient Middle-East project.	negative
Thanks for the pics so far. Will you have high-res pics of the other sets in the instructions?	positive
MattZitron, you have done well to display images of the Dung Stain hull... Its a darn shame that it can't be extended. However, I see no reason why LEGO couldn't produce a special middle hull piece that is compatible. Although the way they've made the hull is a bit stupid. The old system was a lot more flexible. Better still why can't LEGO design a hull that can be extended in length and width... Then they could be as made as long or wide as desired and that would be great!	negative
Good work Samsta! No wonder I wasn't aware. 4+ Pirates and all...	positive

WooHoo!!! Thanks for these pics. I'm probably more excited about the dark red 1x4 arch than anything else. I have a large project that I'm doing in dark red, but there has only been the 1x6 arch made in that color....until now! Now to figure out how to score about a hundred of them :/ -Jeramy	positive
Right so here's my review (FINALLY). The whole Gallery of box, parts, minifigs and finished model is here, over 2 pages. So on with the Show. Minifigs http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=1340864 In the set you get Krakaroff (I dunno how to spell it) and Victor Krum. The figs are exactly the same, bar their heads. These are two fantastic figures, the expression on Krakaroff's face is priceless. Judging by the design I think we might get a Yellow Krakaroff cropping up somewhere, which would make me a happy bunny (he'd make a fantastic Viking) Ideally I'd have liked more than 2 figures for my money, three would have done it, I think 2 is too few. Piece Count http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=1344573 http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=1344571 http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=1344572 For a ?40 set, the piece count is quiet good, I don't know the exact number but when building it, I didn't feel short changed, bar the exception of the hull. Now I don't HATE the hull, my problem is that is doesn't connect with bricks like the old Pirate ships. There are pros and cons to this, on the plus side its more secure, and your whole ship doesn't need to be taken up with support structure. The negative side being, you can't really make it bigger (as they've only released a megablocking 4+ set with the right piece, and its the wrong color). I also like how its wide, meaning you can fit LOADS of minifigs on the main deck. Overall though I liked the pieces. Of note are gold studs (http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=1344510) (5 in total, you get one spare), the return of the black falcon shields (http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=1340835) and the new Drumstrang Shields. The Construction A simple fun build. Nothing too fiddly. The Finished Model http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=1344474 (Big Picture) I really like this set. There's no bones about it. It seems Lego with the latter half of 2005 have given people who loved their original pirate ships hope for the future with this and the fantastic Viking Longboat. Even with the two 4+ pieces (the hull, and front of the ship) I wasn't put off. http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=1340841 http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=1344461 The front of the ship is a nice piece, and can be used for stuff like castles. http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=1344490 http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=1344491 http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=1344492 http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=1344494 And the hull isn't all bad. What I REALLY liked was the little cargo hold, at the moment I have a treasure chest in there, but there' space for about eight of them I reckon. Playability wise it does make alot of sense, and as you can see you can imprision minifigs below deck. http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=1344484 http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=1344488 http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=1344506 http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=1344500 The quarters are great as well. You can comfortably fit about six minifigs in the main gally, three by the steering wheel, and a couple up above the top cabin. You could fit more, but it'd look strange. My only gripe is the design of the top cabin. When you want to open it up, you have to remove the mast. I know its simple enough, but I think that it wouldn't have taken much for TLC to design it better. But saying that its easily done, and I like how the cabin can be lifted with ease from the steering deck. http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=1344540 The final play feature is the plank. You can while away the hours murdering hapless minifigs who've displeased the cabin. A really nice addition for pirate fans. The Final Verdict[/b Playability: 9.5/10 - Lots to do for all the kids. Piece Count: 9/10- A great selection, loses one for the hull. Figures: 8/10 - Just needs one more! Construction: 9/10 - Nice and simple. Value: 8.5/10 - Let down a bit by lack of minifigs, and the cons of the hull. [b]Overall: 8.8/10 Overall this is a set worth getting, especially if you miss proper pirates. It wouldn't take much to turn this into an AMAZING pirate ship MOC. Hope you liked my review. Matt	positive
[burns]Excellent...[/burns] I love those parts shots, great stuff in there! This really is a good sign for the new line, hopefully there'll be the same level of usefulness in the others. Thanks for taking the time to finish it up! Did you scan the back of the instructions?	positive
I received this set with a $25 gift card, so It was a great buy. It follow with a similar build to the 2007 trucks, but has a few improvements. Of course, the name of the set could have been a bit more creative... And yes, this was an academy review. Set name: Truck and Forklift Number: 7733 Pieces: 343 Theme: City Year Released: 2008 Price: $25.00 USD, ?19.99 GBP, 24.00 Euro 1/Box Now the box follows a design similar to most other City sets. It has the set information and photo of the set on the front, (sorry for it getting cut off, I will remake it). Now the back of the box shows what each bag builds. Bag 1 is for the forklift, bag 2 is for the cab, and bags 3 and 4 are for the containers. It also has the set's features. 2/Contents The instructions: There are 2 books included with the set: One for the forklift, and one for the truck. Minifigure(1) The first minifig you build is a simple cargo worker. Interesting/new parts: Here we have some interesting and new parts. They include a yellow seat, a 1x2 plate with clips, and a 1x4 slope. 3/The build Cargo1 The first cargo palette has a few crates on it. I really like the sticker on the small box. Forklift: The forklift is a very fun extra to build, and it is probably the best forklift that we have had so far. It is very realistic and is very strong. Cargo2 The next piece of cargo is some Octan barrels on a meter. I am not sure what It is supposed to be, but it is still a nice addition to the set. Minifgure(2) The second minifigure is a classic driver with sunglasses and a coffee mug. Very nice. New piece! This is a very nice new piece that is included in the set, a hollow canopy. I believe it is also in White with the police mobile command station. Truck: Now anyone who has had one of the Lego City Harbor sets from last year, then you will probably find this build to be very similar. Mostly in the cab part of the truck. The trucks build is very solid, and very realistic. I sense ths will bring the ratings up quite a bit. Mystery Cargo: For some time specualtion has been going around, what exactly is this? It seems like nuero poison.. I am very happy with those 2x2 cylinders in trans-yellow. In fact, you can join in and guess what it may be in this topic. Containers: The first container is built to hold one palette. It fits onto the truck. It produces a very pleasing result, and has a better look to it than the Containers from last year had. The second container has the ability to hold two palettes, and has a design similar to the first. Then, you build on the wheels. The back ones have beautiful mudflaps! Finshed set: ---------------------------------- Parts: 10/10 (lots of useful pieces, great colors, and some very cool new pieces.) Minifigs: 8/10 (I would have liked another but it was $25, so I guess its okay.) Price per part: 10/10 (almost 350 pieces for $25. ) Playability: 8/10 (Forklifts are always fun, and there are lots of things to do with this set.) Overall: 36/40 90% A- This is truley an outstanding set, and It will make a great addition to anyones collection. Mocers would aslo like this, due to the fact that it has some really nice parts. It has a great build, and utilizes some awesome new techniques. It also has details, something you might look for in a set. Highly Recommended. Hope everyone enjoyed the review! If you have any pic requests, questions, etc., please ask! I look forward to hearing your comments, and the judges comments as well. 7733 Peeron.com 7733 Bricklink Catalog 7733 Shop At Home	positive

A very fine set indeed and something at least a little different to the more usual City sets. Sweet! And it could even be a little sweeter to me with car doors... well, nevermind. Thanks for that very nice review, ~VBBN~!	positive

That explains why it isn't in our local stores. I also got it from S@H, but my box hasn't got the "special edition printing" on it, surprisingly.	neutral
Nice review, VBBN! I stumbled upon your yellow seat as well. Didn´t you have one already or what made you think it´s new? The big letdown on this set is the big canopy. I would have preferred single bricks for that. And for this truck there is no real need for a hollow canopy - it could as well have been made of solid bricks. Maybe we get another set with different use of the canopy. This is one of the reasons I didn´t buy it so far. And I´m especially NOT interested in another forklift, I have plenty of those... I agree it´s the best one we have seen so far though.	positive
Today I shall be reviewing 8290 Mini Forklift, which I recieved when I went to TRU to get a technic set. So Enjoy! Set Name: Mini Forklift Number: 8290 Theme: Technic Parts: 89 Price: $10.99 1/Box The box for this set is suprisingly small. It's about the size of a $3.99 set. It shows the Main Forklift, and the set information. The back of the box features the Dragster. A very cool model, and the suspension works perfectly. 2/Contents We have two instruction booklets; One for the Forklift and one for the Dragster. The bags: Here are a few interesting pieces: The long double pin in blue, a bionicle connecter joint, and a yellow L joint. 3/Build We start off build nice and solid, with your average technic build: The following steps build up the detail of the bottom part. Next comes the cab. It's pretty simple yet effective. After that comes the Forks. They work very well, but If you have the palatte on them, and you let go, it might topple off. Hint: Put the edge of the palatte on the small lip on the pieces that connect to the forks. This will hold it on better. The finished Product and palatte: Extra Pieces(keep them, as they are used to build the alternate model): Here is something that I found- how to put a minifigure into the cab. First, remove the side doors. Then, set the fig into the cab, with his arm sticking slightly out the gap. And finaly, seal off the cab. A nice way to put system into technic for your towns. ---------------------------- Parts: 9/10(Loving them all.) Price per part ratio: 8/10(Somewhat Pleaseing) Playability: 9/10: Works in any system town, and has a great dragster alternate model. Overall: 26/30 86% B+ Overall I would definatly recommend this set to anyone, whether you are a system or technic fan, this is perfect. It has great parts, and is pretty cheap. The alternate model is also very good. I hope you all enjoyed my Review! I have made the pictures the requested size on my camera. I look forward to hearing your comments.

Nice work VBBN I'm not really into technic myself, but you've definately done a fine review on this set Funny that it actually fits a minifig. Perhaps we'll see fans design forklifts with technic and having it minifig sized	positive
That´s really a sweet and charming little Technic set, thanks for that fine review!	positive

What that? Looks like a walker! An Imperial Walker? No?€?.. Theme: Space, Blacktron I Set Name: Alienator Set Number: 6876 Number of Pieces: 82 Figures:1 Released: 1988 List Price: £?.99 (It seem no source online has the price) Peeron.com Bricklink.com As always lets have a look at the box first as I?€™m luck to own a boxed version of this set. Walking across a planet with a grid pattern sky! The back shows a great selection of alternative models. After opening the box we find a single instruction booklet Inside the instruction booklet Now we come to the man in the black visor the Mark I Blacktron and black and industrial he look. In my opinion I think he probably has the second best Lego Space torso. Before the focus group decided they needed to be brighter Now turning to the walker itself, it?€™s a simple build which I don?€™t think even I with my great skills for messing up could get wrong. The final unit is built in three key parts. The command pod which is attached to the body by two pins at the back. The walker legs, this is pure design genius. Simply built easy to replicate and no fancy parts. The top section which open to reveal the Blacktrons high-tech tools. Time to put the entire set together, I think you?€™ll agree it looks great for such a simple build. Looking like you could take on the universe. A side view of the finished product. A frontal view of the Alienator What the hell! How did that take down an AT-AT. This is one of my all time favourite Lego Space sets. Actually I didn?€™t have it pre-dark age and only recently bought one. What attracted me to it was an old boxed set, but since then I?€™ve discovered a set that I wished I?€™d owned long ago. The Rating System Figures: 8/10 (I love the dark industrial space look) Parts 7/10 (Yes it may be nearly all black with some yellow highlights, but is have a good range and they fit to make several great models.) Fun Fun Fun 8/10 (It walks well and it?€™s a great set, it has a large number of possible mods.) Design 10/10 (It?€™s ingenious the walking mechanism is so simple and yet so good I can?€™t fault it Price ?/10 (While I could tell you how much I paid I was luck on ebay so this remains a question mark) Grand Total 33/40 (Reduced top level due to lack of price knowledge) Conclusion. A set which in my opinion showcases what Lego was about in the 1980?€™s. The set has an excellent design ethic and looks great, with very limited parts it retains great action and functionality. Twinned with the great main model you?€™re shown that there are a number of other great models you can make with the same parts. This set is what it?€™s all about for me, I?€™m very glad I bought outside my normal theme when I saw this. Actually on the strength of this set I recently order 6894 Blacktron Invader and can?€™t wait to get it and see if it lives up to the Alienator.	neutral

csiquet, on Aug 28 2008, 05:27 PM, said: I've built the Y-Wing and the Imperial Landing Craft (7659) more or less at the same time and, for about the same prices, I think the Imperial Landing Craft (ILC) is much superior to the Y-Wing. The Y-Wing doesn’t have much functionality besides an awkward dropping bomb device and a moving cannon. The missiles firing system is … your fingers. The ILC has an awesome missiles firing system (I wish I could get it individually for MOCs), a clever bomb dropping mechanism, 5 minifigures with weapons, the wings fold up together and the “cargo” can be detached as a play set. I’ve built the ILC first so I got quite disappointed with the Y-Wing. You've got to be kidding? The ILC is bulky and doesn't even come close to the design superiority of the Y-Wing. It's smooth, it's beautiful and it's awesomely designed by the designers at LEGO. "It's got greebles, man!"	positive

I think it is a fair to ask questions here with the expectation of a new Y-wing in the coming year. I came here to look at the review even though it is a few years old. No images to go with the review. Bummer. I'd like to see a more friendly tolerance on dated threads being bumped.	neutral
fallenangel309, on 19 September 2011 - 03:43 AM, said: Not a threat at all - I was simply pointing out that yodalikespie made the mistake of inquiring about the new Y-wing before we had any information on it. To my understanding, it's not so much the fact that he bumped the thread as the fact that he bumped it for no good reason. I'm not certain where the Moderators stand on this issue, but I feel that yodalikespie's question would have been better received had he posed it after a substantial amount of information had been gathered on 9495 - as I've said, there simply isn't much one can go off of at this point to determine its value relative to 7658. Roger that. Sad that the original review pics aren't available any longer. Would be nice once the new set is released for comparisons.	neutral

Finaly we get a new Mech for takeshi. And yes, it's yellow. It brings back some flashbacks of Supernova. Good times. Anyways, I recieved this set at christmas last year, with 3 other EF sets. Set name: Assault Tiger Number: 8113 Pieces: 163 Theme: Exo-force Year Released: 2008 Price: 15.00 USD, 18.95 EUR 1/Box The boxes this year are much different than those from previous years. It has some gaps in it, and has a cardboard backround inside of it. The box itself shows Assault tiger and the set information. The back shows a combiner. The cardboard backdrop: A very nice jungle look to it. It has lots of fog as well, creating a pale effect. 2/Contents The instructions: The instructions are clear, and straight-forward. Also included is a lego "blooper." The remains of the sticker sheet: The stickers aren't too bad. I didn't apply the saw sticker as I wanted it to be left plain. The buzzsaw: A VERY cool piece. Mocists will love this. 3/Build The figures: The figures included are Takeshi, who features a nice new torso. Also included is the mini robot. His is a very neat little guy, but sadly, he doesn't really become a weapon. More of a block of red and black bricks. The torso: Now the torso design for Assault tiger is very different from the past years. It now uses a castle-like piece as the main structure. Also of note is that he has a mini throne. No controls, sadly. And with the orange cockpit piece, it's impossible to see takeshi when looking at the AT close on. See the third pic. The legs: The legs are slightly similar to the MT-201 Ultra drill walker's, but have been modified to fit the AT. They are quite large, and suit their purpose. The arms: The arms follow a new design, but the only problem is, they have no elbow or hand articulation. Nice weapons though. The finished product: ----------------------- Parts: 10/10 (lots of useful pieces, great colors, and some very cool new pieces.) Minifigs: 8/10 (A robot would have been nice, and a better weapon mode for the mini-robot would have been good.) Price per part: 7/10 (A stretch...) Playability: 8/10 (The lack of elbow and wrist articulation isn't the greatest. Overall: 33/40 82.5% B- Assault tiger is a nice set, but some of those small little things can truly take a toll on the final rating. I think that I would only recommend this set to anyone who wants the yellow, and hardcore Exo-force fans.

Thanks for that good review, ~VBBN~. That´s really a fine and pretty solid looking mecha. I think that the designers did a good job on this last wave of EF sets, and the inclusion of these mini robots was also a pretty smart idea!	positive
This was my first Exo Force set and I was quite skeptical towards the mecha theme, so I got it because it seemed to have nice parts. It turned out however that the mechas are quite nice :) I really like the poseability of it and since then I got another EF set.	positive

What do you mean the troll’s should outnumber the Crown Knight? How are you going to manage that? Well here’s the answer. Theme: Castle Set Name: Troll Warrior Set Number: 5618 Number of Pieces: 19 Figures:1 Released: 2008 List Price: £2.50 (GBP) $3.50 (USD) 2.99 (EURO) 5618 Peeron.com 5618 Bricklink Catalog 5618 Shop At Home Lets us begin with the box. The troll warrior and his might cart. Set sets for children to pester for at Christmas. Now for what’s inside. The contents of the box, it doesn’t look like much. Now for the troll himself, I’m glad they selected this troll torso rather than the other one for the impulse set I think this one is the superior one. Also he comes well armed with a spear and sword but no shield sadly. Someone really needs to look at the rodent problem in the Castle sets.. Now the cart, nice easy construction as with all impulse sets, I’m still not convinced by the flicking missiles. A line of those would do some damage. What an oncoming army can expect to see.. All together now and it looks rather good. So there we have it a cheap way of bolstering the troll army and outfitting them with some more weapons. Also for anyone planning a Pied Piper MOC another set with a rat in it. The Rating System Figures: 8/10 (|Preferred troll torso and helmet style. ) Parts 7/10 (Two spears and a sword but sadly lacking that all important shield.) Fun Fun Fun 4/10 (Somewhat more to do on it’s own that other impulse at least the troll can fight the rat!) Design 7/10 (Well designed even the flicker missile doesn’t look bad) Price 8/10 (At £2.50 more than the other castle impulse.) Grand Total 34/50 (Lack of a shield and to small to stand alone for my rating system..) Conclusion. Castle fans got a great army builder with The Knight and they’ve been lucky enough to receive another one with this set. I’m glad we’ve got a troll impulse as it allow for enlarging the armies of evil some the Crown Knight don’t totally outnumber all their opponents.	positive

The rodent problem is funny but I lov always getting more animals, so that is a plus. The cart is a nicely formidable machine that I will keep together so I can maximise their fire power. The troll figure is one of my favourite ever too, I love that torso and helmet, and I want that sword in grey, I only have it in bronze. Thanks for the review! Batbrick Away!	positive
Thanks for the interview, i nearly forgot this set is out yet. Maybe i'll grab one off my local store tomorrow.	neutral

Nice review! I never new trolls had fireworks, at least that's what it looks like to me. Maybe I shall build a trollish fireworks company! Fireworks on!	positive
Thank you for the nice review. The set is not that bad, but a shield would be a nice addition. I also don't like the flickfire missile. A camp site with a fire and a chickenleg would also be nice about the rat; Isn't it just foodsupply for the troll? The only problem would than be that the food is running away.	negative
More firefighter, there must be a pyromaniac in Legoland somewhere! Theme: City Set Name: Firefighter Set Number: 5613 Number of Pieces: 25 Figures:1 Released: 2008 List Price: £2.00 (GBP) $3.50 (USD) 2.99 (EURO) 5613 Peeron.com 5613 Bricklink Catalog 5613 Shop At Home Starting as always with the box I didn’t know red cylinders were flammable. Interestingly an action shot and not other sets you might like to buy. The contents of the box. Looks much like every other impulse set. Firefighter, not sure there’s much else to say apart from I wish they’d included breathing equipment. Looking pretty pleased with himself if you ask me. The equipment rack is fairly standard and easy to build, it does however include a fire hydrant. Inbuild shot, will I be able to finish this complex build.[/. Unsurprisingly I did. I nice selection of kit is provided. All together, I think the fire is a bit odd but it does add playability. If you want to increase the number of your firefighter and their equipment this is a great way, though there is something missing in my mind. The Rating System Figures: 5/10 (Fairly standard I already have a fair few) Parts 6/10 (Good selection of tools, but lacks the breathing apparatus I’d expect in a set like this) Fun Fun Fun 5/10 (There’s clearly something to do even if you just own this set.) Design 5/10 (Not going to win any awards but it’s robust) Price 8/10 (Nothing to complain about, you get a lot of accessories for the price.) Grand Total 29/50 (Reasonable design and good accessories a good set to improve any fire department.) Conclusion. This isn’t a set I’d necessarily buy, but while I was at Bluewater today I decided I should try to review every impulse set myself, so that why I bought it. Still I think it has some good playability and a good set of accessories if you need more firefighting kit, I just can’t get passed the lack of breaking apparatus, that would have made it a better set in my view.	negative
That’s the problem I couldn’t quite tell what, it’s a bit of a problem in a reviewer. Maybe a hose to clip to the fire hydrant I don’t know.	neutral
Brick built robot, surely we?€™re getting near classic space now? Theme: Space, Mission Mars Set Name: Mini-Robot Set Number: 5616 Number of Pieces: 24 Figures:1 Released: 2008 List Price: £2.50 (GBP) $3.50 (USD) 2.99 (EURO) 5616 Peeron.com 5616 Bricklink Catalog 5616 Shop At Home Let look at the box first. Space man approaching the robot from behind. I?€™m not sure you can still buy the base easily anymore. The contents of the box. The contents of the box, it?€™s rather white. Fairly standard Mission Mars spaceman, he?€™s got printing front and back but sadly no air tank! How does he breath? *As has been pointed out he does have a printed tank but I'd rather a physical one* Note the megaphone is in flashlight mode not weapon mode, that?€™s important.. The robot itself feels a bit clumsy the metal detector is never going to touch the ground and it feel a bit wide. I don?€™t like the look of him something in the eyes. The reason why so we can have a box to put crystals in. Both together and ready to explore new worlds etc. Sadly the robot was homicidal, remember in space no one can hear you scream. It?€™s not a bad impulse set and if it marks the return of brick built robots to Space then it?€™s a good thing. I just feel the robot could have been better built. The Rating System Figures: 6/10 (Not to bad but nothing wonderful) Parts 6/10 (Lots of white and not much orange, but where?€™s the air tank!) Fun Fun Fun 6/10 (Probably the best impulse set as a stand alon toy lots to do with a robot and his human boss) Design 5/10 (The robot feels clumsily put together I think it needs work) Price 8/10 (Can?€™t fault the impulse price.) Grand Total 31/50 (Not well designed but does have more play value than other impulse sets.) Conclusion. I was surprised that Mission Mars got impulse sets as it didn?€™t seem to sell as well as other lines last year. However I think this is a fairly good set, it has more playability than other sets and does come with a metal detector been a while since I?€™ve seen one (though I could be wrong) sadly the robot isn?€™t as good as it could be.

I wasn't all that impressed with what you get in this set for the price. But you have an interesting point; that the robot can be considered a reference to the Classic Space bots. Makes me think I ought to try modding the robot later...	negative
Nice review and quite funny Now I'll never turn my back on a robot again. Poor set. I find this set bad, even for an impulse,. The robot is poorly designed and without any use. The space minifig is ok. I'd rather get another impulse set than this. Except the other Life On Mars Mars Mission impulse sets.	negative

This here was a set that I new I had to get. A beautiful minfig, amazing minfigs, what more could you want? So was this set worth it? I guess you will just have to read the review to find out! Set name: The Batcycle: Harley Quinn's Hammer Truck Number: 7886 Pieces: 267 Theme: Batman Year: 2008 Price: 35.00 USD, 44.96 EURO 1/Box The new box art for batman is pretty stunning. It's clean, and really sells the set. For this set, Harley Quinn's truck is pictured attacking Batman, with the set information. The back of the box shows a nice little comic, the other sets, as well as the set functions. 2/Contents The instructions: The instructions for the set are, as always, clear and straightforward. They display the colors well, and have what we expect in an instruction book. 3/Build Minifigs: The stars of the set! Batman is back with a new torso, much more metalic than before. Harley had all new printed torso, legs, a new head, and that sweet new hat. Batcycle: The bottom part is very sturdy thanks to a small bit of Technic. The red throws it off a bit, but it isn't seen once the top part is put on. It has a nice use of the smoke stacks, and looks very nice in the end. The top part is simple, but suits the purpose well. It has handle bars, and a nice motor. The blue is a little strange though. Hammer Truck: The hammer truck begins with a very sturdy base. It has lots of detail, and really looks cool. Rims Added: Lego did a very nice job at giving it a checker board appearence. The only problem here is that you stick a sticker over two bricks, multiple times. Jewels: Inside of the crate are these shining jewels. Look how they illuminate the darkness in Gotham... More Added: Then, we add on a spoiler and the crate. Looking very nice now. The detail is again, outstanding, and It has a good amount of smoothness to it. The infamous Hammer! Okay, I haven't said this yet, but the square pieces need to stop. First on those SW backta tanks, now on the hammer? It creates a sloppy look for the hammer. Still, this is the ultimate wacking weapon. Added to the truck: On the truck it works pretty well. But the handle is to short, and it's near impossible to smash Batman. The finished truck: The finished truck is really nice. The big wheels give it the monster truck feel, and the way that Lego alternated the colors works well. The cockpit is a little palin, but that's not a major issue. The "I love Joker" sticker is one of the best stickers I've seen. It's simply a classic. The finished set: ---------------------------- Parts: 9/10 (Lot's of good mocing pieces, and red and black are always usefull.) Minifigs: 10/10 (Awesome!) Playability: 9/10 (the hammer is a little short) Price-per-part: 8/10 (It's a liscensed theme, so meh.) Set 7886 is a very nice set, and has some great details in it. The minifigs are very cool as well. However, their are some flaws. First, the hammer is two short, and is kind of square. The Batcycle has a few awkward colors in it, which throws it off a bit. This set is definatly worth the money. Batman fans will love it. And also wacking fans will like it, for that hammer... And if you would like to buy this set, Here are a few useful links: S@H link Peeron link Please let me know your comments. And pic requests and questions are welcome!	positive

I discovered this review a month ago and since that point in time, I could not get the image of the sparkling golden chest out of my mind. I finally just purchased the chest for myself. I suppose this is a testament to how well honed your picture taking skills are. This set is definitely a nice one. I'm not a LEGO Indy collector, but I was tempted to purchase this set several times. The vehicles are very nicely detailed and have some cool building techniques, such as the wheel guards.	positive

Great Review, I was debating on whether or not to snag this up before its gone, and I think I will, great review and thanks again!	positive
Welcome to another sunny day in Legoville...Today we will be joining the Mailman on his daily route delivering the day's mail. When I first saw this set, I immiediately liked it.I think TLG should make more of these everyday life type sets such as delivering mail, going to the grocery store, things like that. Anyway, enough blabbering, on to the review! 7731 Mail Van Set Name: 7731 Mail Van Year: 2008 Theme: City Pieces: 66 Price: $7.99 pounds 4.99 Euros 5.95 Price Per Piece: About 12 cents We'll start with the box shots. The box is an interesting shape that I have never seen before. Very rectangular. The box art is pretty nice. The back shows the mailman delivering some mail. The picture on the front is the same as on the box. Random manual shot. The manual does not have the piece call outs, but on a small set like this, I don't feel it's needed. Parts list. Decent selection of parts. I really like the mail pieces. Image at the back of the manual showing all of the Cargo sets together in a little scene. I like it when the manuals have images like these because it's nice to see all of the sets together. All of the parts spread out. The parts in this set are pretty good. Unfortunatly the car base is one large piece, however, we do get 2 printed mail pieces which are always nice. Our trusty mailman. This torso I think is very nice. The little envelope is a nice touch. Extra parts. Not much to say here... The finished set! I really like the design of the van. It looks very smooth and somehow looks very LEGO to me. The colors are my favorite part. The red and yellow look nice together A nice mailbox. However I wish the letter on the front was printed. The front of the van is nice I think. The textured brick on the front gives it a different look on the front which is nice. The back of the van. The doors open to store mail, although it doesn't have much room, I like that they included this feature. Delivery! The mail bricks slide right into the hole at the front. This adds nice playability. The van's all loaded up! We are ready to deliver! ======================= Parts: 7/10 (Pretty good piece selection, but for $8, should have included a few more.) Playability:8/10 (It's fun to deliver the mail to all of your town's residents.) Design: 9/10 (The design is very nice, except I feel that some of the stickered parts could have been printed.) Overall: 24/30 After a long, hard day of delivering mail, there's nothing like enjoying a nice pizza and letting your hair out. Why do they make us wear those silly hats anyway... This is a nice set that I can definitely recommend and I think TLG should certainly release a post office to go with this and the Air Mail set. I really like these everyday life sets rather than always fighting crime or putting out fires. Those guys have normal lives too! Brickshelf folder: http://www.brickshel...ry.cgi?f=338718	positive
Good review, thanks! For the mail van, while it certainly adds interaction and fun to a LEGO town, it alone lacks details and playability, and thus not a good set, especailly taking its price into consideration. Its value is pretty much just like, if not less than, some impulse sets, in my opinion...	negative
It's a good set, but I think the first sticker shouldn't say "7731"	positive
LEGOMAN132, on Aug 29 2008, 06:35 AM, said: This set is nice it looks like a DHL van Makes you wonder if there was some kind of promo or hookup in the pipeline that never happened?? I have this set and I really like it. It works well with either the new City sets or with my older 1980s/1990s sets. I actually like the use of the old style car base and mourned the day that these became exitinct the first time round (c1990). Thanks for the review! Cheers Rog	positive
Thanks for that very nice review, Erdbeereis1. It´s great to see some other City sets beside the usual hospital, police and firefighter mayhem, and this is a really nice little one. Now give me some car doors and a Kevin Costner-like MF and I´m a happy camper indeed, TLC...	positive
Nice review. I like this little set. Some how it reminds me now of "Postman Pat" in dutch "Pieter Post", an english childrens tv series about a postman in a little village somewhere in Yorkshire. Aah, sweet memories I would rather have seen a postoffice released (with some women minifigs) instead of the green post bigplane. But maybe in a couple of years.	positive
I do like the set also. I've bought 2 of them. One to build it up and one to keep it MISB (I dunno for how long ). Only poor things is that the wheels are too wide. Car is 5nops wide instead of 4. Afterall a good design. I wonder if there's a post office coming soon. By the way, great review.	positive
What an outstanding review of a great set. I esp. like your intro. I have this set, but have not opened it yet. It looks like a fun little beach set. The new Coast Guard theme is very nice! EDIT: This set could almost pass for Classic Town, except for the use of orange and the lack of opening doors on the car. 5 stars!	positive
I am not a fan of City/Town/Train-stuff. But this is a very good review, that almost makes me wish I had the time (read: money) to purchase some of the coast-guard sets.	positive
Thanks for this review. I was thinking of getting this set and having read your review went out today and got it. What a great little set. What I particularly like: Very sturdy build. Feels very solid as you build the pickup (compared to the Fire pickup & trailer I also have) The orange pieces (my first pieces in this colour!) The tyres which give the smoothest ride of any Lego Town/City vehicle I've ever built The raised suspension and side runners The Coast Guard dude (again a first for me) and his mega-cool flippers and aqualung The jetski controls - The handlebars actually move left to right which is a great detail Little details that Lego didn't have to do (the grey handle by the ball joint; moving handlebars; the new tyres) As you can probably guess, I have voted Outstanding for this set! Erdbeereis1, on Aug 29 2008, 06:02 AM, said: Color separation is not a problem here, and since it is a small set, the piece call out is not a necessity. You do get a piece call out with this set (I did anyway). It's on the back of the small poster that is included in the set!

I meant the piece call outs during the build that show which pieces you need for that step. And Cardinal Brick, I'm not quite sure what you mean, but I cetainly think that this jetski is wonderful.	positive
I agree that this is a very good looking set. I just finished building mine yesterday, and I love it. But here is one suggestion. Trim the large sticker that goes on the roof of the vehicle by cutting along the angles at the front of the sticker. If you use it as it is, it will extend beyond the "flat" surface of the roof and will overlap the lower sections. Past experience with stickers has suggested that this sticker will "lift" at the front corners. Lego stickers are probably the best that there are, but sometimes modifications must be made. Now I want that large Coast Guard helicopter, #7738!!!	positive
Nice set, nice review, I already have one coastguard set (that truck) but I like the idea very much. However, the Rigid Inflatables could be much improved (see the real ones at www.rnli.co.uk or www.knrm.nl)	positive

As I've already said somewhere on this forum, this is the largest Islander set I own and therefore my favourite. Thankyou for your great review. I picked mine up for only 5 pounds along with Crocodile Cage and King Kahuka, but I can't help you with the original price. I would search the web but I'm too tired right now...	positive
What a great review of an excellent set. I love the Islanders and that drum (outstanding!). I think these Islander sets never got the credit they dserved. I really like this set and it's a great addition to the Pirate collection.	positive
I feel the same way about the Islanders sets Brickster. They are a nice change from the regular pirate versus soldiers that is the norm. I think it would be interesting to see some new Islanders sets released in the new pirate line to see how TLC would make them.	neutral
Great review, well done for sure!! I love these reviews of old set, and this one is especially unique. I must agree with you the color scheme is magnificent. Makes me want to go to ebay and buy it now! To bad for Spongebob though, he got in with a real bad crowd...	positive
Excellent review! I want this set now!	positive
Another very nice review, and im glad to see it has some nice pieces as well as characters too. Looks to me that no one on BL has it in Australia for sale so I may pass on this beauty. Though I did pick up King Kahuka recently. He makes an appearance in my Medium entry	neutral
$17 for an old set is good. I may hunt for it on ebay. :)	neutral
Well, for some weird reason I missed this before, so I tell you now: very good review (as we are used of you, Erdbeereis1). I like all the Islander sets, and own quite a few myself! For people that don't own any of the Islander sets yet, the 6262 King Kahuka's Throne is a great way to start! Lots of minifigs and accessories!	positive
Well, this is a not so old set and i bet most of you already have it. So here is another review from me. As usual, let us start off with the box art. Box art: I like the box art. They put a nice background for the AT-AP. At the side we have the minifigs scale and at the back there is the function shown and advertisement for other set. The content: The content is consist of 6 packets of bricks and a instruction book. Yeap, no sticker sheet. Instruction book: The instruction books not only show us the steps but also show us all a clear pictures of the January release sets and some sets show with their function. Well, this includes the AT-AP functions as well. Besides, there are bricks checklist as well and the how do you start off before assemble your sets and a little poster where the clones with their AT-AP battling the Droids. Here's a random page. New pieces (to me): I never see both of this piece before so I assume it is a new pieces. Anyone have any idea is there any other sets that contains this piece? The blasters: We are given a 2 long blasters which is great. Which I it is more accurate as most of the Clone troopers use a long blaster. The minifigs: The minifigs is 2 Shock Trooper but is different with #7655 clone troopers battle packs's Shock Trooper. The leg is different in colour, we are given white hip while the one in the battle pack are given a black hip. Furthermore, we get a new printed headgear, which I think they have improve it, check out the mouth printing, the colour is brighter. So here is the headgear: The headgear limit itself from turning to the side this is because the front part it is too low until it block by the torso. The Shock Troopers: Without helmet on: We are given a black stud, no face printed. How I wish that I have extra. With helmet on: Comparison with Shock Troopers from Battle Pack: The AT-AP: Here's the AT-AP. It looks ugly at a certain angle and looks great in a certain angle. Anyway I still like the set. I like the walker vehicle. Below are the pictures taken randomly: Top view: Side view: Without stabilizer leg: With stabilizer leg: Rear view: The Functions: Well, the functions are not so impressive. Just something turning around, open here and there. The only function that is say as special is the retractable stabilizer leg. The cockpit: The cockpit can fit two Clone Troopers but too bad we are only given two and is not enough as there is no gunner on top. Inside it there is a guns holders, which can hold two guns but fall off easily when you are trying to remove the guns. Well the other side have some speedometre thing and a controller. To reveal the cockpit, you have to open the top hatch. Look below: so you can see what's inside: Oops, the side hatch and back hatch as well: Open and close: I think this pieces is use not to let you open the hatch but to make some design, I mean make it able to move inside. With Clones: Beneath: So this is the pieces that hold the stabilizer leg when is not in use. This is how the stabilizer leg move: At last~ And of course the revealing cockpit from below and at the back. Guess the droids have alternative way to take this things down faster. The leg: There are pieces blocking the leg to go to the front I mean overhead and lose balance. The base in not movable The side armor: The side armor has door and this is how it is attach. It is very flimsy, when you want to adjust it to be a little steep to creat the shape, they might just fall off. So it is connected to the body with just a technic pin. and to hold it properly, here is the support: The side hatch: It open and close easily, very loose, nothing to hold it tight. Here's some view when the side hatch is open. The cannon: The cannon on top is movable and adjustable. The big cannon can move up and down while the smaller one can cove sideways. But the smaller one tend to lose balance when it is without minifigs, means the one on top and below will not b align. This is the pieces that only enable it to move up and down. To prevent it from moving freely, LEGO put two pieces to block it. Completion: I try to make the sets looks great. I think this angle is right. Spare parts: It is so few compare with #7673 Magna Guard Starfighter and it is more expensive. Overall: This set is not really a good set. The hatch is quite flimsy, top and the side since there is nothing to hold them tight. Besides, it is lack of one clone. But to complete your walker collection, you must have it. Pros: -no sticker needed -new improved headgear -long balsters Cons: -lack of clone -flimsy -expensive as few pieces are given] Hope you guys like it.

I don't like the the Shock to have white legs because I am very fussy and I don't mix them. I also expect other Clone to be in this set but it came with 2 Shocks. I buy it because i like the Walker vehicle.	negative
I agree, the pure white legs are odd, as is the inclusion of shocks instead of pilots or regulars. Or maybe even Kashykk troopers; that might have been better.	negative

Technic Rotation Joint Disc set list. It's used in 10 different sets so far, not exactly a new piece A nice review with many good comments. I really like this set. It's one of the walkers with really good design and a lot of playability. It's the usual issue of using too many technic pieces to make a moveable feature versus minifig-scaled design. The same issue concerns for example the AT-AT, The Twilight and the AT-TE (plus more sets). What annoys me in this set is the use of the 2 tan 4x8 plates. They "stick out" and it would have been better if they (the designers) had used dark grey or light grey plates. Also I'll add this to the inventory - now!	positive

Did anyone encounter the problem with the main turret? Apparently, the very tip of the piece (cone shape) can't be put onto the "pole" piece. I check the instructions 2 times and still can't find what i'm doing wrong. Is it just me or did anyone else got this problem as well?	neutral

I seem to recall having a problem with the largest turret as well. I forget how the instructions look though, but the bar not fitting in the cone sounds familiar. I just checked mine and what I did was I took the red bar and stuck it into the round piece with the fins and then attached the cone to the stud on top of the round part. Worked fine for me.

Measures 6" (15cm) tall and 10½" (27cm) wide! Also known as the homing spider droid, this is what I would usually reckon as a mini-fig set if not for the high price point. Since there's a total of 5 mini-figs to be had, and at least 3 of them are going to be high sought after.(Commander Fox™, Clone Trooper™, Battle Droid Commander™). At first glance, it looked like there's only 3 packets. Actually, it's a total of 4 packets, 1 of the packet is inside the biggest packet. It's not a very complex build. Took me around 25min since I was playing around with the mini-figs more than I was building up the spider droid. Though finally, here's the completed build-up. Usually for lego products, what excites me are the vehicles, yet this set is the other way round. Yes, the mini-figs are definitely the crowd-pleaser this time. On with the review. Here's the close-ups of the droids in the following order, Battle Droid Commander™, Battle Droid™, & Super Battle Droid™. There's not much to comment on the droids, except that the battle droids come with the new arm that's able to hold the blaster properly upright. The SBD is the same dude that can be found easily in the previous droid battlepack. And now the good part... Clone troopers. And that's commander fox, and his trooper. I was quite mystified by the amount of accessories given to the clone troopers as per the instruction booklet, as there wasn't any indication of what they were... (commlink, grenades, sensor scope, range finder?!?) Then it hit me... real hard. Notice anything yet? Yup, it's a night scope, and a range finder. That, plus the visor that's available to Fox too. Now, this is really a good time to start troop building for the clone wars. :twisted: Here's the weaponary. Of course, let not forget the main dude... Fore: Port: Aft: Starboard: The SSD looks very similar to the actual screenshots from AOTC, though am still wondering what's that little translucent red piece for... A re-enactment. And a comparison. This set is really either a miss or a hit. For me, it's a hit, due to the mini-fig count, and the wide array of accessories. It's going to probably be a hit depending on the movie that's coming out this month, since we have commander fox here(I heard that C.Fox hasbro figure is a Target Exclusive, meaning it's gonna be another highly sought after). This set is also stated to be a limited edition, and seeing as how it's only available so far in only 1 toys r us in sg, this just might not be available anymore after the movie starts. :D Comments: This review was done immediately after the Launch of the clone wars toys at the midnight launch on 26 July on a local starwars fan forum. And after having caught the movie only yesterday, I now only have this to say, "It's not part of the movie!?!". Oh well, Cmdr. Fox probably will fair better once the TV series starts proper. Then again, that less-than-one-minute cameo of him, I do find it unforgivable. This being the 2nd review available, I sincerely hope you guys enjoy it.	positive

Dr. S. Yup, only notice it after re-watching AOTC. It's the sensor for visual data. TLC gave the better effect than Hasbro, since they made it glow like in the movie. KimT, not at the moment, since I have slowed down quite abit due to my day job. Though, I still definitely enjoy the company here to contribute more reviews when available(meaning after I find a better way to co-exist both my hasbro and lego stuff spending). millacol88, yup, those accessories definitely makes me want to start lego clone troop building.	neutral

There's plenty of reviews in the Review Index. (Pinned topic)	negative
Good review for a simple set. While it does come with the basics for an impulse set, I just feel that it lacks something though I am not sure what. Perhaps a printed magic scroll? I am still not a fan of the printed cap (especially the stars), but I do like the printed pants displaying his various goodies hanging from his belt. The plain torso is to be expected from a wizard minifig I suppose. Overall, it's not a bad set but it certainly feels to be lacking something, IMO.	neutral
Thanks for the review. I love this impulse set, I bought two of them so I could make a Wizard and his apprentice. I didn't have an owl either so an extra is pretty cool, and I like the trans globe piece. Batbrick Away!	positive
I Scream Clone, on Aug 31 2008, 02:27 AM, said: Kudos on a well presented and written review. I think the reason this set didn't release in US was because it didn't have any warnings about choking anywhere on the box, therefore no lawsuits in US for LEGO. Cheers ISC No that's not the reason. I'm sure you'll get this set eventually. As for the box, well, there's always been 2 box-designs - one for the US and one for EU (actually there's an Asian one as well). The EU doesn't have the box count or the don't swallow (we know that). The US version has the brick count and don't swallow warning (typical US). Thanks for a super review strawberry-ice-man. I like the wizard, I'm only sorry they put him in an impulse set. Who'd want an army of medium blue wizards? So it's the worst army builder, but a cool wizard. Does that make sense?	neutral
The next in my attempt to review every impulse set single handed Theme: Space, Mission Mars Set Name: Alien Jet Set Number: 5617 Number of Pieces: 21 Figures:1 Released: 2008 List Price: £1.99 (GBP) $3.50 (USD) 2.99 (EURO) 5617 Peeron.com 5617 Bricklink Catalog 5617 Shop At Home As always we begin outside of the box It looks rather exciting at first glance. Set that cost a lot more than this one. Now for what?€™s inside. The contents of the box, the impulse sets never look that inspiring. Now for the alien, I have to say I?€™m not impressed. I?€™m not a big space fan and I only bought this due to my impulse review challenge, but as the main point of the impulse sets is the alien is a little hard to build a good set round something with one point or articulation. It lacks what make Lego minfigs so great their articulation. Now for the space vehicle, as always with impulse a short and easy build ensues. Took maybe 2 mins at the most. Time to mount the alien in his craft. The craft looks a little wide for him. Slightly better from this angle but still not winning any awards. I?€™m disappointed of the impulse sets I?€™ve reviewed so far this is clearly the weakest of them, but what really disappointing is the other seem so good and useful. The Rating System Figures: 3/10 (The alien is not a good minfig) Parts 6/10 (Some interesting parts but nothing that special.) Fun Fun Fun 2/10 (I can?€™t think of anything to do with this set to be honest.) Design 4/10 (Poorly designed the box makes it look much better.) Price 6/10 (Despite the impulse price tag I?€™m still unhappy about the price.) Grand Total 21/50 (Less than half marks the lowest I?€™ve given so far.) Conclusion. In many ways I?€™m annoyed, from the outside of the box this set looks quite interesting and certainly appears to be well designed. The idea of a small alien fighter/flying craft is in my opinion a good one, but sadly when you?€™ve got the finished product in your hand it looks nothing like the box art. While I think Mission Mars had some interesting sets and I might still get some of them this one will not be a repeat purchase for me.	negative
Well set out review with alot of great content! Gotta ask you though, how does the set look nothing like the box art? With so few pieces I'd have thought one could mentally put it together given the box front.	neutral
I’m not a great communicator but what I was trying to say was that on the box the sets looks quite exciting and well made and that the Alien fits much more snugly than it does. So I was a bit disappointed that it seemed wider and less compact and certainly less exciting when I opened it,	negative
well now we at least know that we can avoid that set ;) Johan	negative
Thanks for the review. Considering the price, I give it "Below Average". I didn't buy any of the space impulse sets as I don't think they are good value.	negative
Thanks for this review. As for the set? Well, I am not to crazy about this set, But I want some sort of small alien fleet vehicals, and this would work well. But I would rather ave my money to buy classic town. Edited by ~VBBN~, 01 September 2008 - 02:48 AM.	negative
I already don't liked the aliens, but if the fighter was better I would already bought him. Now I will maybe buy one of it just for the 2 limegreen pieces.	negative
I rated this poor due to the fact the set is unimaginative (looks like a bunch of plates where thrown together) and it just isn't worth the money LEGO is asking for it, IMO. I've never been a fan of the non-articulated "jellies" so I'll leave my disgust for them out of this post. However, unlike the set, the review is a fine work of art that clearly depicts the goods and provides valuable insight/opinions about the set's playability, usefulness, and overall value.	positive
Sets we miss include minfig sets like this one?€? Theme: Space Set Name: Space Mini-figs Set Number: 6703 Number of Pieces: 30 Figures: 6 Released: 1988 List Price: ? (unknown) 6703 Peeron.com 6703 Bricklink Catalog Lets begin by admiring the outside of the box. Wow 6 figs and all equipped, I was four more of these. We don?€™t get instructions so the back show how to put the figs together. Now for the men themselves. The complete line up, of all six figs, it seems strange half are in black. A closer look at our four Futrons. A look at the Blacktrons looking like nice guys with their visors raised. Time for a closer look at the range of tool these good men received from the Lego Company. Yep one accessory per person. The question is what could you do with this set, I mean it?€™s just spacemen in a line? Do you see the man who mugged you ma?€™am?. A good set from an age when we could look forward to every few years a new set of minfigs and just a box of them The Rating System Figures: 10/10 (An excellent selection for the time) Parts 4/10 (Good accessories but nothing else.) Fun Fun Fun 7/10 (I can see lots of opportunity for fun with this set..) Design 8/10 (Well it?€™s not really designed much but it?€™s a great idea.) Price ?/10 (Unknown at this time though mine was from Woolworths!) Grand Total 29/40 (A good mark for a great set.) Conclusion. Until the Castle Battle Packs came out this year we?€™ve been suffering from a lack of minfig based sets, and from this review I think you can see why. For many of us and I include myself here Lego minifig are one of the best parts of the hobby and sets like these allowed you to build up a much larger number of figs. Lego did well with this set a nice range of figure and also a good selection of accessor	positive
You you got it mint in sealed box? It indeed is a nice set. I am not into Space, but nevertheless this set is a good addition if you need to get your space environment a little bit more crowded. LEGO however is planning to release a minifig set again next year (city) and of course the advent calendars are also quite nice to get some figs with accessories.	positive
Thanks for the review! The latter space mini-fig sets were great as they gave a nice variety of men. I'd love this one...	positive
Fantastic review! This is one of the classic minifigs pack which is so great for gathering massive number of minifigs. I miss those days where they sell 5 minifigs together in a set. Thanks for this lovely review.	positive
Nice set, lucky you! The only reason I buy the MM impulse sets is lack of good space minifig packs like this nowadays ...	positive
Thanks for sharing this review with us. I think this one of the sets. In Europe this thing is waaaay overpriced and thus makes it a crappy set. We pay nearly double the US price. So I rated it poor. Also because the figs included does not make it great. The Hailfire is well designed and looks great, but that's just about all there is worthy of a positive mentioning. Sorry. [on a side note: As a bronze-awarded student, where's the price in EUR and GBP? And where's the poll?] [Nevermind the poll, I've added that one for you ]	negative
JimButcher, on Aug 30 2008, 10:25 PM, said: Oh yes, I will add the other prices, and I was going to make a poll for it (I made one for the Homing Spider review), but you beat me to it. Thanks! That's my job, I'm a moderator	negative
Thanks for the review, JimButcher. I really like that set. It combines interesting and good design with some awesome cool parts and a neat amount of charm.	positive
Great review. I agree that this set is underrated. The Hailfire is supposed to be a little taller than two battle droids, so scale-wise it's nice. The dwarf spider droid is amazing in my opinion. I just wish it wasn't brown, it makes me feel like it's on Geonosis. We never saw a grey varient of the Hailfire, so it's fine with me that it's brown.	positive
Thanks for the review. Is a great one. This set is not really a good set but i like the Spider Droid. The Hailfire Droid scale is not right, i think it is suppose to be even bigger. anyway, this is the first set that re-release the Commander Droid. So i grab it.	negative
Thanks for the cool review JimButcher . Actually, I really like this set, it is small but very clever and even if the hailfire droid is undersized, what in the whole line is not under or oversized . The new spider droid is the best small build I have ever done in a set and the droid commander is pretty cool . I am happy with the set and I will get another with my comic-con exclusive .	positive
7681: Homing Spider Droid (LIMITED EDITION) Number of Pieces: 206 Number of minifigs: 5 Price: 34.99 USD/ 29.99 EUR/ 19.99 GBP Theme: Star Wars: Episode II Year Released: 2008 Brickset Folder Bricklink Catalog Welcome to my sixth review on these boards, of the mighty Homing Spider Droid. At first glance, this ball on legs may not seem like much, but hopefully this review will change your mind. The box. This box is the standard for all of the new Clone Wars sets: sleek, shiny, and a right-out-of-the-factory look. The blue-and-white color scheme is fantastic, and portrays that the sets are based off of a cartoon well. This box has a "LIMITED EDITION" (in Spanish, too! ) seal slapped on the front, although you won't have trouble finding this in your local Toys "R" Us, because of the big Clone Wars display in the front of the store that you can't miss. Overview In this picture, you can see the contents of the whole set (minus the instruction booklet) built. You can spot five minifigures (which I'll get to later), and a very tall CIS weapon, known as the Homing Spider Droid. This weapon of destruction is a must-have for your CIS army, although the color scheme (mostly dark bley and light bley) is a change up from the regular colors (brown or blue) of the CIS. This may have something to do with the blended armies of the Trade Federation and Corporate Alliance, but I don't know for sure. The instruction manual is very thin, only about twenty pages. Homing Spider Droid This is the main part of the set. Four huge legs, two mounted guns, and a red sensor eye are the highlights of this artillery unit. There's not many playability factors to this one, but sometimes its just fun to squash the little clones, a change-up of the contrary. It also looks good next to all of the other CIS sets, but you might want to clear some room in your display area; the legs take up a lot of room! This thing is also massively tall, about the same height as the Republic Cruiser. Main Body This is the main body of the spider, which has no cockpit and is remote controlled. This spherical body (not in that sort of way...) is a very quick build, and features a big, red eye connected by a red stud and hinge. Top Gun Here is the top gun (not with Tom Cruise), which is connected to the body using a clever Technic system (pun not intended). As you can see from this picture, you can see that it can rotate a full 360 degrees, but only if you remove the eye. Also, the gun can be pulled back, and if you let go, it will snap back, like the a gun does when fired, due to the force of the shot. I'm not sure this was intended by TLG, because it wasn't showed anywhere on the box or in the manual. Lower Gun Here is the gun attached to the under body of the main part. It is attached using a hinge, which allows it to move up and down. I also like the cord (that presumably transfers power) included on both guns. Hips Here is one of the hips attaching the legs to the body. There is one on each side, with two legs each. The are attached to the body and legs with Technic pieces. Legs You can see the tall legs in this pic. They are basically just Technic poles and connectors. Feet This is one of the feet, the essential to balancing the whole vehicle. These and the legs are repetitive, so I suggest doing them all at the same time to avoid flipping back in the manual and repeating the process three more times. The picture speaks for itself for the design of the feet. All are connected to the legs using a double-holed Technic piece. One Massive Son of a Gun This thing is so tall! It frightens the skin off of even the toughest, most experienced soldiers. Run for your Lives!! Look at how much havoc and fear it causes! Family Photo Enough of the battle scenes, here is a shot of this spider with it's smaller cousin: the Dwarf Spider Droid. Minifigs Finally, here are the minifigs that come with this set. There are five in all, which include: Battle Droid: Nothing special, but still an addition to your army Commander Battle Droid: I love that yellow torso! Super Battle Droid: Again, nothing special Clone Trooper: I'm glad they gave us one in this set, I can add it to to my other Phase 1 clones. Commander Fox: I love it! Everything from the dark red markings to the accessories are fantastic! The head is just the regular anime style Clone Wars face. This set comes with two flashlights, two antennae, one visor, one pauldron, and one kama. Close-up of Fox Here is a close-up of Fox, so you can see the detailed insignia of the Republic Guard. That wraps it up for the review, here is the FINAL VERDICT: Build: 8/10, very easy and straightforward, a little repetitive with the legs. Should take the seosoned builder around 20 minutes. Playability: 6/10, not many play factors, but it's fun to just squash puny clones with this giant arachnid. Swooshability: N/A Minifigs: 10/10, you really can't ask for more in this sort of set! Design: 8/10, not very sturdy, but it is altogether clever. Price: 5/10, yes, it is limited edition, but pumping up the price fifteen dollars more than it should be is a little ridiculous. Overall Score: 8.5/10, An excellent set for display, although not very sturdy. Minifigs are superb, but the price could be better. In the end, I would highly recommend this to any Prequel Trilogy fan looking to build up his/ her army. Well, that's about it for this review, Please feel free to leave your opinions!

KimT, on Aug 30 2008, 05:27 PM, said: I just bought this set the other day and I must admit that it gets a "Below Average" from me. The price is not corresponding with what you get. Which would be implied, had Jim added the EUR or GBP price in the info[hint hint ] The spider droid is flimsy at best. Making it stand or even move without tumbling over is hard. Also why the brown cylinders on the legs? Keep the colourscheme clean, please. The figs are fine, except that I dislike the clone headgear and the fact that the helmets now have holes in the sides, allowing the flesh head to show within = Goofy looking. I am soo replacing the clone heads with black ones. Great review of an acceptable set Aw, that's too bad, KimT. While I must admit it is flimsy, I still love this set. Oh yeah, I added the other prices, thank you.	positive
Thank you for that good review, JimButcher. I think that this is really a pretty interesting and original looking set. Maybe it´s not very stable, but it owns some special 'War Of The Worlds' charm for sure...	positive

Thanks for the great review JimButcher! This looks like a pretty decent set, I might get this if I find it on discount.	positive
I love the look of this set it's the closest to getting a Walking Eye from The Venture Bros. As well as the Droids and Troopers :)	positive
mass-manufactured and designed to withstand extreme amounts of punishment... It's an Iron drone, and it's marching on its Sentry! Set data 7711: Sentry Year: 2006 Theme: Exo-Force Subtheme: Robots Pieces: 74 (+4 extra) <- both counting Hinge control stick and its base as two separate pieces Price: Euro 7 circa, MISB, including S/H, on eBay; RRP was Euro 5 circa / 5 USD. Probably 5 UKP. Building time: 20/25 minutes (10 minutes building, the rest of the time placing stickers!) More info: Brickset - Peeron Being 2006 my last dark year, I wasn't a big ExoForce fan but they were ok. I tought 2007 models were better, and still think 2008 models are the best. That basically means 1) It's a shame that there will be no more of this line and 2) this is my first 2006 model, yet I bought in in July 2008. Ok, let's do this one. Box front: box was battered due to Italian Post; they'll do their best to give Lego boxes a "war" outlook. Close-up: the Japanese katakana read "tokushu butai" -> special (military) force(s) Box back: amazing alternate model; some like it more than the original design. Box content: a small but capable sticker sheet, two bags and instructions. Sticker sheet: and they're numbered! Random instructions page: connecting legs to the body Instructions page - sticker detail: that's why they're numbered. Instructions page - parts inventory: does anybody check if they're all there before building? Surely not me. Loose pieces: nothing rare, I think; small Techinc parts come in different colours, as usual (you often don't see them when the model is complete, but sometimes you do) The Iron drone: "strong and durable" (and much better looking than those crappy MM jelly aliens) Building starts. The open cockpit - front and rear view Left leg - front and rear view; right leg is built of the same pieces. Left arm - with laser cannon The cannon - great use of the hollow studs with the "Plant Tree Palm Top" Right arm - with twin missiles Complete model - front view Complete model - side view and rear view Rating and review. Parts and building: nothing new, but both models are O.K. Instead of waiting the last page of the manual, you'd better put the stickers in place while building. Looking at the box you'd tell stickers background is (trans) purple. It actually is trans clear (excpet for the yellow and black stripes - warning: hazard!). Try not to put your fingerprints on the sticky side! Consider using tweezers. Posability: both legs and both arms feature three joints; and that's good, so that the weight doesn't have the Sentry falling down. Final model: smaller compared to 2007 Claw Crusher and 2008 Batlle Arachnoid, but cheaper and surely worth the money. The "minifig" is just another Iron drone, not much to say. Final rating: 3,5/5 Edited by Sinner, 01 September 2008 - 02:22 AM.	neutral
Thanks for the review. This is one of the few first wave sets that I didn't get. I'm not really sure why as it wasn't too expensive.	neutral
I like the theme very much, but sadly, I don't own any sets of it. It brings such a great feeling, it's fresh and has great parts and sets. And it brought the polar bear! Your review is very good and informative, thanks! (I voted wrong, I meant above average, but I clicked below average )	positive
Thank you for that fine review, TheBrickster! I really like how this two small sets create an intense and adventurous atmosphere against the backdrop of a pretty exotic region. The sets´re well designed and very nice with a fine amount of rather unique and well fitting gear. The whole theme offers a lot of playability in a set-up that´s a little different to TLC´s standard sceneries for sure. And... it always reminded me of 'Who Goes There?', too...	positive
A nice set review. As for the theme itself, I though it was a very interesting theme. Sadly I don’t think Lego put enough effort into it, I was personally upset not to se a second year even if I didn’t buy any of the sets. It reminds me of the artic theme Playmobil did at one point in the distant past to be honest. I think a number of good artic scenes were missed, when it came out a really wanted to get a ski plane but it never came, I built it myself in the end but I don’t know how Lego missed that one. On a slightly random note I do know that at least one Lego minifig did make it all the way to the real artic with a research team, sadly I don’t have any pictures to offer you.	negative
A very nice review! I really miss the Arctic theme. I didn't own any of the sets, but after looking at the pictures in this review and reading the instructions on Brickleys words and Brickfactory, I want them.	positive

Nice review Brickster! The Arctic theme is very nice. The minifigs have a great look to them especially with the hoods. The colors for the Arctic sets I have always liked, and somehow the idea of minifigs exploring the arctic is fun to me.	positive
Thank you very much for this review, TheBrickster! I voted both times for Outstanding because: I really the Arctic theme. I only bought the ice sailor but otherwise no sets because of money and place reasons and because I already collect four themes (City, older Castle, Western and Star Wars Old Triology). But a comeback of the Arctic theme - perhaps as addition to a winter sports and winter rescue theme would be very welcome! I really all sets - the little and the big ones. In my opinion they all were very well designed (not too big vehicles, not too little and not minimalitic, great minifigs and very nice and lovely details and accessory). Klaus-Dieter	positive
On this, the first anniversary of the news organization that has become so near and dear to your hearts, EB News is pleased to present a very special feature that we've only added recently: The EB News Review! This is really our third such extravaganza, but the first one to actually be done right, so it's my great honour to welcome all of you to this event. I'm your hostess with the mostest, er, host, ImperialShadows, getting in the way and generally causing mayhem will be Staudie, of course, and actually presenting the review will be cub reporter and senior reviewer, WhiteFang! Yes, the ever popular WhiteFang of the Reviewer's Academy. You know him, you love him, let's hear some applause! *audience cheers wildly* Oh, that's too kind, now how about some for WhiteFang? Name: Airplane Mechanic Theme: LEGO System / Town / City Year: 2006 Pieces: 26 Minifigs: 1 Price: USD$3.50 The featured set will be a 7901 Airplane Mechanic. This is the smallest set ever released in the CITY sub theme, Airport. We will be bringing you to on site experience in the hanger. Today our special guest is a mechanic who is specially trained to handle with jet engine turbines. *Camera Rolls* Aren't our pose look so cool? Staudie, your clothes are still white. Let's just all try to smile until this picture is done. Look at our special guest. He can still smile in that weird position of his. Quiet you! *Interviewing process* I am the airplane mechanic, holding a grade 2 license. My specialisation is to maintain and repair jet turbines of 7893 and 7894 Passenger Planes. We have many mechanics, 24/7, across international airports, making sure that the planes are in safe condition. We are able to maintain from Rolls Royce, Pratt & Whitney and General Electric engines as well. This is the trolley to push the turbine engine around. This model is used for Passenger Planes 7893 and 7894 series. Look at the size of the turbine. It required actually 4 engine turbines like this, to power a 7893 Passenger Plane aircraft. I have all these nice essential tools, to work on that engine behind me. There is a wrench, hammer, oilcan, open end wrench, power drill and screwdriver. *Whistles Innocently* Geez, he thought no one would notice him pushing the engine away? *Testing process* As you can see, the crane is firm and sturdy. It is able to lift the engine at a certain height. Hey get off there! For goodness sake, this is not a rodeo. Yee-Ha! WhiteFang must fixed his loose wires. I knew we shouldn't let him read those Superman comics on break. Give a man a cape, and he thinks he can fly. *the audience laughs* What's so funny? It's dangerous to stand at that position. Staudie, are you done with your measuring yet? Almost there. *Clang Bang Clank* Oof! Get this thing off me! I'll push, you pull! Let's get moving! *CLANG* I think I sprained my pride. No, wait, it's my back. I gave up my pride when I took over this news organization. *Shadows flips the engine, crushing WhiteFang* Get that hook off my head... Guess, we are heading for a commerical break at the moment. Wait up, let me pull the white curtain. That's all, everyone. With me, Staudie bringing the end of the show. ImperialShadows and WhiteFang are currently in the LEGOLAND Hospital where WhiteFang is getting patched up and Shadows is flirting with the nurses, mostly. I really hope you loved this interactive review brought to you by EB News Reviews. Overall, we felt that this was a very good impulse set with a wide range of mechanical tools and an extra turbine to play with. Therefore, we recommend you to get it since it's very affordable. Anyway, every airport need mechanics/engineers to maintain the aircrafts to make sure it's certified to fly. This is too formal. I hate reading it from WhiteFang's script. It's best to do it in Staudie's style. Yo yo yo, whazzup? Er. No, that isn't it either. Um... Thanks for viewing! I hope to bring you another exciting and information review soon, here on EB News Reviews! *Camera Fades*	neutral
It's amazing! It's stupendous! It's almost like WhiteFang is a reviewer with previous experience! It's almost like I wrote all of Shadow's lines! It's almost like Staudie is being as annoying as ever. Oh wait, that's all true! Great review of a neat little set. I used mine as the air conditioning unit on the roof of my Chinese restaurant. Then some dork told me it didn't look believable or something. I liked it. Um... so. Great review! Thanks for presenting it! I give you a And, let's just take a moment to get sentimental. A year ago, today, Staudie had a lame idea: Interview the members of EB. He flailed around with it for a few interviews, including the infamous one where Hinck attention whored Sinner into a corner and Sinner were featured, reprising their roles from the Whacker and the Walrus. It was quite memorable, but then, a short time later, someone new joined the team, bringing it to a new level of polish and bad jokes. Still, this tribute isn't dedicated to that genius of the written word, nay, it's dedicated to the whole staff, including the new guy who is still a secret so don't bother asking, I'm not telling! Ha! I salute you, EB News, it's been a damn fine year! I hope I can survive another.	positive
Great review, Whitefang and Co.! A thoroughly enjoyable one, I'm glad we have a series of reviews that you can expect to be packed with humour and craziness. Looking forward to the next! ~Peace	positive
It can NEVER be a happy ending for Stuadie! So why did you give him one? Nice review	neutral
2872 Witch and Fireplace Review Theme: Fright Knights Parts: 18 Figs: 1 Price: Unknown (BrickLink $5.00+) Year: 1997 Brickset Peeron Brickshelf Bricklink Ever wanted to turn into a animal, wanted to curse your enemy or just wanted to be rich beyond your wildest dreams. You should go visit the Witch and her Fireplace. She can brew you up a potion for any occasion or purpose. So head down to see the Witch right now. Although this set is from the Fright Knights theme it can easily fit in with any other castle theme due to the lack of specialised Fright Knight parts and printings. The set comes with no astounding parts but looks like the source for our good magician impulse set from the current castle theme. I think I got this as a promo set. Official Pic. The box art for the set has the standard Fright Knight background and lego system logo followed by the set number. Down the left hand side of the box a cat is attempting a head stand. Also I think this box display the contents of the set in an attractive set up as usual. 1. The whole set minifigs and all Here is the witch. On the torso there is a spider amulet which is a little hard to make out due to the low res of the image. The Witches wand is the same as the Bellville fairy wands except in trans red like a lightsaber blade although it is completely useful as a lightsaber. As you have probably noticed the witch has no legs instead she has a slope brick with the dress pattern printed on witch (get it witch-which) looks better than Asajj Ventress' from the new clone wars sets in my opinon. (for this anyway) The Fairysaber (new word) duel. This is the old run down fireplace of the Witch. At the base there are two smouldering coals instead of fire witch (it's not funny any more is it?) doesn't make that much sense seeming as it is a fireplace. The little triangular brick on top doesn't really do anything I also accidentally put the wrong one on while building, it should be a sloping brick. Here are the coals. The old trans orange studs are less translucent than the new ones. I like how they have places them above the main baseplate on a 1x2 plate so they are in line with the rest of the fire place other wise it would look wrong. Here is everything else I haven't covered yet, the crystal ball, the pets and the magical potion vial. The crystal ball is identical to the one included with the Good Wizard impulse form the current castle theme. I like the molds for the cat and the bat although if the cat had some yellow printing for the eyes like the white cat had black for the eyes it would be much better. I think the trans green tube things are a little uncommon but I'm not worried about that. 2. Overall Build: 6/10 Extremely puzzling and difficult do not attempt alone . It's pretty simple but seeming as it has a load of stuff you can move around it is good. Minifigs: 9/10 I really like the witch and it couldn't have really come with anyone else also it came with the wand which is really good too. Design: 8/10 It should have come with some fire and maybe some more orange bricks to put at the base. Parts: 8/10 The minifigure isn't bad nor are the animals or the trans green part. Price: 10/10 I am guessing this was pretty good. Seeming as I think I got this as a promo I gave it 10 because it was free. Playability: 7/10 As wth all impulse sets there isn't much here but at least it comes with some animals to have a fight with or give the witch rabies. Overall: 8/10 If it came with some more stuff for the fire place and the cat was more detailed it would have scored higher but because this set can easily be intergrated with other castle sets it got a mighty 8. 3. Mini comic ! Hocus pocus magic shocus turn my pets into dinosaurs (not to catchy is it?) *Poof* Oh know I think I might drink my magical potion glug glug glug Oh! my	positive
Thank you very much for this review, Skipper 24! I voted for Outstanding since this set is a little but very lovely set. I really it (although I don't own it yet ) since it's very similar to today's Impulse sets: a minifig and some nice additional stuff. And I like the black cat which gives the set a more gloomy atmosphere. Hopefully TLG will include a black cat and a chimney like in this set in the new advent calendar, too. Klaus-Dieter	positive
I chose above average. It has a great minifigure.... I wish I had it....someday I will!	positive
This is a very good review, no doubt about it. About this set, this is a cheap way to buy this set with a witch and some nifty accessories such as the black cat. In fact, I think this is the first time I had ever seen a black cat. It's simple, but not very useful in my collection. Because other Fright Knight sets also offer the witches too. I don't need many witches. Overall, I feel that this is an average set.	neutral
Yay, another Fright Knights review! Odd comic at the end.

You should go visit the Witch and her Fireplace. She can brew you up a potion for any occasion or purpose. So head down to see the Witch right now. Sounds like a song or nursery rhyme, somehow. Anyway, to the review, it is a great review, such a small set but you've summed it up well. This is one of the few unpromo Fright Knight sets I didn't get, sadly. Not 'sadly' because of Willa the Witch, I have about four of her, but the special cat, and the other bits (one can never have too many Lego bats). I voted the set outstanding, I think it is for its size. KimT, on Sep 1 2008, 08:16 PM, said: You already know how I feel about the review. Good or bad feelings?

Review of 7670 Hailfire Droid and Spider Droid *Updated* Theme: SW Episode II / Clone Wars Parts: 249 (- figs) Figs: 4 Price: £20.00, $20.00, ?‚?25.99 Year: 2008 I think many people were deterred from this set because of the low piece count and a high price for it although it does come with 4 minfigures. 1. Overall set and figs Official box pic. This indicates it is a Geonosis set from the background but it is no different from any other set same old brown separatist ship/s. The whole set. Some red tan droids would have been nice like in the Geonosian fighter set. All the minifigs. The super battle droid body is slightly different to the one in the BP. It looks more grainy and silver. I doubt this has any relevance for it being a geonosis set but I like them better how they were in the BP's The Super Battle droid body dwarfing the commander droids body. I think that the new Commander droids body is better than the old one with just the yellow strip even though it is less accurate. New twisted Battle Droid arm, each droid has one of these. I don't really like having droids with these new guns I think the older guns suited them much better. 2. Hailfire Droid Hailfire droid by itself. It is certainly smaller than the original. Seeming as this is the main part of the set I was hoping it would be bigger but I don't mind it being this small too much. Wheels and rockets can fold outwards and inwards The wheels which spin round two large clear discs and made from loads of these tiny links. This is probably the best way to make the wheels on this small scale. The only other alternatives I can think of are using the tracks from the Wookiee Attack set or catterpilla tracks, both of which wouldn't look right. One of the missile pods. These use the new flick-fire missiles which don't fall out are an excellent idea. They should have come with the purple cones like on the Magna guards staffs instead of red though because in the film the missiles are purple. One of the new flickfire missiles that don't drop out when the model is tilted forward. I don't know what the holes in them are for though. The 3 "eyes" are made up of 2 trans red cheese bricks for the sides and 1 trans red stud for the center.You can also see how the missile pods are attached to the side of the body. This is the back of the Hailfire Droid. There is a plate with a hole in, I have found only one purpose for this. The Hailfire Droid is the Commander droids war chariot! What do you use the plate for? 3. Spider Droid The Spider Droid. The design has been greatly improved from the Wookiee attack set. Not only is it more accurate but also more poseable which is useful when setting up battle scenes. The ball joint provides the place to put the antenna which isn't long enough but the dome form the old set looks more like the droid form Star wars Episode II. The eyes are made of a telephone piece with 2 trans red studs on. In the original it had orange studs. The eyes can be seen in action 2 pics down. I told you it was a telephone. 1 of 4 identical legs. These are very easy to adjust into what ever position you want and are much better than the originals. But a word of warning never pull them apart as I did they become very loose when put back together so I put some blue tack in the holes. 4.Overall Build: 7/10 A little to repetitive for my liking. Minifigs: 8/10 4 figs for £20 isn't too bad plus they come with new guns. Design: 9/10 Both vehicles are very well designed but the hailfire's small size let the set down. Parts: 8/10 Comes with lots of useful (maybe not ) Brown track links. Price:7/10 Not too bad with 4 figs and loads of little brown links. Playability: 6/10 Not to much on it's own Overall: 7/10 If it came with some clones and tan red droids it would be better. Afetr Jar Jar wiped out a small droid patrold he realized he was being watched Mesa in big dodo this time...	neutral

6205: V-Wing Fighter Number of Pieces: 118 Number of Minifigs: 1 Price: 9.99 USD/ 13.99 EUR/ 8.99 GBP Theme: Star Wars/ Episode III Year Released: 2006 Brickset Folder Bricklink Catalog Welcome to this review of the V-Wing Fighter. This will be my eighth review on the boards. Strangely enough, there was another set called the V-Wing Fighter that came out in 1997 for the Space theme. Note that I am missing several small pieces to this set, but they are mostly insignificant to the overall look. The Box This is the standard box type for all 2005-2006 Star Wars sets. I can't say that I like it as much as the 2007 or 2008 box types, but it'll do. It features a profile view of Darth Vader and silver text. Overview This is the whole set. This ship is meant to protect the Chancellor at all costs. They are usually found in groups of three or four. Front This ship is very sleek, and you'll notice that it's colors are dark red, light bley, and dark bley with a touch of black. It starts at the nose very narrow, but as the body progresses to the back, it gets wider, like a "V" (hence the name). Back Here is a view of the rear. Note the trans-neon green discs used to represent the boosters. Also notice the dark red R4 astro droid and the hinges used as aromor. Flight All four wings (two on each side) can open up for flight/ attack mode. They can open even farther then the pic shows, but it's not an intended function. The wings a great, but it's a real pain to position them correctly, and the bottom wings close when you set the ship down. Tail fins This is what the tail fins look like on each side, with two flaps attached to the top and bottom. If you look closely, the tail fins and wings look a little bit like a mini ship themselves, maybe controlled by remote. No, this is not an intended function, either. Guns, side The guns are very simple but very clever, using a double Technic hole piece, two black bars, and two Technic pins. Also note the landing gear. Minifig Finally, here is the minifig: a clone pilot. It has light blue arms and legs, white hands, a helmet with black markings and Republic insignia on it, and a double-sided torso. The front of the torso is great, featuring shoulder straps, armor plating, and a life support system. While this minifig is not altogether accurate to the movie, it has still been one of my favorite Star Wars figs. Back The back of the fig that can double as the front of clone marines. This side features shoulder straps and armor plating. Cockpit Lastly, here is the pilot seated in the cockpit. He fits perfectly, although it is not air-tight. We wouldn't want the poor guy to suffocate, now would we? That wraps up the review, here is the FINAL VERDICT: Build: 8/10, a nice, easy, build, and the last of the small SW ships ($10 or less). Playability: 6/10, pretty fun to swoosh around, but that's about it. Could use a vulture droid, but that would take away the 'small' factor. Swooshability: 10/10, very fun and easy to swoosh around endlessly, without fear of it breaking. Minifigs: 9/10, there really is no need to have more, although a Palpy fig would be outstanding. The pilot is a great figure though. Design: 9/10, extremely accurate to the movie, but the cockpit is not airtight. Price: 10/10, you couldn't ask for a better deal! Overall Score: 8.6, an excellent set. Unfortunately, this is the last of the small SW ships currently. The fig is great, and the sleek design is accurate. That just about sums it all up, feel free to leave your comments! Edited by JimButcher, 15 September 2008 - 03:11 AM.	positive
This was a great set for the price. Ten dollars for a cool minifigure and a decent sized ship is great.	positive
Yeah this was an ok set. I remember getting a few of these at TRU. The boxes were smashed up and I got some 30 percent off. (Still not as cheap as regular US price ) Some ok bricks and a great minifig. Thanks for sharing your thoughts and opinions on this set I'll rate this set as average. Oh, yeah I've added the review to the index.	neutral
Thanks for the review. This set never got me, so I didn't get it! I also don't like the droid-head-only thing and I haven't bought any set like that. I planned to buy this on sale... but it never happend.	negative

Is your knight army feeling short? Do your knights get consistently run over by the skeletons? If so, this is the set for you! 852271 Knights Battle Pack Set Info Set Name: 852271 Knights Battle Pack Theme: Castle Released: 2008 Price: USD 12.99-GBP 6.49-EUR 9.95 Minifigs: 5 It's army building time! Packaging The figs come in a plastic box with a slide out tray. To open, you slide out a tab on the bottom, and pull the tray out. The Weapons One plus of this set is the good weapon selection. You get a whopping 5 shields, a spear, a lance, acrossbow, a pointed lance thing and a lovely chrome sword Minifigures Now the main focus of this set, the figs! One thing that's nice here is that you get a good selection of different knights. The figs are quite nice, with different faces and helmets for almost every one. Minifig Backsides! I really like the archer's quiver. Two sided head The Archer has a scared head on the other side. Brickshelf Folder And now, the ratings! Price: 6/10 (Certainly a bit overpriced. It should have been $10. The Star Wars battle packs have only 1 less fig plus some parts for $5 less) Parts: 8/10 (No bricks, but a nice selection of weapons) Minifigs 9/10 (The figs are great) Overall: 23/30 LEGO S@H Brickset Bricklink Even with a bigger army, the poor knights are no match for modern technology... Summary Even though the pack is a bit overpriced, it is still great for increasing your army's size. I would get this set if you are a Castle fan looking to expand your army, otherwise don't worry if you pass on this set. Thanks, and happy building!	positive
Very good review! I enjoyed reading this. I want to buy these battlepacks. Until now, my country has not re-stocked these battlepacks. I wonder will they ever arrived again. I want to build massive armies with this outstanding battlepack set. Hope it will arrived soon.	positive
I love this battlepack! I bought two last time I went to Legoland California, and it certainly gave the knights a good variety of new troops. However, I have one complaint, and that is the guy with the lance. I am wondering why he has a lance while fighting on foot. If TLG really wanted to give him a lance, they should have given him a horse.	positive
Great review of a neat way to bulk up your castle guards and their associated weapons and shields. I hope we continue to see sets like this in the future, they have to be a good money maker for TLG and they always please the fans. Francis Marion, on Sep 2 2008, 10:39 AM, said: they should have given him a horse ... with that lovely new barding. Nobody would complain about the price then, even if it was $15.	positive
Great set, but with two HUGE cons. - Availabilty: only on S@H? Well, surely not in Italian stores. - Why are the figures already built? Are today's kids SO dumb? Let's go back to those old minifig packs!	neutral
I've been thinking about buying this. I haven't bought any Castle sets since KK2. Plus I really need that scared face.	neutral
The Cobra, on Sep 2 2008, 11:33 AM, said: - Why are the figures already built? Are today's kids SO dumb? Let's go back to those old minifig packs! Probably to reduce the size/complexity of the package, thus, saving TLC money. I don't see it being a big deal as customization is always an option. Concerning the set: Not much to say other than it does what it's suppose to do: build up one's army of knights. The variance of faces and accessories are great. I especially love the chrome sword. The price isn't bad either since the package comes with five nice figs and some great equipment. Edited by dj2005, 03 September 2008 - 06:46 AM.	neutral
I was going to get this, but when i rang up S&H, apparently they'd sold out already. Price is a little on the steep side as well, and i can only see it going up on sites such as amazon as the number of people wanting them goes up, which it will it it's anything based on the star wars battle packs.	neutral
How were you able to get three small shields. I only got two in mine. I am going to check the trash just in case.	neutral
I think this battle pack is a little expensive, but the minifig ,their heads and weapons and stuff are very very nice! but because of the price, I'll rate it " average" ^^	neutral
I love this set. I bought one when I went to the Lego Store at Downtown Disney, and went home and bought another online. I love that it gives you a variety of weapons and figures. I like using the Bowl Helmet guy to man my catapults and crossbows.	positive

I like your review on this battle pack. But I think that this battle pack was over priced. $12 for this? I am not paying that much for 5 knights.	negative
Yeah I have to admit, you expect it to be wayyy cheaper since: A. No packaging to pay for(baggies and such) B. No liscensing fees(like SW) So why isn't this set a better deal than SW battlepack? Don't look at me, look at TLC(he he it rhymed)	negative
Today we will be joining Mr. Brickop and his dog Stud on the tough job of being a police officer.

The Box A very nice small square box with the policeman and his dog on the front. And the back which shows the officer running to the scene of the crime, walkie-talkie in hand. Instruction Manual The back of the manual has the 2008 Police sets and impulse sets pictured. It is interesting that the Good Wizard is on here even though I bought this set in the U.S. On this side you see how to build the model in 8 grueling steps... The Parts Not much out of the ordinary here except for the lovely printed road sign. Minifigs Here are the 2 figs, Stud and Mr. Brickop! They make a great team don't they? Extra Parts This set comes with a surprisingly large amount of extras for such a small set. All Built After it's all built, you get a pretty nice set. The road sign looks nice, but it is a bit strange seeing that arm stick so far out. The little equipment rack is pretty nice. Brickshelf Folder The Ratings Price: 8/10 (Decent price, but could be 50 cents cheaper) Parts: 8/10 (Nothing special except for the road sign which is a big plus) Minifigs: 10/10 (You can't wish for more than 2 in an impulse set!) Overall: 26/30 LEGO S@H Brickset Bricklink Mr. Brickop has finally put LEGOland's most notorious criminal behind bars... Summary This is a great impulse set. Having 2 minifigs really sets it above some of the other ones. The set make a great gift, or a good cheap present to yourself. It is great if you need to expand your police force as well. I would definitely recommend it. Thanks, and happy building!	positive
Good set, but I would have about 4 by now if it came with handcuffs though the roadsign is good.	positive
Tanks for the review erdbeereis1 but I don't really need to buy this set since they're are always loads of police sets and it's not as if I need anymore cops, although Stud makes it tempting...	neutral

Set Name: Crossbow Attack Set Number: 7090 Theme: Castle Pieces: 54 Minifigs: 3 Released: 2007 Price: 5.99USD, 3.99 EUR, 7.99 CDN Legoshop.com description: Ready, aim, fire!It's a battle of brave knights against the evil skeleton rider! Includes 2 knights, skeleton and a skeleton horse! Rolling wagon has a launcher that really fires! Bricklink Inventory Peeron Inventory Brickshelf Gallery Now, On to The Review! The Box As you can see, the front of the box illustrates the set very nicely, showing the skeleton warrior attacking and the knights firing their crossbow. The Back The Back of the box shows a small battle happening between a knight and a skeleton, as well as the main feature of the set, the firing crossbow (more on that later.) The Instructions Not much to say here, its the same as the front of the box. The Back of The Instructions This merely shows pictures of other sets in the castle line. Random Instruction page This set does not use piece callouts to tell you what parts you will need in each step. However, the set is so small you should never have trouble finding a piece. The Minifigures This is the main reason I bought this set. You get two knights, one with a standard helmet, and the other one with a new mold. You also get a skeleton warrior. The Horse The set comes with a skeleton horse that looks great. However, it is a single molded piece that has no articulation. Close-up of the Warrior riding his horse Here you see the brave skeleton riding in on his...ah......er......um......noble steed! The Accessories/Weapons For Minifigure Accessories, you get an axe, a skeleton sword, and a skeleton shield. Extra Pieces I was left with one skeleton arm and one leg when I was finished the build. The Crossbow Wagon and now, to the main part of the set, the crossbow wagon. It is really just a plate with some whells attached and a lot of those cheese wedge pieces to create the track for the projectile. Back View This view shows the mechanism that makes the crossbow fire. It is powered by a rubber band. You pull back on a technic piece, which creates tension in the elastic band. When you let go, the elastic pushes the piece forward, which in turn hits the projectile and makes it fire! It works fairly well, but I would have prefered it fired farther. Entire Set The Skeleton charges at his adversaries! The knights prepare to counterattack! Overall Build: 10/10 The build is simple, easy and quick. Set design: 7/10 The crossbow could have worked a bit better. Playability: 8/10 The crossbow is fun to shoot. Minifigs: 10/10 It doent get much better than this. I love that domed helmet mold! Price: 8/10 The set is very affordable and worth the price. Overall Score:43/50 Conclusion Overall, this is a great set and a solid army builder. You get three minifigures for a fair price and the crossbow wagon adds some much-needed playability. I bought two of these to bolster my army and to stock up on those rare domed helmet pieces. Basically, get this set! Thank you for taking the time to read my review. I hope you liked it!	positive
I agree that this set is worth the price considering the amount of minifigs and even a skeletal horse. It also comes with a lot of blue 1x1 slopes that are always useful and quite rare to obtain. Another weapon for the soldier operating the catapult (or a shield for the other soldier) would have been great, but that is pushing it. The crossbow itself is quite nice and is better than what most $6 sets come with, IMO. Overall, a good set indeed. Thank you for the review and the other review concerning The Knight, of which I hope to buy in the near future as it looks like it comes with a great deal of goodies. The weapon rack is useful, too.	neutral
I like this set mostly because it has some very usable pieces, but also because of the amount of minifigures in the set, which is a whopping three and one large animal (skeleton horse). The one thing, however, that I don't like about it, is that one of the catapult operators isn't armed. In my opinion, this would have been a good time for TLG to release a suitable dagger piece (not the kitchen knife) for its Castle line. Great review, by the way, it captured the key elements of this fantastic small set.	neutral
Cardinal Brick, on Sep 4 2008, 07:47 AM, said: Nice review . I still thing sets like this are the reason castle has done so well, it allows you to collect a large number of minfig for not very much cash, which I certainly indulged in. My only complaint is that you end up with the evil skeletons out numbered, however heard of the good guys winning with the numbers in their favour. I've experienced that problem too. I find my knights outnumber my skellies about 3:1.	negative

It's so hard to perforate the lungs or pierce the heart on a skeleton with a spear or crossbow bolt, isn't it? A great set with a reasonable price. Thanks for sharing it with us.

Dark times in LEGO Castle land... The poor knight is being held prisoner in the skeletons' prison carriage. We must help the brave knight on horseback free him at once. Let's ride! 7092 Skeletons' Prison Carriage Set Info Set Name: 7092 Skeletons' Prison Carriage Theme: Castle Released: 2007 Price: USD 19.99-GBP 14.99-EUR 19.95 Pieces: 193 Minifigs: 5 Animals: 4 Price Per Piece: About 10 cents Review Time! Box shots Our first pic is the front of the box, which shows a dark image of the knight attemping to free the prisoner. And here is the back, showing some features. The Manual The image on the manual is the same as on the box front. Random Manual Shot No piece call-outs, but the color distinction is not a problem. The Parts 193 pieces doesn't seem like a lot, but many of them are quite large. The selection is pretty good. Lots of greys and black. Minifigs With this set comes a whopping 5 minifigs which is amazing for a $20 set. The knights are very nice and one has a double-sided head. The Horses Adding to the already large minifig count are the 4 horses. 3 skeleton horses, and 1 great brown horse for the knight. Extra Parts Now, the finished set! First, we have the brave knight on his brown stallion. The horse's head covering looks very nice. And the knight gets a nice long pointy stick. The main event, the prison carriage! The design of this is excellent. With the bionicle piece and the white horns, it looks very spooky. The Tower This part is one of my favorites. It uses white horns to give it a great creepy look. One problem is that there is barely enough room for the 2 skeletons. The Driver Here you can see the driver and his whip. You can also see the bionicle spine. A side view When you look from the side, you can see the great design of the prison. It is placed on tiles for easy removal and looks great with the round white 1 x 1s on the corners. Horses' Harness This is another very well designed portion of the set. The harness attaches easily to the horses and to the carriage. The Prison Look at the poor imprisoned knight. Let's try to free him! The back of the prison hinges down! The knight is freed! Everything Together All together, the set looks fantastic. The carriage has a great creepy skeleton feel, and getting 9 minifigs is amazing. Brickshelf Folder Ratings Price: 10/10 (193 pieces and 9 figs is fantastic for $20) Parts: 9/10 (Lots of good large pieces) Design: 10/10 (Captures the spooky skeleton look very well) Playability: 8/10 (It's fun to try and free the prisoner and the carriage rolls well) Build: 9/10 (Easy but fun) Minifigs: 10/10 (The sheer amount of figs is great and they look great) Overall: 56/60 The future of LEGO Castle... Summary This is an amazing set for the price. A huge amout of minifigs, combined with a great design and good playabilty makes the set a winner. I would certainly recommend this set to anyone that remotely likes LEGO sets. Thanks, and happy building!	positive
Nice review, it seems that you really covered all aspects of this FANTASTIC set. My favorite part about it is probably the fact that you can give almost every included minifig a mount, except for one poor knight . However, another part I like is that the horse includes a plain saddle, which is a nice relief after the overabundance of the gold-plate barding, which is nice, but overused in the early sets. Also, the SW jokes are hilarious! I particularly the running gag with the walker, but I like this one too. Reason for Edit: I made a mistake due to a loss of internet and an accidental post.

You're really rolling these reviews out, huh? I am not sure how I feel about this set. While it does include five figs, three are skeletons and are generally worth much less than say three trolls/orcs (I know they didn't exist at this point in time so this is understandable). The amount of horses is nice, but I'm not a big LEGO horse fan. What this set does have is a great appearance and brings atmosphere to the table. $20 is an affordable amount for those of us who do not wish to splurge too much on a toy while being enough to actually get a large enough set to create something out of. Personally, I'd rate it in between average and above average. Like another Castle set (I can't remember which), I just feel this one also lacks something.	neutral
I really like this set, and it's probably my next purchase from a store (if I can still find it). There's alot of great pieces (I especially like the spiked thingy on the front), and it makes a great addition for any skeletal army. Above all, I just love the spine-chilling feeling of it. If I were a minifig in a Legoland, I'd be scared out of my pants-piece if I saw a carriage like that rolling towards me in a dark night.	neutral
Well, indeed looks like a very nice set. Especially the scared knights are very nice ;)	positive
That’s a nice review, though I do feel the price was a little high but as you said you get so much in it. Last year Argos in the UK reduced it to £7.99, which was a true bargain and sent me all over London looking for a store with more in stock. Again as with all the Lego castle sets I think what makes it work so well is that Lego are now providing a much larger number of minfigs and that’s often what makes a set.	neutral
This was one of the first sets I bought from the new Castle theme and I love it. So many figs and awesome skeleton horses in just one set. At the same time you get quite a few usefull black bricks for castle MOCs. Another perfect set in the new world of Castle Review added to the index.	positive
Thanks for the great review! I was going to buy this set this Saturday and after reading this review, I am twice as likely to buy it!	positive
I really do love this set. It has 5 figures, which is unheard of for a $20 set. It comes with plenty of weapons and accessories and has a great design. The detail is really well done and for anyone who wants to just buy one set, this set allows for hour of fun just by itself. I already have one of these, and hopefully will be getting a second.	positive
This was my first set from the new line, so I'm rather partial to it. I'm glad to see it get such high praise. It's quite the lovely little Halloween-y set. I wonder if TheBrickster could modify this for his WW Grave Stone MOCs? (Hint, hint, hintedy, hint, hint. ) Edited by Pirates Forever, 13 June 2009 - 02:02 AM.	neutral
Yaaaay! This set is outstanding! It was first set I have bought for pieces! Seriously! If you like skellies its mustbuy for you!	positive
Great review! This is my 2nd favorite lego castle set (tied with Skeleton Tower) that I own. My first favorite is Drawbridge Deffense.	positive
Great review, Erdbeereis1 this really is a fantasic set. let's hope Lego makes more sets like these (with 5 minifigs+4 horses at a price of $19.99? ) actually, it's about RM200 here. and it's not even price-to-piece count. anyways, amazing review, ad if i could get more Castle sets this year, i might even join the Reviewer's Academy	positive
Great Review Erdbeereis This is a cool set! Pics are Great! Love that shot of the lightsabers! Well done! CommanderFox	positive

I voted outstanding, because i think this is the best cement mixer TLG ever made, also love the 6-stud wide based vehicles, as you mentioned. I both bought and sold it again this year, and i already regret it, but i had to sell some stuff because of a loss of space	positive
Lovely review, really. But the sad fact is we've seen it before, twice. http://www.eurobrick...showtopic=20293	positive
A great review of a very good set, I must echo KimT though (I seem to be doing it an awful lot) it would be improved by the addition of one more fig to the set, as it’s the same price band as last years catapult.	positive
I've skipped a few lunches on behalf of this set. It's a great army builder, but so are many of the new castle sets. What makes this great in my opinion is the figs - 2 orcs and 1 dwarf - what else could one want?

INDEXED Going through the boards I was amazed to find out that no one ever attempted to review one of the best Lego classics, the 6399 Airport Shuttle. While I was studying for exams a few weeks back I decided to take a break, built the monorail and take some pictures of it. Resulting in the present review. Along with this I made my first ever poll. Here we go: First, some data: Setnumber: 6399 Setname: Airport Shuttle Released in: 1990 in Holland, though Bricklink says 1991 Number of parts: 731 Number of figs: 9 Price: unknown, prices on Bricklink vary from $261 up to $2300 (!) but this was an expensive set even in the nineties The box: Mine is a bit battered by the owner before me, but there's still plenty to see. This is one of the largest boxes I have (look at the minifig in the down-right corner for the comparision) and it is a really neat storing facility for many sets. The box shows the set, and in the background the silhouet of the set that is to accompany this one: the airport from 1990. I like the angle of the box, showing the two stations, track and train in one picture. The back of the box shows some really nice ideas for other setups, why oh why has Lego abandonned this kind of showing what's possible with one set...? Inside flap of the box, showing details of the set and the functions, Detail on the front of the box, displaying the dimensions, it really is a huge track layout for one set! The instructions: there is a nice little booklet showing the same picture as the box art with the figures lined up underneath. The last page nicely folds out to show the entire setup of the tracks, The figures: A brilliant selection of minifigs including airport people and a cook. All figures that are supposed to go on the shuttle carry a ticket and there are also some suitcases (tickets fit inside, of course) Station # 1: The set includes two stations. Here is the first, depicting the airport. There are lots of details: a phonebooth, two seats, some flowers, a map, luggagelockers and of course the streetlights. A detailed shot of the station showing the luggagelockers and ticket-validating machine, Part of the beauty of this set is the fact that it is so extremely detailed, just look at the signs to show where to go next (stickers), and the scenery opposite the street... The station has the same shape as the Airport Shuttle logo, how sweet is that? The station pictured as part of the layout. The stations ends are made with airplane wings to smoothen the arrival of the shuttle. Station # 2: Here is the second station, my personal favorite: An elevated stop with a little snackbar underneath and stairs leading to the platform. Some chairs and streetlights here as well plus two old fashioned trees, The part of the set that can be used in any layout: the snackbar with hamburger sign (sticker). Yes, those hamburgers look tasty indeed! Also notice the lights hanging from the platform overhead and the ticket-validating machine at the bottom of the stairs. Here we have the platform with information panels and seats. Also notice the two trafficlights for the train. Here's how it works: the train will travel in the direction the arrow is pointing. When turning the knob the two grey blocks will move towards or away from the track-center, activating a button on the centerpiece of the train (the motor) which makes the train start it's journey around the track. There is only one speed and the train can only be put to a stop or change direction at stations. The station as part of the layout. The Shuttle: Now on with the train: There are two carrriages connected to a centered motor. the power is provided by means of a batterybox containing a 9v battery. The batterybox is in one of the carriages and displays: Airport Shuttle. A total of five passengers can be seated inside leaving room for their luggage and two drivers. The front carriage with the button for the batterybox showing. The underside showing the gearwheel (metal) that brings the power from the motor onto the geared track. The black pointy things alongside the gear-wheel react with the direction knobs at stations. This is how the shuttle negociates with height differences, everything hinges and rotates, making the shuttle capable of performing steep climbs. The motor is powerful enough to not slow down at such a climb! Detailed shot, showing the first set of covered wheels in hinged position. The shuttle on the layout. The full layout: This layout is quite huge, involving lots of track pieces, ramps, ten large stanchion-poles and the two stations. To show the movement of the shuttle I have made a 20 second movie, which can be seen in My Brickshelf gallery of this set. Conclusion: Well, to conclude the review, some final thoughts: This truly is one of the more detailed sets around (at least from the nineties) and one of the largest in dimensions. The monorail system is cleverly thought out and works excellent. Track extensions are hard to get however and very expensive nowdays (especially the switchpoints and long straight track pieces). The tracks included with this set will provide you with hours of fun though, because there are a lot of them. It can be quite hard to incorporate the monorail in your town without having a clearly-based-on-the-monorail-alone town. I tried to incorporate it some years ago (link here), posing a real challenge. The Ratings: Price: 8/10: this is an expensive set, if you can get it for under $200 get it!), this set is rare in any condition. Parts: 10/10: lots of rare pieces, cool minifigs, 9v system, roadplates, lots of minifigseats en red trainwindows. Originality: 10/10: there are very few monorails released, this one being the only town set. Compatibility: 8/10: can be a bit hard to incorporate in a town, but hey: you got the monorail so no complaining here! Total: 36/40: I can only reccommend this set to anyone, It is my personal favorite set upto this present time! If there are any questions, ask them, all comments are welcome of course!	positive
You chose the perfect set for your first poll, Simon! No question this set is one of the all-time-beauties. I rated outstanding of course. I never hat the chance to get a complete copy of this set, but I do own the engine and quite a bunch of monorail tracks. Your very detailed review made me think of getting the whole set some day. Thank you very much for this! I never realized there were so many details included to this set: The snackbar and the telephone cell and all the other nice things. Really strange for a nineties set which often lacked details. The only thing that comes to my mind right now is that the engine looks quite blocky. If the set was released today, TLC would use more of those parts which make a better design imo. And it would fit better to the curved walls of the stations as well. [wishful thinking]How much would I love to see the monorail system back again! [/wishful thinking] I had to lough when reading your comment on the minifig seats. Don?t you own many of those? I don?t know where to put mine...	positive
This is an outstanding review which deserved to be featured here! After seeing this set, it prompts me to own this set, and match with my 10159 LEGEND City Airport. It's very nice to see such outstanding set being reviewed and presented to our very screens. Everything about this set is simply outstanding. I can't imagine that such incredible set actually released before. Why don't they ever continue with this anymore? Sigh, it's nice to see so much detailed from its shuttle, snack bar, stairs, waiting platform, validating machine and etc. This is an instant "5" set! If given a chance to own a MISB set, I will defintely seriously consider about it.	positive
Yes, this is one of the best town sets ever.	positive
Who was the one who rated it "above average"?	positive
An aweome review of an Outstanding set.	positive
Sets like this just don't come around too often do they... I didn't realize exactly how much detail really was in this set. TLC should bring back the monorail! Great review of an amazing classic town set!	positive

I can't help it, but to notice that both of you placed thumbs up, and immediately it struck me with that thought.	positive
This remains the definitive city set in my eyes. I never managed to get one but from the instructions it seems to be perfect in just about every way. I got the two space monorails a while ago but the much higher prices on this one have kept it out my reach. This set is a lot bigger than either of those though. I always liked the monorail system a bit better than the trains because you could easily incorporate height into the tracks and spread them out in all three dimensions. Quote Edit: And bricklink is wrong giving 1991 as the release date. You're right; it was 1990. It was apparently released in 1990 in Europe and 1991 in North America, going by some US and German catalogs I have from that time period. Edited by CP5670, 06 September 2008 - 06:06 AM.	positive

very nice review indeed. B.t.w. a lot of children just love this set. One year we had it with us to LEGOworld and children asked a lot of questions about it.	positive
*gasp* BLASPHEMY! Someone voted this set "Below average". *Brings out hunting rifle* Ahem, back on topic; I remember wanting this set badly, for years. And I still want it, just no as much, because it's expensive and, as this review proves, takes up a lot of room. I've already got my trains to think about, and I won't be getting this set anytime soon. I also have a faint memory of this set being featured in one of LEGO's advertisements, more specifically someone narrowly missing it, hitches a ride, races the monorail to the airport and catches the plane. I am yet to find it on the net, as old LEGO adverts are hard to come by, especially the european ones. Now, to more important matters... *starts hunting* Edited by Freddie, 07 September 2008 - 10:03 PM.	positive
Good Review, who voted this below average??? I own one and managed to pick it up off ebay a few years ago now with the track expansion pack for £150, in very good condition So glad I did, an all time classic	positive

Yeah its very nice along with all the older sets. I've got the Cement Mixer that was released around about the same time as this.	positive
Thanks for the review. Like many such town sets, I would characterise it as cute. Contrasting it to the new bin lorry, it's nice that this set has two minfigs (more realistic) and two bins. Those bins are a great addition to Lego, although wheelie bins would be nice now (need some kind of 2x2 container you can clip a plate onto as a hinging lid, and clip mini-wheels under the back two studs). Having two minifigs is a superior point for this earlier Lego rendition of a bin lorry. In fact, even though our bins are now emptied by a private company rather than the local council (as was the case up till the mid 90s), and of course for the last two decades there have been wheelie-bins, bin lorries have three guys - the driver and two collectors. However, our bin collectors for sure don't use a broom or shovel! Indeed on occasion they've befouled the street themselves if something goes wrong with hoisting the bin on the mechanism! The shape of the lorry in the set is still quite accurate, pretty good for a four-wide vehicle (I must admit to preferring the newer vehicles).	positive
Thanks so much for the great review, I love that truck! I hadn't realized there was a real 4-wide recycle truck out there. I must get it one day to replace this abomination currently doing garbage duty in my town: I think that truck has seven pieces total in it. I do like the blue color though ...	positive

I own this set however, because it was really cool those days, nowadays all trucks nd cars can do neat things, but that wasnt so back then.	positive
Greetings! Just looking through the review index when I came across this one. I recently acquired this set through ebay which came with a practically perfect box and instructions. I would almost say that no one played with it much as all of the parts were brand new. Anyway, I just wanted to say that this is a great set that was worth the $14.99!	positive
Great to find this review of a classic set and it's far better than any yuk set from 1997 OMG what were they thinking ! I prefer the six wide for trucks, but for the 80's it was perfect and even today still holds it's own !	positive
I did not see this! Nice review and beautiful truck. I like it!	positive
Nice set, but nicer review! Looks like the set has quite some nice parts.	positive

Name: Jetport Fire Squad Set No.: 6440 Theme: LEGO System / Town Year: 1991 Pieces: 84 Minifigs: 2 Price: USD 27.50$ (which equals about EUR 19,26€ and GBP 15,57£) Introduction: One of the sets that especially my cousin likes is this one. One time at the Dutch LEGOWorld event we had three of those there with flashing lights and loud sirens trying to put out the fire that was caused by the crash of again some LEGO aircraft. We never had this set before our drak ages and the sets probably came from ebay or so. In my opinion the newest Airport rescue is nice too but in the conclusion I will make some additional remarks about that. Just imagine what it would be like for your LEGO town if the pilot of one of your smaller planes, just couldn't stop before the end of the runway. Here you see the disaster that happened some day in our town: Fortunately all passengers got out safely thanks to our brave fire fighters. This magnificent truck was used to help putting out the fierce fire caused by the aviation gas from the small plane. The set includes two firefighters in distinguishable airport uniforms. In order to be able to safe the passengers and go for a quick intervention, our brave firemen have an axe for each of them, airtanks and a portable fire extinguisher. Here you see the truck on the right side. The large spout on the roof really makes it a remarkable truck. As you can see, behind the red door, there is space for the airtank of our brave firemen, at the right there is also place for the small hand held extinguisher. The left side of the truck has a water hose instead. For a truck from 1991 there is quite some room inside. Actually both firemen fit inside. Unfortunately there is only one seat. At the back there are two clips for the axes. There you can also find the main switch for the light and sound system. As you can see, the red flashing lights, do their job quite well. The sirene is just behind the bar with the flashing lights. The main spout just seems to begin emitting water. The front of the truck. For some reason there are two hidden spouts there as well. What their purpose is seems unclear but they look nice. KimT suggests that it is for foaming the runway and that is a real option of course. This set can be found on: Peeron Lugnet Brickset Bricklink entries Playability: 8/10 (Very nice set, details that are movable and of course the light and sound) Design: 8/10 (nice sets with nice details, but could have even been better: seat for 2nd fireman missing, no oxigen masks and only one airtank) Price: 7/10 (For a light and sound set and two firefighters, the price is reasonable I would say.) Overall: 8/10 (nice sets, some details could even be better, too bad that there is only a five to choose from a sticker when you have more than one truck) Last but not least an overview of the complete set including instructions. "Fire mastered" as the Dutch firefighters will say when they have completed their job. We have also bought the newer airport rescue truck (7891). However we think this 6440 one is much better. The light and sound, all the nice features and the nice details are much better than the new truck. Edited by JopieK, 11 September 2008 - 10:25 AM.	positive
I owned it and loved it when I was young ^^ I really miss it.	neutral
A very robust set. The fact that it seats two figs plus has L&S makes it a unique set. I definitely liked the big airport subtheme TLG created in the early 1990s.	neutral
JopieK, I enjoyed this review very much! Your first picture, certainly capture the essence of this lovely set. In reality, I am in the Aviation line, especially aviation safety. Therefore, you re-entact the scene very well. To be honest, I have never seen this set before. This AES (Airport Emergency Service) Fire Truck is certainly unbelievable. I love it very much. It's a pity I never owned this. This is a set which give me a "5". Great job JopieK. I enjoyed viewing your classic town reviews very much. Keep up the good work!	positive
Perfect Perhaps the front sprouses are for foaming the runway? You've certainly kept that set in near mint condition, haven't you? Now all we can wish for is a new firetruck combining this L&S version and the new	neutral

Name: Cargomaster crane Set No.: 6352 @ Peeron.com Theme: LEGO System / Town Year: 1991 Pieces: 133 Minifigs: 1 Price: USD $26.00 / GBP unknown / EUR €19,95 Aargh stupid tree! for more than fourty years this 'megabrick' has tormented our town! we need some help! Long before my dark ages LEGO released this relatively small set. since they didn't have a construction site like nowadays, they released these small road-works. I was only six years old and really into small sets since my ADHD didn't allow me to sit and build for long periods of time. So these smaller sets were ideal for me. The instruction booklet. The complete set. The set itself is not really a surprise to set up and play with. First you'll build the smaller parts of the set like the container and the small verhicle. No real surprises there, except for the smaller car that fits perfectly in the cargo container. Just pull off the seat and steering wheel, and the car just fits. The crane itself is just as easy to build as the smaller parts. just place bricks on top of eachother. Although you'll still have the wire to connect and pull through a diversity of bricks and plates. The carco container and small car. Being out of my dark ages really tunnelled my vision toward bigger sets and completing my town. This set really comes in handy if i need construction or traffic workers in my town, I can just MOC a few containers for tearing down trees, fixing traffic lights, and so on. Behold the mighty cargomaster crane! It's pretty easy to say that a set as simplistic as this one is not much fun to play with. However if you see the bigger potential in your town this one could be of great value to any city. Playability: 7/10 (with only one container it gets a bit boring) Design: 9/10 (it's small, and fits perfectly) Price: 7/10 (Average, but not really cheap.) Overall: 7.7/10 (a nice overall set if you're building on minifig scale) Gimme my pizza!

Information Name: Fire Control Center Set No.: 4953 @ Peeron.com Theme: LEGO, Legoland Year: 1991 Pieces: 516 Minifigs: 4 Price: USD $85.00 / GBP unknown / EUR unknown Bricklink search results Brickset Lugnet Introduction This week I got the flu. so since I have to stay home and get better, I might as well make a review. It's one of the most amazing older city sets, thus making it a really valuable review. This is the story about four handsome firemen living in one of the most amazing city structures out there. The 6389 Fire control center. The box I actually didn't remember the box to be that small. (Borrowed from Peeron) The four hunky firemen Oh jeah what women doesn't like a man in a uniform The manual Even the manual is aging... but then again it's 17 years old! Review As you all know a city must have some standard civil services, like a hospital and a police station. A fire house also is a must for any lego city. This particular fire house is one of the most amazing sets ever to be released. In this cool set you get 4 minifigs, all fire fighters, two verhicles, and a helicopter Firefighters have to move around The futuristic fire truck is definately my favourite! Chief's car The smallest verhicle of the set, it's a small all-terrain jeep for the fire chief. pretty much a standard car in those days. a real simple layout, and a trunk which holds a small fire hose. It's lucky to be in this set, because it complements the whole thing The car Luckily it's red and it has de cool signs on the side. Helicopter Another great addition to the whole set is the helicopter. Again in a basic setup for that kind of verhicle at the time. This one has the nice addition of two hoses to put out the fires raging in lego city. The chopper No, it doesn't really fly Really cool fire truck thingy This fire truck is definately the best of the verhicles in this set. It's actually a futuristic model of fire trucks. I haven't seen any other fire truck like this. I saw a police truck like it though. but we're talking fire fighters right? Actually the whole thing han open up to reveal a number of fire fighting appliances such as a hose, a computer, and a oxygen tank. The fire truck click for bigger version! The main building actually looks kinda empty when the trucks and chopper are gone. However, this still is realistic compared to a real fire house. Also the front has those amazing sliding doors, which make this thing really look cool and clean. Off to fight a fire Main structure, with the slinding doors pulled down Actually those sliding doors are also the hard part of the model. Since all the bricks must be perfectly aligned, or else the doors will stutter. But if you're a little familiar with lego then you don't need to worry. From the back Enough room to play with I'm going to give my perspectives on each of the sides On the left we have the garage for the bigger fire truck. The only real flaw about this set is that this garage isn't long enough for the fire truck. This could have been solved by making it two or three studs longer. Notice the cool sunroof! In the middle we have the chief's office. complete with coffee machine, a diversity of computers, and a tape recorder, most likely to tape any incoming calls. A lot of details are crammed up in there. just like in the rest of the set. To the right is the helicopter platform. I really like the grey-blue-yellow of the platform because it doesn't look so red anymore. Don't get me wrong, red is a cool color, but not too much red! And the helicopter actually fits, and stays in place during playtime. The baseplate filled up This picture says it all. Again the four lego hunks are greeting all the ladies The minifigs are from a classic series, this happens with more of my lego sets. Bottom line is that this set is one of the best fire houses lego created. Verdict The build is pretty easy but takes a while to really see where you are with your building. It's nice to have a hospital from the same era, this create a more uniform look to your city. once you completed the model your baseplate is pretty filled up but still has a lot of opportunities. Playability: 10/10 (cool trucks, a chopper, and sliding doors, nuff said!) Design: 9/10 (insanely good design) Price: 10/10 (couldn't get better than this) Overall: 9.6/10 with a score like that one can only say... get one... NOW! Time to go home The trucks and chopper back on their rightful spots	positive
I have this one. The newer 6571 station is better in some ways, but I always liked the big airport-style fire engine in this and the windows covering the garages. One mod project I have in mind is to expand the base, adding a second room in the area beneath the control center. Interestingly, this set had two different box pictures. There was the original 1989 yellow Legoland box and a 1991 blue System box, and the blue box has the vehicles in different places. Quote Price: USD $85.00 / GBP unknown / EUR unknown If this is referring to the original price, it wasn't that much. $50 is more like it.	neutral
This set looks real nice, but a Wall in the middle with a stair and a few desks/containers.	neutral
I think the 6382 Fire Station is the better one from the 80ies.	neutral

I agree, have that 6382 set for about 27 years now, but I have always like that one 'futuristic' truck when I was a child so I also still have some feelings for this set as well. @Crazydance: nice review after all!!!	positive

It doesn't have a chopper like this set and the fire engine is not as flash. It does have a downstairs in the building though (at least a door and a front wall anyway!). It's nice to see a review of this set as it's one that I often looked at in the catalogue and thought of getting but never did. It's great to see the details that I otherwise would not have seen. I don't like the firemen with hair though! They should have helmets or caps IMHO! Thanks for the review! Cheers Rog	positive
From memory Argos sold it originally for about £21 GBP. I seem to remember this as I could not afford the airport released the same year as this was about £29.99! Seems such a small amount of money now, Now have 2 copies of this set, only 1 boxed :-)	positive
Found this set on a flea Market in Munich, yesterday. Just 25 years after its release. The instructions for a total of five models, two of them printed, the other 3 are just photo instructions in the book. It still has the box in good shape, despite some wear from the age. Sadly five little pieces were missing, and 5 wrong pieces inside instead (2 complete wheels and a classic 80s-90s plane wing (dumped into my bricks). But I was able to replace the missing Minifig torch and the 4 missing plates with identical pieces from my collection. The Box and Contents The set still has the original box. Inside the pieces, plastic insert, instructions and a 1987 Technic catalogue, imagine that set livespan today. Four years and the 8841 is still in the catalogue. Classic technic design from early 80s showing a function drawing of the Steering and the main model A small set, but with a flap shoeing the contents. All pieces in the inner box and the papers included. 5th Model: Soapbox Racer This is more or less a soapbox racer with working steering, but no engine. It's got a rather blocky design, but still looks sleek enough and is a simple build little over 100 pcs out of 180. The Soapbox at step 2 Just included the steering at step 6 Completed and ready to race downhill. Total: 7/10 Simple, but effective 4th Model: Simple Chassis very simple and boring alternate using just 1/3 of the 180 pieces in the set. It even hasn't got a seat construction. It's just a plain steering mechanism attached on wheels with a spartan chassis of just a few pieces. This is the whole model at step 5 Just attach the steering mechanism and wheels and you're done Total: The worst alternate model of the complete set. Just a boring 4/10 3rd Model: Balance Very original small model. It's a small model of a working classic Balance. And it works with small parts laid on the scales, altough they've got just a 4x4 Footprint. IT's a fast build. just 15 minutes and you've done it. The model as it looks at step 3 Finished. Easy build with just 63pcs out of 180 Total: Very original model, it actually works with small weights, but a very simple build. Still a 7/10 Alternate Model: Tractor with equipment This is the second model. It's a simple but boxy design featuring a harrow and a plough. The tractor has a similar design to the very first tractor set, but much smaller. The plough is about 24-wide and the harrow is completely SNOTTED even back in 1983. Has two functions: Working steering and the coupler for the equipment. Uses almost all pieces of the set. The tractor at step 8, the steering isn't completely attached now This is the completed tractor The complete harrow Finished alternate with the plough attached. Total: Nice, but quite ugly and boxy design for a tractor with 4 wheels of the same size. Takes me to a 6/10 Main Model: Desert Racer This is the main model, with a nice (for early 80s) but boxy design. It has two functions. Steering and a working 1-cylinder rear engine, which is of the old 2x2 piston type, since the small piston design wasn't invented back then. This is the only model of the set, which has piece callouts in the instructions. The printed alternate model has no callouts, they weren't invented on both models back in 1983. The three smaller photo instruction alternates have a piece callout at the beginning showing all needed pieces. The seat is a nice, but blocky design and use a primitive SNOT technique. This is the model at step five. The piston is already attached. Imagine this state on step 5 in modern sets. Back then LEGO had challenging instructions, not the step madness like today This is the engine just made of plates with a hole in the middle for the piston Step 9. The piston engine is completed. On step 12 the roll bar and the seat are installed. Only the steering isn't completed yet. Front view of the finished model. Just 15 steps needed back then. Bird's eye view of the whole set Displayed on the box Model Verdict: Nice design, especially the colorful seat in SNOT technique, but quite boxy especially the engine, since there were only the huge pistons. Still a 9/10 Set Verdict: Design and Models: 7/10, very boxy designs, due to the age. The chassis alternate sucks Build: 9/10 Classic 80s technic building. Quite challenging but fun Sturdyness: 7/10: rear section damaged after the table fall, but rather easily fixed Fun: 9/10 Blast from the past. Overall: 8/10 mfg Widdi Edited by Widdi, 07 September 2008 - 04:11 PM.	positive
CP5670, on Sep 7 2008, 05:25 PM, said: Nice classic set. Are those hoses around the engine pneumatic tubes? That Technic catalog looks interesting too. I have the catalogs for the next several years but not that one. The most extreme example of this was the engine step in the 8865 set, which uses over 120 pieces by itself. The pneumatic tubes are listed seperately under x188. The classic hose is x467. I think they're just the same with just a single difference: The x467 seemed to be already cut in lenght instead of x188 which must be cut in lenght. mFg Widdi	positive
Name: Electric Passenger Train Set No.: 7725 Theme: LEGO / SYSTEM / Trains / 12v / Train Set Year: 1981 Pieces: 485 Minifigs: 1 Price: USD 70.00$ (which equals about EUR 50€ and GBP 40£) Introduction: Our most favorite theme is 12V trains. Actually I got my first 77-series back in 1981 (5th of December, I was 2,5 years old) just a week before my brother was born. Some years later I got the 7740. After our Dark ages we (my brother, cousin and myself) got all 12V trains at least once. This 7725 was gathering dust in my brothers' room. The train in all its splendor. As you can see it doesn't occur at the back of the 12V era train instructions although its larger brother the 7740 does. Some investigation learned that all the sets at the back of the instructions date from 1980 so the 7725 wasn't released yet. Here you can see the front of the 7725 with the driver in the cockpit. The driver is in fact the only minifig that was included in the set. As you can see, our version of the train has a different front than the one in the instructions. Apparently the former owner used 7861 (Lighting Set (12 V)) to upgrade the train with working back- and frontlights. I like the original lights but didn't notice that the train had those double lights until I did the review. Maybe we will give the train again it's original signs and put custom LEDs in it or so so that the train can drive into two directions with accurately working lights. Another thing about the lights that puzzle me are the Backlights. While typing this I realise that the former owner might have added those, so let's have a look at the instructions then. As it turns out, the lights are there also in the instructions. I recently learned that only the last car or coach of a train has it's red lights on. So unless the train drives with only the front car it will never use those red backlights. Here you can see the cockpit with the engineer. The cables don't look very pretty but well, the train at least has working light. Here you can take a look at the inside of the engine car. While the 7745 has a nice 'fake engine' there, just the weight bricks and the ugly cables, apart from the engineer and his cockpit, no other nice features here. B.t.w. LEGO always used tiles in such a trains to make it easier for kids to take off the roof and have access to the minifig passengers etc. Here the 'proof' that it is an electric train. The pantograph of the front car. It has the same kind of panthographs that the 7745 has. The middle car has 4 chairs. As you can see, some vandal must have nocked over this one. Hope they leave the cables alone. This early morning train seems to have one passenger: a workman. I like the small 2x3 windows from this car very much! They give this care a nice look. Also the door in the middle adds something special to the train. As far as I know, no other passenger train has the doors in the middle. Here you see the side of the train, just after the train has left Brickingham Station where the worker, probably from set 6647 (Highway Repair) that was also released in 1980. A closeup of the last car with steering stand to allow the train to travel back and forth without having to 'make head', in other words: putting the engine in front again. The train, shunted to an end track so it can be cleaned (I think it is apparent that it definitely needs cleaning very badly). This set can be found on: Peeron Lugnet Brickset Bricklink entries Playability: 5/10 (The train is fine, but with only one minifig not very playable without other sets; also no accessories at all!) Design: 7/10 (Nice train, the inside could have been a lot better, but I really like to original front lights!) Price: 7/10 (the train came with motor so not a bad price, goes now for quite some money at eBay.) Overall: 6.5/10 (nice set but the 7745 is a better train I'm sure) Well that was it for today. I hope you have enjoyed this review and got tears in your eyes seeing how nice the 12V era was... It never comes back, but maybe LEGO rereleases some of this sets in the 2009+ train era (very likely that this is just wishful thinking). Edited by JopieK, 12 September 2008 - 04:56 PM.	neutral
A very nice review, JopieK! You know, I was wondering how LEGO could justify having two 12V-powered passenger trains at the same time, but after reading the review, and seeing the lack of figures and accessories, I guess I understand why (plus the train is rather compact). Oh, and I can't help but think that the chairs in the middle carriage are somewhat oddly placed, because those placed next to the door are unusable because the door takes up room needed for figs' arms. Also, it appears that your set also has the newer couplers, i.e. there's no hooks for the decoupling rail to grab hold of. With the light assembly it really won't matter, play-wise, or if you don't have any decouplers, but it's still a bit of a bummer.	positive

The chair was just loose so it should be placed on the 2x2 plate that is also visible in the picture of the middle car. B.t.w. the front magnet is the old type. I have some decouplers but we don't use them because they are not really that reliable. LEGO just release a whole line of trains at the same time. I just discussed with my parents and they told be LEGO had those sets longer in store back then. I must have gotten the 7745 somewhere in 1983 or even 1984 although it was released in 1981. I started of with the 7710 (push along train) and then upgraded the tracks with current rails when I got the 7745.	positive

The best 12v legotrain is for me the 7740. The 7725 is still a goodlooking train and the only one with short wagons in a electric version. Before I started to with bricklink, I started to build this train in blue. I've build 4 trains of it and sold 2 of them. Still one for sale . You can also build this in other colors, like a yellow one: Or you can build a black version, which I made a death train of it. Driven by a skeleton .

Beach Cruisers Set #: 6445 Theme: Island Xtreme Stunts Year Released: 2002 Piece Count: 97 Minifigs: 2 List Price: $7 (USD) During a trip to Legoland California in 2002, their Big Store had a neat little display of some new sets and themes including Island Xtreme Stunts. The new theme offered great colors including orange, tan, and light blue; which immediately caught my eye. The theme focussed on island fun with some adventure, and included some great figs like the Brickster. I had to buy at least one set choosing Truck & Stunts Trike (review coming soon) at the time. The theme was short lived and many of the sets were on sale at discount toy stores not too long after their initial release. I picked up this set, 6445 Beach Cruisers for $3.33 (USD), which will be my first of three Island Xtreme Stunt reviews. Starting with the box, a race between the Street Surfer and Skate Boarder: The back shows some alternate models including a sail boat and jet ski: Same image on the instructions as the box: But the backside shows the Island Xtreme Stunts video game for different platforms: The set includes a small decal sheet for the skateboard: I love the two figs included within this set. One is a "hippie-type" with shades and leafed muscle short, and the other "Pizza Boy" skateboarder. Check out the "Pizza Boy" on his skateboard: Two green brackets are included for attaching each fig to the long grey bar. Using this piece, one can make the skateboarder do tricks and flips. The "street surfer" vehicle is pretty nice to: The sail is placed on a black bar and lance, then attached to the vehicle: Here's a picture of the vehicle. To me, it has that old "soap box derby" look to it - like something kids would create to race down a hill: The vehicle doesn't have a steering wheel, but rather two levers which I think work well in the cockpit: Here's the underside: The set has three neon orange wheels that attach to technic axle pins to attach to the vehicle: Lastly, the entire set with a few extra pieces: Final Thoughts While Island Xtreme Stunts is not the best City/Town sub-theme, esp. for the traditional Lego Classic Town fan, it does have some fun sets like this little beach cruiser. Good figs, a skateboard, and a very "rollable" (fun word equivalent to "swooshable" but for vehicles with wheels), vehicle. You can even blow on the sail to get it to roll across the floor. This set is a lot of FUN!	neutral
I had never seen these sets before in my retail stores before. However, I do remember the existence of its video games. Look like an interesting set for great outdoor enterainment and fun for LEGO citizens whom is out for real thrill and excitement. This theme never really got me excited back then. After reading your review, it's quite useful for some new addition to your town features, such as including a skater boy, holding the pizza instead of using the pizza van. The high fuel cost must have caught up to them, to resort using skate board for delivery. As for the street surfer vehicle, it's a cool looking vehicle with unique construction. Pardon me, I have not seen such design before. I will actually tear off the wheels, cover up the sides and used it for wind surfing! That's the whole idea. After giving some thoughts and weighs its factors, I will have to give it a "3" for this set. I will probably get it if its on sales. Once again, Brickster this is a lovely review which has showed us a new perspective of Island Xtreme Stunts.	neutral
Like WhiteFang I too only remember this line in computer game form. I used to love that game! I actually have never seen a review for an xtreme stunts set, so this was nice to see. As for the set, I think it looks pretty good. I really like the hippie guy. The windboard thing is nice as well, but looks a bit strange somehow. I give this set a solid 3 out of 5. Thanks for the nice review! Edited by Erdbeereis1, 08 September 2008 - 04:05 AM.	positive
Her name was Sky Lane. It's quite sad, though, to actually play the game--the "Xtreme Tower" is the only set that made it into the game itself, and it was a really watered down version of the Information Center from the first two games. But the island was, in the game, filled with incredible buildings that would have made really cool sets.	negative
Air Chase Woosh! The Brickster's seaplane flies over the beach quickly. Hippie Dude is in close pursuit on his hang glider. Fuel is running out for the Brickster's plane. Can Hippie Dude catch him before he either gets away or crash lands in the water... You decide, with Island Xtreme Stunts Air Chase. Set #: 6735 Theme: Island Xtreme Stunts Year Released: 2002 Piece Count: 83 Minifigs: 2 List Price: $10 (USD) A nice addition to the Island Xtreme Stunts theme, Air Chase includes two air vehicles; a seaplane and hang glider. The set has nice Island colors inclusing white, light blue, and orange. Also includes in the set are some great chrome pieces for the Brickster's airplane wings. Starting with the box. You can see Hippie Dude in close pursuit: The back of the box depicts some nice alternate jet skis: Same front box picture on the instructions: And on the backside, pictures of the video game: Air Chase includes two nicely detailed figs, Hippie Dude (for lack of his official name), and the Brickster: Here's a picture of the orange hang-glider: And the underside: Unfortunately, the hang-glider is too heavy to be held up by a minigig. While I like the brick-built glider for the extra pieces, the plastic wing pieces from the Ninja theme would have worked effectively and be a lot lighter. I think the seaplane is the best part of the set: Here's a shot of the front end. I like the skeletal shark/fish design. What's great is none of the pieces use stickers. They are all printed: Including the tail end: Although the cockpit has no steering wheel or lever piece, it does have a very nice printed 1x2 tile: The wings of the airplane have hinges to allow them to fold inward slightly: Also notice the nice chrome/silver pieces. Here's a shot of the underside of the seaplane: And lastly, the complete set: Final Thoughts: Air Chase is another one of those "fun" Island sets. Two figs with two vehicles make a perfect combination for creating some dog-fights in the air. At the same time, the Brickster's plane can land in the water to explore other adventure play opportunities. This set is also a nice addition to the Island Xtreme Stunts Truck & Stunt Trikes (6739). The seaplane can be hauled by the large semi-truck included within 6739. Hope you enjoy this review.	neutral
Nice review. Is that one minifig breaking out of prison? (Just wondering about his clothing.) The worst thing is the name. Anything with Xtreme in the title almost deserves the lowest score possible on principle.	negative
Thanks for the review! I loved this theme, it had some of the greatest pieces ever arranged in any theme, brilliant printed parts and figures, and some good colours. Snap Lockitt (Hippie Dude ) is a great figure with a cool name, I own him from another set, but unfortunately not this one. It looks like a very good set, no stickers and good printed parts too. Nice review. Pencoin, on Sep 9 2008, 05:21 PM, said: Hippie dude? Thats Snap Lockitt, Island Xtreme is one of the best themes ever, Im trying to get the sets off Bricklink, thanks fo the review I need this now. Hahaha. That made me laugh for some reason...

It is not very often that I rate a Legoset 'poor' (it's the first time actually), but in this case I had no other option. The idea of this set is good, and I like the mostly yellow minifig, but the design of both the airplane (weird 'window'-piece, a propellor that is way too small, minimal skies underneath and a strange colourscheme) and the hangglider (two handlebars on the wings, too many colours) makes the set mark the essence of LEGO's downfall during those years. I really appreciate the fact that you made a review of this set, Brickster, it made me look into the details of 6735, but I am just as sure today as I was back then: I will never buy this. Anyway, thanks for the review, the quality of the set may be a disapointment your review certainly is not	negative
Hello all Eurobricks members and Town Lovers, Today, I will be doing up a review on Glade Runner set. This is a very small set which is slightly bigger than the current impulse set. It's part of the Race theme which involved in land and sea racers back in the early 1990s. I just love these orignal race themes which is produced back then. Name: Glade Runner Theme: LEGO System / Town / Race Year: 1993 Pieces: 29 Minifigs: 1 Price: USD$3.25 An image of a 6513, Glade Runner Swamp race shall begins This glade runner is pretty nice looking with its sleek sports look. Well, for a glade runner in the water, it certainly looks much impressive. Somehow, I felt that the 6513 is aligned with the 6514 Trail Ranger. I always had that perception that both vehicles are brothers and was released under the same year. In fact, Glade Runner was released in 1993 based on Peeron information. I always felt that this set is used for Investigators or Police to used for tracking or search purposes in the swamp areas instead of using it for a race. I will place this set in the jungle, somewhere like Brickster's jungle settings. Although it looks too bright for such serious agenda, but I think it's pretty useful to use it this way. They can rent it from the nearby shop and used it to search. It kind of reminded me of the movie, US Marshals which acted by Tommy Lee Jones and Wesley Snipes. Meet the ace Please pardon his trousers. I did not bleach it earlier. (It was caused overtime without adequate caring to the minfig. Look at this great article on how to protect your LEGO!) The driver wears a green vest with patch pockets on both sides. This is my favourite design during that period. It comes with a yellow lifevest too. As for the 1x4 printed tile with 3 stars shining in front of the runner, it's a very nice printed tile that can be used for other racing purposes in other sets as well. Overall design The built is very simple and yet so realistic. Making use of the aeroplane tailhead to add as the holder for the rotor is smart. The white bricks acting as a platform for both sides to hold the driver to sit onto the centre with the steering wheel at the front. I am very happy with this design. Place the glade runner in front of the fan with a reasonable fan speed. You will see the rotor runs like a charm. Different angles of the vehicle Close encounter with the "Swamp Sharks" coined by Brickster! See you later To conclude, this is a very nice little set that can provide much fun. I don't really used it to race in the waters. Instead, I leave it to my imagination and used it for police investigation purposes such as air crash excerise, search and rescue operations and etc. I think it can provides quite a fun loving experience. Although, the set might not be very appealing to some people, but I find it very fun to play around and is one of my favourite sets in the 1990s where I placed it with my 6514 Trail Ranger together. Summary review Playability: 8.5/10 (I leave it to your imagnination.) Design: 9/10 (Very simple yet realistic design.) Price: 10/10 (A very inexpensive set. Great way to buy such small sets at a low price.) Overall: 8.5/10 (Glade Runner is not common in Town and City theme. It's not a must to have it, but if you ever come across it. Do get it) I gave it a "4" based on my Review Score Card. What about yours? Hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine. Comments and Critics are strongly welcomed.

Thanks for the nice review WhiteFang! I quite like this set. The front looks a bit bare, but for a small set like this, it doesn't really matter. This set gets a 4 from me as well.	positive
Thanks Erdbeereis1 for your kind words. Glad you liked this set. Just wondering whom has rated poor and below average. I will like to know why you voted this way. Perhaps, you could share with me and the rest on your thoughts and views.	neutral
Nice Review White Fang. This really reminds me of an "All-American" set with its Red, White, and Blue Colors (and the white stars). Although I really like the fig with its scruffy bearded face, I find the green torso a bit odd for this set. I suppose I would expect some sort of red/blue racer fig with a white/blue racing helmet. Swamp Sharks - too funny! . You always add a nice addition of humor to your reviews. Now I'm going to check out some Wonder Woman clips on YouTube.	positive
I love the classic sets of that era and a great review helps show off the simplicity of some older sets.	positive
This is one of those sets that make me really want to start building up a city. It's a great value, has a lot of useful pieces, and is just plain fun to play with. I do miss vehicles having doors though. Great review. I was a bit curious as to how the dumping mechanism worked. As well as the sticker count.	positive
Yeah, the name on this set is strange. I think all the boxes say Garbage Truck. I guess it's up to each builder to decide whether 1x1 round plates are recyclable material or not. It's a great model in any case. I love these highly detailed city trucks we've been getting during the last year or two. I used to have a preference for the late 80s/early 90s city line but some of these new sets have really surpassed them in detail and functionality.	positive
Nice review. This is a very nice vehicle, one of my favorite of the newer city ones. JopieK: There are two generations of road plate that are wide enough for six-wide vehicles like this. The current plates are dark grey with plain white printing, and look not great in my opinion. The previous ones are imo the best road plates of all time - green with dark grey road, white dotted line/zebras, drain covers and yellow verge markings (just like we really have here in Ireland). For urban area I would still choose the green-edged plates and just cover up the green - the markings are so much better than the current plates.	neutral

I should have taken a better look at the one my brother has ;) It still is a nice truck, much better than all the strange sets that were release those 'dark ages' before.	positive
A good set, with a nice color scheme. I still prefer the last one that had a removable bin.	positive
What a great set and a very nice review Erdbeereis. I think the only improvement to this set would have been the use of chrome exhaust pipes and front grill. I bought this set with a lot of excitement, but unfortunately have not put it together yet. What are your thoughts on these larger 6-stud wide detailed vehicles as opposed to 4-stud wide classics? Here's an image of 6668 Recycle Truck released in 1992: PS. I like the use of "taking out" Sponge Bob in your review.	positive
This looks like a great set, and I'm happy you were dumping spongebob, he deserves that. This set looks very nice, and if I see it I will probably pick it up.	positive

Thanks for this review. I really love this set. It's perfect for my town, and brings a sense of "classic" when I see it.	positive
Thanks for the review! This is one of the few CITY sets that I own (despite loving the theme so much, most of my town is either custom or classic), and it's about as beautiful as a big garbage truck can ever be. Quote nice truck indeed, but the yellow one is better I think, at least if you put them on a roadplate it seems to me that those road plates are too small for that. Also it will not empty completely because of that panel. Well, for the rest it is a nice set and a fine review! Well, the truck BARELY fits onto the old roadplates (not on curves though), so if you put it in a display it probably won't look bad. I think from what I see, this and all the other 6 wide vehicles will fit much better on the newer roadplates, which are four studs wider than the old ones.	positive
Hi, I bought this set a while ago, and have since remodeled it into a larger 8 wide truck. Now it can hold a driver and passenger. Its kind of boxy, I may redesign it in the future.	neutral
That's a really nice mod badsneaker! The added bulk serves it well.	positive
I like this set, but I can't give it a good grade for playability, as the rearmost hinging section is too stiffly hinged, so when you open it, it's likely to break if you hold it just over the shovel and broom. My truck thus has that function, and with it of course the whole container tipping, disabled. I also moved the cab a bit forward and the front axle rearward to give the cab the typical garbage truck look, as they are often very low slung. This also created space behind the cab for some equipment.	negative

Nice review I REALY need to pick up this set! and the Cement Truck too!	positive
It would be cool if someone made a MOC in which hippies steal the truck and cover it with flowers and bright colors and stuff!	neutral
