306 lunar landing plates year released 1979 piece count 2 minifigs 0 list price unknown as part of the classic space collection lego offered two sets of moon plates one was a set of two crater plates and the other this very useful landing plate set not much to review but worth sharing a few images the landing plate and tplate the two plates connect to form this very nice classic space landing platform set 497 galaxy explorer included the landing platform but the one that i had was lighter in color than the one contained in this set at least the yellow circle future lego space sets could benefit by having similar road plates share your thoughts	neutral
these are my only space base plates from classic space actually with only 2 plates i could not do much serious expansion with it instead i merged it with my old city baseplates and used it as a docking station for scientific purposes or restricted facilities that is guarded by the police these baseplates are very useful and is suited for creating a space command center up in the space  	positive
these are pretty good but i think they look too much like the standard town roads from that period i like the black space plates from the early 90s better 6710	negative
first what i liked sooooo much was the cover of these plates with this large picture of a classic space scene i still have a 306 misb just to keep that nice feeling of taking it out of a plastic box and look at it there were different versions of the cover though second the markings of the landing platform changed at some point id have to check it later when im at home think it had something to do with the interupted yellow lines	negative
whitefang on jul 7 2008 1142 pm said actually with only 2 plates i could not do much serious expansion with it instead i merged it with my old city baseplates and used it as a docking station for scientific purposes or restricted facilities that is guarded by the police you make a very good point there ive used these plates to represent restricted areas and even as simple airport runways beyond their space uses i never liked the black plates they were during my dark ages anyway so ive never really seen one up close but i have seen them used in a death star display as suggested and it turned out fairly well	neutral
quote oh how i love these plates afew years ago i found a local retail store with about 67 sets of these in their basement warehouse i was given special access to along with many other old space goodies hehe i love the things i have loads and ive used them for multiple space bases and battles along with afew grey crater plates and the large grey plates 15x the size of a normal baseplate you can get quite a monorail layout going sigh i should really clean up and get one set up again so i can take some pictures wow nice you probably have enough to make that scene on the box picture i got one pack off ebay a while ago and have another octagon plate from the blacktron 6988 base im building my carrier moc around one but dont have anything planned for the others these baseplates are still relatively common on ebay for their age i see misb packs on there every few weeks and they tend to sell for around 20 the older kind in the op are much harder to come by edited by cp5670 09 july 2008  1018 pm	neutral
i also love these plates i build a lot with them eg this  unfortunately they are not available in bley 	neutral
lokix on jul 11 2008 0300 pm said by looking at the pictures used to display this set ive a sneaky suspicion it did not come with instructions but meant for the pictures to be ideas the whole set was suppose to teach children to use their imagination giving them instructions would somewhat defeat this while trying to figure how to build things from looking at pictures would be a much better educational experience but i dont wanna use my imagination	neutral
year released 1976 piece count 53 minifigs 2 lego brought out floating boats quite early and in many ways the first were the best ill explain why later this set in particular is interesting as it came out in two versions one that includes the first minifigs and another that included the nonarmless type set 709 the police signs are stickers and are in surprisingly good condition considering the age of the set i am missing one sticker on the front though note the technic bush and axel they are the old type the position of the second figure is not a mistake i think hes supposed to be sitting down the first boats out by lego needed a weighted keel to prevent them keeling over i have tested this i suspect this is because of the density of the old hulls and the flat bottom but i could be wrong it cant be just because of the flat bottom as the new cargo ship doesnt need one the keel in detail the bottom extension is for a motor not included nor made by lego at the time the keel had longer studs even now it holds extra firmly this is why i prefer the old design you can extend or shorten the hulls as you please or even insert other lego in the middle you can easily add wheels or any other piece to the bottom of these hulls i wish they would go back to this idea the 4 hulls were of this concept but were too wide probably so the keel wasnt needed the old minifigs aside from having odd feet and no arms had a normal stud as the neck thus when you turn the head it tends to come off i love this set	negative
great review sinner i own the later version 709 released in 1977 mine no longer has decals though the variations were minimal it looks like your boat is in really good shape considering its 30 years old excellent review	positive
hinckley on aug 1 2008 1041 am said how about these policemen are unarmed you give a guy a holiday he comes back a comedian its too obvious for my taste	negative
sinner on jul 31 2008 0743 pm said you give a guy a holiday he comes back a comedian its too obvious for my taste words hurt you know	negative
this set showed what potential variations on the standard brick had back then i think that tlg was still finding its legs back then and learning new things so this is a solid set for the year it was released nice review sinner	positive
thank you for the nice review sinner holodoc on aug 1 2008 0859 am said nice review sinner the old sets i donÂ´t know  every old set especially equipped with the old nonmoveable arms minifigs look very odd nowadays i agree with you with the hull shape and its possibility to be extended but every other aspect the lack of detail the keel itself you canÂ´t float it in shallow water keeps me from rating it higher than 310 in my opninion the best police boat so far is 4021 click to enlarge well if youre meaning really old sets than i agree with you but a lot of the sets from the very late 1970s and onwards are still very nice this set just isnt a good example thats all oh and i also agree with you about that police boat however the newer one in the city line is also great imo the only thing that weighs against it is the giant size which makes it feel awkward in more classic towns edited by grevious 03 august 2008  0630 pm	negative
well what to say i got this boat late 70s when we were on our way to italy to spend the holidays there my parents always needed to keep my quiet during the 3day trip and the best way to do that was to buy me a lego set i got this one in a gas station in germany as far as i remember italy didnt have lego sets so a gas station close to the italian border but still in germany or austria was very often their last chance i often saw large quantities of lego sets in those gas stations though i remember seeing yellow castle and the galaxy explorer standing on a shelf it would be my birthday 13 weeks later so i always made sure they knew what to buy for me	positive

so youve been bitten by the classic bug too sinner great review but one would think arms would come in handy pun intended when you are a police officer right its a shame that many of the original figs must now be forced to stand looking like they have their hands in their pockets eh i have no idea where i was going with that last sentence	neutral
nice review mariko this set is way past my time the baseplate is okay though i hate those dots the car is pretty cool too	positive
great review i never had this set but it looks nice i really like the checker pattern near the big window	positive
way before my time tooin fact this set came out twenty years before i was born the baseplate doesnt actually have dotsim not sure if they were there once and then rubbed off a possibility as the studs are rather smoother than i imagine they once were or if this particular one didnt have the dots this set also shows that the difficulty lego has in doing vehicle scale isnt new the house is the perfect size for microfigures from the lego games however the car is massiveover twice as tall as a microfig	neutral
image link from brickset i thought i would do a pic review of the 1st lego castle the yellow castle 375 released in 1978 first let me say that this set was truly ahead of its time it introduced new building concepts such as the hinge and new figs most were still the armless faceless minifigs during this time this set introduced me to castle which was my first real favorite theme i enjoyed breaking it out from the garage and building it again the majority of the pieces are 1x1 1x2 1x3 1x4 1x6 and 1x8 standard yellow bricks the set also includes yellow 1x4 1x6x2 and 1x8x2 arches yellow 2x2 2x3 and 2x4 bricks various grey plates 1x2 black inverted slopes red drawbridge pieces two classic red castle doors 8 hinges 2 for each corner and a few other nifty pieces including six red 1x1 windows a complete inventory is available at peeron 375 inventory a view from the front the drawbridge is 6x8 the front tower stands 12 13 bricks high plenty of room for horses the drawbridge does work the string originally black is attached to the opposite side between a plate and the arches the right side of the castle identical to the left ive always loved the 2x2x3 sloped bricks and corner pieces the back i love these red doors a 1x4 brick attached to the other side of the baseplate keeps intruders out that banner was the original sticker piece notice the wear the rear tower largest of the towers and backside two hinges at each of the corners allow the corners to open for playability before opening open lots of arches add to the detail of the inner walls inner front this set included 14 figs how about that for quantity unfortunately i peeled off worn stickers from the shields and the breast plates years ago the blue castle guards and knights are the keepers of the castle i still think that these helmets are the best lego ever made they just look good the black and white knights and the red knights ive always prefered to use the black and red guards and flags from the knights joust sets conclusion the yellow castle is truly a classic set and im so glad i kept the pieces to this together after all these years if you have a chance to buy one or even obtain the set instructions its worth building and wouldnt be difficult to substitute grey or other colors i hope you enjoyed this review and feel free to share your comments	positive
nice review i havent built yellow castle for many years but i do remember the fun i had building it when i was young yellow castle just opened up an entire new world for me also i liked all the alternate models on the box od wish i still had that	positive
theres two alternates on the back of the instructions and as i recall some sort of bridge on the inner fold or back of box i threw away the box to this set years ago just lucky to still have all the pieces with standard pieces you can build all these alternates and many more thats why i dont particularly care for the new castles like vladeks they make building so difficult and duplicate pieces are so limited heres an old shot of the castle in the city that it use to guard we played for hours back in these days	neutral
great review it is nice to see an indepth photo review of this set i especially love the last picture of your old city it certainly does bring back memories	positive
yup that is very very nicei wish i had been alive back then d well ill never have a chance to own something like this so this is as close ill get to it thanks for showing me the greatness	positive
question for you guys whats the best way to clean lego i was noticing that the baseplates and gray plates to this set are very dusty and could use a good cleaning mild soap water soak is there a better way	neutral

theme hobby sets set name harleydavidson 1000cc set number 394 price new 260280  185200 euro price used 14175  10125 euro pieces 143 year of release 1976 links peeron bricklink and brickset looking at the release date of this set makes me remember the good old times when lego sets stayed in production and could be found in stores for long years yes i hear you younger fols say this meant we had less variety at the time but at least we did not have to go on a frenzy to get them all in just 1 or 2 years before they disappeared to reappear on the secondary market at crazy prices anyway i also realise this set is older than me by 5 years at least the first boxes of this set i think my parents bought it when i was something like 12 year old or even before as my father really liked the hobby set line and took any chance to get one you know for the kids when theyâ€™ll be old enough to play with themâ€¦ i am really happy my father did it too as a matter of fact this has always been one of my favourite nonminifigure scale sets i know younger eyes will look on it and wonder how we could love and enjoy a model like this so blocky and rough just remember this was the best tlg designers could do with the bricks available at the time enough about memories letâ€™s start with the review the box front the front of the box here cut and folded to save space shows the harley davidson 1000cc in all its glory upon a nice town landscape i really appreciate how tlg box designers used a real life photo of the model in a real life environment to give this hobby set a better background moreover the landscape does not distract the eye even with its lights since the focus is strongly set on the motorbike itself back and sides the back of the box shows the model on a more neutral background and from another angle we can see the stickers in place take a good look at them here because i did not apply them the right side we also see a pic of the set from the front and one with a child playing with it in this latter shot the model rests upon a nice black box with a harley davidson sign on it i frankly do not remember if this was some sort of tray or smaller box within the lego one or if it is meant for publicity only another thing we can notice on the rightmost side of the box is a white band right below the lego logo sporting the sign â€˜designed for experienced lego buildersâ€™ in various languages all in all a really well done and professional job contents inside this set includes a number of parts in mainly black white and light grey some blue and yellow add nice touches of colour to the total the partsâ€™ selection is not mindblowing as most of the pieces had been in production in these same colours for years anyway iâ€™d like to focus on a couple of details the milky white technic axles as well as the red technic bush old 2 are among my favourite parts the bushes in particular are quite useful to build more sturdy looking tubes than what can be achieved with the newer and slimmer ones it would seem that the tile pieces appeared in the â€˜without groveâ€™ version as a standard and in the â€˜with groveâ€™ version as alternates see bricklink inventory notice though that the box above and instructionsâ€™ below pictures all show the â€˜with groveâ€™ variety as said there are no recoloured parts in this set new pieces the few new molds used in this set are black and white slope inverted 45 2 x 2 old type with round bottom tube black technic brick 1 x 2 with hole type ii and red hinge plate 2 x 4 with articulated joint â€“ male and female the most interesting piece from this lot as many of you will have noticed is the technic brick 1 x 2 with hole type ii this kind of technic brick was use during 1976 and 1977 only it would seem tlg tried a new design variant which did not meet success and was later replaced with the standard bricks again nonetheless iâ€™m sure that people who own these bricks like them for the unusual design and the possibilities they offer into adding details to their creations instructions cover â€“ as usual the instructions are not organised in the form of a booklet but they consist of a folded double printed sheet the â€˜coverâ€™ shows again the same shot as the front of the box with bigger lego logo and set number and without the other additional information â€˜back coverâ€™ â€“ here we see the full name of the set harleydavidson flh 1200 this makes me wonder why is this set known as 394 harley davidson 1000cc when it is indeed a 1200cc anyway what really makes me love this page is the list of stats below the photo and in particular these two lines hp not given this calls for just one question why did harleydavidson not release this info my opinion is that since this is a motorbike built for the police they did not have permission to share the specifications on the motor which was probably customised either by harleydavidson upon request or by the police themselves â€˜random pageâ€™ â€“ as expected no callouts here but the build is pretty straight forward and does not need them apart for one passage weâ€™ll see later the colours are easy to tell apart in the end there is no dark grey in this set that could be confused with black again notice how the instructions include the â€˜with groveâ€™ tiles and not the older ones maybe this was changed during the long time this set stayed in production the â€˜last pageâ€™ shows other four models included in the hobby set line unfortunately i own only one of them the 396 thatcher perkins locomotive indeed i would have liked to have them all building start the handle bars look a bit too squared to me but itâ€™s just a minor feature and the overall shape is still good in my opinion notice the red hinge plate which will be almost totally hidden in the finished model see below and the blue tiles which work as indicators the first steps used to build the front wheel and windshield are really easy until you get to the wheel in facts the instructions do not show clearly all the pieces needed for it and i found myself with a â€˜floatingâ€™ wheel for the absence of one of the red technic bush old 2 on one side the one not visible on the instructions of course not a big deal but something that could have been done better motor and seat the second part of the build includes the motor seat and â€˜saddle bagsâ€™ the technique used for the motor or better the radiator is very clever to get the ridged feel tlg designers used 4 light grey plates stuck one on the other but not completely in contact this way the studs while keeping the plates in position keep them raised from one another at the same time the yellow round bricks add some details and colour touches to this predominantly light grey parts of the vehicle the use of the engine smooth small 1 x 2 side plates for the exhaust pipes while quite clever still looks a bit strange to me iâ€™m mostly used to see them in airplanes helicopters and spaceships â€˜saddlebagsâ€™ a simple build for one of the iconic parts of this motorcycle here you see them in place as well as get a look at the finished seat i like how lego designers managed to make its shape with just a few quite big bricks the â€˜saddle bagsâ€™ are a really nice touch and they work perfectly when compared to the original this is the rear wheel as said before only when you get to this passage in the instruction you get a real understanding of how the front wheel is supposed to be mounted as well careful readers will notice how this is not one of the original wheels in this set the original ones were mounted using the technic gear expert builder 9 tooth unfortunately i could only find one of them in my collection an itâ€™s used as the front wheel by adding the rear wheel which is shown from a better angle in the instructions we complete the model notice how the two technic bricks supporting the wheel are held in position by two 2x1 plates i think this was a bad case of â€˜building by compartmentsâ€™ mentality if tlg designers had considered this a bit more they would have used 2 4x1 plates instead of 4 2x1 on the other hand this is not the worst case i have seen in a lego set and they keep up the tradition nowadays too finished set front and here it is our fancy police harleydavidson indeed the front looks blocky and quite horrible to our eyes but again it was almost the best that could be done at the time i only wish they had made it a little less bulky even though this build is clearly thought to give better stability to the wheel the blue tiles work nicely to emphasise the indicators the slightly unsightly red plate is normally covered by the plate sticker and the windshield albeit being hard to see through is nicely shaped back the back side is less detailed than the front but shows the red light and antenna which are typical of the police motorbikes from this period how many times have we seen this angle in the chase scenes from tv shows like â€œchipsâ€ side all in all this model looks pretty sturdy apart for the antenna which falls off all too easily and detailed especially considering the limited variety of parts available and used at the time they even got so far to put a 2x2 tile as kickstand to display it without fear of it falling on the sides bonus images size comparison what i never understood about this set is what scale it is meant to be i mean it is clearly not minifigscale and it could not be technicfigscale those came later but it is not even miniland scale moreover the only other model with the same scale is the other hobby set motorbike as the cars have a scale of their own and the thatcher uses still another one final comments overall this is a great set for collectors of old models and motorbike fans or both it does not sport a huge variety of bricks but was a good choice at the time and even if the result is matteroffact blocky when compared to the original it implements some good solutions to minimise the lego brick appearance and maximise the similarity as much as possible design  colour scheme â€“ 910 the design is as accurate as possible apart for the front mudguard maybe and the colours are completely in line for a police vehicle the solutions and details included in this set justify the â€˜expert buildersâ€™ label and add to the appearance and why not playability of the model parts  810 not a huge selection and very few new molds nonetheless a good source of black and white standard parts for mocs and one of the few sources for the extra rare technic brick 1 x 2 with hole type ii pieces playability  910 a sturdy model which can take some serious play and swooshing without falling apart the easily detachable antenna and the lack of an appropriate scale interaction with most other models make it lose one point though build  710 pretty straight forward with few nice solutions and an already mentioned slightly obscure passage in the instructions price  510 like most older models especially the hobby set and model team ones this set can be found at reasonable prices only rarely most of the times people are asked shameful prices for such a smallish set overall 810 very good as always questions comments and pic requests welcome edited by whitefang 17 april 2011  0619 pm indexed	positive
great job on this review of a unique and rare set luxorv considering the year it was released this must have been a cool set back then even up to now with all the specialized pieces and advanced building techniques i could still appreciate the beauty of this brickbuilt harleydavidson police motorbike the various elements are instantly recognizable and it even has the unusual partlystacked plates technique for the motor overall id say this is an above average set that is a musthave for any hardcore lego collector	positive
great review the set is really nice i love that the front of the motercycle can turn and the engine is just beautiful with its half stacked bricks like kieldaman said the price used or new is quite a bit but there is a good variety of bricks here like the bricks inside the wheels did you get this set from your father great review luxorv	positive
luxorv this is an awesome review the classicness of this set is just lovely its so easy to just fall in love with this set youre review is outstanding as well the pictures are so clear and the review is just solid youve really polished your reviewing skills	positive
wow talk about illegal connections eh great review i really like this set even for its age	positive
thanks for the feedback guys indeed this is a great set and im very attached to it as far as i remember i got it for say my 2nd birthday i think but it is not my first lego set youll learn more on this in my next planned review	positive
luxorv this is a well written presentation on this lego vintage review i never knew the existence of this set and even though the design is not part of the modern lego design concept but the overall appeal back in the 1970s certainly appeal to many i could not mind to own such vintage lego model and put them on display and potray as if it was a chart of evolution of lego motorbikes thanks for sharing and i cant wait to find out your next review	positive
thanks luxorv for this review of such a classic old lego set and i do remember seeing these in a catalogue years ago excellent brickbuilt police cycle i think its time lego did another one eh  brick on ride on everyone 	positive

theme hobby sets set name thatcher perkins locomotive set number 396 price new 369450  258314 euro price used 100355  45250 euro pieces 434 year of release 1976 links peeron bricklink and brickset my father assures me this is the very first lego set i ever got in facts he gave it to me as a present for my first half year of course that is to say he bought it for himself and used me as the official excuse when i grew up at first i found it to be quite boring no minifigures limited play features in the end it was just a locomotive it soon went to forgottenland then when i was about 10 years old i one day found again the instructionsâ€™ â€˜bookletâ€™ and saw this bright coloured big steam engine and i suddenly wanted to build it again it would seem i finally got to the right age at least for me to appreciate the design of this great set but enough about memories letâ€™s start with the review the box front the front of the box here cut and folded to save space shows the thatcher perkins locomotive in all its glory upon a nice countryside landscape i really appreciate how tlg box designers used a real life environment made of sand gravel and pebbles to give this hobby set a better background moreover the landscape does not distract the eye since the focus is strongly set on the locomotive itself the box measures about 395 x 245 x 55 centimetres or 1556 x 965 x 217 inches this is more or less the size of the 4840  the burrow or the advent calendars back and sides the back of the box shows the model on a more neutral background and from another angle we can see the stickers in place take a good look at them here because i did not apply them the right side we also see a pic of the set from the 34 back and one with a child playing with it in this latter shot the model rests upon a nice black box with a thatcher perkins sign on it unlike the harley davidson 1000cc set the thatcher perkins does not have the sign â€˜designed for experienced lego buildersâ€™ for some reason contents inside this set includes a large number of parts mainly black blue and red with some nice yellow to lighten it up more parts of interest the partsâ€™ selection is not exceptional but weâ€™ll see this set includes some unique pieces which have not been in lego sets for long years since the 1980s like the very nice black plate modified 1 x 2 with steam engine cylinder flat surfaces black train wheel spoked for motor and the red train steam drive rod holder  train steam drive rod group the wheel spoked large as beautiful as they were saw the light from the production line for the last time in 1976 the only new mold used in this set is the black and blue slope inverted 45 2 x 2 old type with round bottom tube as you can see in the above picture this locomotive was designed to work well be played with on all kind of surfaces so the wheels sport tyres in this picture you can see how they look without the tyres of course builders can use the thatcher perkins on their brickbuilt tracks another group of interesting parts are shown in this pic red wheel spoked 2 x 2 with stud and tyre black brick modified 2 x 4 with wheels holder old clear bottom and yellow minifig head plain  stud solid many newer fans will not be familiar with the last two parts they were standard fare in a number of sets between the 1960s and early 1990s but then unfortunately they were taken out of production to be fair the replacement of the black brick modified 2 x 4 with wheels holder old clear bottom with the standard technic parts was probably due to the fact that the metal pin used to connect the wheels to these bricks had a shameful tendency at getting off the wheel too bad it could not be fixed and these parts kept in production for those interested here is a picture of the dss courtesy of peeron instructions cover â€“ as usual the instructions are not organised in the form of a booklet but they consist of a folded double printed sheet the â€˜coverâ€™ shows again the same shot as the front of the box â€˜back coverâ€™ â€“ here we see the name of the set and some additional information like the year when the first thatcher perkins started working 1863 and the type 460 of this locomotive which as shown in the image is related to the number and position of the wheels on a side note the pencil signs on the sides of the sheet were made by my father while counting the parts in the set â€˜random pageâ€™ â€“ as expected no callouts here but the build is pretty straight forward and does not need them the colours are easy to tell apart full page â€“ as you may have noticed all the building steps are drawn on one side of the â€˜bookletâ€™ making it more properly an instructionsâ€™ sheet what really makes this â€˜instruction bookletâ€™ stand out in my eyes is the fact that it is indeed a poster the building steps are all on one side while the other is a bigger image of the completed set with the name thatcher perkins in yellow enclosed in an old styled red tag building start the build starts with the base of the locomotive putting the 10 wheels in place and strengthening the engine notice the use of this â€˜illegalâ€™ technique to build the bumpers lego as we all know can be a tricky medium to build with and some details need special solutions to be completed we then start building the boiler and cabin going up fast and steady in the penultimate step we build the chimney and cow catcher iâ€™d like to spend a few more words on the chimney and how it is attached to the main body as you can see in the left picture the 3x3 base of the chimney is asymmetrical with a 3x2 base on one side and a combination of a 1x2 and a 1x1 plates on the other in the right picture you see the top of the main body where the chimney will be attached it is made of a 1x2 base and 1 1x2 tile using another â€˜illegalâ€™ technique or at least one lego designers do not like much nowadays the holes of the 3x2 plate of the chimney will connect with the studs of the 1x2 plate on the main body giving a well centred and quite sturdy build finished set front the front of the model sports 3 big headlights a nice cow catcher and the nicely detailed engine front i can almost hear it whistle side and here it is our good old thatcher perkins locomotive indeed it looks like a classic and powerful engine form one of those spaghetti western films doesnâ€™t it what i found strange in the beginning is the choice of colours i was convinced steam engines were all black at the time then i checked some pictures of the original and i must admit the resemblance is almost perfect back the back side is less detailed than the front with cabin almost devoid of details i think lego could have done a better job on it 34 front and â€¦ just see how good it looks from this angle with all the tubing moving parts and the lovely 3 headlights â€¦ 34 back the back view is not as impressive but grants us a good look at the big posterior wheels and the bumpers bonus images size comparison as i stated elsewhere i never understood what scale these hobby sets are meant to be they are clearly not minifigscale and they are not technicfigscale either but they are not even miniland scale moreover they use different scales between locomotives cars and motorbikes amongst the hobby set line as i said before the set comes with tyres on the wheels to allow a wider playing experience not limiting this model to tracks nonetheless builders can assemble their own track maybe using the vintage blue 45v tracks and make the thatcher perkins run its proper environment final comments overall this is a great set for collectors of old models and steam engines fans or both it does not sport a huge variety of bricks but was a good choice at the time and even if the result is matteroffact a bit blocky when compared to the original it implements some good solutions to minimise the lego brick appearance and maximise the similarity as much as possible design  colour scheme â€“ 810 the design is as accurate as possible and the colours are completely in line for the thatcher perkins locomotive the solutions and details included in this set justify the â€˜expert buildersâ€™ label and add to the appearance and why not playability of the model though i still wish tlg had included more details in the cabin parts  1010 quite a big selection but only one new mould nonetheless a good source of black blue and red standard parts for mocs and one of the few sources for the extra rare black plate modified 1 x 2 with steam engine cylinder flat surfaces black train wheel spoked for motor red train steam drive rod holder  train steam drive rod group and wheel spoked large playability  910 a sturdy model which can take some serious play and swooshing without falling apart the somewhat easily detachable chimney and the lack of an appropriate scale interaction with most other models make it lose one point though build  710 pretty straight forward with few nice solutions price  510 like most older models especially the hobby set and model team ones this set can only rarely be found at reasonable prices most of the times people are asked shameful prices for such a smallish set overall 810 very good more pictures can be found in this brickshelf gallery as always questions comments and pic requests welcome edited by rufus 10 july 2011  0705 pm

kieldaman on 10 july 2011  1143 am said rare classic sets are always a priceless part of any lego collection and its a good thing you still have this first set of yours luxor or did you purchase a new one excellent review btw its always a pleasure getting a closer look at these classic sets which i wouldnt have known to exist had i not seen this review overall i think its a really good set at that time of course judging this one by modern standards wont be fair but at the time im pretty sure it was a cool set to have though less cooler than having the harley davidson set thanks kiel i can grant you thats the same old one i got as my first set im very glad to have it lightningtiger on 10 july 2011  1221 pm said thanks for the review luxorv an interesting old set though i find it hard to imagine a square smoke stack instead of roundish it truly has that classic lego simplistic build with all studs showing and making do with standard partsm except the few you havepointed out luxorv a nice flashback 35 years agonow thats old school anyway brick on everyone  indeed this set must be valued in relation to its own time and style i was considering making an updated version with current parts but im not sure ifwhen ill have the time for it rufus on 10 july 2011  0709 pm said thanks luxor for bringing us this excellent tour round an old classic for its time this is truly a remarkably detailed and beautiful set and i think its amazing how its still in such good condition after all this time do you have any more from this era excepting the harley of course  ive created a whole new index to put them in interesting that you had to create a new index for them  but these two are the only ones i have for now maybe other members will be ble to contribute to it in the future	positive
indexed 410 â€“ payloader theme legolandvehicle piece count 28 year released 1973 msrp  links brickset lugnet peeron bricklink note this set was released under the number 604 outside of the us ah classic legoland a time before minifigs ever existed and cars and buildings could be made with just a few bricks the part selection was pretty basic bricks plates slopes windows and wheels were all you needed to construct an entire town heavy machinery could be modeled in 4wide and be just a few bricks tall for this review we will be taking a look at the 410 payloader one of legoâ€™s first sets of a bucket loader so grab a hard hat we are heading to the construction yard box image courtesy of bricklink box contents here we have our instructions which are obviously the older style of lego instructions the steps used much simpler imagery but they get the job done they show how to build the payloader in seven steps this small set has all of 28 parts in it the more interesting parts of note are the red digger arm the bucket the blue 1x2 brick with arm holes and the blue 2x2 brick with the classic lego logo printed on it construction in the first few steps we start building up the base then add the arms and start building the cab add the bucket the trailer socket and finish the cab throw on some wheels completed set and with that we are finished with our nice small model here is the back right side notice how the back of the cab was left with an empty spot here is the left side notice how on the top of the arm they made it so you could just push down on the tips it to make the arm lift instead of having to grab by the arm itself on the front we have the nice lego logo shown to remind the forgetful of what they were playing with you can also see how much space is in the bucket itself which cant hold more than a few small plates finally on the back we have the trailer socket this was a nice addition to make it able to tow trailers from other sets like 685 just donâ€™t try to bring it into your layout populated by minifigs they may have a problem trying to get in other thoughts considering this set is nearly 37 years old i myself am still surprised by how well the bricks have held up i purchased this set from a thrift store a year ago for a mere 25 cents normally when used lego is purchased you can expect to see scratches marks wearing discoloration etc but boy was i surprised to see how all these parts are in mint condition even the instructions still looked like they came from a new box and not all ripped up and tattered the pieces still connect to each other nice and tight and the metal pieces for the wheels havent rusted this just shows that with proper care these things can last a lifetime i really would like to get a small display case to show it off conclusion playability 810 in addition to the standard of having rolling wheels you also get a fully movable bucket assembly with it you can pick up smaller pieces and unload them into a dump truck design 710 like all other legoland vehicles it has a very basic design but you can still easily identify what it is simple yet effective parts 710 like most other older lego sets all you really get are a few basic bricks and plates however you do get a bucket assembly and the 2x2 brick with the classic lego logo on it is very cool it was also nice of lego to include the trailer socket so you could tow around your trailers price 810 bricklinks history shows them to sell for around 10 usd used while that is a bit much for a set this size it is pretty good considering this set is over 37 years old however if you are looking for a new boxed set be prepared to fork over about 50 usd overall 810 this small machine would make a nice addition to your collection as a reminder of legos past so what are your thoughts on this classic set edited by thebrickster 01 june 2010  0555 am	positive
nice review great nostalgic set like you said it has nice designsimple yet effective i like construction vehicles so this set has even bigger impact on me	positive

well its not exactly a large shuttle but still a nice set 442 space shuttle year released 1979 piece count 79 minifigs 1 vehicles 0 list price unknown this little classic was my smallest classic space set believe it or not i still have the box heres the back the instructions are pretty tattered and missing a section i had to download some from the web but the ship is again intact missing only one grey 1x3 plate ive always liked this computer piece heres the under side this set included the small classic jet engines a closeup of the sloped printed space brick and the complete set with minifig this set was a great little space ship that made a nice addition to the blue space theme as small as it was it could hold twothree figs one standing up i dont even think the mars mission recon drop ship holds three figs in any case it was a musthave for blue space fans and probably only a few bucks back in the day swoosh	neutral
and again those tears in my eyes with original box i really love those classic space stuff looks like i need to clean my stuff this summer	positive
this classic space shuttle is simply superb i love the layout of this shuttle in fact it reminded me as one of the space fighter jet that roam around in space defending the boundaries from intruders i just love these old grey bricks very much and the printed computer brick is just lovely its such a pity that i did not grow up with classic space in my childhood these are actually great stuff and formed the base of the space theme in lego brickster thanks again for another outstanding classic review	positive
this was my first space set ever 1979 1980 dont know anymore but i do remember i got this together with 897 for my birthday when we where camping with a little luck i may even have an old film from my dad opening the boxes well what to say it looked soooooo aggressive with those two engines but i never knew why you needed two steering wheels on it they probably just thought a symmetrical model was better  i cant blame them what a nice set it would even sell today no doubt looooots of swooshability	positive
indexed everyone remembers their first time for me it was in 19coughsomethingsomethingcough we were at her house and her mother was gone for at least an hour she slowly unzi uhhh sorry wrong story um yeahh anyway i do remember my first time it was 1977 in late summer our neighbor who worked for a department store called famousbahr said that the main store had a travelling lego display so my family filed into the car and drove into downtown st louis to see this display to tell you the truth i dont remember much about the display itself but i do remember that my parents bought me my first lego set set  456 the spirit of st louis set  456 also sold as set  661 name spirit of st louis theme legoland  large vehicle year 1977 pieces 49 minifigs 0 price 500 usd bricklink misb start  17500 usd used complete 3500 usd links peeron bricklink brickset packaging box front the original box that my set came in was most likely trashed 5 minutes after returning home this image was lovingly stolen off of the peeron page for this set i feel lucky that i even got this much similarly i have no pictures of the plastic baggies the set came in truth be told i cant be sure that there even were plastic baggies that the parts came in the set side view well there she is my first set ever  actually i seem to recall the real spirit of st louis was silver colored not black and yellow if you need a history lesson the spirit of st louis was charles lindberghs plane when he made the first transatlantic solo flight more details can be found on the wikipedia page the overall shape is pretty close at least the cockpit window could stand to be moved forward one stud but everything seems to be relatively close the tail piece isnt the right shape but it is likely the only tail piece lego produced at the time if you look closely you can see the various bite marks that my brother and i inflicted over the years i know some people would be aghast that there are bite marks but brick separators wouldnt come out for another 10 years besides we were young we didnt know any better i certainly had no idea that it would become my obsession there are some interesting part choices here everything is brick and plate built as you might expect the same set nowadays would have lots of slope wedges and wedge plates to round things out but lego was all about the brick in 77 so bricks are what we got the black inverted slopes worked pretty well asthetically as the wing struts the wings are simple 4 x 10 plates nice and square there were no minifigs in this set if i remember correctly 1977 was just about the time when minifigs made their first appearance i know i have one other set from 77 that does include a minifg at least i dont have a lot of comments for the following photos ill let the pictures speak for themselves 34 view back back 34 top front parts interesting pieces i have no idea if there were any extra pieces that came with this set i kind of doubt it instead i took a photo of some of the interesting parts to the model that translucent white piece didnt photograph so well but it is a technic axle 8 thats right sets from 1977 contained technic elements the two black parts are the forerunners to the 1 x 2 technic brick as well everytime i hear someone on the forums complain about technic elements in system sets i think back to this set the round brick is special as well here is a closer view of it complete with bite marks  round brick as you can see the stud is closed it is only one of two closed stud 1 x 1 round bricks that i own they stopped appearing in sets in 1981 for those that are interested the dss you thought you were going to escape this heading didnt you surprise yes even in 1977 lego sets had stickers the oldest printed elements i can remember were in the classic space sets that started in 1979 again when people in the forums complain about dss in sets i can only help think of this set and chuckle to myself maniacally the sticker has held up really well considering its been stuck on the brick for 32 years no discoloration very little curling i think if all stickers held up this well over time there would be less dss complaints the ratings playability 610  the set is quite swooshable and the propellor spins outside of that though minifigs na design 610  the overall shape is quite good especially given the era the color choice leaves a lot to be desired price 110  its been retired for 30 years its going to cost you to get your hands on it overall 1330  this set is for true collectors only i cant imagine anyone wanting one because they want to play with it it was a great set back in the day but the design feels really dated and if youre wondering mine is not for sale ever all the photos plus more can be found in the gallery	neutral
very brave to give an impression about one of the oldest sets ever reviewed a lot members here are younger than the set itself i think you will have to have grown up with it to like it nowadays we have seen quite a few better airplanes than that one for example this years 7643  but thanks for letting us know btw the 1x1 round brick with the solid stud is no 3062a instead of 3062b with the hollow stud	positive
im sorry you had to move this topic white fang when it was in the reviewers academy the teachers agreed it belonged in other themes shrug i guess it ended up where it belonged eventually	neutral
great review its good to see some of the old sets reviewed i think i learned something about the history of lego from this one	neutral
fantastic review iÂ´d love to read more like this trivia about oldrare pieces is almost as fun as the set itself	neutral
outstanding review of a very special set i actually remember seeing this set on the store shelves of local department stores can you believe it fantastic review walter i really enjoy looking at these vintage sets this one deserves a blog	positive
here is the spirit of st louis just go there washington and have a look of this legend  cavannus on jul 15 2009 0940 pm said in 1977 trans or yellow slopes existed already and using them would have made the plane more realistic i dont think so there is no 45Â° slope in the original plane design  and no front cockpit window quote a third rear wheel would have enhanced playability and design rather than this ugly black round brick except that it wouldnt have been the spirit of st louis this set is a great one and i wish id bought it in 77 it is the spirit of the 70ties 	positive
daoudbazaar on jul 15 2009 0526 pm said  there is no 45Â° slope in the original plane design  and no front cockpit window  except that it wouldnt have been the spirit of st louis oooops youre completely right the spirit of stlouis didnt have any front window nor rear wheel anyway i think a standard ryan m1m2 plane would have been a better choice less a legend but more a flexible plan for multiple uses	negative
i really like the design it has an aesthetic value lacking from most official lego planes and follows closely to the real thing minus the colours something that cant really be claimed for more recent sets	positive
483 alpha1 rocket base year released 1979 piece count 170 minifigs 3 vehicles 1 two sections list price unknown despite the nuclear nonproliferation treaty of 1968 lego dared design a rocket base complete with a rocket system that may have had nuclear capability in 1979 luckily the rocket was defective having rather flimsy white bricks that did not stay together well during launch attempts lego scrapped its wmd program and the result was this classic blue era space set known as the alpha1 rocket base instructions on the backside of the instructions the set is featured with the space command center space cruiser and a few vehicle sets the set includes three figs and this great rocket fuel tanker heres the front section complete with computer and the rocket fuel section the set has some interesting features including the control section fuel control and launch pad on top of the control section is a nicely design radartracking system heres the open control room the launch pad and fuel control the fuel control includes two sink pieces and blue steering wheels and legos wmd weapon of mass destruction the alpha1 on the launch pad heres a shot of the launching mechanism unfortunately i have lost one of the blue sinkfaucet pieces as well as a black hose a closeup of the alpha1 rocket the white bricks never stayed together well often times coming apart within your hands the arming and guidance system was nicely designed a view of the complete set and another this is a great set the base fuel vehicle and launch platform offers a great amount of playability my only complaint is the rocket as mentioned above i dont think i ever played with it a sa kid because it always fell apart share your comments regarding this classic space set	positive
thebrickster on jul 4 2008 0414 am said a closeup of the alpha1 rocket the white bricks never stayed together well often times coming apart within your hands huh did they not think of putting a technic axle down the center of the rocket come to think of it when were technic axles invented its a neat little set makes me think i oughta make some similar kinda layout in ldd very elegant for playability	neutral
i always thought that that grey thing on top of the rocket was some kind of satelite xenologer on jul 4 2008 0525 am said huh did they not think of putting a technic axle down the center of the rocket come to think of it when were technic axles invented i had this set as a kid and i dont think there was a technic axle inside that rocket but if i remember correctly some of the later cs rockets did	neutral

nice rewiew the set is good too	positive
thanks for the great review sweet now that ive seen the set im afraid im a bit disappointed 8 1 the color combination doesnt really do it for me blue dark blue grey black tan white theyre all mixed together without any over all design 2 is there any interior it doesnt look like it and in any case you can only reach it if you remove the modules hm  now it looks too much of a box 3 there are most certainly some nice ideas in this model and some great parts the best part of the model is the staircase 4 i dont think he spent much time in thinking about the design as apo said the chimneys on top of a garage is kinda weird theres also a gate next to another gate which is weird as well also if this is supposed to ba a grocery then the owner has done a lot to hide it the croissant is nice but next to the brown box with vegies theres nothing that suggests this is a shop 5 the white lamp and the the yellow cylinder are at the same level of the tiles imo it should be above the level of the tiles 6 imo not worth the 90 euro edited by snefroe1 20 june 2007  0903 am	negative
thank you legocastlegirls for your quick review y its the first time i realize the back of the market street the tan bricks are a replacement for some windows id guess i do love that building especially the top floor with the neat balcony wub of course you are again left alone filling the interior but i just had some food parts ordered at bricklink xd one thing id like to know this is an onlineexclusive right can i order it at a legostore kln  oberhausen and get the sum rewarded on my voucher booklet sweet i heard it here but im not sure 8 if anyone is looking for how to fill it with interior go read the latest brickjournal 8 theres a whole chapter written about designing the rooms interior on	positive
hi thanks for posting those great pictures i got the cc some time ago and i really looking forward to get my hands on the market street i think the colour scheme of this set is great maybe because blue is my favourite colour just check my wardrobe i really like the design of the roof and the staircase i am not so sure if i like the gateways but i believe they will grow on me when i get the set myself snefroe1 on jun 20 2007 0902 am said 5 the white lamp and the the yellow cylinder are at the same level of the tiles imo it should be above the level of the tiles i am totally agree with snefreo1 the yellow cylinder and the lamppost should be on a level above the tiles actually i have put a 2x2 plat under the lamppost on my cc looks much better if you ask me unfortunately shop at home does not send to norway so i have to purchase this set in billund yes i am going to legoland this summer or on ebay	positive

im not much of a city fan but this looks great i guess this is the closest we can get to legoland miniland quality sets and considering this is a three floro small structure and its over 1000 parts just imagine pun not intended how many peices are in ll californias empire state building or wtc freedom tower models both are large and in real scale over 100 floors thats a lot of bricks anyways ive got a friend who loves city im sure this one would make a great addition to his town setup gotta tell him about this new set y	positive
legocastlegirl on jun 20 2007 0742 am said i know its not such a nice review like yoda did the last times but i hope you enjoy some of the pics nonsense sandra  tks for sharing these cool pics  its also a nice hommage to erik brok i really like this set i think its really well designed with great ideas such as the dual stairs the balconies the croissant insignia the market entrance design with the horns whip and owl 8 i like the color combination and the mosaic design just in front of the entrance the only terrible flaw is that yellow cinlinder  that is just awful for a flower pot x i dont mind at all having that lamp post at the same level since it would be normal to have the base of the lamp at the level of the tile but i agree that is just pickering about an insignificant detail p legocastlegirl on jun 20 2007 0742 am said a funny idea is the salad in the one box at the front i think normally its a hairpiece of an exoforce fig yeay that is just brilliant all the way 8 this is a great set indeed and a must have for town fans  yoda	positive

well now that i have some money a trip to toysrus was obviously in my future especially since my local tru has much of the summer 2007 lineup when i got there almost all the smaller castle sets had been sold out but there was one left the one i am now reviewing for both eurobricks and bzpower  the box well for starters the castle theme boxes are beautiful the blended clear and stormy skies give a great clash of the titans effect and the action poses help as well  the back is equally nice featuring a photo showing kids how to use the crossbow and the brave axe wielder taking a swipe at the skeleton foolish soldier that wont work on skellies see later on in the review to find out why and of course we have a small box with the link to the official lego website where tlc can advertise even more lego sets p the contents after opening the box a single bag of pieces with a couple loose ones the instruction manual and necessary catalog  p  and a new wider rubber band holder spilt out the instruction manual is clear as a bell no color trouble here folks also its worth mentioning the nice background with the mountain and kings castle silhouettes  sorry that theres no picture but ill take one if someone wants to see it  the pieces for being a 5 dollar set well seven in my case darn your above average prices tru crossbow attack features a lot of nice pieces as does the entire castle lineup notable elements include two large brown spoked wheels two brown modified 1x1s a pearl gold slope end and six dark blue modified 1x1x23 slopes the bulk of the pieces however are nothing special ill let the picture do the talking for this the accessories are by far the best parts in this kit two different helmets in a beautiful shiny silver are my favorite but i also really like the scythe looks good for mocing and the round shield  wub  which are both brand new parts and can anyone not love the classic axe and crossbows oh and theres a black lightsaber too but thats rather boring compared to the other parts p the minifigures can you say four figures including the horse that has to be a record for a regular 5 dollar set at least in the present age of limited figures per set well start out with the two crown militia a regular soldier and an archer both have old faces but they look spiffy with the shiny helmets and the superb torsos ill name the soldier bravo the stout and the archer angler the precise for future references now we come to the skellie although some people dislike the new skeleton design i personally prefer it to the old ones since the arms are now poseable and the face much meaner the only problem is that the arms hang too low but its not too noticeable when they have weapons in their hands and last but not least heres the elusive skeleton horse i for one am very happy that tlc took advantage of that awesome prototype piece and made it into an official massproduction mold however the horse is unfortunately one piece but since regular lego horses are as well i dont have a problem with it i do have a problem with the pose however the legs are in quite an odd position and i wonder why tlc didnt make the front and back leg poses symmetrical ah well the finished set i have only two pictures here since this set is so small first heres the completed crossbow i must say finally no more ridiculous horse mounted catapults or crazy fire wheel launchers now we have realistic siege weapons including the one included with 7090 plus it actually launches okay although not the best heres the other main attraction the completed skeleton rider and horse i think its rather dramatic with that pose and the dark background dont you think  playability okay so theres not much in this set but a bit of imagination brings plenty of possibilities to show you what you can do heres a little story made only with this set  overall rating presentation 910 pieces 810 minifigures 910 finished model 810 playability 810  final score 8410 crossbow attack is a fine introduction into castle so i recommend it to any lego fan whether they are a castle nut or just want a cheap change of pace tlc has a knack with making great small kits these days and i more than ever support them in their amazing rebound from their dark ages between 1997 and 2004  edited by kimt 10 august 2008  0133 pm	positive
thanks for this review and that great little comic about the skellies though xd you have to admit that besides their long arms making the skellie legs look out of proportion that theyre just made poorly theyre sticking straight out as opposed to every other fig which have a slight bend to make them look more natural also as im sure youve noticed the pegs are on angles that makes it impossible for them to hold their weapons straight and they cant even put their arms over their heads without stressing the plastic some i mean theyre dead well at least undead theyre not supposed to be stiff and personally i like the ragdoll look more it makes them seem more dead p	negative

here is a review of the new monster dino creator set with power functions first lets start with the box which is much larger than it needs to be it is one of the new style recloseable boxes rather than the rip the sides style this set is typical of creator and comes with three sets of instructions the monster dino a kind of spider and a crocodile the set comes with two of the new motors one small and one large a sound module plus the new ir controler and receiver there is a mix of techniques in this set the core is mainly studless technic there are some studded technic parts and most of the details are standard creator style there are two mechanisms one to control the legs and one to control the head and arms the leg drive is from the large motor and the arm and head are operated from the small motor the completed mechanism will stand on its own without any detail added the detail is added to the base unit to complete the model the operation of the dino is very good the design for the motors and drives is very compact and well thought out the walking motion works well although there is no steering and it will fall over it it encounters obstacles the sound module is built into the head so when the mouth opens the dino roars sort of glyman made the comment that this set is ugly as sin and i tend to agree i think there are too many colour variations with different shades of grey black and that lime green p which confuses the look of the finished model but i guess it might apeal more to younger kids i also do not like the spikes along the back which glow in the dark because the are loose and keep falling off this set is not cheap at 70 but i guess this is because of the motors and ir controller while on this i was surprised how good the range was on the new controller it would still operate ever when not in direct line of sight i would give this set a 1010 for playabilityit has kept the kid amused for hours i would give it 610 for value for money it is a bit pricey overall 810 it took approx 3 hours to build and has been well played with i have posted some more images and some videos of the finished models on my brickshelf page here if you have any questions please ask pete edited by whitefang 23 may 2009  0628 pm indexed	positive

thanks very much for that review i downloaded the instructions last week and i was largely impressed with what was in it however like holodoc i am waiting for the bulldozer i might have to settle with the dino though if lego charge australian some absurd price edit i just watched the videos thanks they are great the dino is better than i thought edited by sinner 10 july 2007  0229 am	positive
thank you very much for that interesting review ickelpete y well the color schemes pretty bad and the design of that dinos a bit to blocky for my liking but the two alternative models youve builtre quiet nice at least therere a lot of possibilities coming with that set 	neutral
tks a lot for your review ickelpete  i saw that set at tru a couple of weeks ago but was really not interested due to the design  i am not a fan of those motorized lego sets  i guess the lime colour is to please kids as well as the general design far from a real dino  i am sure that its going to sell well to a younger croud let me quote you here quote the walking motion works well although there is no steering and it will fall over it it encounters obstacles hum i really hope it works welll because i will have to buy that motorized atat and i dont want it to crash p yoda	neutral
ickelpete on jul 9 2007 1119 pm said first lets start with the box which is much larger than it needs to be pete no lego box is too big my friend xd  nice review y as for the set i dont like the colors myself surprised xd  and it seems a little blocky otherwise the set is cool i really like the head	positive
ugly as hell but an awesome parts pack worthy of purchase	neutral
 such a beauty the functions are great cool video i want to get this set so badly great review y	positive
the box is has really strange dimensions  its very flat but has a large front  the 11 scale regarding the spines because theyre made of the softer nonabs plastic the stuff the 1994 cutlasses and brown muskets were made of they lose their shape a bit and so are hard to grip they simply fall off i suppose tlc use loads of different colours because a single or twocolour dino isnt very nice to look at especially when the surface isnt very smooth  it takes your eyes away from the surface and puts it on the colours someone should make an all terrain dino that can walk everywhere from this set  i dont have the skill with technic  i always end up layering and never finish any models 	negative
thanks for the nice review its butt ugly to me but the motors  ir control seem pretty neat  even at that high price it looks like a good parts pack  sweet	positive
i didnt spot this great review earlier thanks for the effort of posting all those pics and videos they helped me decide that this set is worth getting	positive
got this baby via shophome a little early and i though it was time to post my view of this set  snefroe you need to get this one   sorry for the lack of pics but there are already many pics online of this baby so here it is  best space set since a way too long time this is my first new space themed set since more than 20 years and i must say that i’m not disappointed at all i have much to say about this little gem first let’s cut it straight about the martians minifigures they are absolutely rubbish i can’t imagine how lego could produce such atrocity this said let’s move on to the dropship a real piece of art reminiscent of the aliens movie dropship the cockpit is spacious and provides a great field of view too bad there is no hinges to open it you must remove the canopy completely to switch pilot the drilling unit can be attached under the ship with the clever use of a rubber piece it stays well in place once attached good point some people don’t like the inclusion of the 2 containment area for the martians and crystal on both side of the ship but i kind like it it makes the ship less empty the 2 wings are complete with air intake some armaments and 1 standard launcher on the right wing normally i don’t like launchers but this one is very discrete and well integrated on the tail section are 2 thrusters that can be rotated and provide thus some “realistic” movements to the ship one of the last highlight of this ship is the landing gears or i must say landing dishes 6 medium sized radar dishes provide and incredible stability to the set they are quite sturdy and can take a beating i’m not going to review the alien spaceship in detail since it’s quite uninteresting i consider it more like a bonus addition to the set than anything else the look is passable and there are some interesting building techniques in it that’s all to end the review a little proscons table we all love proscons table   pros  incredible design  at last a decent space set  modular functions  quite sturdy  beautiful  great value for money cons  martians are rubbish  no hinges for the canopy  the drilling unit could use some more details score 910 by the way  i added a nice cool feature on my site  you can download the stickers for some sets that i own before building i always scan the stickers we never know it could come handy check this out on my site you need to go in the lego lists on the left vtx classic games	positive

of course right before i post this i see that ickelpete reviewed this set earlier in the week sorry for being redundant but it is already written so here ya go monster dino reviewed by dunamis set 4958 792 pieces 8995 from lego online store build time 35 hours here we go with another offering from the creator line im kind of fond of these sets as they are pretty imaginative and usually have instructions for multiple models i like the reusability of all the pieces and the varied things you can build the box the box that lego shipped this thing in was absolutely huge when i first got this in the mail i thought i had won the lottery and they had shipped the ucs falcon early once i opened the shipping box i was surprised to see an unusually large creator set box the box itself is pretty standard creator type box but this one shows off the power functions prominently on the right side of the box the back of the box shows some of the motorized features as well opening the box is a matter of breaking two seals were back to the reusable cereal box type tab system for those of you who stay up a night wondering about legos next box design inside the box we have a bunch of sealed bags immediately the power brick remote and motors stand out as they are each in individual bags also there are three manuals the manuals the three manuals are 76 76 and 56 pages in length they are laid out well and are pretty standard with all the usual trimmings  piece call outs for each step  parts inventory at the end of the primary model build  page numbers color separation in these manuals were fine for me interestingly the instructions for the primary build took a full manual plus about a quarter of another manual random manual photos parts list ill explain a bit more below but it would have been nice to have some written documentation on all the functions of the motors remote and receiver such as motor load guidelines and specific explanations of all the remote control functions it is severely lacking in this area the pieces obviously the pieces were most interested in are these new motors and wireless remote control note that before you fire this bad boy up you had better byob since this is prominently a european community i had better clarify my acronyms over here across the pond byob usually means bring your own beer in this case it still means bring your own beer im on my second heineken right now but in addition to numerous bottles of beer you will need a total of nine batteries to get through this set i kid you not anyway there are two motors a small and a large each with its own very unique name according to the manual the smaller one is called motor and the larger one is called xl motor very creative indeed the battery box takes six aa batteries and there are two compartments to hold them here is the first that seems pretty normal however the back side of it holds the other three batteries and it seems to be very poorly designed note in the photo above where the bottom battery is placed compare it to the previous photo and you will see the difference i played around with trying to get that bottom battery out and you better pack a lunch or byob because it is no small task why couldnt they make this compartment just like the other side there is a single power cord connector and a three position switch the middle position turns the power off and the other two positions seem to provide the same functionality in either position as far as i can tell perhaps a little blurb in the manual would have been nice to clear things up a bit the remote takes three aaa batteries it is fairly small and lightweight even with the batteries installed it has two thumb controls which could be levers if you insert technic bars or even pins the two controls are color coded and match the plugs on the receiver to control two separate motors in addition there is a four position switch which i assume changes the channel finally there are two tiny levers that seem to have no function im not sure if they are a trim control or variable speed control i messed with them and didnt notice any difference in the motor speed again some documentation from the incredibly verbose lego manual would have helped as far as the rest of the parts its really a mixed bag there are a lot of varied parts in this set to the point that there is almost one of everything lots of technic gears pins studded beams studless beams axles wheels etc also lots of little 1x1 slopes in various colors teeth horns etc you cant really say it is a parts pack because there is not enough of one thing to make it a parts pack a couple of notes it seems the quality control issue on the axles has been fixed i initially reported this back when i reviewed the 8285 about a year ago all the axles worked fine for me the color quality control issue is still alive check out the different shade of red in these two parts also included is the sound brick this looks just like the other sound or lightup bricks we have been seeing lately it does have a load dinosaur roar sound embedded in it though so hide the younglings if they are a bit on the skittish side finally ive never seen one of these before although someone will no doubt rattle off a dozen sets where you can find this part in about 5 seconds no i am not referring to the studded beam i put that in the photo for scale the build the build was fun and was fairly straightforward as i mentioned there is a lot of technic parts so if you are not a fan of the technic line you should run not walk away from this one there were no gotchas to speak of but you need to pay careful attention to the placement of the wires that go from the motors to the receiver they kind of sneak them around a bit so watch closely otherwise it was fine here is what is left over so far i have only built the primary model as seen on the box there are instructions for two more models both of the other models seem less complex than the primary model and are likely quicker builds the dino took me about 35 hours which included some time to screw around with the motors im an old school technic fan from way back in the 80s so i had some familiarity with the old technic motors obviously 25 years has improved some things and these seem much more powerful the design if you have built the 4507 prehistoric creatures then some of the design will feel familiar especially the head and tail it is almost like they took the dinosaur from that set and figured out how to motorize it this is not necessarily a bad thing just a comment the set does a good job of showing off the features of the new motors and remote it is nice to see how one motor can perform multiple functions in this case the small motor makes both arms move and opens and closes the mouth of the dinosaur when the mouth is completely open it pushes the activation switch on the sound brick which emits the roar sound pretty cool the xl motor handles the walking feature of the dinosaur there is both forward and reverse forward works really well while the reverse just makes the dinosaur look like he is doing a michael jackson moon walk wow i never thought i would use michael jacksons name in a lego dinosaur set review it is almost like the dinosaur cant get traction going in reverse however as noted previously forward works really well this guy actually gets going at a pretty good clip as you might expect he kind of waddles like a duck since there is no articulation in the knees it is a bit awkward but it works the xl motor seems to kick out plenty of power overall the design seems to be a mixed bag the way the tail is attached seems to be an afterthought the arms look to be too small however the walking mechanism and legsfeet are pretty cool as well as the head and mouth i guess it is a reasonable effort to get people introduced to the parts and well see designs improve as time goes on here are a few views of our new friend but what about the atat of course the real reason you are reading this is that you hope i will have some epiphany on how all this relates to the new walking atat judging from the box on the atat it looks like we get one motor i dont see the remote which is a disappointment as i hope it is not controlled by a switch on the body and you either turn the atat on or off if that is the case the first thing i am doing is scavenging the receiver and remote from this set to add to the atat granted it could be that it comes with a remote but is just not seen on the box also the atat box looks like one of the images shows that the head turns i sure hope this is controlled separately as it would be really lame to not be able to control this independently from the walking feature im kind of skeptical on the walking feature of the atat i suspect it will be rather cumbersome but hopefully i will be pleasantly surprised needless to say this is all speculation but those are my initial thoughts based on this set overall thoughts its an ok set kind of pricy but i suspect a large part of that is due to the motors and remote i havent built the other two models they seem less interesting to me but at least it has some variability also you get a ton of different parts which can either be a good thing or bad thing depending on what you are looking for the dinosaur is average the color selection is marginal black and lime green and the tail section is just lame i appreciate it more for the mechanical functions and how the motorized parts work it does do a good job of waking up my dog who seems pretty irritated by it it is a nice set to show off to the neighbors or the endless caravan of my wifes friends that seem to materialize out of nowhere people are quickly impressed by it and then promptly move along once you start trying to explain how it all works im a bit disappointed that the manual did not explain more about the remote and motor functions i suspect that there is more than meets the eye and ill just have to play around with it to find out it would be nice if lego had a website that showed all the cool functions of the motors and remotes so we fully understand the capabilities final rating 72 build 910 pretty quick and fun the mechanical part is cool functionality 610 it is a creator set so you have multiple builds as far as it being a dinosaur its just ok motorized parts are cool though design 610 partly cloudy some things are cool others are lame parts 810 new motors and remote are cool lots of varied parts included but nothing to write home about price 710 it is kind of expensive edited by whitefang 23 may 2009  0623 pm indexed	negative

oh is he ugly or what ive never seen a dino that needed to go on a diet more then him d but id get him for the pieces all those limegreen pieces drools but meh im not really in to mindstorms so i dont think id get this but anyway nice review i now know exactly what hes like kml	negative

paulc on nov 4 2007 0221 pm said i kind of like the design of this but more importantly i really want to get my hands on the power functions motors and ir control system id prefer the 8275 technic bulldozer but theres no way i can stretch to the 100 price tag so i was thinking i would have to see if i could get a 4958 monster dino cheap in the january sales if you really want the power functions the bulldozer is better value as you get two large motors two small motors and two receivers compared to the one in the dino set alos watch toysrus and argos both have had the bulldozer for 7075 in there pre christmas sales usually for a week only i am hopeing they will be on sale soon as i want a second bulldozer to get some more motors	neutral

i ended up buying a misb set recently from a lego collector who is clearing up his collection excellent set to get the ir remote and ir receiver and other motors without paying insane amounts for the bulldozer now there is a quite a number of parts in power miner lime green and 1x1 white teeth plate for the mouth and claws the dino alone has 20 teeth in its mouth the glow in the dark antennas on the backbone of the dino is a nice touch as you can let him walk in the dark somewhat i do agree with the reviewer the box is insanely huge i dont think lego wanted to show a 11 scale dino they just wanted to promote the power function stuff as large as possible also the remote is smaller than shown in the picture as the hand holding it i think is smaller	positive
thanks for the early review i dont know much about the rebals show at all but i can say that the over all design of the walker really appeals to me and the minifigs look top notch i also like how the spring shooters are pretty much hidden in the frame nice job	positive
looks really nice one complaint is the back it is a pitty that lego didnt use any plates greebling there	negative
pretty good first review this looks pretty great i probably wont be getting it due to budget constraints bionicle but still very nice set to me it kinda looks like the missing link between when the atst evolved into the atat also i know the rebels stormtroopers get a lot of hate but i really like them thanks for the review	positive

i built this set and i think the two rubber pieces holding the both sides of the face is a bit stretched out therefore making the set somewhat tight for entire top hatch to open and close does anyone have the same situation is this right  never mind i got it i built the back a stud too long edited by namioik 29 december 2014  0304 am	neutral
thanks for the early review how tall is this next to the most recent recreation of the atat im picturing the two of them standing next to each other looking silly due to the scale differences	neutral
the legs are about 2 shorter than the atat its cockpit is a little larger than the atats head it doesnt look out of place as an escorttype walker or heavy walker especially as both are built in the same style although if scale differences really bother you the most recent atst is probably a better bet for you edited by hjmediastudios 29 december 2014  0432 pm	neutral
great reveiw shame on lego for forgetting that they already made a atdp pilot helmet ezras from the phantom set that didnt resort to needing a printed head	negative
its a different helmet ezras is an imperial cadet helmet the same one he wears in breaking ranks	neutral
thanks for the review and pics this is a really nice looking walker one question  how snug are the atdp drivers sitting in their seats the cockpit looks good actually im not crazy about the atdp helmets on the show but i dig the minifigs good stuff awesome facial hair for kallus	neutral

hi i need some helpwhen i atach the pod to the place where the legs are placed the small piece that unites the pod to the legs is loos from the bottom so the top of the walker just moves around freely wich is different from every video review that i have seen where they can rotate the pod but its not loose the small piece that serves as the axis isnt staying locked on the bottom piece and i have reassembled it all and still its the same  help edit sorry i found out what went wrongdidnt push hard enough d edited by mrpinache 05 july 2015  1210 am	neutral

fantastic review could easily be the years best and its only january 1st youve got a duplicated picture in the bit where the candy is being moved from the outside and through the barber shop and i was expecting a final bw picture or two where the detective makes his report to the woman in red and gets his reward candy of course or she in turn reports back to her real boyfriend the candy smuggler edited by rollermonkey 01 january 2015  0408 pm	positive

great review oky i really love your introduction text you put a lot of effort in this review with lots of nice touches well done for me the set gets 4 out of 5 its a great set but theres something preventing me of giving it 5 stars	positive
wow that is the best start to a review i have ever seen great job oky amazing set ill be picking it up this weekend	positive
great review oky i managed to pick this set up a few days ago and i must say it might be my favorite modular yet for the feel alone the pool hall barbershop and the detectives office itself are all wonderfully designed	positive

snaplock on 01 january 2015  0740 pm said totally agree with you the height does seem rather small also 2x buildings on a 32x32 baseplate with a lots of spare studs behind the buildings are these buildings 12 studs in width it still looks great style wise however this might be a set i buy and look at it after i have built it  regret the amount of  i have spent on it 239 for us aussies  both are are 14 deep on the upper floors do is 3 studs deeper on the ground floor buit thats pretty much it cant believe how cramped the upper floors of the barber shop look weve come a long way from the wide and empty halls of cc and gg	neutral
amazing review very thorough with lots of details	positive
thanks for the review im a fan of the set but will be modding quite a bit have to get a small bar into the highlander and then turn the secondthird story above the barber shop into a proper apartment the detectives office is great and will stay as is	positive

awesome review okythanks for the cool writing and excellent photographyyour last photo could of had a cry ofyoull never take our candy well he does look mel gibson like  this set is a serious contender for best set for 2015 so much detail must buy one need to brainwash wife into buying me one 	positive
thanks very much i love it wub  it needs tweaking but isnt that half the fun incidentally when people were calling it rhino i thought it was just a reference to captain scarlet seeing the stickers in the middle made me realise my mistake buy buy buy	positive
thanks dude this is a great set can you please take more pictures thanks	positive
natelite on jul 15 2007 1220 pm said seems like they infuse system sets with more technic bars must be that technic isnt selling too well and they want to educate ppl how cool technic can be p its quite apparent when even the small bike needed technic frame my guess its less expensive and complicated to produce theyre also using these parts in other themes so in the end theyre producing a smaller catalog of bricks but every part gets produced in larger quantities	neutral
wow this year my wallet size has been bugging me sigh still its a goodlooking set and i will get it too many big sets	positive
thanks for that very interesting review snefroe1 y that vehicle looks really nice with a lot of playability but too much technic brick construction for my liking it seems like theres pretty much space wasted inside of it some kind of small laboratory or a room for the crew and at least a mining toolshed wouldve been cool	neutral

please build the alien craft im sure that we would all like a review of that 	neutral
sinner on jul 15 2007 0102 pm said incidentally when people were calling it rhino i thought it was just a reference to captain scarlet yeah me too thats a great programme is it not and i mean both new and old anyway i like this ill probably get it when it finally becomes available in the uk i think theres a few things ill mod but overall its very nice although its interesting and slightly creepy how much the lights at the front look like eyes and as ive said many a time before i love the motorbike edited by brainbox 16 july 2007  0111 pm	positive

nice review y i have quick question though do the crystals fit into the aliens hands try and stick one in therebecuase the new catalog shows an image of an alien holding a crystal lastly lego should have made the aliens with movable arms and no hole in the middle  i dont want to waste any money so i am only going to grab 1 or 2 of the smaller sets piranha editimo the aliens would win becuase they have superior technology and all they do is have to cut the airtank line and the humans die edited by piranha 20 july 2007  0140 am	positive
say i was looking at your pics and then at the instructions and i just realised  havent you put the stikers on the shield thingies in the middle upside down i think you did d i dont know if i like those new sets though i mean they have great shapes and potential but at the same time they seem so holey theyre really huge and big but full of empty air and space as well well this one not as much and indeed it is the best looking set of the lot though but i dont think ill go into that line	neutral
snefroe1 on jul 16 2007 0719 am said ok then ill do that later on but i will not touch that plastic residu xd you touched them to put them in their holders in the ship so in theory you will not review them anyways nice review i dont think ill get this though im trying to decide between this moble devastator or anothe 90 set i need to get something large before my bday regards vbbn	positive

i think the life on mars series was great although i didnt click until the line was gone that the red hangar on the alien base was for the red mech and same with the blue one man i was gutted when i realised that i want those mechs however the base was great with the small mech and the flying crafts could the lom mechs have been the spark of life for exoforce 8 edited by iamded 31 august 2007  0515 am	positive
lego 41062 elsas sparkling ice castle lego managed to get a frozen licensed set in the new wave of disney princess sets however im very surprised by the size its a 40 set and comes in a small friendsstyle box roughly 12x12 size  i almost didnt see it on the shelf when i was looking for it because its so small i mean i know its only 40 but its a friggin castle and why did lego only make this a smaller set if theyd made a 200 frozen castle they still would have sold every one they could produce they made big harry potter hogwarts sets and those sure sold and have you seen the toys in the frozen section of stores huge playsets for barbiesized dolls but i suppose im getting the cart before the horse here reviewing before ive even opened the box so name elsas sparkling ice castle set number 41062 pieces 292 price 3999 minifigs 3 theme disney princess year of release 2015 links bricklink peeron brickset the box the front of the box is standard lego fare other than the large anna and elsa in the bottom right corner oh and surprisingly nowhere on the box is the normal minifig lineup the only way to know what characters are included is to look at the set pictures the 11 this set uses one of the minidolls as the actual size sample thats probably not a bad choice since the minidolls are not nearly as well known as a minifig the back on the back the play features are shown in insets around a rear view of the castle like friends sets you also have an array of play accessories the seals is this standard on 2015 sets or is this specific to this set ive never seen 3 tape seals on a set even huge modulars or technic sets only have 2 so 3 on a set this small seems excessive perhaps lego expects people to try to steal the dolls if so why bother with extra tape a tiny pocketknife makes quick work of the tape so the third strip doesnt even slow you down the contents in the box are 2 instruction booklets bent a white plate a sticker sheet and 3 numbered bags of parts the stickers these are very hard to photograph since theyre shiny i mean polished chrome shiny those dark lines across the corners are not really there theyre reflections of my ceiling the manual backs the back of one booklet has a friends win girl the other has an ad for the lego disney princess website that site is so girly theres even sparkles following your mouse cursor around so i didnt stay too long or look too deeply the sample page the interior pages of the manuals are on lavender backgrounds its standard lego instructions with part callouts and insets when needed the build 1 the first thing you build is anna but im not showing that yet then you build this little picnic scene its tiny but effective and nice to have something not icy in the set since the movie has the in summer song for olaf im curious whats in that sandwich though  green and pink after the picnic is the olaf build but ill save him for later too the build 2 next is this small sleigh it has an amazing amount of style for something so small the curved front and decorative whips on the back make it look sleighlike instead of blocky but come on it already had pink accents are the pink flowers really necessary technically yes so the whips can mount to them but still its just overgirly for my taste the build 3 the sleigh needs a ramp to help it rocket along for a couple inches at least the ramp starts like this with a hidden lime green jumper plate that gets a cookie on it i couldnt remember anything in the movie like that so i asked my wife and she couldnt either a hidden cookie under a hill the build 4 after putting the tilting 2x8 onto the base and adding decorations this is the result a lime green bucket holding a pair of ice skates a flower in the snow really green and white round studs that i assume are supposed to be grass and snow the build 5 the sleigh looks huge sitting on top of the tiny hill but it actually works pretty well assuming youre on a smooth surface like a table you can give the sleigh a little nudge and itll shoot down the ramp and a few inches across the table the unevenness of the slopes vs the blue tiles holds the sleigh in line well and the bumps in the slopes dont seem to hamper anything the build 6 moving on to bag 2 man thats a lot of colors in this base already and im already starting to feel like theres transblue cheese thrown around randomly the build 7 continuing and rotating some steps and even more colors thrown in magenta in elsas ice palace i sure dont remember any of that the build 8 wait seriously an ice cream stand in the castle that is what the magenta is for i kinda actually like the looks of it but it doesnt fit the set the build 9 spinning back around now theres a light aqua spiral staircase added along with a roof this is where im really starting to wonder about legos thinking those light aqua stairs and the light aqua 1x4 tiles are exclusive to this set as far as i know its possible some other 2015 sets use them but nothing in bricklink yet seems expensive to produce to me when theres no huge reason to need them another blue for the tiles would have been fine and the spiral stairs really elsas castle is known for staircases but not spiral ones there should be a huge straight ice stairway out front or sweeping curved stairs inside but not a spiral the build 10 and now we finish the tree again why where is there a tree next to elsas castle and so weird with ice hanging from green branches that have both snow and flowers on them huh did lego watch a different movie the translight blue bits before looking at the upper level a brief pause to look at some other parts heres the 1x2x5 brick in translight blue and the 2x4x6 rock panel in glitter translight blue do those look like the same blue to you and again another unique part for this set why do those rock panels need to be glitter when lego made the same panel in trans light blue in 2013 and 2014 for superheroes friends and chima sets apparently disney really wanted glitter because there are a bunch of transglitter parts in the new princess sets theres transneon green cones for jasmine ariel jasmine and sleeping beauty all get glitter trans purple cones so theres a bunch of new glitter parts for 2015 the build 11 back to building  time to add the upper level we get a bedroom with a decent bed although stickered the build 12 the other side of the bedroom has some little accessories perfume and a crown i assume the build 13 time for walls and a roof i like the small white macaroni bricks for a wall but whats with the lavender fence piece in the center ill grant that it looks nice a common white fence would have been a little boring but its another unique piece to this set the build 14 the very top of the castle is built separately not a whole lot to say here other than why is there a torch in an ice castle the finished castle once the roof is put on the castle is done and that big purple star on top says everything to me about the styling it just doesnt look like modern lego to me it looks like this should be an old belville fairy tale set from around 1999 if i saw a photo of just the castle with no figs or picnic blanket id assume thats what it was the oops not actually done yet accessories at the end theres a few bits left to add there are these dark purple skis yup another unique part in the lower level let me tell you theyre a pain to get into that location at least with my big man hands more accessories the top level gets a stickered book the sticker has a nice castle image on it that is while not quite exactly the castle from disney world very disneylooking i actually had to google and see if thats the castle they use in their logo nope but its the same style the leftovers there are a lot of extra parts in this thats almost 10 of the part count in the set right there they are pretty useful overall though its great to have an extra carrot and brown branch for olaf since you know those will get lost as hes played with the figs finally the reason for the set lets face it the castle set is just an excuse to make these figures and theyre great i mean just fantastic the print on them is just such a good match to the real characters compare to the cartoon version from the front of the box elsas hair is a little darker than the cartoon but overall these are just dead on if i had to pick out a flaw its the spell elsa is holding its too bad she can only shoot it forward with her arm down like that itd be nice to have the end of the splash part bent 90 degrees so she can have her arm forward and the spell shooting forward too oh one other thing the minidoll heads dont press down tight to the body like minifig heads do theres still exposed neck it looks nice but it means elsas cape can swing around the fig backs elsas cape is glittery on the back and you can see the removable bow in her hair the full set one final issue when you put anna on the sleigh her cape doesnt have enough flexibility since its a wraparound kind and so it folds out funny thats why on the back of the box it shows her standing on the back of the sleigh with elsa in the seat edit how on earth did i forget to comment on those orange flowers to each side of the castle im pretty sure elsa did not have any flowers blooming outside her castle the conclusion hm i really wanted to like this set but i just cant quite bring myself to it feels like lego pulled a random castle design from the files then redid it into white and trans blue to look icy and allow a frozen tie in set the figs are great but the castle isnt i guess the real castle in the movie would be a boring set and this one has play features but it just is too different for my taste the ratings value 710  40 for less than 300 parts is high especially when so many of the parts are tiny but on the other hand theres a lot of rock panels and 1x2x5 trans blue panels but the figs help save it design 410  not one of legos best not as bad as the lows in the 90s but not a great set minifigs 1010  possibly even a 1210 they are the reason to buy the set  playability 810  there are a bunch of play features but they actually detract from the design so i had to knock off a couple points parts 710  a bunch of impractical unique parts how often do you need dark purple skis or a lavender fence piece but also a bunch of nice parts if you wanted to make your own icy scene overall 710  a great bunch of figs but id recommend not bothering with the manuals just use the parts to build your own castle thats better	neutral
i managed to get two sets for my twin girls for christmas and would have to agree with your ratings the anna and elsa figs are indeed excellent	neutral
isnt getting parts in new colors a good thing it is a shame there is only this one set i think tlg could make a whole subtheme out of frozen i do agree that they overuse lavender and magenta i dont see why every girl set has to have these sort of colors instead of what would be accurate to the source material 	negative

thanks for the review mostlytechnic i too wish they had done a real castle for this set it certainly deserved it my sons and i figure they could have used the old rock monster mold from rock raiders in white for the missing snow beast i will pick it up though for the figs and unique pieces	positive
thanks for the review i have the same opinion about the design looks like belville i bought it on legostore orlando december 30th it was impressive my wife saw them putting on shelf 8 or 10 boxes she ran and grabbed the last one the girls faces around it was indescribable mix of ecstasy and afraid to loose it it happened in less than 2 minutes my 7 yo girl didnt want it she likes the dresses but hates the movie prefers lego movie but my 2 yo girl who never saw the movie grabbed it for good and we bought it lego will sell it like water but i do not understand why a set so small it is the worst set design since the introduction of lego friends my 7 yo has more than 50 lego friends minifigures all the lego fiends stores and concluded that the castle had a terrible design she is 7 lets be honest lego should have released this sets months before this christmas and is loosing a perfect opportunity to sell a decent set with much more pieces i am wondering if they are going to make another set with the same characters at the end it is just for the minifigures	negative
when i first saw the pictures i didnt realize that this set had so much color barf going on in it also there is a bunch of stuff that does not fit in with the movie and it is pricey the minifigures are nice but no kristoff or sven i thought about getting this but this review is pushing me towards no	negative
i think the transglitter blue panels can be icy or snowy just fine im sure thats why they used them for this set now if youre looking for realism like the photos in your sig seem to be it might be tougher but ive been thinking about using those big glittery panels to make a waterfalltype scene	positive
well the good news for you is youre in luck whenever you find sets since the figs sell for a good bit of money  right now the bricklink value of the 3 figs is about 30	positive

bennemans on 13 january 2015  0608 pm said there is a very simple reason for the flowers and greenleaved trees you should remember from the movie it was actually summer when elsa set of the eternal winter… true but all around her ice castle it is all winter so why are there nonwinter bits in this set doesnt make sense the picnic is because they wanted a minivignette for olaf to fit into but the rest of the green and flowers dont make sense tenorikuma on 13 january 2015  0958 am said im pretty sure ive gotten other sets recently with three pieces of tape on them cool good to know was wondering but havent remembered to look when im at a store recently whitefang on 13 january 2015  0912 am said very nice review indeed and i also cant wait for the release of this set it will be a superb wonderful addition to the lego disney princess theme thanks for the fp but a lovely sweet review i thought i bashed this set pretty hard	negative

when i first saw pics of the biplane i wasnt sure if i liked it or not but after seeing it in more detail i gotta say i love the thing wub its a great plane with so many good aspects its also the perfect counter vehicle for the new batplane for me though the best part of the set has got to be the new pumpkin heads those are just beautiful and i cant wait to get lots of them	positive
great review funny as allways the comic was just a hell lot of fun it really had me laughing i would love to have this set but the price is just to high here far worse than i had expected ill be better off buying the battank which is much better priced actually there is almost no price difference between the batcopter and the battank here wacko	negative

out of nowhere this set appeared at my local tru hadnt been expecting this one for a while so a nice surprise sweet firstly the box nice pic on the front good selection of minifigs the officer and pilot look cool with their dark blue trousers a new r2 unit as well dont remeber this in the film but great to have one in a new colour wub back of the box shows some of the ships nifty features first thing you notice when you open the box is the awesome selection of bricks this makes a for a great parts pack loads of unusual red and dark red pieces its so refreshing to see a star wars set that isnt predominantly grey there are also two instruction booklets as soon as you open the first booklet you hit an error why would i want two obiwans  its also at this point that you come across a big disappointment on the box you get a flesh quigon what is actually in the box is an epiii obiwan come on lego  why change it  all the figures look impressive in the flesh despite the big mistake once i started the build it progressed rapidly red pieces seem to be a lot easier to find lots of clever techniques quite a few technic elements get used at the start it reminded me of building a technic set from the 80s at times here is the main body half way through the build the landing mechanism is a nice touch its not fully retractable but still folds away nicely you find the ship keeps tipping over as you build it despite the feet as its only at the end thay it all becomes evenly balanced at both ends here the feet are extended you can also see the yellow knob that rotates the radar on top of the ship landing gear up viewed from the front here are the radar a great collection of dishes they spin easily with little friction here is the ship at the half way point the front works well with the top flipping up to squeeze in the pilot more to come 	positive

whats up kernow nice review thanks for sharing welcome to eurobricks i hope you have fun here d xd that quigonn thing is weird come on lego someone is just asleep at the wheel over there with quality control missing pieces injections molds slipping quality ice cube traysimo thats a huge thing to miss the minifig on the box doesnt come in the setfalse claims anyway the ship looks beautiful and i wanted this set when i first saw it and your review confirms that it is very cool thanks again xd xd	negative
7665 review part 2 the second half of the build goes quicker than the first once you start to add the engines the ship really begins to take shape the main body of the ship has a few surprises hidden away under a removable cover inside you get some retracting guns a storage box a little shuttle and space for a droid and figure here is everything you can fit inside the guns are concealed behind the side vents pushing them forward causes the vents to open closed and open the final feature is the passenger areaescape pod inside is plenty of space for two figures the pod cleverly attaches by pushing the front section of the ship forward sliding the pod in then returning the front everything locks together and is held securely in place by an elastic band  heres a couple of pictures of the final model its not the most beautiful creation ever but it is an excellent representation of the ship from the film the angular shape actually suits a lego build well theres one more useful feature the whole ship can be safely and comfortably picked up by two ball ended technic pins towards the back end it balances well at this point and does allow you to swoosh the ship around much more easily this was the most enjoyable star wars build ive had in a long time everything progresses nicely with almost no repetitive bits the ship looks good and is also huge sweet compare it to the 6211 isd and youll see its only fractionally smaller when i first saw pictures of this on the internet i thought it looked ok once you see it for real it is much more impressive for 6999 in the uk im not complaining its the best value star wars set of the year so far to conclude pieces 910 minifigures 710 would be a 9 apart from the stupid quigonobiwan head error playability 810 originality 910 set design 810 overall 8210 the box says this is a limited edition set whatever that means so if youre planning to get it id suggest you grab it at the first opportunity im glad i did xd edited by kernow 22 july 2007  1056 pm	positive

brick miner on jul 31 2007 0746 pm said as for the set the thing that jumps out at me most is the use of dark blue for water im so used to seeing the classic blue for water that the dark blue seems weird i dont like it  bm indeed i only noticed this when i saw the sh images i guees that theyre on dark waters you can always put some trans blue and trans clear 1x1 round plates no i tried that technique to make the lava using trans red and trans orange plates it looks neat regarding the human soldier thing yoda mentioned its quite weird like him im going to swap the legs so theyre coherent with the soldiers from the other sets third note is it just me or did you attach the two black gate pieces too high shakar	neutral
shakar on aug 1 2007 0134 pm said third note is it just me or did you attach the two black gate pieces too high shakar no i think this is correct the upper plate with clip for the door is a little high on top of a dark gray 1x1 brick so if you want the door to operate well you have to place it like that i just put the clip under that brick a very easy fix so my door now is lower which looks better imho and no sneaky skelly can crawl along under it xd	neutral

yes very nice review mr brickster i think i  for a change like the castle part better the ship doesnt look quite right to me if theyre gonna make a pirate theme with ships like this i wouldnt be very happy but i think the ship brings some nice accesories like the anchor a black mid piece steering wheel etc i think ill buy it eventually wout on aug 1 2007 0819 pm said nice review i like the buildingport the most mmmdark blue plates wub pity it is a toysrus exclusive in the netherlands there are only toysrusses in the greater cities ah thats good to know now i wont be searching in other toystores as well thanks mr tiber	positive

excellent set the snowtroopers are just amazing most lego imperial troops are really good however its sad that except from luke all the rebels have the same face which is what is more the most unexpressive that you can find for the rest the quality looks excellent the snowspeeder is far better than the first they realized but only one thing it looks a bit too white to me i think i remember they were grey and orange rather than white in the film and the echo base door is really cool really nice set edited by lord beckett 02 august 2007  0414 pm	positive

review  42039  24 hours race car introduction when the preliminary images of the le mans racer surfaced somewhere last year 2014 it got a lot of praise this changed dramatically when the final images of the 24 hours race car showed up the front side of the car especially the head lights and the curvature of the side of car had changed a lot the car obviously still resembled the prototype but the new design raised a lot of eyebrows the new design was considered a step back instead of forward eventhough i still liked the design i must admit i liked the earlier design better too with the emphasis on past tense liked i am not sure anymore and this review will show you why like the arctic truck this set has a bmodel which is well worth checking out thats why this review includes both the amodel and bmodel for people who are on the fence the bmodel might actually convince them to buy the set after all lets see what this set is all about note all images can be clicked for hires versions set information number 42039 title 24 hours race car theme technic released 2015 part count 1219 box weight 2110 gr box dimensions 478 cm x 373 cm x 87 cm model dimensions 40 cm x 18 cm set price msrp €9999    £9999 price per part €0082    £0082 links brickset bricklink the box the box measures 478 cm x 373 cm x 87 cm and weighs well over 2kg 2110 gr to be precise the width of the box is the same as the box of the arctic truck this box also feels like its filled to the brim the front the front shows a picture of the main model in action with radial blurred wheels to emphasize the motion of the car the lower right section shows the dimensions of the model upon completion it will measure a length of 40cm and a width of 18 cm the back like the front the back side has exactly the same setup as the box of the arctic truck the top shows the functions of the model while the lower left side shows the bmodel and the lower right side shows the motorization options the picture of the bmodel looks so cool it could be a model of its own at this point i was very eager to build both models and compare them the side one of the sides usually shows a part in 11 scale this time its one of the wheels indicating the size of the model content of the box the box contains 1 booklet 1 sticker sheet 13 bags 4 tires instruction booklet since i own two copies of the set i also received two instruction booklets whats catching my eye is that my second copy is supplied in different packaging than the first one its for the first time that i am aware of that the instruction booklet and stickers come in a sealed bag without cardboard back hopefully this will be a new standard for all sets with sticker sheets instead of multiple booklets this set contains a single square bound book in earlier reviews i have epxressed my preference for a single book i dont see any advantage in having 2 3 or even up to 6 booklets sticker sheet like the actual model the sticker sheet looks very vibrant the bright green white and black color combination has found its way to the stickers as well either you love em or hate em since i started writing reviews i have been applying stickers and i am happy i started doing it stickers do give the model its finishing touch bags with parts thirteen bags with a total of 1219 parts give or take a few are supplied in the densily packed box the rims and flex are sealed in a bag as well sometimes looking at the bags makes you wonder what the logic is behind the distribution of the various parts across the different bags well this time it really got me confused take a look at two of the bags below theres a bag containing all the 3l blue pins then theres a bag with various partsand a single 3l blue pin i figured this might be an error but both of the sets have the same anomaly tires the tires have been supplied unbagged as usual highlighted parts this chapter describes new and interesting parts this set actually contains a lot of them this set also contains an abundance of panels if you arent into panels this isnt the set for you changeover catch this year 2015 the new changeover catch parts were released its a combination of three parts the advantage of the new parts is that the red gear is the same on both sides which avoids mounting it the wrong way around it also avoids the changeover catch slipping out of the driving ring like it used to do you can apply lots of pressure but the catch doesnt slip out pins some of last years new pins are also included in this set 12 x pin with pin hole and 21 x 3l pin with 1l axle securing technic beams can be quite simple with the new pin with pin holes the new 3l pin with 1l axle gives you more possibilities when connecting beams and other parts below are two example situations where the new pins have been used granted the examples below can be accomplished by using other techniques however some predicaments from the past can be easily solved by using these new parts like me you will most likely appreciate the ease of use engine and suspension also included are two steering portal hubs and steering portal hubs with ball joint arms and four steering portal axles for driving and steering the vehicle these parts are commonly used nowadays the picture below also shows some other parts like gear rack steering arms and suspension frames this set comes with a single 5x7 frame and three 5x11 frames panels this set contains a whopping 47 panels in three different colors i personally like panels a lot and i do appreciate the variety we have at our disposal lately this set even contains a new 13x3x2 curved mudguard panel new 13x3x2 curved panel this is the first set to contain the new 13x3x2 curved panel looking at the pictures doesnt do these panels justice in real life they are actually quite big i figured they would be smaller but they are even longer than the 11 x 5 frame with a length of 13 including the attachment points hopefully this part will be available in other colors as well preferably white for adding variety to your ev3 robot 19l white flexaxles the white 19l flex axles have only been released in a single set the 8461 williams f1 racer in 2002 current prices on bricklink are as high as 15 euros needless to say we are very happy with the return of these white axles now we can build jeroen ottens awesome alfa romeo 4c spider for a decent price as well i am really happy that useful rare parts are being used more often by tlg designers part list heres the complete list for all 1219 parts as you can see in the highlighted parts section this set contains a lot of interesting and useful parts if you dont own sets like the 8070  supercar this might be the set to pick up if you want to start building your own supercar the build enough with all the set and part information lets build the model rear suspension the build starts with the rear suspension and drivetrain as you can see in the picture below the length of the axle between the steering cv joint is 4l where it usally is 3l this is an indication that the finished model will be a bit bigger than usual 8070 for example the finished suspension is one of the cleanest suspension setups i have seen in an official model its pretty basic but it works like a charm this setup is defintely worth using in your moc heres a video after attaching the suspension to the frame you rotate the module and secure it at this stage the rear section of the chassis with suspension is almost finished v8 midengine extending the chassis forward results in the picture below where the front spoiler is already visible whats also visible is the v8 engine placed right in front of the rear axle resulting in a midengine setup perfectly suited for sports and race cars two exhaust pipes have been fitted on either side of the engine together with two hoses attaching them to the engine the instructions are easy to follow although you sometimes you need to bend the beams a bit minor improvements are possible here and there but nothing shocking front suspension the front suspension is a bit more complicated than the rear suspension which makes sense considering the fact it contains the steering rack the shock absorbers are placed in a different angle than the rear ones resulting in a somewhat stiffer front suspension all in all the front suspension is well designed and the steering rack can be easily powered with a servo motor the picture belows shows the front suspension attached to the chassis if you follow the official instructions to motorize the model the area in front of the suspension is used to mount the battery box when you are modding this model to make it full rc this area can be used to mount the servo motor gearbox like the gearbox in the 8070 its not used to switch gears powering the drivetrain its used to switch between two functions opening the doors and the hoodbonnet the gearbox is located at the left of the vehicle near the cockpit the mechanism to open the doors is located on the left side while opening the hoodbonnet is taking place at the right side to accomplish this some axles traverse under the cockpit to the other side of the vehicle following the axles to other side of the vehicle and adding some gears results in the situation below the video below shows the gearbox in action door opening mechanism the mechanism to open the door is comprised of some knob wheels links without stoppers and pins with towballs take a look at the doors opening and closing the front using the new mudguards and various other panels you finish the front of the car the front is probably the most controversial part of the car this is caused by the preliminary pictures shown before the release of this car in the early pictures the front of the car had smooth curves and beautiful lines while the final car lost these smooth lines and got a more blocky look in return i must admit that at a first glance the new design lost some of its appeal however this model grew on me pretty rapidly the headlight design can be found in more or less the same way on several real le mans type race cars the rear the rear of the car looks great with the stickers continuing from the mudguards to the panels underneath the spoiler the two exhausts sticking out give some details to the back i absolutely disagree with all the negativity surrounding this car maybe its one of those models which needs to grow on you finished model here it is the finished model i know some of you dont like the looks of the car but i think it looks great the color scheme is outstanding the new for technic bright green parts combined with white and black make this car look very vibrant and colorful i am not a big fan of the green used in the 42008  service truck but i do like this bright green a lot it fits perfectly well with the mindstorms ev3 set the curves on the side of the car are not as smooth as some of us hoped but i still think the car looks more than acceptable from the side the stickers add some nice details to the car giving it that characteristic race car look the model looks great in pictures but it does even look better in real life i love this picture of the front of the car however i do wonder if a dedicated 24 hour le mans racer has the seat and steering positioned offcenter using the good ol google machine i come to the conclusion that they do have centered seating and steering at least the majority of them theres ample space in the cabin which makes me wonder why tlg decided to place the seat offcentered the rear view looks cool too with some of the suspension showing and the two exhaust pipes clearly visible the bottom view is very useful to determine the size of the car in studs it measures approx 59 x 27 studs the chassis looks organized and well designed the engine has been placed close to the ground which is perfect for the weight distribution a low center of gravity improves the handling of the car i really enjoyed building this baby the build is very clean and organized although there are some steps where you need to bend the beams a bit to get things into place seeing the model come to life and seeing it grow to pretty impressive proportions is very satisfying for me it was fun but i reckon kids will go nuts over this set and the build size comparison what became obvious during the build but whats emphasized when you have finished the model is that its quite big the size of the car is pretty impressive the pictures below show the car next to the 42030  volvo l350f the side view emphasizes the size of the car its even longer than the volvo if you dismiss the bucket parts left some parts left nothing out of the ordinary features and functions unlike the bmodel this model doesnt implement any unexpected features the functions it does implement are exactly what you would expect from any car steering hog working fake engine suspension opening doors gullwing style opening bonnethood opening trunk gearbox for switching between functions unfortunately the steering wheel hasnt been linked to the hog hand of god steering mechanism placing the seat in the center would have provided an easy way to link the steering wheel to the steering mechanism its a shame we hardly see actual steering anymore opening the hood actually opens up the entire rear section of the car providing you with easy access to the motor compartment the mechanism to open the hood works properly which results in smooth opening and closing of it the same goes for the gullwing style doors both functions are operated manually and you need to switch with the lever to the left of the cockpit these two functions are also the ones which can be motorized by placing an mmotor near the cockpit and a battery box in the trunk all things considered i think this car offers lots of playability the model is solidly built and the functions are easy to operate id say its pretty safe to let your kids play with it bmodel unlike the amodel the bmodel for this set received almost universal acclaim and i can see why often the bmodel is a pale shadow of its part donor in this case the model looks so good it could be a model of its own it even incorporates a neat feature which actually deserves to be in the amodel theres a lot a variation in the quality of digital building instructions tlg is providing but these ones are of very high quality the picture below shows most of the chassis with suspension fake engine and gearbox in place finished model some concessions have been made but overall the car looks fantastic the black of the roof has been extrapolated from the hood which definitely works for me the rear section of the car feels a bit empty but the panels do cover up most of it so its hardly noticeable the v8 stickers will be upside down if you use the parts from the amodel since i could apply new stickers i have placed them using the proper orientation the bottom of the car shows the chassis its obviously a bit smaller than the amodels chassis features and functions taking the functions into account this model isnt playing second fiddle to the amodel besides the obvious functions like steering opening doors and hood this car features folding fog lights which deserve a better podium than a bmodel steering hog working fake engine suspension opening doors manually opening hoodbonnet manually opening trunk operated by gear folding fog lights operated by gear gearbox used to switch functions fog lights one of the most interesting features of the bmodel are the folding fog lights it almost feels a bit weird that a feature like this is implemented in the bmodel instead of the amodel below are 4 steps showing how the mechanism works i have also included a video the mechanism is somewhat reminiscent of fork mechanism used in the 8109  flatbed truck which has been described in effermans review take a look at the video to the fog lights in action parts left a fair number of parts left which isnt uncommon for a bmodel summary to summarize how i feel about this set you need to take a look at the picture below the combined image reflects the quality of this setor better yetsets you actually get two great models for the price of one you dont like the amodel no problem you can have lots of fun with the bmodel i cant stop playing with the fog lights its mesmarizing the color scheme on both models is outstanding i simply cant emphasize enough how well this color scheme pleases the eye the regular green is dull and boring but this bright green really pops out especially when combined with black and white and possibly some red details black white and a little red sounds familiar yes bright green can easily be combined with your ev3 robots so while you are combining the bright green with your robot why not use the great new curved mudguard panels these new panels are introduced in this set and they look great they open up a lot of possibilities in the design department the build of the amodel is outstanding it is fairly simple but since its so clean i really enjoyed it a lot i think the build should be entertaining which doesnt mean it needs to be a real challenge and lets be honest when is a build really challenging the rear suspension is a good example of why i liked the build its very simple yet very effective works like a charm the same goes for the other functions in both models and the star of the entire show can be found in the bmodel hows that for a surprise being aware of the fact that i like this model a lot better than most of you seem to do i really encourage you to give this model a chance the sheer size is impressive the color scheme is awesome and you get a bonus model which is actually worth building score okay so how do i grade this set 8 design open to debate but i like it a lot 8 building experience fun and clean build 9 features superb function in bmodel steels the show 9 playability both models offer lots of playability 8 parts lots of new parts and cool existing parts 10 value for money two models for the price of one 87 twice the fun i hope you enjoyed this review

i think this set will be my next purchase i love the color scheme and indeed it looks like a nice set also 1200 parts for eur 100 is not a bad deal and yes the looks of the car have really grown on my since the first official pictures appeared im curious how the bright green will work combined with other colors than white i really hope more sets in the future will use the color so that more different parts will be available over time i think im the only person on eurobricks who doesnt like the looks of the b model but i appreciate the extra functionality it offers besides the set itself i think this is one of the best reviews i have read in a while great job on the superb photographs which i think are essential to a review and the extensiveness of it all you really touched every subject which is great d	positive

fantastic review jim from the quality of the review alone it is easy to see how much hard work you have put into it im with you on the instruction manual i much prefer one quality bound book over umpteen stapled booklets already have 2 of these sitting in the build queue one for display model as im a fan of this one and one to build the b model then dissemble for parts so im already sold on his set but still very much enjoyed taking the time it deserves to read through the review and ogle at your pro photography	positive
this is a mega review youve taken the right pictures and the video demonstrations of the mechanisms really help get the good points of the set across whats more amazing is that the review still feels very concise and to the point youve actually convinced me to put this set on my list and not just as a decent parts pack lasse d on 12 march 2015  0847 pm said  the front shouldnt open like that  instead it should be easy to remove the whole front cover leaving the suspension easy to work on  the aero seems to be realistic except for the rear end where theres no indication of a venturi channel this should have been easy to include  there is no fuel tank nor fixed fuel connector right behind the cabin  there are no air jacks seriously this is one of the most unique features of a race car like this and lego forgot about them instead they automated two functions which are manual on a real race car  the top cars at le mans are hybrids with ingenious systems i would have loved to see the front wheels connected to some kind of spinning apparatus indicating a kinetic energy recovery system im not sure air jacks are the feature that will have people fawning over this set and pneumatics are being covered rather well later in the year  but i agree with everything else most notably removable front and rear bodywork the removable engine cover on 8674 would be a good starting point here and the inclusion of some nod towards a hybrid system its also worth remembering the preliminary design did have the big honking fin bhf that is mandatory on all current prototypes so maybe when that was removed any trace of a tunnel or diffuser went with it on the subject of steering wheels all modern prototypes actually have left or right hand drive the regulations demand that both lmp1 and lmp2 cars are nominally capable of seating two people of course in practise the extra seat is taken up by the hybrid system in lmp1 and electronicsextra cockpit access in lmp2 however this doesnt change the fact that it would be easy to link the steering wheel to the hogfront axle edited by jay psi 12 march 2015  0955 pm	positive

awesome review jim i love the pictures i dont like how lego did this model though too many compromises edited by omikron 13 march 2015  0724 am	neutral
a great review jim just finished building this set a couple of steps required abit of lego stressing to get together when there was an easier way just made it into rc  almost finished it in ldd which was easy to do as it has so much room for nearly any configuration of motors and not have them showing a great set edited by jonorocky 13 march 2015  1053 am	positive
true but i must say i like the new colour very fresh looking compared to the rather dullish regular green cant wait to build mocs with it	positive
i have been waiting for this set since the pictures for the toy fairs eirlier in the year and i am glad to say i am not disapointed first the price it is not cheap at 9999 but i guess that is typical for a set with this amount of electronics in itthere is no parts count and i have not had time to add up the 2 pages of contents to get a figure first the box standard flip top with large internal picture and rip to open lid inside there are no numbered bags in this set which i prefer i like to open all the bags and put all the parts in the box before building next is a picture on the electronics 2 xlmotors as lego describe them and 2 standard motors 2 ir receivers and 1 ir transmitter i know these have been discussed before but i really like the thought that has gone into the transmittersreceivers each receiver has 2 outputs to corespond with the 2 controls on transmitter they also have a choice of 4 channels so one transmitter can control up to 8 independant motors by changing the channel switch the transmitter also has a neat motor direction switch so you can configure the transmitter operation the set comes with three manuals 1 is the main drive mechanism 2 is the cab and engine and 3 is the attachments front and back there is also the now standard parts list in the back of the third manual there is no alternative model instructions despite the pictures of one on the box however there is a reference to the technic website on the back of the box but at the moment the page only has an advert saying the set is to be released on 1st september so i guess i will have to wait untill then to see if the instructions will be online the build is fairly straight forward the main chassis is studless the next picture shows the motors mounted into the chassis and the drive for the shovel and claw it also shows the v6 technic engine this next picture shows the ir receivers mounted on the back the battery box slots into the back and can be easily slid out with the removal of two pins which is useful because i can imagine i will need to change the batteries on a regular basis the next 2 picture are of the completed model overall i was very happy with the finished dozer the functions work really well and as i have the monster dino i have used a second transmitter so i dont have to touch the channel switch i have included some video on my brickshelf page unfortunately this set does suffer from some quality issues for example moulding marks on the plates colour diferences some of the pins not finished properly some pins were very stiff and quite hard to push into the holes but the worst issue was an axle that would not turn freely in a hole which just adds extra friction into the system i am glad to see some studded technic in this set i much prefer sets that use both varieties of technic beam there are only 2 fairings which is a great improvment over recent sets if tlc had tried to make the bulldozer shovel with fairings this would have been a complete disaster marks for the set 810 for price with the number of motors i expected it to be greater 910 for fun my kids love this type of set that does something when finished 610 for quality tlc really need to work on this one 810 overall i would definately get a second one if i see it in the sales feel free to post questions but i will be on holiday next week more pics and videos available here	positive

grand moff viceroy on aug 3 2007 0132 am said excellent review thanks what is the cost in us not released in my area the shovel is obviously my favorite area it looks detailed and strong i love the treads because i need them to move the 4 x 4 barrels on my superscaled turbolaser turret very good pics too what color are the treads i never had them they are plastic or rubber the treads are dark grey i not too good with naming colours the treads are the same as in the snowmobile set released earlier in the year they are a hard plastic	neutral
ah mani wanted to review it with mine oh well here in the us it cost 150 and has 1355 pieces total the pins and axles did seem a bit difficult in putting them into place a problem i have been having is the batterys are done after about 4 hours of play which i really wish they would last longer   overall it is a stupendous set and it is really nice to see our old friend the studs make a return	neutral

thanks for the review it really looks cool too bad its soo expensive  i must admit that i prefer the 8421 mobile crane for more or less the same price the design is more sexy wub	neutral
thanks for the great review of this set ive been looking forward to it as well and i am excited about the wireless controls like the dino i too am curious if this set has been released here in the us i was told that it was a sept 1 release i agree about the battery life my dino set lasted about 4 hours too	positive
thanks for the review this looks like a great set and with four motors two receivers and a remote control i wouldnt say it is overpriced it is still a lot of money though if my scholarship permits it i will seriously consider buying this set	positive
i cant wait to get my paws on this dozer  the new motors look very interesting and i it will be fun to see which possibilities they have in any future mocs	positive
thank you very much for that neat review ickelpete y your picturesre very interesting and your videos really good that set looks very beautiful to me a formidable new technic set that quicklyll turn into an everlasting classic for sure  im just a little sorry for those quality problems well i hope that tlcll work on that matter and fix it soon 8	positive
ickel thanks for that awesome review it makes me want to buy this set i think itd go just swell with the mobile crane the fact that it has all the motors and such is awesome i can foresee using those for a lot of other functions for mocs and well im a fan of treads you can never have enough treads d hm would you be able to tell us perhaps after a test or two what kind of weight this beast can push around thank you	positive

thank you ickelpete for that great review i give you two y up i am not a technic fan but this set definitly looks sweet  i see great potential using this set as a model for a smaller dozer for my towntrain layout i really wub the crawler tracks they used i have been thinking about buying the snowmobile for the tracks but if possible i just might buy this set instead i could definitly use the other parts for mocs model on	positive
eyesonly on aug 10 2007 0416 pm said when i read this i first though you meant set number but this model cant be found there yet and now i realize that you mean something completly different what is this code youre after there is a additional code in the booklet different for every one you should find it from the front or back cover also later editions have different codes some examples set 7905  4497674 front cover bottom left set 8421  4284910 book 1 and 4284922 book 2 back cover bottom right ill bet the code is then used to abuse the lego cache  mig	neutral
the new small technic sets have incredible functionality for their size and this one is no exception with only 106 parts this crane can roll extend rotate lift and hold in any position and has working stabilisers the boom extends the same as the other sets with this boom simply pull it it works surprisingly well and due to circular ridges inside the boom the extension which is just a standard beam will hold in place the gear at the back controls the height of the boom as you can see the boom is only half extended boom fully extended half down the cable is kept in place via two gears and a blue pin same as the 7905 crane even under decent weights this works well the stabilisers however cannot handle much weight once the load is moved off axis the stablilsers are a very simple but effective design another shot of the stablilsers this also shows how far the boom will decend the boom height mechanism works well also i love the cab design overall this is a remarkable achievement for the low price i bought it for the boom piece as i want to improve the crane that came with 7998 7898    i highly recommend it	positive
very nice review sinner y wub so we are getting more and more reviews with figs in it thats great  i actually wanted to skip this technic set but your review made me think again i havent seen you posting a price so i will do that for you p  its just 999 in germany	negative

alright so i usually do quick photo reviews when i get new sets thats what ill do here but theres quite a few photos so i thought i might as well make its own review thread so i got the kwikemart by paying just2much on an early ebay copy i think its worth it as this week im gonna be super busy so i was able to build it saturday and stuff heres my video review i think its one of my best well lets get onto this photo review the set is 200 usd with a little over 2100 pieces the official release is april 15th for vip members may 1st for everyone else at lego stores and if you want full size pictures check out my flickr by clicking here the minifigures included are great you get three exclusive minifigures one being a completely exclusive character the first time lego has ever put an exclusive mould in a direct to consumer set and you get three of the series most popular characters in their normal attire for those who missed out on the first simpsons minifigures series the kwikemarts exterior is loaded with lots of sticker details the only printed detail youll see in the exterior is the dial pad in the phone booth which has appeared in some other licensed themes since last year   right here is there the store can be opened a simple technic pin and receiver keeps it in place and allows for opening and closing the roof of the store includes the garden shown in the paul mccartney episode the roof can be slided outin once you open it with the hinge part heres a look at the store with the roof removed the floors are a nice sand blue color coming with 8x16 thin plates and for the interior from the view of the store opened with the hinges at the back that i mentioned earlier the left front corner which includes some arcade machines of bonestorm and great white hunter an amazingly done buzz cola soda machine juice machine the checkout counter ect the right front corner with food aisles freezers and a frozen jasper sticker the back left corner which includes some nice coffee kettle builds the donut tray hotdogs ect the right back corner which has a door leading to a very small hallway that only has a mouse and cheese in it the hallway leads to the employees only door in the back and its very hard to get in the door way not that theres anything to do inside there also included is clancys copcar which fits three figures heres a look at the piece list in the instructions click on each to be lead to an enlarged version of the pic also included are some awesome printed pieces and two unprinted coffee cups honestly i think this set is perfect the price is fantastic and has a great ppp ratio they really went above and beyond by including snake in this set i honestly think its better than the simpsons house in terms of accuracy and the value here so many cool pieces printed and in exclusive colors so thats my quick picture review hope you guys enjoyed and id love to hear your thoughts	positive

thanks for the review i cant help but think the minifigures are the weak part of the set snake and apu are great but the rest i dont know they kinda redundant now they could at least give us new torso printing like homer wearing his jacket or bart wearing his blue tshirt or marge wearing her coat or as i said in the discussion thread id have included jasper in cmf series 2 and a frozen version here overall the set looks kinda smaller than what i thought snakes bag needed a  symbol printed because it looks like he is stealing gargabe  pretty good review overall	positive
thanks for all the feedback you guys robert8 on 12 april 2015  1125 pm said i cant help but think the minifigures are the weak part of the set snake and apu are great but the rest i dont know they kinda redundant now they could at least give us new torso printing like homer wearing his jacket or bart wearing his blue tshirt or marge wearing her coat or as i said in the discussion thread id have included jasper in cmf series 2 and a frozen version here overall the set looks kinda smaller than what i thought i agree but so many people were complaining about how the simpsons house should have included the most common versions mostly because the eyes or whatever so i think lego played it safe and just included the normal versions it makes sense since series 1 is gone forever and the common versions were in there and this set is bound to be in stock for a very long time like the death star i never really agreed when people were complaining about the alternate eye prints personally but i guess this is a good business choice based on previous feedback edited by just2good 13 april 2015  1206 am	negative
hello everyone excellent review english is not my native language but i want to express my opinion simpsons house was the first of its kind and i can say without exaggeration that this is the most impressive set that im going my collection httpbricksetcomsetsownedbyceleb  i look at the video from the kwikemart and is difficult to say how good it is compared with the house the main disadvantages that i said to myself is this build the walls of the large panels next is access to the roof gray parts in front of the back door i think they represent the stairs is not on the level with doors on the roof and when you open them you can see the white block is openly trash my points of view boxes on the left of go to the store and powersauce box i want see make real and not just a cube fe such as in the unreleased star wars set about minifigures i fully agree with robert8 two more of the same homer marge and bart personally i put my set as a scene and all the replays minifigure are inside the house that was not identical characters next and also absolutely terrible barts accessory this set is made parking for bikes and it looks very cool but damn it is hoped to see the bart or lisas bike instead of useless balloons with paint the walls are made with convex inside panels why so can anyone know have not seen any pictures with such walls in tv show why did not they turn i personally really like how realized roof but my brother says that it is terrible  garden could do more in the series there were almost jungle i do not know how to be considered here maybe anyone can express any opinion or idea i look at the simpsons house and then look at the photo of this emart i can not understand in the house we have a garage two floors cool floor a lot of furniture all the rooms and walls collected from cubes many additional accessories and where is all this detail here it looks much smaller maybe even poorer if they still will release next year comic book store it will be even less of course it is difficult to estimate without seeing it live we have it will be sold only in may at first sight it does not look so impressive as the house can certainly the case in the limit on the amount of detail but why it was impossible to add  50 to the cost and make jasper the more detailed the roof the walls of the smaller elements that it was not convex sad thanks all for attention edited by celeb 13 april 2015  0510 am	positive
can you post a pic of it next to the simpsons house just curious about size comparisons	positive
i have sooo mixed feeling about that i loved the simpsons house save for the terrible wall in the homer and marges room but this so far is inferior in almost every aspect the walls made of panels is a bummer i expect a d2c set to be better that this 60 stickers the same thing same price for less bricks and smaller build then the house strange coloured bricks on the outside wall some ugly mix of yellow  tan panels again with their fronts facing towards the inside of the shop so we and up with those squares all around the walls are yellow this was so nice lost opportunity to make it in some other less common colour then again the set overall looks is good the roof is a nice detail the shop looks actually like a real one not just an approximation of one the roof tiles are in dark orange  we got newrare colour here the car looks interesting to build just like the pink one from the house lots of nice references to the show its the simpsons definitely a must buy but for a discounted price ill try to find one with maybe damaged box or afterdisplay copy edited by mestari 14 april 2015  0115 pm	negative

one thing that may justify the price it has 527 different parts if i counted correctly i alway heard the more different parts the more difficult the set is to produce the simpsons house already had an astonishig amount of different pieces but this one is even more extreme	negative

nice review im building it need to finish it but im at work right now with the printed piece you forgot to show the chocolat milk 1x1 brick which is exclusive to this set yet it isnt referenced on bricklink yet only the blue one the set is really fun to build with a lot of little pieces for the fridges i havent put the stickers yet will see the final product to put the essentials ones	positive
did anyone else have a problem with the piano against the wall of the simpsons house it just kept coming off way too easily and i was getting really frustrated with it sticking out and not fully going on so i had to put the two tiles that hold them one place over away from the wall for it to sit properly without falling out i think i might put snowball ii behind it since cats love to hide underneath or behind things lol but just curious to know if anyone else was encountering this problem with the previous set	positive
i recently acquired 90 of this set so i thought i would do a review of it please note that half of the minifigs are wrong and there are some part substitutions this is the only set that comes with this plate there is a depression under the grey plates to the back the pool depression can be easily covered by three quarter circle plates which just happen to be included in this set good set design lego the stairs are old fabuland ones and have been used in a few other sets this is the only one that has them in parapink however what is the difference between parapink and pink dunno the big windows are in only two other sets both of them dacta ones the smaller ones were in one other paradisa set the interior while simple works very well i love the coffee machine a cute car came with the set as well the bird house is a nice idea as well once the current visitors leave i will probably be breaking this set i wish lego would go back to these sets as they always had some great parts in them	negative
nice review of a surprisingly interesting set y those windows are great and no doubt difficult to get classic coffee maker simple yet exactly right that baseplate was in a few other sets but never with that pattern would have made a great base for some of the classic 80s houses lego used to treat us to in tan was part of the adventurers egypt sets as recently as 2001 it was a base for ogel versatile plate that hopefully hasnt disappeared completely parapink is apparently light pink on brickshelf so i guess its just lighter than normal pink and stopped appearing in 1995 just so you know that monkey is drinking too much and likely to fall in the pool  	positive

due to a larger bl order in the us i couldnt resist to add two hopper waggons to my train layout heres a review of this fantastic set the box well theres nothing really special about it the open box with three polybags note that there are only three different colors used in that set actually there are 4 but you cant see the dark grey ones great color composition by the way wub and  no stickers   d oooops  i opened the bags too fast help me im drowning sing not following the instructions i built the wheels first to get the larger pieces out of the way keep on rolling this is the load of the hopper waggon 11 round bricks altogether when i opened the set i was curious if it was a new colored set or an old one luckily enough it was an old one with old dark grey i dont know if tlc ever produced this set with bley from the following pic you can clearly see that the set is an old one look at these slope bricks see what i mean all bricks are looking exactly the same buy a set today means get at least three different textures on the slopes and maybe even more shades of tan x  i have said that in many other threads here and im saying it again back to the roots lego you were able to produce good quality show us you can still do it sad but now to the building its a 6 x 24 train base plate youre building on did i say i liked the colors d this is the mechanism to unload the waggon built in the waggon with open gates  and with closed ones almost done this is the first time i realized that minifigs actually can step on those ladders  a short lift and the wheels are fixed this darn mechanism wait im coming with my monkey wrench  who opened that door again do i have to do it all on my own  finally the work is done now have a brake one shot from the frontback you can see the car is really huge 8 i put it behind the red car of the 4512 that sure looked very strange wacko the set fits a lot better to the other cars of the my own train theme than to the older ones the score brick selection 1010 excellent color and brick selection these were the days playability 910 great unloading mechanism pricepiece count ratio 810 at peeron it says 20 i got it for 3995  30228 bricks not really cheap but worth every cent  overall rating 910 and a definity must buy for rolling stock lovers sad enough its not available on sh any more but there are still sets on bl and ebay thats for now folks thank you for reading i have some job to do	positive

yes my spongebob fans its time for another review  lets look at our bikini bottom map and head strait to meet miss puff at her boating school she is waiting for us to give us a guided tour of her establishment  another bit of sb history this set comes from the following episode boating school spongebob fails his boating test for the 38th time what a freaking retard lool hes so determined to get his license that patrick decides to help him he implants a walkietalkie inside sbs head in order to cheat and tell him what to do you will say that i am biais but i really enjoy building this set and i really like the sb theme  lets hope 2008 brings more of that cool spongieness  but i digress here are general pics of the instruction booklet and the dss g there are loads of crappy stickers in that one also  as you can see the set is divided in 3 polybags shamelessly but nonetheless wilfully hehe i will disregard the third one which is that playability crap course  i would have reviewed it but since it involves stickers i didnt want to ruin the parts and without stickers it would look dull plain and ugly it does look crappy with so imagine without so that review will not be 100 complete and i do apologise in advance but how many of you would have build that and keep it hehe off p 1 mfs and extras i will start with the really cool miss puff wub the fig mind you  she looks a bit stressed  no wonder that sponge menace will bring her to the hospital once again hehe as you can see that mf comprises 3 parts the small blue 1x1 round and the 2 major parts yeay another great stupid looking sb i love those idiotic faces  3 different sb figs and 3 idiotic faces hehe you never can get enough of them  here is just a regular patrick too bad patrick doesnt have different expressions  the pull back boat car nothing really to report except the fact that i left it sticker free  the only thing i built from the third polybag is that pretty cool ancker holding tower thingie  looks great in a lighthouse set hehe yes the roud tile bouey is printed  its the same as in sbs bed in the bikini bottom set  ok its time for those two great buildings the lighthouse and the school  pontoon  before reviewing them individually here is a general pic 2 the lighthouse one of the main reason to own that great set  sure it suffers from accute stickeretite sad but d  t worst is that door but nonetheless a great and simple building  great whitered colour scheme and a really fantastic 2 turning lights  i really like the yellow top of the lighthouse it adds to the comic atmosphere of that theme instead of having a more plain redwhite only the rear has nothing really fancy except tools to fix it in case of problems hehe the only thing i modified since i didnt build the third polybag is that i got rid of the trechnic parts on the right of the lighthoue to replace them with regular logs all hail the tower king  d 3 the school and pontoon i really like that little building and its great to see that once again tlc uses the amazing dark blue color  its really a simple design but looks fantastic and can be used for many things in a town hehe i also really like the combination with those dark bluish grey slopes  the rear reveals the desk stickers on the wall doh  and two clams serving as chairs really like on the show its really great to see that tlc stays really as close to the show as possible the pontoon again is simple yet really cool and effective and its really nice to have 2 lifesaving boueys the only thing i modified since i didnt build the third polybag is that i got rid of the trechnic parts in front of the pontoon to replace them with regular logs on the overall i think its really a great set  apart from the crap stickers i think tlc should have ditched or simplified the third playability polybag to lower the cost  oh well parts are always usefull except those one part shitty palm trees  so until my next review i bid you farewell my spongebob fans  and i really hope to see next year hehe will sb get his drivers license one day  for the sake of bikini bottom lets hope not  no license ever on  yoda	positive
thats really a great and overall nice playset with a very cool mrs puff and a fine new spongebob sweet the boating schools indeed very nice with a beautiful color scheme and so is the lighthouse im really tempted to buy a second set just to complete these buildings although its a little too expensive for doing so and it wouldnt even fit with the style of the other sb sets xd wet highway to the poor puffer fish privat hell on d	positive
i like this one better than the other one for parts and such plus im generally a sucker for any different minifig but yeah that price is steep great review though	positive
one more sb face  yeah wub being a lighthouse freak i really like it the trans clear blue ones rocks y im getting it  period sb on copmike	positive
another great review thanks yoda man those smooth slopes really look like crap when on a roof  that was the whole reason they had texture in the first place  ill never liked those they feel so cheap the new sb head is great and can mrs puffs legs move i just ask since her feet are separate and in figs where the legs cant move theyre usually one piece at the bottom to keep them from breaking off the set looks great and seems to have a lot of playability	positive
nice review  im not a big fan of those spongebob figs however this set has some very useful pieces this is actually the first time i took a decent look at a spongebob set	positive
man that spongebob head cracks me up hilaritythis is a cool set although i much prefer the chum bucket set i dont see whats wrong with the course then again i can see why afols wouldnt like it its just playability really i like the breakable wall though the building is cool a few modifications ie making it more realistic real chairs for a start and it would make a cool little wharf for your lego town and to sw4j mrs puffs legs are connected at the feet if you look closely so thanks for the great review yoda	positive
thank you yoda for strike 2 its sb again  sticker alarm x but this set is better than chum bucket there are far more interesting parts if you dont like sb especially the light house and the little hut with the wooden pontoon y and yet again another set with smooth slopes and rough ones too bad too bad    if i just knew the person who is responsible for that 	positive
nice review mate the set looks great and a real must for all those sb fans out there the whole set scream playability thats for sure which is great because lets be honest theirs gonna be alot of kids and yoda out their playing with it p xd   geezzzzz what is it with all those bloody stikers this set would be soooooo much better with printed pieces instead of those still once your over that at least the rest is ok am i the only one who thinks mrs puff kinda looks like a kinder egg toy theirs nothing wrong with that mind you yes i have a kinder problem xd  just seems strange to me	positive
maybe mrs puff has a nice toy inside xd i like this review the lighthouse part and the school are nice enough for other towns and the figs are nice even mrs puffs 2 pieces you cant use for other things  pity that its 50 dollars 60 euro for half price i would think about it	positive

the set and the other designer sets that came out with it especially 4888 are incredibly well designed sets i wish lego would go back to doing sets like these as i loved the multitude of instructions and ideas the last batch of creator sets had zero ideas even though i know several were made  anyway less whining more review the lion is the main model his mouth doesnt fully close but it does open more the head works well from most angles i love the dark orange bricks great for rust he is quite solid but the joints take the weight well the neck goes side to side and rotates but doesnt go up and down the body is built in two parts and pinned in the middle with what is left you can make what i think is a hyena a silly plant moc and what i believe is a vulture there are also instructions for a few other models including a bat boar and a snake which i quite like he can be built at the same time as this cute little lizard overall this is a great set with an excellent blend of colours and pieces i wanted it for steampunk potentials sweet i hope you liked the review till next time	positive
thank you for the nice review sinner i also bought this set but in combination with 4883 when it was on sale 50  hurray at sh i made a short review of 4883 but wasnt really sure what to tell about 4884 so im glad you did that for me d i have different feelings about this set on the one hand i love the lion he is really impressive even my wife not known for being lego enthusiastic asked me if there were more animals of this kind the lion is  restricted  poseable and the colors used are fantastic wub 3 models can be built simultaneously  thats great on the other hand i still dont know what to do with these rotation joints wacko and the other models are somehow disappointing compared to the lion i seem to have missed the little lizard  i put it on my to dolist like all the creator sets great parts pack  but wait until they get on sale xd for me  i had a lot more fun with 4883 indeed roarrrr on 	neutral

lego 75915 pteranodon capture im glad to review this nice set 75915 pteranodon capture name pteranodon capture set number 75915 pieces 174 price 1999 minifigs 2 theme jurassic world year of release 2015 links box the front of the box has the jurassic world logo along with the set number piece count etc its a decent box size for a 20 set here it is compared to a minifigure heres the back of the box it shows all of the features from the set an ad for the video game the back also shows a small picture with a silhouette of the dinosaurs from the line along with their set numbers instruction booklet the booklet shows the same thing as the front of the box nothing more nothing less near the back of the booklet there is a picture with all of the characters from the sets the other page shows all the dinosaurs with a mini box that shows the size comparisons the minifigures the minifigures in this set are simon masrani and an acu both of them have excellent printing on the front and the back the gun is the same one from tlm that the ssp used simon masrani is the only one with a double sided face his second face shows a scaredworried expbbression he has a zipped up jacket or jumpsuit with a shirt underneath the acu trooper only has one face which is a scaredworried expbbression i would have a scared expbbression too if i was about to get eaten by a dinosaur he has great detail on his torso and legs lets take a look at the vest the vest is the same mold from the ssp in tlm i think it has the letters acu on the front too the back is nothing interesting pteranodon the pteranodon has great printing too the colors match the ones that the pteranodons from the movie have the wings mouth and head are a rubbery type of plastic and are easily bendable it uses the same mold from the pteranodon in the 2012 dino line heres a comparison between the two spare parts the spare parts arent many just a few extras the helicopter at first the helicopter was meh when i first saw it on the box now that ive built it ive got to say that i really like it its my favorite helicopter of all of the ones ive built its sturdy and sleek its not too bulky either the first play feature in this set is the net launcher it works pretty well not one of my favorite features but it does what its meant to do the other play feature is on the other side its a stud shooter which can be used by a minifigure you can put it on their hand or you can leave it there and let someone operate it the shooter can fold up inside the helicopter as well there are stickers on both sides of the helicopter and they also have the jurassic world logo with dino marks final verdict value 910  for 20 this set isnt that bad the parts count is a little low for a 20 set but the price is probably because of licensing other than that its a great deal i wouldve hoped for maybe some bait for the pteranodon but that can easily be fixed design 910  i really love the way this helicopter looks its sleekness and design is great the only flaw this has is the huge net launcher its too big in my opinion minifigs 1010b  the minifigures are extremely detailed and it even includes an exclusive minifigure playability 910  there are many things you can do with this set the swoosh factor is great and so are the play features parts 1010b  theyre useful parts and there isnt many huge specialized pieces in here either overall 910  this set is great for fans of jurassic world its also a nice parts pack theres one exclusive minifigure in here too which makes it even better having a little fun with the set hope you liked my first review here on eurobricks please leave any suggestions on what to improve thanks edited by thelazychicken 02 may 2015  1019 pm	positive
thanks for the review i really like this set i love the acu minifigures and the dinosaur is really nice i think the helicopter has great potential for a shield helicopter only suggestion is that some of your pictures are a little bit dark especially the box front one but really good for your first review thanks a lot	positive
i love the dinos in these sets but aside from that the builds imo kind of suck just like the last dino sets this just has a franchise connected to it and honestly i hope it does well enough to spark more dinojurassic parkworld interest because i want to see more dino minifigures maybe a brontosaurus or something i will most likely be buying many of the dinosaur minifigures here however i doubt ill buy the actual sets or the genetically altered dinosaur which can only work for jurassic world this set is imo average love the dinosaur	negative

robin creations on 04 may 2015  0207 am said nice review although that picture of the ad reminded me of how some of the things surrounding jurassic world lego that is seems hastily put together just look at that the minifig he is star lords head and hair indiana jones torso with different arms and city legs to me that seems a bit weak especially for a video game oh yeah i just noticed that	neutral
yesterday i went to toys r us and bought the dilophosaur ambush beside that the shop had a display of the jw polybags for €349 i picked up two of them now here is my little review of this pretty nice set first some data line jurassic world year 2015 pieces 29 price €349 packaging polybag ok lets start with the polybag itself it is a standard size and had plenty of room for all the parts the front depicts the whole set with a little hexagon on the right with a seperate picture of the dinosaur and its name in this case the celophysis is called gallimimus weird choice next is the instruction sheet it is a doublesided paper with every building step in clear sight the part selection is nice there are only a few but all of them are pretty usefull for all kind of builds there are two parts which stoodout both are printed tiles the first one is the yellowblack warning tile in 1x4 you cant have enough of that the second one is a 2x2 tile with the jurassic world logo on it thats pure awesome the bigger sets seem to have only sticker for that so this little set is a perfect way to get hold of this nice tile the leftovers nothing special here is the complete trap it is a basic build and functions pretty well in the end the parts are more interesting as the build so it will definitely end up as a partspack now on to the star of this bag the celophysisgallimimus i dont know why lego decided to call this dinosaur mold any different but i think it has to do with movieconnection and the will to not produce a new mold nevermind this figure is great and the colour is very bright and totally stood out pretty beastie a comparison between the 2015 gallimimus and the 2012 celophysis the final set in all its glory final verdict it is a great little set the parts used a nice and usefull the printed tiles are the secret stars of this set and the dinosaur is fun two with a few packs of these you could easily build a celophysis pack with lots of jurassic world signs on their way highly recommended	positive

reviews for this set really should picture them next to the bike shop  cafe which its intended to be compatible with right down to the size of the baseplates and grey tiles around the edge it doesnt look that great on its own but if you add the two sets together you get something that begins to look like a street scene	positive
lightningtiger on 04 may 2015  1255 pm said thanks mostlytechnic for this review i only brought this set to continue the shop series from creator in my opinion its only half as good as the bike shopcafe one plus it doesnt fit the same as that pair of shops oh well maybe next year lego creator will have a better one brick on review on mostlytechnic  well it is only half the price of the bikecafe one too  but i agree it seems odd that theyve made a couple shop creator sets that dont fit together in style like this i guess theyve done that for years with the creator houses though  none of those really work together david thomsen on 04 may 2015  0133 pm said reviews for this set really should picture them next to the bike shop  cafe which its intended to be compatible with right down to the size of the baseplates and grey tiles around the edge it doesnt look that great on its own but if you add the two sets together you get something that begins to look like a street scene interesting to get two comments right in a row with opposite opinions  i dont have the bikecafe set but to me they dont looks like theyd really go together theyre the same concept two buildings that fold in half but the sidewalk is different size and they just feel differently styled to me	negative
this seems like half of a set compared to the previous bike shopcafe as i like many of the elements i will probably buy a second one and build a mirror image version making one entirely a toy shop and the other a book storenews stand and adjust the sidewalks to work with the previous model then i think they will work well together i remember a little area in copenhagen that had this sort of architecture i would hope the subsequent models are better deigned to create more complex alternatives but these are both good starting points for original or enhanced models	neutral
as a fan of creator houses i really want to like this set however i think that creator houses have long filled a niche thats neglected elsewhere residential houses we havent had a larger residential house since 2013 im not sure if these sets have anything to do with that but it seems like they may be the replacement for larger houses and id much rather have a larger house set than a set like this i also agree with many others here something about it just feels incomplete i think that the various city business buildings weve gotten in recent years including those in this years city squarewhich is much more expensive than this but also contains much more make for better buildings at this scale	positive
thanks andy0306uk your very clever strategic decision to serve us with blurry pictures allowed me to glance at this review without ruinating that whole wonderful advent surprise too much p y but although i loved the last years one i think they could do another theme or perhaps even two calendars because right now castles pretty hot imo	positive
andy0306uk on sep 13 2007 0136 pm said really hope they do different themes next year but not sure how theyd managed 24 different minisets for castle can envisage 78 minifigs but what else yeah i guess this would need a little more out of the box thinking than tlcs doing usually for their castle line things that are similar to the city theme and more civil life based like some blacksmith equipment market place bakery farmer and so on but a wizard workshop a hidden treasure and some medieval furniture would also work fine and an evil santa with spiders and coal pieces as gifts and a sledge pulled by a dragon of course d	neutral

930 euro is msrp here in denmark 7 euro would have resulted in a nicer reception from my part but the strong marked position of lego in its homeland together with the general high prices because some of us are supposedly rich makes the prices less bearable it is funny you should mention germany i thought the prices for lego were even higher there im sure i paid more than msrp last time i bought lego from from your country on the other hand the last thing i bought was the 5521 model team sea jet from 1993	neutral

hovercraft alternate model uses around 45th of the parts it is cool but a bit fragile	positive
this is a really great set when i first saw it i thought oh a silly small plane who needs that and then i got it and i am very happy that i did this is one of the best designed lego creator sets and it was designed by the designer of the cafecorner	positive
thank you sinner for bringing the pictures of the hovercraft i think it is a really cool model but the steering wheel doent work too well it doesnt turn easilly all the way around and when the craft turns it doesnt stay stable on the three wheels because the front wheel turns quite alot into the opposite side now to the third model this is quite a basic helicopter with the functionality of having the rotors turning it doesnt use that many of the bricks and doesnt even have a landing gear i have a question to all of you as you can see i prefer to show one or two large pictures and have the rest as clickable thumbnails most people use only the relatively big typically 640x480 pictures so that you dont have to follow links what do you prefer it is no problem for me to do it the other way but i would like to know if you have any preferences	neutral

thanks for the review ive had that set for quite a while and its among my favorite marvel superheroes sets actually compared to the other stuff we usually get to accompany the minifigs all those laboratorys the most recent construction site and the hydra fortress  yeah youre being a little harsh here maybe youre still suffering from ptsd after watching fantfourstic	neutral

im glad you were joking about doom im not that big of a fanboy but i had the need to correct you for some reason with that said i bought this set for the minifigures a few years ago looking back i dont really care about the figures today like i did in 2013 the building is decent for the size of the set though thanks for the review	neutral

personally i thought your review was spot on and i very much enjoyed your tone im not usually much of a minifig person but i will admit i bought this set mostly for dr doom and considered nova a bonus growing up i was a big fan of the fantastic four and an even bigger fan of dr doom i hope that someday the film rights will revert to marvel and well finally get a ff film that respects the original source material and features a dr doom worthy of the name as for the set itself i dont have much use for playsets not that theres anything wrong with them i think the marvel lego line could use more of them in fact and i didnt even realize it was linked to a specific show as ive fallen a bit out of touch with the franchise of late i bought it i built it it sat a shelf for a while i scrapped it for parts i think most of it wound up as a greenhouse for my winter village setup its not a bad set but i think you summed things up nicely when you called it mediocre thanks for the entertaining review	neutral

this set seems to appeal more to the non superhero crowd it is one of the only marvel sets i bought mainly because i thought that the building was a nice return to the old style of city sets i would love to see this sort of backdrop for a more realistic agents theme i also liked that most of the figs in this set were easier to merge into other nonsuper uses thanks for the review god bless nathan	neutral

good idea to make this review while you build the set ill be monitoring your progress and feedback the box so huge impressive	positive
xwingyoda on sep 27 2007 1118 am said what what what  have you stopped your medication once again xd no actually im out of fly agaric but now its that seasson to go out in the forest and refill the stock of those babys vikings on	neutral
wow that box is big but i somehow thought it would be even bigger still it looks like for once lego are actully using all the space inside and not just a fraction like with other sets cant wait to see more dunamisyou lucky megablok 	neutral
thats awesome man lucky that you got it i want it so badly and it has a huge box too zots	positive
xwingyoda on sep 27 2007 0918 am said many tks dunamis for doing that its really great and i cant wait monitoring your progress on the beast 8 like it was mentionned in another thread the box looks less gigantic than i thought  remember the isd box  that was a huge box  is the instruction book in the pizza box  how big is it  im sure its really big and i hope for our sake that the colours are clearly marked xd if you know what i mean d  yoda interesting question regarding the size of the box vs the isd here ya go also ill be posting more on the size of the manual a little later im going to be building for the next few hours sweet	neutral
tks for that comparison pic dunamis  ok the box is big  i pictured it a tad smaller though  i know what i dont like its the fact that it has the regular lego star wars logo on top with vader ucs sets should have a different iconography like they did in the past sure its a trivial detail but it adds to the fact of owning something special  after all its the most expensive set ever as of now  happy building  and well wait patiently for some cool pics later on p yoda	negative
very expecting indeed waiting for your kind photo  	neutral
my gawd that manuel is huge thats enough to put a sane man off of buying this setthank gawd none of us are sane thats all i can say xd just how many technic pins does this monster need 8 judging by that one pic theres gotta be a lot in this set	negative
nice idea reviewing the set while constructing it this is the top of the bill for any legocollector also financially speaking and i like the look of all those thousands of pieces the manual is incredible i thought i had a really thick manual coming with set 8479 but this one exceeds it with ease review on	positive
xwingyoda on sep 28 2007 0734 am said tks for that comparison pic dunamis  ok the box is big  i pictured it a tad smaller though  yoda i dont have the ucs isd but from the pic i can see that it is about the same thickness slightly shorter but much wider than the mf so this leads me to believe that dimensionwise the ucs mf is more compact also notice how in the content the parts fit in just nice without additional spare space for anything else strange isnt it that when tlc is responsible for the shipping we see optimum usage of box spaces xd imagine if all boxes were this efficient 499 sets would be no bigger than a match box xd xd the mtt would be reduced to 14 its current size xd xd xd	neutral
good review y me i cant build it before saturday 	positive
great review so far i am looking forward to additional posts as for the number of pins  from the peeron inventory for the set there are over 400 technic pins of various lengths insert the my fingers hurt from building emoticon keep the pictures coming	positive
the build the build is going quicker than i thought i am sorting as i open the bags that i need some bags are in multiples so it is easy to pick them out the build is a tad repetitive as the framework of the ship is somewhat symmetrical here are some progress shots note that two plates 1x4 and 1x8 are stacked in between technic beams then the part below is assembled to hold the structure together this took about an hour of sorting and building ill post another update tomorrow	positive
the minifigs as you can see the minifigs are really nice they even throw in an extra fleshie head no doubt these will fetch quite a bit on the bricklink and ebay markets im keeping mine continuing the build this photo shows how well this model is put together notice that they use four of the threehole beams per side to hold this together i remember reading that you can hang this model from the ceiling i dont doubt it these right angle technic pieces are used to reinforce the structure of the model you can see them used here i was shocked at how many light gray plates are in this set i have two tubs full of these the infrastructure is now complete i got hung up for about an hour looking for one of these turns out lego gave me an extra left wedge and shorted me a right wedge so frustrating i had to stead one off my 6211 star destroyer it is not a very common piece by the way	neutral
hey nice review im up to about the same point as you page 70 to be exact  tho i didnt have that missing piece thankfully i think lego have done a much better job at packing the lego this time i remember it taking me much longer to find pieces on the ucs isd build	positive
a beautiful and humorous review with very fine pics y a fantastic set full of neat details and in a wonderful color scheme great for every city builder for sure i guess we waited for sets like that we dreamed about them im glad we got them now  edit congrats it seems youve got your bucket back p	positive
thank you very much for the review sinner i definitly wub this set this will make a great addition for us townies i thought the size was too small i plan to make my house fit practically the whole baseplate plus i will definitly add floors that looked d  i cant believe tlc skimped on the floors	positive
thanks for this review sinner i love this house with the nicely made tiled corners the colorscheme and the garage the only thing i dislike about this set is the way the windows are attached in train windows so they turn inwards a little instead of the usual frames with shutterattachmentability but that is something that can be fixed in the blink of an eye i will certainly buy this house some day when i find it at reasonable price	positive
thanks for the review sinner y  although we had a not very detailed one already p i bought this set at tru with 20 off resulting in 54 xd definitely a must buy for every townie you get tons of useful parts to build other buildings as well shameless selfpromotion off  you have to love tan bricks though 8 moc on	positive
thanks for the thanks guys sweet hinckley39 on sep 28 2007 1108 am said great job now sort that out and start building for our competition xd i started building today sweet matthewusa on sep 28 2007 0356 pm said i cant believe tlc skimped on the floors it didnt bother me as i downloaded the instructions prior to buying the set i think it was a deliberate choice to make the house flashy looking but not very functional due to the cool looking corners it isnt very strong either while breaking it i was reminded of a zip p simonwillems on sep 28 2007 0653 pm said the only thing i dislike about this set is the way the windows are attached in train windows so they turn inwards a little instead of the usual frames with shutterattachmentability these were my first windows like that and it surprised me i wouldnt be surprised if lego are trying to phase out the old windows holodoc on sep 28 2007 0758 pm said thanks for the review sinner y  although we had a not very detailed one already p i notice that but since didnt show what the original set looked like i saw that more of a moc 8 holodoc on sep 28 2007 0758 pm said you get tons of useful parts to build other buildings as well shameless selfpromotion off  i was actually considering adding a link to your moc anyway thanks p pauldelahaye on sep 29 2007 0738 am said i too have bought this set and the only thing i notice which is a bit odd with the exception of there being no floors in the house is the lack of a steering wheel in the car once again i think this is just a sign of all style no substance d paulc on sep 29 2007 0519 pm said the mixed rough and smooth roof bricks would annoy me on a model like the mtt but here it looks as is if the roof is quite old with some parts being worn and pitted and some parts being replaced with new roof tiles i quite like the effect fair point what confuses me though is the cg cover has the rough ones shown 	neutral

thank you for the nice review i want this set too with al those tan bricks and black slopes and the cute blue car wub i like the old windows more i hope they dont stop producing them	positive
sinner thanks for this outstanding review i am glad that i had read this review in advance before making my purchase on this set earlier with my girlfriend we built this set for a total of 3 hours to complete this beauty in about 2 hours ago there are stars circling around my head at this very moment when i post this reply i must admit from the bottom of my heart that this is an wonderful piece of house that simply shows the beauty of it with the european kind of houses where there is a garage furthermore there is a lovely blue car i am seeing stars right now in the middle of the night and i must drop a thanks to you personally as well although it is empty from its interior unlike the 4996 beach house but this set has the majestic look which simply place a wow factor in front of it upon completion at the moment we had plans for getting the second set next month to build the other design as well hopefully i will be able to share with you guys all of my different creators sets with its alternate designs as well in the near future	positive
nice pictorial review i always like this little set  a little more text would have been nice but that is ok as it is  ps you should have mentioned in the title that this topic is picture heavy  i was wondering why it was loading so slow on my mobile	positive
hi youve done well on the pictures but i agree with freekysch a little more text would be great ever thought about joining the reviewers academy	neutral
thanks for comments i know about text im trying to write more but havent succes in this yet i thought about joining reviewers academy but im not sure because i have only maimum 4may be 5 hours each time when i can make review or something that needs some hours	neutral
writing a decent review will indeed take some time but you dont need to do it in a single session if each time is 45 hours you can write a review in 2 x each time	neutral
i actually bought this set last monday as it was reduced to 1499it actually not a bad little set considering the size and part count has a decent array of functions its a nice little setthe b model looks just as good so i might buy a second set as you get the bucket left over and i need that bucket for another set edited by richard dower 19 october 2015  0442 pm	positive
remember when i said in my review of 7090 to expect a review after i went to toysrus well somehow things didnt work out but fortunately im finally reviewing my latest purchases starting with 7091 catapault defense which happens to be one of the best sets in the castle line the box and instructions lego box art is at its highest point ever these days with lots of special effects and great action poses the castle theme is no exception and 7091 isnt either ill let the box speak for itself i love the back of the castle boxes as well since they give another action scene and other neat info like a layout of all the accessories the contents only the bare essentials as usual piece bags and instructions i seriously wish they still put mini catalogs inside sets like they did when i was young but i guess they are too expensive to make or something ah well cant have everything no picture of the instructions this time but since that isnt necessary ill just say that they are fine and do not have a problem with distinguishing dark gray from black the pieces heres your basic shot of every piece included minus a few extra pieces like an extra viking horn and black skeleton leg not too shabby for a 10 usd set theres a lot of nice pieces in 7091 as you can see and this doesnt include the accessories or minifig parts the brown plates wheels and spoked things are always useful and the dark blue and gold slopes are really cool however theres also a fair amount of technic in here so be warry as usual for the castle line 7091 has a heaping helping of accessories most of them are old pieces recolored but the ball on chain whats the actual name could someone tell me and the shields are brand new i actually like the new skeleton weapon since its fairly detailed and was really the only way tlc could make a part like that and yes the shields are printed quite nicely too if i do say so myself plus you get viking horns always useful to have a grey boulder a basket and 3 helmets not a half bad deal eh oh who am i kidding  its awesome minifigures ah yes one of the highlights of any castle set you get 2 soldiers and 2 skellies this time all with different weapons the two soldiers are just regular crown troops with different faces  nothing special except that they are awesome anyway the skeletons on the other hand are much more interesting an archer and a black skellie archers cool of course but i know many dont like the printing on the black skeletons well let me say that i dont mind it so much the only real problem is that the eyes are dark red instead of just red which makes the printing a bit less noticeable and ive been through it before that the new skeleton molds in general dont bother me at all  go skeletons the finished set alright theres two builds in this set and ill start with the smaller the skeleton barricade okay so its nothing special but its cool all the less the shield on the front and the slanted spears are nice touches heres just how the skeletons can tower over their own barricade with a little step ah the catapault the lovely catapault seriously i love tlcs design very effective and also very realistic especially compared to kk love the side details and the swiveling base and you gotta love the clever use of that basket playability yes ive made it a tradition now to write stories for any castle set i buy and this isnt the last one you can be sure of that heres one featuring everything in 7901 oh and heres a small ship i made out of all the pieces in this set plus a couple extra figures and weapons from my copy of 7901 not half bad imo considering what i had to work with overall rating presentation 910 pieces 810 minifigures 910 finished model 910 playability 810  final score 8610 once again i highly recommend the reviewed set castle is possibly the best theme this year and this set is one of many that prove it as with all castle sets its best if you buy several if you want to truly enjoy it but this set alone is also impressive in both design and pieces and minifigures get at least one if you have even a slight liking for castle edited by kimt 10 august 2008  0131 pm	positive
very nice review seems like ill be getting my first castle set soon wub grevious on oct 10 2007 0933 pm said most of them are old pieces recolored but the ball on chain what’s the actual name could someone tell me that would be a flail 	positive

its that time of year again when the days get shorter the nights get colder and children all around the world stare longingly into warmly lit toy shops and prepare their wishlist to send to santa this is also the time when the lego group releases their latest winter village set which has been an annual tradition for the past seven years these sets have been very popular especially among afols and are always highly anticipated however while some entries in this series have been more popular than others none has been as controversial as this years set the winter toy shop which is a rerelease of the first winter village set 10199 winter toy shop from 2009 it seems that many think that this set didnt need to be remade and would have preferred a new set instead or that it is not different enough from the original and will be redundant in a completionists collection does it deserve all the hate lets find out disclaimer i dont own the 2009 version so i cant compare them visually but i will do my best to let you know what is different in this version if you do need a visual reference you can refer to sveltes excellent review of the original set number 10249 name winter toy shop theme creator year of release 2015 pieces 898 minifigs 8 price £5999  7999  6999€ sh description quote welcome to the winter toy shop the holiday season has arrived and the toymaker is busy finishing off his latest creations outside children ski and snowboard and a freshly built snowman sparkles in the light that shines from the toyshop tower help decorate the huge tree that stands at the center of the square play with the curious kitten on the cozy wooden bench or join in with the carolers beneath the ornate streetlamp this charming set also features a ladder trees in various sizes jackinthebox a toy biplane helicopter rocket train race car truck robot tugboat teddy bear and a wrapped gift have fun building this enchanting winter wonderland includes a snowman and 8 minifigures with assorted accessories a male caroler female caroler a woman 2 men 2 boys and a girl sh bricklink brickset the box the box art of this set is similar to that of the original but there are some notable differences the christmas tree is on the right side of the image this time while the park bench is on the left and of course it features this years design for creator boxes with the dark blue stripe along the right side and the expert logo in the top right corner theres also a small picture of the back of the toy shop and the background looks less cartoony than on the original the back is also very similar showing a different angle of the toy shop along with some closeups although this time there is no minifig lineup instead the minifig lineup is on the right side of the box it also includes the accessories that each minifig comes with and some of the toys on the left side of the box there is a thumbnail of the box art and the set name in six different languages they also want to make sure that you know that there are batteries included by saying it in dozens of languages the top of the box features the inventory and a 11 scale reference with the female caroler on the bottom there is a picture that reminds you that there is a light brick included in this set in case that wasnt clear from the front of the box and it confirms that yes it is a bad idea to put it in water in case you were planning to go swimming with your winter toy shop the contents inside the box there are two instruction booklets and two groups of bags one for each instruction booklet while two groups of bags is not as many as there usually are in other sets of this size its still better than the first version of this set where the bags werent numbered at all so this makes the build a bit easier the large bag in group 1 and the two large bags in group 2 have a white stripe going down the middle of the bag and only have one group number printed on it along with some other number and some kind of scan code i have no idea why they made this distinction for these bags or what that code is for so if any of you know the purpose of this please let me know in the comments below here is a random instructions page as you can see the building steps can get quite challenging as they sometimes include many different pieces in one step especially when it uses a lot of brown pieces which are very dark and hard to see in the instructions living up to the sets status as an expertlevel set most of the time though the instructions are pretty clear and easy enough to follow there are some parts in new colors in this set that werent in the first version or any other set until now such as that large flat technic arch in dark green the jester hat in orange and blue one of those new 2z2 round jumper tiles in brown a golden frog and a snowboard in dark blue there are also some rare friends parts that make their creator debut here such as the skis in azure and that new clear 1x1 round tile with a tiny tube coming out of it which is usually used as a stand for friends accessories and is a very useful piece especially for snot techniques and no im not talking about the type of snot that many people usually have stuck in their nose around this time of year there are some printed parts as well such as the clock tile the letter tile and the register slope like in the first version of the set we also get a new face print for the white cat which is more in line with other modern cat designs but the best part is the shop sign which is printed this time around it features a lovely wood pattern the words toy shop and a toy soldier on both sides of the sign which is ironic since the shop doesnt seem to sell any toy soldiers like this but it looks so good on the sign that i wont sue them for false advertising the minifigs lets start with the most unique figures in this set the carolers these two were also the highlight in the first version of the set but in the original they both had the same head this one   which featured a very questionable facial expression that could easily be taken out of context in this version they have unique faces which look much better and help distinguish their gender the male caroler uses lord vampyres torso which looks quite snazzy on him maybe this is lord vampyre before he became a vampire the female caroler is easily the best minifig in the set though because in addition to her exclusive head she also gets an exclusive torso and skirt print a huge improvement over the generic unprinted one in the original she also gets the queen hair in dark brown and aragorns lined cape instead of two combined regular capes this set truly is the return of the queen the snowman is technically not a minifig but as you can see here he is exactly as tall as one and he is the first thing you build after the minifigs so i included him here he has mostly the same design as before except this time he has robot claws for arms instead of levers which is good since they allow him to hold accessories such as his broom his carrot nose is included separately again the carolers both have back printing while the snowman looks no different from the back than he does from the front here you can see the black side of the females cape this lined cape is so much nicer than the solution they used in the original next up we have what i assume is a married couple who are likely the parents of at least one of the kids as well as the toymaker who i will call geppetto the man in the pinstripe suit was not included in the first version of the set so hes a bonus minifig these guys are fairly generic but they have some detailed torso prints so they look pretty nice geppetto seems to have gotten younger since the release of the original set since his gray hair has now turned dark tan and he doesnt seem to need glasses anymore the men both have back printing but the woman is the only one in this set who doesnt get a back print why you gotta be so discriminating against women lego last but not least there are the kids one of the boys wears dark blue pants a green jacket and a wool cap he looks a bit like a lumberjack so lets call him lumberjack boy or jack for short the little girl wears an outfit that wouldnt look out of place in the friends theme with a lavender scarf and pants ill call her lavender the second boy is wearing an octan jacket and a sports helmet which makes it ironic that he is the one not doing any winter sports on the box art ill call him president business junior or pbj for short all of the kids have fairly detailed back printing which makes up for the fact that much like the adults they are made out of mostly common parts pbjs helmet and scarf cover up the back of his head nicely which is important as you will see in the next picture whats also great about these figs is that half of them have a doublesided head here you can see pbj doing his best macaulay culkin impression i also removed his scarf so you can see the printing on his torso better but hes not the only one who seems to be easily scared the mother also has a very alarmed expression maybe she got surprised by the jackinthebox or maybe she just realized how expensive toys are nowadays you can see the female carolers back printing here her alternate expression is a nonsinging face which is very nice to have and i wish the male caroler could have one too she looks quite cute with those rosy cheeks but the most adorable out of all of them has to be the little girl she comes with a pouting sad face that will melt your heart please dont cry ill buy you any toy you want just stop looking at me like that the build the first half of the build is dedicated to the surroundings of the toy shop it includes the christmas tree the park bench the snowman the toys the carolers jack and lavender the large bag contains two smaller bags with small pieces a white box that contains the carolers cape and the jester hat in its own little bag the first thing you build after the minifigs and the snowman is the toys this version of the set has a lot more toys than the original which is good because i always felt that the first toy shop was a bit light on toys also the ones that were in the original have been updated for example instead of the two pairs of skis you now get one pair of skis that use the new ski mold and a snowboard the jackinthebox is mostly the same except it now has an orange and blue color scheme instead of the red and blue from the original this change was probably not necessary but hey at least we get a new jester hat out of it and instead of the brickbuilt teddy bear you get the new teddy bear mold i have mixed feelings about this change because i actually kinda liked the brickbuilt teddy design and using a specialized mold seems to be going against the spirit of creator sets but on the other hand i cant deny that the molded teddy looks better than the blocky old one meh the new toys include a tugboat which has some rounded technic pieces as its hull a biplane a rocket a helicopter and a truck that cleverly uses roller skates for its wheels these are all quite brilliant designs that feel like micro versions of lego city sets and make a great addition to the set here is a back view of some of the more complex models as you can see the friends accessory stand has been cleverly used to hold the biplanes fin in place and to provide a stand for the helicopter the jackinthebox has a hinged lid the only thing that bugs me a bit is the tpiece on top of the helicopter that holds the rotor in place but i cant think of any better way they could have done it next is the ladder that is used to decorate the tree which is exactly the same as the first version the supports are on a clickhinge so they can be adjusted or folded away then you build the tree itself you begins of course with the stand which is mostly the same design as before but this time the plates at the bottom are brown instead of white and have golden studs as feet next you build the first layer of branches the main difference in this version of the tree is that this one actually has a brown stem rather than just a technic axle on which you stack the layers of branches one by one you wont be able to see the stem in the final result but i like this change as it makes the tree more realistic then you add the second layer of branches this one doesnt have lightscandles and attaches to the lower layer at an angle using the four transyellow studs close to the stem the third layer is added this one has lights again each layer is similar in that they are all made out of green plates that are built around a 4x4 ring plate but they get smaller each time and are constructed differently enough for the build not to feel repetitive with the addition of the fourth layer we get close to finishing the tree lastly you add one more layer and the tip of the tree now its time to decorate the tree however its not as fun as it sounds since that requires you to add lights to the two chainsropes first which can get a bit repetitive the clips holding the lights to the chain were white but this time theyre pearl gold which looks much nicer in my opinion the next part of the build is the park bench with the streetlamp and the little tree this is a fairly quick build with not much to it the fishbowl helmet parts are a useful piece that you dont see too often so its nice to get them again in this remake the design is pretty much the same as in the original set except for the wreaths on the streetlamp which use a green life preserver instead of a round 2x2 plate this is another instance where they use a specialized piece instead of a brickbuilt solution but im okay with that because unlike with the teddy bear this part was not originally intended to be a wreath so its still nice part usage the second half of the build is dedicated to the toy shop itself and includes the couple geppetto and pbj please note that there is a fourth 6x10 plate burried under the parts you begin by tiling the floor setting up the walls and adding the interior items such as the fireplace the cash register and the toy displays next you add the walls windows and the door and the ground floor of the shop is finished so far the build is the same as the old toy shop except this time they decided to have the white stripes on the marquees be the longer ones instead of the dark red ones for some reason i dont know why they did this and kinda would have preverred to get dark red 1x1 plates instead of white but it doesnt detract from the look of the shop so i dont really care now we begin with the upper floor this is where things start to look a little different can you tell the difference the difference is that this time they attach the roof using cliphinges instead of bulky technic constructions which gives you more space on this floor and allows it to look more like an actual attic they even tile the floor next to the frog clock aftter adding the roof the build is finished the main roof feels a bit loose since its only attached to the building by one side im not sure if this was an issue in the old toy shop but its not a big deal i just wouldnt pick the set up by the roof what i do like is that they used double cheese slopes on the awning on the outer wall of the tower instead of singles which makes it a bit easier to build i like how the supports under the tower roof now match those of the main roof the wreaths have also been updated like the ones on the streetlamp and those technic arches under the roof look a lot more like garlands now on the original they were dark gray so i didnt even know they were supposed to be garlands and assumed they were part of the architecture the shop sign looks a lot better now that it is printed the old one just looked like a white flag i also like how the small plates under the marquee give it a wavy look and they included two trees in different sizes on the right side of the shop the back is nice and open and allows you to see the rest of the toys the robot train and race car all of which have just as much of a simple and clever design as the other toys the clock looks much nicer with the new golden frog because golden frogs make everything better spare parts there are quite a few small parts left over including a roller skate and one of those friends accessory stands which will come in handy the complete set here you can see the full set together it looks quite nice and festive with all the little details and there are many scenes that you can play out with it you can have the minifigs decorate the tree have the kids play in the snow have the carolers sing by the bench have the toymaker build some toys in his workshop or have the parents buy presents for their kids its a festive toyfilled winter wonderland the fireplace looks cozy and i like the brick pattern going up the chimney the entrance of the shop looks a bit empty aside from the cash register i feel like they could have displayed some more toys here but oh well being a set targeted at teens and adults there arent really any play features aside from the light brick which is attached to a hinge so you can either activate it by pressing the button with your finger or tilting the brick upward so that the button is pressed against the roof however since the roof is not connected in the middle and only attached on the sides it tends to split open a bit when you do that so im not sure if attaching the roof this way here was such a good idea nevertheless it looks quite nice when the light is lit ratings design 55  this set is as gorgeous as it was back in 2009 the small updates that they made are mostly good ones although the absence of a brickbuilt teddy is a bit disappointing and the new way the roof is attached while not as bulky as before makes the roof slightly unstable but those are just nitpicks build 55  there are some interesting building techniques here such as those on the tree the roof and the toys the fact that the parts are only split into two groups and the part callouts can get fairly complex makes it a challenging enjoyable build minifigs 55  they did a great job updating the figs in this set while only 3 of the torsos in the original had any printing all of the torsos have printing front and back in this set even the skirt and cape of the female caroler you get two exclusive heads and half of the heads are doublesided plus you get 8 instead of 7 minifigs you really cant ask for more in a creator set playability 45  this set is more meant to be displayed than to be played with but there are plenty of things to play with if you want all the different minifigs accessories and set pieces make for endless possibilities for play its especially fun to swoosh the micro vehicles around parts 35  there are lots of good parts here most of them are fairly common but there are some rare parts and some even in exclusive colors price 45  this set costs 20 more than the original but considering that this set has nearly 900 pieces including some rare and exclusive ones as well as more minifigs with much better printing i think 80 is still a fair price overall 55  so whats my opinion of this set for a remake i think its great they managed to make a good set even better are the changes minor yes are they an improvement mostly yes were they necessary perhaps not but its good that they made them instead of just rereleasing the exact same set so if you didnt get the first winter toy shop i can highly recommend getting this one if you do already have the old version this one might still be worth picking up for the hugely improved minifigs and rare parts alone as for the controversy over rereleasing the winter toy shop i can see where the haters are coming from but i find their complaints to be quite petty i can understand if youre disappointed because you already have the first winter toy shop and were looking forward to a new set this year but theres always next year if youre a completist and feel like tlg is forcing you to buy a set you dont need youre wrong nobody is forcing you to buy anything but yourself if you decide to buy every set in a theme no matter what it is thats your problem not legos so put down your torches and pitchforks and just be glad that they improved the set design and gave us another chance to buy this classic set there are far worse things that can happen in this world than lego rereleasing one of their most popular sets sorry for that little rant so what is your opinion on rereleases like this please cast your vote in the poll above i hope you enjoyed this special eurobricks reviewers academy review and would like to thank the lego group for the opportunity to review this set happy holidays everyone battoys by okay yaramanoglu on flickr	positive
thanks for a great review first of all i do like the upgrades and changes made from the original 2009 set more colours and parts are offcourse available today than back in 2009 it does look like a great set and i would really realy have loved to get it myself if i had the funds however their are so many other sets thats first priority for me this december and next year so sadly i might have to pass on this if its not that i can get it redicioulusly cheap at some point and yeah we should appreciate that lego does keep sets coming even if its just upgrades from earlier releases town is known for a new police and fire station every year cant see why a new toyshop is so upsetting once again thanks for a great review and happy holidays to you as well	positive
nice to see they finally updated that generic screaming face from the 2007 castle line awesome review oky i have the old set so i wont be picking this up	positive
great review you almost make me want to buy one i dont know what it is with these sets on the one hand they are so nicely designed and cute on the other side i never seriously consider buying one i cant explain what it is that holds me back	positive
great review thanks oky imo the only significant improvements over the 2009 version are the figures toys and printed shop sign as i already have the older one ill have to give this one a pass	neutral
thanks for the excellent review unfortunately it only highlights how minimal the upgrades are though they are nice definitively a pass for me lets hope lego does continue to make the more realistic winter village sets versus santa im not opposed to a rehash the post office could use some improvements for example but this one is just a wee bit minimal	negative
i missed out on the first one but i love the improvements made in this version like the tree having an actual brown trunk so it looks less like an artificial one and the carolers as well i may pick this up but im sorry to those of you who already have one	positive
i bought it and im very happy with it	positive
thanks oky for this fine review i agreed with your sentiments on the unnecessary rants i also owned the 2009 version and even though there are minor improvements there must be a logical reason for its release again but is not entirely the same i felt is an excellent opportunity for others to acquire this design especially after six years ago as for myself i will probably buy this if my spare funds allow me to own this set	neutral

thanks for the kind comments everyone i like hearing your opinions on this set withacee on 01 december 2015  0937 am said pity the poll has no option yes but only in addition to new sets not in stead of new sets i dont think that would be a realistic option as that would mean that they would have to spend twice the resources on this theme which i dont think they are ready to do but if more people would like this option i can add it to the poll joebot on 01 december 2015  0833 pm said after mocking people for holding a particular opinion you then turn around and ask people to express their opinion no thanks i guess ill keep my opinions to myself i certainly dont want to be labeled a hater im not mocking anyone i just think that some people need to calm down a bit and that tlg is getting more hate than they deserve for this set but thats just my opinion and youre welcome to disagree with it everyone is entitled to their own opinion including you and me and yes i would love to hear your thoughts on this matter because i would like to have a friendly discussion on this subject	neutral

i didnt own the original toy shop so i bought it this time around i just finished building it saturday and i love it however i wish they had both rereleased this one and came out with a new addition to the village 	positive

while i can see kids enjoying this im not sure i would buy the flex axles are nice and it is a decent number of white panels but i think i would get better return out of a larger parts set fantastic review though and your pictures show off this tiny model better than the box art does	negative
thanks for the nice review the landing mechanism looks quite cute arent the yellow axles 5l not 4l very strange that they would release such a part	positive
it says 5l in the parts list	neutral
love this model awesome swooshability interesting parts and a nice little model to put on my desk at work 	positive
hi there nice model great review i almost reverse engineered this model but used wrong parts for landing wheels didnt know how to fix the nose proper and so on so i was very interested in this model and i like playing with it i love the reviews but i think i have to mention that the yellow axle must be a 5l the picture shows a 5l and a 5l would fit the size of the model the cart has also a 5l in yellow what sitze is the yellow axle in this seit really 4l as written in the text greetings robert	positive
i seem to have been messing up axle lengths in various reviews its indeed 5l my bad thanks for pointing it out	neutral
good review as always jim when i first saw this set i thought that it would make a great parts pack for me as that i have about 20 white pieces in my technic collection all from 42043 and this set has some really useful ones all for a cheap price those 7l flex axles will be extremely useful in my current build im doing	positive
nice review even with the missing demonstration video of the amodel looks like this is an excellent panel pack for the price and those soft axles will go down a treat will this set be the dark horse of 1h 2016	positive
jay psi on 02 december 2015  1210 am said nice review even with the missing demonstration video of the amodel hmmm strange let me fix that	neutral
set is only interesting for the panels thats all it is to me	neutral
i just built the a model and i rather like it it is much bigger than it looks from the box  about 30 studs long there is only one function  the landing gear  but it works very nicely apart from that its a very solid build and achieves an elegant shape with an absolute minimum of parts i dont usually get excited about small sets but this one appeals to me i like the feeling that every single piece has a purpose	positive
my favourite of the 2016 sets ive built so far id go so far as to say this is the best budget set in years i would have loved this when i was a kid  great swoosh ability 	positive
i got this little set for xmas and i noticed all the gaps and decided to fix them so here it is img5344 by jj2sam on flickr first i added some beams to the wings and top to make it less hollow second i put some navigation lights on it i made the nose a bit wider and added a control panel and lastly i changed out the landing gear wheels to more appropriate ones img5349 by jj2sam on flickr more pictures are here	neutral
thats a cool little mod two small nigles though 1 your navigation lights are flipped on the main wings 2 the panels on the tail i think were supposed to be the intakes for the jet engine by using them to close up the tail youve turned it into a glider cant wait untill i find one of these on shelves	positive
so this set showed up in stores yesterday and i immediately picked two up all in all it is a nice set but it is slightly different from what i was expecting the plane feels a bit flat pointy nose wide bottom etc and while the panels work very well as wings it feels a bit simplistic to just have singlepart wings the stickers really work for it though its a cracking set though nice parts pack and a nice model as well	positive
review  42046  getaway racer introduction starting with the 42010  offroad racer and 42011  race car in 2013 tlg released two sets in the first half of each year using a pullback motor the pullback motor allows the model to be pulled back followed by forward motion usually theres no apparent relation between the two set other than the ability to combine them into an alternate build this year there seems to some sort of cops and robbers scene going on a getaway racer and a police interceptor that cant be a coincidence makes you wonder who will be victorious the good guys or the bad guys lets find out note all images can be clicked for hires versions set information number 42046 title getaway racer theme technic released 2016 part count 170 box weight 302 gr box dimensions 260 cm x 138 cm x 59 cm set price msrp € 1999 price per part € 0118 links brickset bricklink the box the box has the same dimensions as previous years pullback motor sets in the lower right corner theres a visual explanation of the pullback mechanism the dark model with its decals sure looks like a cool hot rod content of the box the box contains 1 instructions booklet 1 sticker sheet 2 technic liftarms 1 pullback motor 3 bags instruction booklet just a single booklet unfortunately no booklet for the alternate model sticker sheet the sticker sheet contains a lot of cool stickers with flames and skulls etc pullback motor and liftarms the pullback motor and two liftarms are found unbagged bags a total of three bags containing the majority of the parts highlighted parts this section describes the new andor otherwise interesting parts actually this set is the only set of 1h 2016 which doesnt use any new parts not even parts in a new color tires the getaway racer uses four low profile tires tire 37 x 22 zr rims the rims are wheel 304mm d x 20mm in pearl gold found in 12 other sets panels this set contains three 3 panelsand three 4 panels in black part list this set contains 171 parts all listed below the build this being a small model i wont show any building steps lets skip right to the finished model below you can see the end result in my opinion the model looks great its got that hot rod vibe going on and the stickers add darkness to the vibe slight problem with this set is that it really needs the stickers to finish the look otherwise its quite dull with black and dark grey liftarms and panels the rear view shows the pullback motor connected directly to the rear axle in this image you can also clearly see the exhaust pipes on the side which are very well executed the 3x3 technic discs with stickers used in the rim result in only seeing a part of the rim this works very well with the golden rims the bottom view shows the chassis of the car nothing really noteworthy as you would expect from a pullback set video the following video gives you an overview of the finished model parts left these six parts are left after building the model seems about right features and functions this being a pullback motor set it only has a single feature the video below demonstrates the acceleration of the vehicle my girlfriend was kind enough to catch the model before it fell to the ground or did it hit something before it fell to the ground video this video shows the pullback functionality bmodel the alternate model is a combined build with the police interceptor which you can see on the back of the box unfortunately the instructions for the combined bmodel are not included so i didnt get a chance to build it this would make for a fun challenge building the bmodel without the instructions summary pullback sets are not the most technically advanced models so you cant expect any other functionality than hitting the walls in your house however i think they are very appealing to kids the fact that this years pullback sets form a duo adds to the fun in my opinion tlg hit the nail on the head with the getaway racer and police interceptor the getaway racer looks very badass which is something you dont see every day in a technic set score how do i grade the bad guy in this years duo 8 design it looks so cool but it does need the stickers 7 building experience nothing out of the ordinary 7 features limited to the pullbackanddrive functionality 7 playability combined with the police interceptor kids will love it it does need its nemesys though 7 parts collection of common parts gold rims could be interesting 8 value for money pullback sets always deliver a certain value 73 hit it more image can be found on my flickr page thank you for reading i hope you enjoyed it	positive
i almost purchased this today because i like the wheel  disc combo so much	positive
one hero will now have just enough of that pullback motor to create one ultimate machine thanks to this	neutral
jim on 01 december 2015  0934 am said you are right i came to the same conclusion when writing the review i tell you it doesnt look that good without stickers but i dont have a picture to prove it to be honest i compared it to the model posted in the 2016 topic a few days ago i applied the stickers before building the model so i wasnt able to make a proper comparison i will keep it in mind for future reviews thanks for the suggestion youre welcome im not a huge fan of stickers for 2 reasons i do reuse all the parts normallyand also i believe a model should look great even without stickers then obviously they can be a plus but only afterwords anyway im enjoying the reviews as usual and those pics thanks for making them jim	neutral

lego 42049 mine loader thanks to lego and eurobricks for making this review possible this was supposed to be a previewreview before the dec 1 release date for the set but it got stuck in customs or something and didnt arrive in time well id rather do a good late review than a rushed review so here it is name mine loader set number 42049 pieces 476 i think price 3999 i think minifigs 0 theme technic year of release 2016 links bricklink brickset the box another standard technic box not that theres anything wrong with that it is a littler weird that the mine loader is shown outside the mine but whatever the back of the box again very standard its oddly technical showing the exact angle of the machine when turning but thats the sort of nerdy detail that technic people like the alternate mine cutting machine model looks interesting and unusual as well the 11 part the 11 part on the top of the box is especially helpful with this set these mining machines are very oddly proportioned since they need to fit in mine tunnels so its hard to judge the model size based on the wheels or seat like you can an ordinary set the contents you get manuals for both models a single book for the b and two books for the main a medium size sticker sheet 4 bags and 4 loose tires the special parts this set has 4 of the new mudguard panels in yellow two cylinder halves in red a new color some of the new color red and yellow axles a couple of the newish technic spacers some of the axlepin combination pieces and a couple swords im pretty sure thats an antenna and a spare the start of the bmodel since i like the main model better im building the alternate first so thats how ill write the review theres power for something probably the engine being taken off the one axle here overall a pretty standard technic frame beginning with some structural beams a frame and using liftarms to support axles out to the sides more of the frame the far end of the model has some obvious steering mechanism being formed as well as a pivoting arm right in the center thats probably the connection from the hand of god knob the steering yup called it oddly there is a different turning radius between right and left right now i wonder if thatll get fixed more mechanisms thats looking more technic now sad to see a ujoint being used just as a fixed straight connection like that but it is the alternate model the engine block because all engines should be enclosed in a red cylindrical housing am i right the chassis its definitely coming together now and yes the bmodel instructions tell you to put the stickers on it doesnt matter whether you build the main or alternate first youll get the stickers on almost  there were a couple leftover that didnt get used in the bmodel almost done with the rest of the body done and the wheels on you really get the scale of this machine that blue seat is tiny compared to the rest of it and yes the uneven steering lock got fixed after putting the wheels on you add a couple of pin with ball pieces to the underside to restrict the steering they didnt do that at first so that you could turn the axles sharper while putting the wheels on which made it easier to do the grinder keeping in mind the scale of the machine this thing looks terrifying the tan gear at the back drives the spinning blade up front the red bushes near the turntable let you adjust the angle all done the arm quickly attaches to the body and its done sadly that tan gear doesnt connect to anything  its just a knob so you can spin the blade by hand raise your hand if youre sure i think im dating myself with that title this thing has massive reach im imagining this inside a mine grinding away the rock overhead pretty viciously effective machine the crank on this side of the model is used to raise and lower the arm works well and the grey spacer makes it nice to use since it spins freely the leftovers not much left for a bmodel nice usage starting the main model the main model starts similarly to the alternate with a frame some axles and a drive connection from one axle to something later getting complicated already were only a few pieces in and we already have three separate gear trains going on theres the axle driving the tan beveled gears inside the frame at the bottom theres more tan gears in the middle and theres also a black gear sticking up as a knob that turns the grey connector in the center the body is done i skipped ahead quite a bit but it was a bunch of standard technic building youve got a fake engine with fan at the back driven by one of the rear wheels a knob sticking up for steering and an axle coming forward to open and close the claw the claw i like that they used a link system to open and close the claw instead of just gearing it the axle comes forward from the chassis its the red axle with a couple ujoints for flexibility and drives a worm gear that rotates a gear below with a 2 stud liftarm on each side those arms have pin with towball in them and then a link going from that short liftarm to the claw its a small rotation of the liftarm but makes the claw open widely and works very well raising the claw a few black liftarms join the claw to the body of the loader and allow it to move up and down its a simple mechanism there  one yellow beam goes back and connects to a lever that lets you raise and lower the claw when raised as shown the lever locks in place by going just slightly past the centerline and its done add some wheels a cab and some wheel arches and were done its a great looking machine pretty unique and looks like the real thing the main difference from reality is these usually have a scoop for moving loose rock since weve had so many scooping vehicles in the past tracked loaders the volvo l350f excavators etc the claw here is a fun change and adds to the playability for kids like the real thing the body stays very low so the cab only has to stick up a little bit for the driver to see all around because mines are cramped and busy areas from the rear this angle is great i love the use of the new mudguard panels to make a nice curve to the back of the loader the antenna is a little weird but perhaps they had a big pile of flat silver fencing swords to use up the black gear just to the left of the antenna is the claw control rotating that gear opens and closes it the back end is a little lighter than a real machine would be but lego wanted to leave the engine exposed so you can see the cylinders moving the conclusion so whats my conclusion on this model i like it a lot its simpler than a big set would be but its got lots of design and playability crammed in a midsized set its a unique vehicle however it does have a few flaws the steering on the main model needs some drag added as is you basically have to drive by holding the steering knob since itll bend if you push it from behind i dont like the use of pin with pin hole as mounting points for the orange and red trans plates for lights since they can turn slightly and be at weird angles the antenna is unnecessary and in the way but none of these flaws are dealbreakers or even big deals theyre minor the ratings value 1010  less than 10 cents a piece lots of useful liftarms and such nothing too weird or singleuse design 910  looks very realistic for the size of the set good functionality not too dependent on stickers minifigs na  na playability 910  controls arent perfect loose steering small knob for claw control but very functional and cleverly done parts 910  nice selection although heavy on the standard yellow and black almost zero studded parts overall 9510  its a great intro to technic set  a unique vehicle good functionality nice part selection and decently priced i like it a lot and plan to keep it around as a finished set	positive
i was waiting especially for review of this set let me add few things about this thing it all will be complainging of person who works with these type of machines so if you just want a unusual machine in your collection ignore my complaining  i see underground loaders almost every day and believe me this model would now work in the underground mine first of all its cab should stick out more from the frame each loader has cab placed out of the chassis to provide better view for the driver in this class of machine it would help a bit but in low loader ones it is extremely important this is the view from the cab of a low profile loader looking at front  and yes front of the machine is where engine is placed because at least at kghm all machines drive engine forward another thing about that cab is that seat and steering wheeljoysticks are placed perpendicularly to the machine chassis to provide same view for driving forward and backwards so another weak spot of the set the model lacks of trans clear lights on the engine part because all machines that work underground have same lamps on front and back another thing that comes to my mind is that warning light and antena would not live too long in the mine becuase it could be torn apart by ramming into tunnels roofs it does resemble shape of underground machine but not a loader only machine that comes to my mind is something that are used for movingplacing hydraulic support jacks in tunnels sorry for poor quality i didnt find better picture of it it does have claw four wheels and articulated chassis but have much greater range of movement of the arm anyway id give it at least 35 for overall look model itself as a set looks unfinished or cut down on pieces after visit of an accountant for me it looks like engine part was built differently with knobs for steeringclaw operating sticking out from back claw needs almost seven full turns of the worm gear to close from opened position and is rather annoing to use it in way it is built in this model bracket that holds bevel gears responsible for steering is rather loose being hold in place by single 34 pin on the other hand the steering works very well it seems that lack of differential will be more common in lego sets becuase it is another model that have fake engine driven by single wheel like in old russian rc cars i am ok with that but it is a pitty that this model has only r2 engine thing that i do not like the most in this model is how the claw arm works first of all it barelly lifts the claw of the ground the movement could be much better and it has major design flaw  universal joints are not placed in line with articulation points and this is main reason of 5l axle not being suported on both sides under the turntable while rainsing the arm it bends a little i really would like to see this model built differently with normal bucket and better range of movement edited by mlonger 05 december 2015  1108 pm	negative
excellent review worth waiting for the set itself is very interesting looks like it may have one interesting build techniques thanks for the review andy ad	positive
great review thank you the set to me is kinda blah interested more in the new panels than the rest of it	neutral
think this is the only 1h set ill be getting guess im waiting for 2h for the rest of the construction stuff this set looks okay to me it includes the instructions for both models which is cool and includes some great parts i like that its not just another bucket loader and that it actually tries something different too	positive
freekysch on 06 december 2015  1200 pm said great review and great pictures  many thanks for talking the time to review this set  i am a fan of lego technic construction stuff but this set is not so appealing to me but then again i am sure some people will love it indeed very good review and also good points pointed out by mlonger  this set doesnt appealing to me neither but before i knew what it was i was thinking it was interesting but now its so simple a set close to 500 pieces with only 1 real function and the entire rear section looks unfinished	negative
great review one thing reaaaaaally bothers me about this set both models have the engine connected to one wheel the other wheel on the powered axle is just left to rotate freely and that really bothers me as it did in 42022 on 42022 even more tbh since its main feature is being a frigging car looking at the pics it isnt even a space issue as it was in the hot rod where they needed to route the steering through so they just cheaped out and didnt bother fitting a diff in there or even a live axle link im not very interested in this set not into construction stuff but i think this is a worrying trend 	negative
thanks for review mostlytechnic not a must have for me but this set have nice assortment of parts new turntable new panels i like yellow and if ill buy two of this sets  ill get enough wheels for proper 18wheeler and rubber connectors that i almost dont using at all but want to have more and more edited by victor imaginator 06 december 2015  0219 pm	positive
definately a quirky set i think id have prefered a bucket on the front with a complex lift and tip mechanism but a grab is different as for the b model i may prefer its functions to the a model certainly something different we have not seen before	neutral

lego 42045 technic hydroplane racer thanks to lego and eurobricks for making this review possible this was supposed to be a previewreview before the dec 1 release date for the set but it got stuck in customs or something and didnt arrive in time well id rather do a good late review than a rushed review so here it is name hydroplane racer set number 42045 pieces 180 price 1999 minifigs 0 theme technic year of release 2016 links bricklink brickset the box standard technic box action photo 2in1 logo inset of functions and the new try our app logo in the corner the box back more standard stuff with the bmodel and a larger app ad the contents 3 bags two manuals yes despite all the ads for their instructions app they included printed manuals for both the main and b models a big sticker sheet and two loose black beams the interesting parts theres a lot of panels in this set some are new colors the blue curved panel and the lshaped blue panels are a new mold i see them being used as mudguards on future sets or maybe even this year i havent looked at the other 2016 technic sets in detail yet the hose soft axle 7 long in black is new as well the normal 7 axle in yellow is a new color too and i have no idea why its in this set both models use it in invisible places so theres no reason other than making it easier to grab the right length axle to have it i assume other sets this year are using it but im not sure the manual and the dumbingdown continues now they have to show people to compare axle lengths to the 11 prints on the page that have always been there but how does the 11 work on the app might have to look into that for the record i pulled out my phone and tried to find the app in the google store couldnt find it so then i went to the lego website shown on the page and it had a link to it turns out it wasnt showing up because its tablet only so google wasnt showing it to me on my phone ill try again later with a tablet starting the build two technic standards a bunch of pieces linked together to make a specific pattern of holes and an engine block some weirdness this felt very weird to me  making the crankshaft for the engine they have you build it right to left i dont know if its because im a lefty or what but it felt awkward i need to look in some old manuals and see if its always been this way nope i randomly looked at 2013s set 42000 racer and it builds it left to right assembling the core heres the core of the racer upside down the engine block some gears at each end and a couple boat studs for smooth gliding and yes they cheated and those are only attached on two studs instead of all 4 im always amazed at how lego geometry keeps finding interesting ways that it works like here with those boat studs they fit perfectly into the bottom of the brick and against the beam the front end up front we get a standard blue seat with a couple hidden wheels behind it a boat doesnt typically have wheels but these will drive the mechanisms of this model so well let it slide an odd part choice here though  in the very front there are two tan axle pin without friction parts holding that 3 long liftarm on why theres no need in either model for the nonfriction pin and theres lots of the normal blue axle pins in the set so why include these two different pins and all done it looks like a huge jump here but its really not the front and rear connect to each other and then a bunch of big panels are added that make the model look way bigger the stickers on this set really make it work without them its pretty bland and boring so i recommend using them from the rear at the back we have a fan to propel the boat thats not so accurate all the images i can find of reallife boats use props in the water but since this is a nonfloating model we have to make some tweaks i guess there also should be fins going down into the water for stability and hydroplaning but again had to drop that heres an example of a real boat you can see they nailed the overall look quite well the underside for those that want to see the mechanicals heres the underside of the model minifig scale technic nope not quite a fig will fit the seat but sticks out of the cockpit and cant fit a helmet at all so close starting the b model again with the engine block but this time an opposing 4 instead of inline an odd part its rare for lego to include parts specific to the bmodel so i was curious when i found this 2axle with pin a fairly new part in the main model its used in a place that a normal 3 pin would have been fine and its the only one of these in the whole set so it obviously must be needed in the bmodel sure enough theres an assembly here that needs it the front of the boat more upsidedown building and that silver piston is basically only there as a spacer it has no real function yet it turns out later an axle goes into it so its a support for one end of the axle adding the wheels we keep building around the engine this model uses the same wheel setup as the main model taking shape the bmodel instructions tell you to put the stickers on in case you havent  they actually did a good job making the sticker work on either model but the silver piston used as a crossbrace is a bit weird it can spin so that axle hole on the side ends up facing whatever way it wants the back end the flex axles are used here under the panels just for appearance and to support the exhausts at the right angle same fan propulsion as the main model and just as wrong here  worse the gearing is switched in the main model the pistons and fan spin pretty quickly as you push the boat across the floor in this one they turn very slowly more instruction weirdness im always curious at how lego decides to do instructions heres how the panels on one side of the boat are assembled for the mirror image on the other side they tell you to put all 3 pins into the short panel as step 1 2 black and a blue add the white piece as step 2 and then add teh second panel and stickers as step 3 why two different ways all done heres a similar angle as most of the official images looks ok i noticed though how obvious the wheels are the back of the box image is a lower angle that hides them more and i like the mudguard panels as seats pretty clever from the side im not fond of the profile it doesnt sit level like i think it should the wheels are a stud too low sticking out of the bottom the underside like most bmodels there are compromises theres pins and axles sticking out but thats what you do when faced with a limited piece selection minifig scale yet nope not quite a bit too big this time i think the driver is supposed to sit in the seat with knees over the front of the guard where the grey pin is so the minifig is way too small spare pieces very few leftovers in this bmodel the conclusion so whats my conclusion on this model the bmodel is fairly meh and too similar to the main model however i love the hydroplane racer itself it looks great and is very swooshable for the price its surprisingly large thanks to the big panels on the sides yes this is one set that really needs the stickers to look good but they look great and are well worth putting on the ratings value 910  close to 10 cents a piece and a fairly large model for the price design 910  looks great other than the tiny fan on the back minifigs na  i was tempted to give a score since a minifig almost fits but thatd be cheating playability 810  not much functionality other than the engine and fan spinning but very swooshable and sturdy enough to be played with parts 910  a bunch of panels including some new ones just about every kind of technic pin and quite a few thin liftarms  overall 910  the set is a solid winner as long as your satisfied with the main model	positive
again great review with superb pictures the white and blue certainly works very well with your dark backdrop thorough review for such a small model small in size but great as a set tell me why did i let you review this one	positive
quote and the dumbingdown continues now they have to show people to compare axle lengths to the 11 prints on the page that have always been there but how does the 11 work on the app might have to look into that for the record i pulled out my phone and tried to find the app in the google store couldnt find it so then i went to the lego website shown on the page and it had a link to it turns out it wasnt showing up because its tablet only so google wasnt showing it to me on my phone ill try again later with a tablet funny thing is that they changed colour of 7l axle to yellow and on that picture it still is in lbg	neutral
thanks for a great review too bad there is only one blue curved panel in this set my opinion on the frictionless axlepins is that the flex axle might be easier to stick in them than in regularblue axlepins didnt actually try it though  edited by majklspajkl 05 december 2015  1146 pm	negative

great review im a bit undecided on the set though it has some nice parts 4 cil engine in such a small set and it looks good but also a bit small and simple not sure if it stands up to the standards of the small tracked loader or similar for sets of this size and as a parts pack for panelsflaxles the display team jet is infinitely better ill probably pick one up but right now i really want another tracked loader last one was sacrificed to the mod gods	neutral

very timely review jim my wife has just surprised me by giving me this set a few days ago and i have just built the a model two days ago and b model yesterday i agree with all that you wrote above i dont have tumbler tires but i have 9398 tires driving is smooth but steering  suspension will be bad as you said due to negative caster and tires hitting the chassis anyway tonight i will destroy the b model and rebuilt this httpwwwbusterhau8cmodelhtml	positive
the set is a looker youve got to admit it but what it gives in looks does not make up for what it lacks in functions i really wanted this set badly even when i restarted my adventure with technic about a month ago than i learned more and more about what a good model can do mostly thanks to this forum and yt right now im a bit disappointed with the arctic truck  smaller sets offer more functions and teach you much more jim it was a great review nevertheless edited by pgplay 14 december 2015  1122 am	negative
great review i bought this model several weeks ago and the box has sat on my shelf so i think after this i will be digging it out for christmas and i expect my son will have a lot of fun with it when its built ps these tumbler tyres look amazing on this model and indeed amazing in their own right	positive

you switched the sides for the panel with the unsymmetrical sticker otherwise you would see that the cut off part is where theres a beam in front of the panel thats probably done because the beam could possibly damage the sticker either while building or while placed against it for a long time or its simply omitted because it wouldnt be completely visible	neutral
until i saw photos of this set i wasnt convinced i wanted it now after seeing all the combinations ab and tumbler tires i am definitely buying two copies i need orange parts and black treads anyway the only problem i have with this is that its going to encourage me to buy many copies of the drag racer just to get enough wheels to play with	positive

review  42001  mini offroader introduction technic mini models are sometimes regarded as models not worth buying i dont agree with this opinion whether its a special part or innovative building technique almost every mini model has something that makes the set worthwhile this time i will be reviewing the 42001 mini offroader this model is not a smaller version of an existing model so theres no real comparison with a bigger brother or sister if you will nor does the model resemble a real life brand or vehicle so it is what it is a mini offroader note all images can be clicked for hires versions set information number 42001 title mini offroader theme technic released 2013 part count 100 box weight 165 gr box dimensions 155 x 140 x 42 cm set price msrp 999 eur de  799 gbp  1299 usd price per part de 0100 eur  uk 0080 gbp  usa 0130 usd links brickset bricklink the box the box measures 155 x 140 x 42 cm which is obviously not very big the weight of the box is approximately 165 grams frontside the front of the box shows a though four wheel drive offroader challenging a fierce rocky mountain trailnow does it what the box actually shows is mini offroader challenging a small foam rock formation much like rocks used in star trek the original series yet smaller the box also states that this model is for the age of 7 till 14 more importantly the 2models in1 logo is clearly visible which means this set can be used to build two different models backside the backside shows a picture of the alternate model and a smaller version of the original model the conversion arrow and the 2in1 are printed to clarify that the main model can be converted into a secondary model sides one of the sides shows the 2in1 logo and a picture of the main model another side shows a picture of one of the wheels in actual size and again a picture of the main model contents of the box the box contains 2 booklets 2 bags 4 tires booklets this set contains two booklets which is not very common for a set this size both models share the same chassis which is why the build has been divided over two booklets one for the chassis 8 pages with 10 steps and one for the bodywork 34 pages with 23 steps for the main model and 20 steps for the alternate model bags the box contains only 2 bags which is to be expected from a set consisting of 100 parts one of the bags is filled with liftarms panels rims and two elastic bands the other bags contains all the other parts like pins axles connectors etc opening the bags results in the following collection of parts with the exception of the tires no abundant number parts that will add real value to your collection nevertheless there are some interesting orange parts and elastic bands tires the tires are provided seperately ie not contained in the bags from the picture you can see that these tires have a front and a back side so you should pay attention when fitting them to the rims which have two different sides as well highlighted parts this section describes the unique andor highlighted parts very small smooth technic panel 21 and 22 these two small technic were new at the time of release and this set was only one of two sets containing them in orange the other set is the 42007  moto cross bike at the moment of writing theres a third set containing these parts the black champion racer side a side b small rubber band i was under the impression that these white rubber bands werent that common but it seems that these bands are as common as dirt but hey you cant have enough rubber bands thin liftarm 1x5 with axle holes like the panels these liftarms were also new at the time of release looking at the the frequent usage in other sets this part has proven to be a most useful mammal thin liftarm 1x3 not a very rare piece per se but if you are not into bionicle this liftarm part can be hard to find your other option would be to buy the 9390  mini tow truck or the 8305  dual bikes from a while ago 2000 long pin with center pin hole this relatively new kid on the block is currently used in many technic and nontechnic sets and has well proven its worth axle pin connector hub with 2 axles like the previous part this newish part is also quite helpful in certain situations part list heres the complete list for all 100 parts building experience the build starts with the chassis of the offroader after connecting some liftarms two elastic bands one on each side are attached to the towball pins this is all there is to the suspension plain and simple the two elastic bands contract the lshaped liftarms which results in the long ends swiveling downwards the video below demonstrates the suspension the simplicity doesnt do it justice because it works like a charm the suspension is very smooth with the right amount of stretch and resistance this great working suspension adds a lot of value to this set to quote john hurt in the movie contact why build one when you can have two at twice the price i have purchased two sets so we can simultaneously see both models and make a proper comparison below you can see two identical chassis which will be used for both versions of the build at this stage we have arrived at the end of the first booklet which only took about ten minutes not surprising since the first booklet only has 10 building steps progressing to the second booklet you need to choose between building the main and alternative model thats a choice i dont need to make for this review so lets start with the main model main model when building the bodywork theres a rather peculiar building technique which you wouldnt expect in an official lego set the axle and pin connector hub with 2 axles only protrudes halfway into the double bent liftarm the thin 1x4 liftarm which is added in one of the following steps makes sure the hubs stay perfectly in place but i was still surprised to see this technique the finished bodywork for the main model looks likeuhhwelli dont know exactly it doesnt bear any resemblance to a real life model which makes it hard to judge one things for sure its not the best looking technic mini model the bodywork can be attached to the chassis by using a 7l axle and two bushes one on each side of the chassis alternate model unfortunately the alternate model doesnt look much better than the main model its even a stud less wide while you would like to see slightly more body matching the size of the tires and chassis attached to the chassis the body is even more out of proportion its not really ugly and the color scheme is great obviously this goes for the main model as well but the body simply doesnt match the chassis i can only imagine that this model is supposed to have a chibi look much like the microfighter star wars models comparison the following section shows a selection of images from different angles to compare the main and secondary model the main model has a bit more volume while the alternate model has a more sporty look front view the main model has headlights which are attached at a higher point while the alternate model has headlights which are placed more closely next to each other rear view a slightly different setup in both models where the main model again has higher placed rear lights side view the side view shows that the panels are used differently in both models the main models uses them as doors while the alternate model uses them as engine cover bonnet top view the top view reveals that the main model might have room for a minifig parts left the left image shows the parts which are left after building the main model while the second image shows the parts left after building the alternate model as you can see the main model uses slightly more parts than the alternate model features besides the awesome suspension which we already have discussed there arent a lot of features in this set theres actually a single feature which is only present in the main modelopening doors wow impressive well maybe we cant expect too much functionality in such a small model summary the offroader is a fun model which is fairly easy to build the suspension is simple yet very effective the model could do better in the design department but the suspension offers great playability and that is what this set is all about the orange parts are not very common so they are an added bonus all things considered this set is definitely worth the few bucks you need to spend on it pros great suspension fun to play with some semi rare orange parts great color scheme cons no resemblence to an actual offroader not the best looking model score below are my scores based on different categories 6 design not the best looking technic model 7 building experience the suspension makes it fun to build 7 features the suspension makes up for the lack of functionality 8 playability the model has carswooshability 7 parts some interesting orange parts 8 value for money great present for the younger builders 71 elastic hope you enjoyed it thanks for reading and please rate this set at the top of this topic	positive

during the annual thanksgiving road trip to the relatives i stopped by the tru in portland or lo and behold the new mars mission sets obviously i bought them  the box not much to say standard box art for mm sets nothing new the parts some good parts here even if you dont like the set which i highly doubt after ive had my say p  its a decent parts pack i noticed that some old parts have been renewed i know the wheel has been used in the 07 sets but the cockpit and hitch i havent seen in a while the vldss very large dss grr new part at least i think it is someone slap me if it isnt wacko the figs i know ive seen that head before but i have no idea where does anyone know i was hoping that the aliens would have new arms at least i was sadly mistaken on the upside i finally discovered that they glow in the dark  the alien has a jetpack if thats not the silliest thing ive ever seen i dont know what is the build simple build a block so easy a caveman cou oh never mind geicos used that one enough then we have this jobber right here not sure what it is but it looks like some crystal scanning device its starting to look pretty nice it almost looks practical the cockpit is suffering from a bad dose of overstickering on the upside we have a new piece there to hold the cockpit on part 1 complete it has a nice little radio antenna which is ruined by the use of a random missile that looks like its going to shoot the antenna before it shoots the alien still i never say no to a good missile i can use for something else the trailer fairly simple but it works it features stabilizing arms a handheld saw and an extremely random minibot whos purpose escapes me the whole meal deal erm general pics overall i thought this was a good set in fact it reminds me of this	positive

a wonderful set and perhaps as close to classic space as possible y also theres a great amount of very useful and interesting parts too like these round stabilizer parts with clip  theres a complete different feeling with this new sets compared to the first mm ones 8 beside the a little more realistic aspects of it with the more enclosed cockpit nearly with some controls   its the overall more solid feeling i guess the other sets look pretty neat and fashionable at the surface but their internal structure is much more hollow and useless with some studless technic beams and such stuff very shining but hard and boring to mod just aimed for maximal cool looking box art and the rest went down for saving costs beside that already pretty good 7692 dropship that is the only thing i dont get with that is why the minirobots a onearmed one ach pirates on mars i suppose xd	positive

wub thanks for another great review sweet i am also glad that it is a very different alien fighter design as i already have three varients of the old type the fighter transforms better than i thought it would i was expecting just the wings i should be buying this set as well mr mandalorian on nov 26 2007 0345 pm said without antigrav support it would fall forward on its nose each time it transformed well since antigrav doesnt exist and will never exist there has to be another option looking at it in tank mode it does have a vague aerofoil shape so i think it should be able to work as a lifting body all it needs to do then is move fast enough to start taking off and then it can extend the wings 8	neutral
great review sinner on nov 26 2007 1222 am said well since antigrav doesnt exist and will never exist there has to be another option looking at it in tank mode it does have a vague aerofoil shape so i think it should be able to work as a lifting body all it needs to do then is move fast enough to start taking off and then it can extend the wings 8 this is clearly tlg officially supporting antigrav technologyi mean think about it how can it support itself without antigrav while transforming the answer it cant sweet p	neutral
thanks for a very thorough review i might think about getting this i really like the mini alien fighter and the transformation idea is always a welcome one both modes look pretty good despite the some of the odd coloured bricks which id mod out you know what it reminds me of some of the futuristic designs in the gerry anderson series	positive

hmmm i doubt ill be getting this set good review though	negative
thanks guys lasse d on nov 26 2007 0854 am said wow this is actually quite a neat set it is definitively my favorite in the line after the big drilling unit begingeek im not sure it would nose dive when transforming from tank mode i guess it would pick up speed and transform quickly since it doesnt seem to have any downwards pointing thrusters endgeek i dont think that tank is very fast maybe if it drove off of a crater commander andrew of 501 st on nov 26 2007 0903 am said friggin sweet thank you mr mandy for the reveiw of this sweet ship y wub i see you know imperialshadows  	positive
lasse d on nov 26 2007 0454 pm said im not sure it would nose dive when transforming from tank mode i guess it would pick up speed and transform quickly since it doesnt seem to have any downwards pointing thrusters the one thing youd have to make sure of though is that it was fairly light and the wheel base had a fairly large surface area actually thats two things so as to make sure it didnt dig into the soil if that happened transformation would be harder as the wheels would dig into the ground and drag through the soil then itd nose dive	neutral
great review mr mandalorian y im not a fan of mm and dont like this set much but it has some neat features but the only way i can see it transforming is by racing off a cliff and swinging its wings out wacko to the brickmobile 	negative
and another tks and congrats mm on that review  like the oher post i think that this set is a wastre of time and money and shelfspace its such a ripp off from that ugly alfa team crapjet i do not like the design of the jet itself the small flags as front is so lame  and i dont like those orange wheels as engines  furthermore i dont like the rover mode either  the only cool thing about it is the special martian jet which they should ahve sold separatly p at least some interesting parts but that far from saving that set imo  money saved on once again p yoda	negative
great review mr m y i wub those green flames and the design of the ship is pretty good thanks for the review and great pictures they are clear big and describe the set just the way they should	positive

lasse d on nov 26 2007 0334 pm said 1 there will always be kudos for a good review at eb  2 yeah it does look quite slow and tanklike it is a shame lego didnt make a more obvious way shoving what goes on you mean the ungainly way in which the wheels have to turn in order to change from tank mode i think you are right as well on the other hand if it has antigrav then it doesnt really make sense to have wheels as well i mean if the power goes then the wheels cant turn anyways it must have antigrav otherwise none of the flying sets would work athos on nov 26 2007 0402 pm said i think blue must be a cheaper color for lego steve i think this is weird tlc included way too many random colors blue red green and yellow wacko	negative

great review y i am sure to get this set for parts now his legs dont look very poseable  thanks hinck vbbn	neutral
great review as always hinckley frankly im in love with this thing so much so in fact that ive been calling it shadow panther for weeks but never mind anyway why do i like it well purple is such a fantastic lego colour its sparingly used which makes it interesting and it simply looks great those jetpackbackpack things the robots are wearing and if they are jetpacks as the back of the box suggests then the use of chaisaws is quite nifty and innovative the minibot is cool and certainly an interesting gimmick sure they dont look quite as good in some of the other sets but here it looks great the overall structure and design are cool too its always nice to see an irregular mech and this is no exception its especially cool whee the spines are concerned plus on top of all that its got a nice selection of parts including some lovely new ones and the inlaid box is interesting well worth getting i think	positive
hinckley on nov 27 2007 0747 pm said thanks everyone im glad you are enjoying the review im working on the 8118 right now and will have comics up for both starting tonight the instructions do not have a comic but i always write one for my reviews featuring my sigfig or other fabuland creatures interacting with the new set translation interactingwhacking fabuland creatures sinner copmike and yoda usually xd 	neutral
dont forget bianca and gavin o lordship of pies d truly another excellent review the pictures are absolutely splendid as usual im really glad those airvent pieces were done so well while i remain skeptical about the new giant spikes youve sold me on this set i cant wait to see the fabuland comic and your final verdict hink	neutral

from the lego store in chicago if i recall his post properly my goodness hink youre going to pull an allnighter for reviews at this rate oh well its kinda worth it right p	neutral
another great review hink looks like a great set quote the cockpit isnt sealed and is actually aggravatingly unrealistic as it leaves the drivers chest vulnerable to enemy fire actually the cockpit lacks any controls as seen here where it looks like keiken is simply pounding a counter demanding food d gimme food or else my friend up there willl shoot your punk  into mars well i guess that explains why there are no robot snipers in ef if there were well wouldnt be much of a story would there xd	positive
john cleese on nov 27 2007 1126 pm said this designers were on a roll with this one until it came to the flying unit it looks like a shambles epecially the guns looking rather simplistic although they used something similar to the light and sound globe peice which is kind of neat i dont think ill be buying this but your review almost talked me into it cool but my reviews are not meant to sway anyone they should just inform people further as if they want to buy it or not i am not necessarily for encouraging anyone to buy every set i review d but im glad you liked it thank you and actually i did feel the same way you did about the flying module until i put sinner in it and started to play heres a sneak peek of the comic and a cool feature of ryos shipit can be configured in a lot of different ways	neutral
this one is much better than i thought i didnt expect the gun and the turret to be geared i agree that a lot of the details sux hollow inside lame cockpits but as an overall package it looks quite good the best part is no shooter is the nightmare finally over  the bonus robot is a much better idea the large amount of blue pieces make this a must buy for me as impartial needs more raw materials p how well do the tracks work the last tank was too light and it didnt roll well at all  thanks for these photos as well hinckley wub so far the 08 exoforce sets are looking good sweet hinckley on nov 28 2007 0448 pm said and actually i did feel the same way you did about the flying module until i put sinner in it and started to play p wow its big enough for my big walrus head wub	positive

thanks for that good review hinckley y a really interesting set and a turning point for lego minirobots instead of shooting crap pretty cool i hope the kidsll like it too for the design i love that asymmetrical look of the front part and the sleek guns of the flyer its smart that the gatling gun moves along with the tank too the set idea with two vehicles in ones not new but very play able and the treadsbig wheel designs cool i dont like the use of studless technic beams but well they do their job i guess and keikens cockpit should be easy to improve	positive
asuka on nov 28 2007 0241 pm said for the design i love that asymmetrical look of the front part and the sleek guns of the flyer the asymmetry reminds me of the wookie vehicles in starwars battlegrounds y and i see they changed back to the first color schemes for minifig suits which i think where better than the dark suits of 2007 except for hikarus wub  luxorv	neutral

awesome thanks hinckley i was not planning to get this set but now it look as if i will have too i still cannot afford it anyway 	positive
hinkley you are the man your reviews just keep on getting better and better although all of the sets this year are great and i love them all to bits i cant say there was one that i absolutely felt like something id buy except for the storm lasher but with this review i think this will be the first purchase of 2008 for me i totally agree with you on how the spider looks better without minirobot but from looking at where the cockpit is placed and how the skull on the cockpit is lodged underneath the walker maybe the minirobot would look better mounted underneath the head that way it looks more even and even gives the thing a nasty set of teeth i gotta try it out once i get it cant wait for the fabuland comics keep it up hink	positive
hinckley on dec 6 2007 0456 am said honckly wow dude  well at least you got the c and the k of course the e is missing its all right though eight letter words can be challenging p thats always the case for me although i have the assault tiger and will start on it next on the box it looks like it is wearing huge bell bottoms d i want to get the chameleon hunter i really like the look of it and forgot to pick it up guess ill have to go back to tru  cross your fingers that i find more indy sets xd ill just stick to calling you hink y less letters d 	neutral

oh i just wub theat minibot creepy but strangely cute nice piece selection and the idea of something with rotors that double up as cutters storming no pun intended through the jungle ripping it apart is just fantastic to me anyway im liking the new swords as rotors blades thats pretty innovative and the exhaust pipe pieces are intriguing	positive

here is my review of the set 6265 sabre island overview sabre island was release in 1990 an it contained 92 pieces and its retail price was 1550 it comes with 3 imperial blue coats and a nice outpost for them the pictures  full review anyway you can see here a picture of the box the model shown on the box differs from the actual model slightly and the back of the box which shows some nice alternative models from the pieces provided a close up of two or three of the alternative models and now for the minifigs i prefer the red coats over the blue coats but these minifigs are nice and for the number of pieces one gets a fair amount of them the set itself makes a nice small outpost it comes complete with a palm tree a cannon with ammo on a turntable a small tower a nice large imperial flag and a little red row boat here is a shot from ground level showing the cannon and blue coat patrolling the out post the rowing boat was a nice touch and it comes with a small flag too no pirates will avoid the wrath of myself and my mighty island the top of the tower is rather plain and simple which in some ways is good as it keeps the whole set detailed yet not crowded but i feel a little something should of been added to the top though the back is lacking any type of walls so one can play with the minifigs inside yet their are also no stairs or any other ways for the blue coats to climb up their tower either the rag tag pirates attack sabre island but never fear the lord of pies is here me throwing a pie at captain ironhook from another angle overall i think this is a very good if somewhat simple set and makes a great cheap imperial set comments thoughts and opinions are welcome and sorry about the darkness in some photos i have not had time to take photographs when it is till light recently for when i return home it is dark   edit fixed thank you edited by phred 12 april 2015  0514 am	positive
nice review hmmi gave it a 4why very good bits 3 epaulettes for 3 gurads patterned wall parts cannon bad bits no pirates to fight title is rather grand for an outpost top needs battlements not very low lattices needs a more substantial base  the wall goes right into the sea  surely the whole thing would sink palm tree is too short and the rest is good p you might want to fix the vote option for 5  it appears to be the title you cant vote for it pirate king skelly killer edit ok boney but i gave it a 4 edited by slyowl 06 december 2007  0732 pm	positive

lord of pies on dec 6 2007 0724 pm said the top of the tower is rather plain and simple which in some ways is good as it keeps the whole set detailed yet not crowded but i feel a little something should of been added to the top though perhaps a catapult steve	neutral
athos on jan 2 2008 1059 pm said perhaps a catapult steve hmm maybe although a catapult doesnt really fit in to that time period all that well	neutral
did i hear right a catapult in the 16th17th18th and 19th centuries wacko perhaps its an appeal for lord of pies to have his own personal catapult to pelt the pirates with whipped cream pastries should they try to sail past but this begs the question why waste perfectly good pie on those scurvy mangy muttfaced villians	neutral

indexed im going to have to start dodging cannon balls soon if i dont start making some pirate mocs pirate anywayz ive had my shell service station set  6378 built exactly by the book and sitting around for the longest time with the recent twinning of my town with dr sinister i needed a gas station that could handle a lot more traffic especially military traffic and these new 6wide vehicles xd  here be a thumblink to the original station at bl i love this station so much but it really needed some modernization the reopening of this station received a lot of attention even the local police stopped right over one big upgrade to this station is the selling of propane tanks which is generally a rare commodity from the lego towns ive seen xd also at this service station is a propane tank refilling station the milkman is our first propane customer the interior has also had an addition and many upgrades for instance this building now has florescent lighting a big frig in the back and more shelf space y oh look theres the officer purchasing a mountain dew now that theres more shelf space we can sell more than just 1x1 round yellow bricks and levers we now have available 1x1 round plates and 1x1 round cones available in multiple colors d with this upgraded gas station hopefully this town will bring in more business and customers into my small town xd p	positive
 i really love everything you did with this gas station it looks very cozy amazing how you said you built it by the book does that mean you didnt have the set but you used your own pieces to rebuild the thing the flourescent lighting is genius and the interior space looks just like what youd see at those little shops i really dig the moc  it gives me good ideas and now i want a gas station of my own p and the history behind how it was rebuilt and how it will improve business etc is so cool wub	positive

my 2nd review what a veteran  again found this set via a shop assistant in my local tru portsmouth uk this evening comes in at 4499 which is pretty steep but you get quite a bit for your money front of the box  back of the box  back of the box closeup  contents  it was a nice surprise to get numbered bags  not had a large set with numbered bags for quite a while at least in none of the sets ive bought recently didnt take a close up of the stickers but i was quite disappointed that the curved pieces had stickers  if they could print the att curved pieces why not these minifigs  oh  and theres a nice backprint on the pilot figure  now the build was pretty good  you build the plane first after the minifigures quite an interesting build in a way becayse for a while you think the back is the front  and then you realise heh now  ive not seen the film in a while but i dont recall a guy flying a plane with a fishing rod  dont flame me if this is what happens see earlier point regards not seeing the film in ages p after that you build the temple in stages starting with the entrance first and then the holey floor section with the spears these spears are just loosely placed into technic holed bricks quite easy to make em flick out but they can go anywhere hehe entrance  holey floor  spears  these two parts are hinged and on an angle to each other and the gap makes for a handy bottomless pit complete with pole for indy to swing over with his whip after that you create the door and the ratchet mechanism to keep it raised after that you add the runners for the ball and the swinging knives trap swords trap  before  after  finally you build the statue that holds the efigy nice bit of construction here especially the way that everything falls over once the efigy is removed do be careful when putting the curved bits on though  it appears one of the edges on mine has slightly bent when putting it on  nowt noticable though temple  preparing to steal  run you can see that the temple has toppled and debris has fallen all around  and then as he goes through the door the door falls he gets his hat and then the rock ball starts a rolling ruuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuun the stickers were a pain though  theres no room for a border around the sticker here beware after all that is done you join all the pieces together and it makes more a really good playset plenty of opportunity for recreating scenes here idol closeup  total set  spares  yet more spare stickers sorry ive already put the spares in my box of bits overall 8 out of 10  lots of play value and a pretty nice build too many stickers though  and defo poor arms for the skeletons edited by imperialshadows 01 june 2008  1218 pm	positive

this set is pretty nice i love the idol id probably buy the set just for that d lol is it just me or in the earlier concepts of this set we saw a native on the box i wonder why they removed it  wacko	neutral
tks so much big pete for thisd awsome review of yet another fantastic indy sets  its clearly one of the best lines of all times with sw 8 that idol is superb and i love all the details of that set loads of cool defense mechanisms sweet vegetation and yeay another black carrot torch p and those mfs are really nice  i am so happy to see lego go dark tan wub now i clearly cant wait to enjoy building this set  fertility idol on  yoda	positive
i just noticed another inconsistency between box art and the actual set  on the box the biplan has white wing supports theyre just plane windows without glass in them and yet the set they are dark grey or is it bley  can never tell the difference without careful study add to that  the outer of the engine at the front is white on the box and black in the set we dont normally have this many inconsistencies do we 	neutral
this set is so cool and another must buy  im in trouble next year it seems the figs are great wub i think the plane is only ok perhaps they should have made that in a separate set as it needed to be a certain size to fit the figs but that meant that the tail is way too short here is a picture of the actual plane so you can see what i mean notice the pilot is fishing   the temple is another story i think lego have done an incredible job with this fitting in the key parts of this sequence without making an absurdly large model addtionally there are many parts in this set that i havent got so it shouldnt be too hard to justify xd thanks for another great review sweet i love the photo of indy running with the idol and the boulder close behind p naith on dec 16 2007 1020 pm said lol is it just me or in the earlier concepts of this set we saw a native on the box i wonder why they removed it  wacko i recall that too  edit yes there was one big pete on dec 16 2007 1128 pm said we dont normally have this many inconsistencies do we  quite annoying ones too i think the plane looks better with those being white	neutral
because of exams and other obligations i havent posted this sooner seeing that noone else has reviewed this set i thought i might as well do it myself the set in its entire glory minus the slammer instructions and the obviously massive sticker sheet the four cars included in this set a muscle car a sports car a roadster and the police offroader because the police obviously have no clue that an offroader is useless for catching streetracers no less a batmobileish sports car it will always trail behind but the police have a trick up their sleeve  the drawbridge gotcha and the mechanism that makes it all tick the motor is nothing more than a slow pullback motor push down the bridge the latch will hook on to the gear and keep it in place until the latch is released and theres the new gas station staying within theme this gasstation is like the tanker in 8147 from the company fuel 4 speed theres a notable presence of detail here such as the sodadispenser water coolant bottles and other accesories two fuel pumps and bumperlevel railings to prevent cars from crashing into them theres no interior however and as demonstrated here by a loyal octanemployee and a pursuing officer the gas station is built to minifigscale my impressions of this set as a collector of tiny turbos and yet to miss a set i got this one regardless of what it included the gas station is indeed very nice and the minifigscale accesories were unexpected the lack of interior is no big issue and the both the station and bridge can with ease be implemented into a minifig town the bridge also solidly built and includes the ramps in its design so it can be lifted with ramps attached without breaking apart the slammer included in the set is identical apart from the white color with those in 8147 the cars are also very nice altough i am yet to get used to the yellow batmobile as ive grown accustomed to calling it i also love the offroaders chunky tires they make perfect wheels for the newer minifigscale cars i never consider priceparts ratio and here it would for me be irrelevant because it will never be demolished for parts the play value is what i would consider pretty good and while the bridge wont rise with a car on it its still strong enough to stay open with a car tipping over the edge hmm every nerve in my body is saying that this sets is worth roughly 810 so verdict 810 edited by whitefang 23 may 2009  0701 pm indexed	positive

heres all the parts in assorted baggies and the horribly messed up instructions four astronauts and four aliens with an extra gold visor yay not bad the base of the horribly unstable alien craft the wings move up and down aswell as back and forth the purpose i know not next we build the nerf section of the base basically technic and the rest of the tube connectors heres the farthest i got the little missle to go its fairly dissapointing good thing i didnt expect much from this portion of the set heres the start of the command base more of the main structure will be adding lots of things to all the little beams heres a storage container and the surprisingly not flimsy radar on this side we see the alien elevator it uses a horribly long technic rod i have not seen one of this proportion its like a foot and a half long more of the inner base where all the little tubes shall go all the connected tubes and such i also encountered a problem in the instructions it says for the end of the elevator prong to be touching the tube connector where it is shown here but mine has a 1x space inbetween no matter heres the completed base  my knee again onto the spaceship the bulk of it is just technic supporting beams with some large slope peices covering it all up more on that later the white coverup the middle section lifts up to store the overly large jetpack as you see the storage containers take up most the bulk in the back and you can see the jetpack on the ground aswell as the trigger hand hold thing that allows you to swoosh it look in the back lego greebles despite the large cockpit it only holds one person laying down the wings are really the saving grace  double layered with a nice two toned effect kitty nudged me this picture so its abit blurry my apologies  extra peices and or peices i have no idea where the hell they go p overall the set is quite fun i must admit full price i probably would not go for it but i got it for just under 70 dollars for that price i can confidently say its quite worth it many useful peices nice figures other than the aliens and the tube things are quite fun to boot even though i liked the life on mars system more which i also have none the less its very fun to make them shoot around alright so its not much of a command base either and it looks abit bare but its still fun even if you ignore the nerf section overall i give it a hardy 35 out of 5 the openness and epic fail of a missile launcher are hard to get by but overall its a dandy set d merry christmas wub	positive

thanks for the review brickmaster this set looks nice i really like the orange wub and white colour scheme although the purple of the lom base was very cool too i only have the lom base if you have it built could you show a comparison on an unrelated note by the time i realised the red and blue hangers on the lom base were for the red and blue mechs the mechs were no longer in stores  i was a bit slow huh p anywho this is one set i wont be buying although if the rocket was sold separately id get that d thanks again y peace	neutral

thanks for the photos and review brickmaster im hoping to find this on sale as well no luck so far i love the white ship and i think the base would be amusing but ultimately hard to reuse incidentally that long axel is common in recent technic sets but i think it was orignally made for the hockey sets d	positive

happy new year everyone i went to my local walmart looking for an exclusive bionicle set yesterday but was amazed to find everything there sw bionicle ef indie the works i nabbed the jsf and the rogue shadow and scampered home to take pics with my new camera wub the box the same as the other 07 boxes nothing new the back shows the various features with pop out r2  luckily the intruction booklet and the dss were intact not folded like the last mm set i got  the dss not too bad but printed parts would have been great the figs anakin is amazing imo wub fits the cw anie great i noticed on the sh reviews the kiddies were saying how ugly he looked  they need to see the cw cartoon for the sake of my health i should probably stop reading those d the build i wont go too indepth on the build since vader posted a very indepth review here the start of the build the body of the fighter starts out long and skinny the jsfs landing gear allows it to sit comfortably without getting in the way while swooshing r2d2s launching device r2 in position when launched he often gets stuck if you dont press the button hard enough  looks like r2 needs to lay off whatever it is robots eat so far the flag stickered its a big sucker sticker completed i forgot to add the nose stickers before i took the pic warning the nose cone sticker is actually two stickers i thought it was one peeled of one of the stickers and put it on the middle of the two 1x8 plates and didnt notice the other sticker wacko various completed shots i think this was a beautiful little set r2s launching unit and the flick missiles are annoying but easily fixed i plan to add proper cannons in place of the flick missiles anakin is a great minifig but he doesnt look so well standing next to my other figs the brickshelf gallery when public will	positive

wow im surprised no one had done this already first off this is a truly lovely set that many people should own even though its sold out on the sh   now lets start off with an overview note i was missing a few of the pieces the rabbit the trike when i toke the pics the figs and a cat the engine i really love this thing its a beautiful 060 steam engine with a tender this is probably the most detailed steam engine lego has given us i loved it so much i made a nonholiday version for my town the flat cars i like these but they seem a bit simple their cargo is good for christmas or a birthday party the passenger car it resembles the green passenger car we got a while back but i like the interior in this one a bit better the caboose a simple caboose like the one from 2001 the sad thing about it is thats there is no interior and its hard to take the roof off overall i like this set but it is kind of hard to use during the non winter months the price is kind of good but with that price it should have came with the motor i give it a 910 happy new year edited by agentrick57 04 january 2008  1200 am	positive

i was fortunate enough to get one along with the hobby train they are the first trains i have ever owned mainly by virtue of them having been half price its a fantastic selection of parts with the holiday train as well as it really looking the part as a set im happy not to get a motor as i think the 9v setup would prove expensive and the ir control system for the rc setup seems a bit poor i got some dead track for with it to have just as a push train for now	positive
okie guys and gals here s time for some droid exploration with my review of set 7670 as a general statement i have to say its really a neat set that is not that expensive for what it holds 1 box art like always i will start with pics of the box art btw notice anything guys  no bloody crappy dss yes finally a set without stickers and that feels great d 2 the mfs nothing really spectacular there the only novelty lies within the inclusion of the new commander yellow torso bd apart from that there are 2 bds and unfortunately yet another sbd i like those but i have a huge amount of them and i would rather had something different you have 3 short blasters and a couple of extra parts 3 the spider droid i think its a pretty cool little buggar its a rather simple yet classic construction i think it has sweet parts such as the bd body in dark bley it really has a spider feel unlike the previous ep3 one 4 the hailfire droid this baby represents the pice de resistance of this set i truly love it  sure its a bit under scale but i dont really mind that its conception is superb even if i totally dislike assembling those technic treads especially 80 of those small things the ellipse of the treads is well balanced and that trans disc is a brilliant idea the great thing is those new flick fire missiles they dont fall unlike the other ones and they do look good on this baby also you can put the wheels together and the missiles to gain some shelf space easy storage on d  in conclusion those druids re really sweet and are perfect target practice for the upcoming rgs hehe  i hope you enjoyed that review and do not hesitate to comment and ask pic requests if any  yoda	positive

great review mate as usual for me the highlight of this set has to be the new spider droid even though its made up of some strange parts it really appeals to me i would love a few of those babys the hellfire droid is also well put together even if it is a little small but hey it looks fun i really like the look of this set but the price tag really puts me off why oh why did lego price it so high 	neutral

ah i finally got the 2 city sets i really wanted  i am so happy that lego went postal on us p  since they are rather small i shall do a mix review of these 2 sweet sweet sets 1 mail van 7731 like always ill start with shots of the box art and bloody dss now here are the extras of that set i really love the new torso of the postal worker my huge grip lies on the mail box that mail logo is a freaking sticker  for that part i was so expecting a printed part that is really really bad  apart from that the design is pretty cool the van is quite simple but i think its pretty cute i love the fact that the rear is a window 2 air mail 7732 like always ill start with shots of the box art and bloody dss the extras are ok another great postal worker you also have yet another red trolley with a package that is a bloody sticker yet again  g tlc should have more printed parts  that plane for me is a classic thing of beauty  really is consistent with the fantastic planes of the 80s thats the kind of lanes tlc should produce instead of those huge playmo planes actually i am happy that tlc released that one  for once its not a bloody airline exclusive promo set  here are general pics i love the engines of the plane simple yet superb also the top hatch opens to insert mail and packages the front control panel is a printed part  i love the classic double train windows and here is a poc of the undeneath of the set in conclusion i truly love these small sets they are the perfect size 4 wide car yeay  and the colour pattern is amazing as well i hope you enjoyed that review and do not hesitate to comment and ask pic requests if any  yoda	positive
great review yoda thanks for sharing i wasnt real fond of the postal truck at first its so different than those in the us but after seeing your closeup images esp the back of the tuck it looks really neat i also like the mail box a lot it looks good in red too bad for the stickers but its still nice the plane reminds me a lot of the design used in the jurassic park set as youve said its similar to 80s designs i really like the brickbuilt design too its just real lego  thats about all i can say very nice sets that are a must together thanks for the review	positive
excellent review you convinced me to buy these two could you tell me how much you payed for them i think im gonna buy them tomorrow if they have it already or if i dont see any cooler sets	positive
thanks for the great review yoda  im definitely going to get that plane ive sadly only owned one of the many lego planes there is  thebrickster on jan 5 2008 1123 am said i havent spotted these in the us yet im looking forward to finding them overall the 2008 lineup is a excellent and its going to be difficult for me to decide which themessets to pursue theres a lot to choose from really where do you live	positive
nice review yoda i dont think i have ever read one with as much cursing of stickers d i love these two little sets the colour scheme the little different wheels on the post van and of course the new postmen uniforms would have been nice if they had included little satchels like in the new indiana jones sets oh well  postman yoda on yoda	positive
aww man is tlc really getting too cheap for printed parts shame on you tlc despite those stickers these are two really neat sets especially the airplane classic wub reminds me of that little plane my dad bought in an airplane not sure whats the set nr the window at the rear of the van looks like a normal window frame without the clips for the shutters i never knew those existed 8 might come handy for ship building thanks for the review yoda	positive
thanks for the review i was always going to get these two sets so you havent swayed me at all xd i reckon lego could enhance this subtheme by releasing a post motorbike with or without a sidecar and post office obviouly the office would be the hub of all the activity while the post bike would take care of the postal run this would free up the van to take or recieve bulk mail or parcels to or from the airport it could then also do the parcel deliveries around the city the office would also serve as the reciever for all the parcels the new goods truck might deliver just some thoughts thats all sweet	neutral
i need to do some catching up here p matn on jan 5 2008 0516 pm said could you tell me how much you payed for them i think im gonna buy them tomorrow if they have it already or if i dont see any cooler sets i paid a tad more than the sh price i paid 15 for the plane and 8 for the van sure its a tad more expensive but i didnt want to wait for tru to get them freddie on jan 5 2008 0610 pm said am i the first one to notice the new doors used in the back of the van not only is it using the popular new frame but the old container doors have been redesigned to fit with the new frame as well pity theyre not yellow though great remark there i guess i totally missed that one  and i agree that yellow doors would have been better but those dark bley do not look that bad  mr hobbles on jan 5 2008 0910 pm said can you tell me though the wheels on the van are they rubber or plastic they look a bit tacky rubber off course  they do look a tad tacky but its because they are the thin type like with the racers and i am not a fan of those  phoinix on jan 5 2008 0935 pm said cant wait for your next one tks  me neither though p marvinblue on jan 6 2008 0331 am said i reckon lego could enhance this subtheme by releasing a post motorbike with or without a sidecar and post office obviouly the office would be the hub of all the activity while the post bike would take care of the postal run this would free up the van to take or recieve bulk mail or parcels to or from the airport it could then also do the parcel deliveries around the city the office would also serve as the reciever for all the parcels the new goods truck might deliver so true 8 at one point i was thinking of a impulse set with a yellow bike postman post and letters that would rock  i hope tlc adds to this sub theme and keeps that retro feel wub a yellow dirtbike with sidecar would be a sweet 5 set  also a small town feel post office would be so cool like a 2030 set  we can be sure of one thing though this years advent calendar will have a postamn and small post office  post on  yoda	neutral
thanks for the review  i was actually considering getting these but i saw they were overpriced for my tastes  too bad theyre nifty lil things wub	positive
thanks for a nice review and few comments to sets nice airplane finally some reminiscence for lego city golden era for me years 19821992 everything is nice but two things are freezing a smile on my face first of all the ugly new hinge used for plane roof i have already 4032 and those new hinges are looking really terrible when compared fe with 6368 second one is new minifig i dont know what i expected but this torso design looks too simple and too cheap concerning new car  i appreciate fact that tlc makes after long long years again postal sets but i dont like those newstyle cars matchbox wheels and bad rate between drivers cockpit and cargo space are damping me from buying 6651 mail truck or 105 canada post truck were much better edited by kanalk1 06 january 2008  0733 pm	positive
while the plane does look nice i dont particularly care for the van but the van does have some good parts which is the only reason i would by one yellow mud guards the new windshield and the small door on the rear	neutral
well first off thanks yoda for the great review  hmmm well i have to say im not at all impressed with any of these sets i mean there nice and all but the van just seems way to small it would have been nice if you could fit more than one package in it i guessim one of those that are more of the fan of the 6 wide trucks and the plane hm this has a cute factor and all but i mean comon you have to open a hatch on the roof to get your packages in and what about getting them out you have to flip the plane upside down  weak they should have had a hinged rear end or a hatch on the side	negative

thebrickster on jan 5 2008 1012 am said i wasnt real fond of the postal truck at first its so different than those in the us good point b this design is just too foreign to my eyes for me to enjoy i dont like either of these sets very disapointing  the postal theme has so much potential i dont really like the torsos either  too plaincheap as kanal suggested and i will agree that the wheels on the van look cheap i was sooooo impressed with city 2007 this is a real let down though i am happy to see a small set with a postal box so even though all that aside ill probably buy 6 of the van  just for the yellow mudgards postal box and stickers to populate my city and i think this set will provide some excellent piece to moc a yellow civillian convertable with sweet  bm	neutral
im glad to see the mail van has the doors that used to be on the older cargo containers i had given up on those older ones but now that theyre still out there i may invest in the older cargo system instead of the new 6wide ones both sets are good enough ill get both im hoping for a postal building too even though i have the smaller of the old post offices a nice big modern one would be great im not too hung up about the design of the plane ive got the neat old cargo plane with the tail that swings open one of the best plane sets for big packages the truck is goofy looking but if i get sick of looking at it i can rebuild it into a classic looking one great review by the way the pictures are some of the better one ive seen in a review recently	neutral
5150 lego on jan 6 2008 1108 pm said well first off thanks yoda for the great review  hmmm well i have to say im not at all impressed with any of these sets i mean there nice and all but the van just seems way to small it would have been nice if you could fit more than one package in it i guessim one of those that are more of the fan of the 6 wide trucks i see your point that more cargo capacity would have been better nevertheless my personal preference is for smaller classic scale city sets the mail van is nice and small and should fit well with my road plates and 1990s cars from the 4561 train on a side note did anyone notice the message on the back of both sets boxes designed for easy building and instant play it surprised me a little since these sets seem no less complex than any other city set of late they look like quick builds sure but not as though the designers went out of their way to simplify them	positive
thanks yoda for the great reviews i love the airplane its really cute the van needed to grow on me though but you did the trick i dont like the wheels of the van they will need replacing and wouldnt everything have been better if they were completely red dr brick	neutral
thanks for the great reviews yoda the car looks great y and the plane is very cool too and much more suited to a lego town than the large planes on xd peace	positive
hey everyone my first 2008 set is this one 5613 i thought id share a review of it sweet id like to say sorry about my photos they were taken quickly first we have the box it is the smallest lego box ive ever seen and actually looks cute wub it will be heavy competition with playmobils specials back of the box showing an action pose the contents of the little box with a very tiny instruction manual wub the manual unfolded notice that every part has its part number beside it  the back of the manual showing some fire sets and the other impulse sets the parts 30 in total the small set built the firefighter has a small fire to extinquish armed with an axe chainsaw other saw and foam psssh thing xd  five extra parts in a 30 part set we get an extra black hatchet yellow bar tap light bley 11 plate red 11 plate modified with fingers and 22 dark bley radar dish besides the plate ive never seen these as reserve parts but im not complaining xd here is a small alternate model i created with it a small bbq what hes hungry and he needs to put something on the bbq  xd overall you cant go wrong with these impulse sets i paid 289 euros for this little set so thats a great value sadly the only impulse avaible were these 3 city sets no police and the alien mars mission looking forward to the knight and magician as well as those indy sets tt	positive

beach house reviewed by dunamis set 4996 522 pieces 2995 from target build time 90 minutes yet another interesting creator theme house this one comes fresh of the 2008 line of sets and promises 3 different models packing 522 pieces albeit a lot of 1x1 plates for only 2995 it was hard to pass this one by as i was foraging for the new 2008 star wars sets at the local target plus i was itching to do another review since i had finally fully recovered from my marathon ucs falcon review which took the better part a month to complete the box the box is pretty standard creator type box which shows off the three models beach house caf and towering apartment building the back of the box shows some of the features of the three models interesting features of the three models prominently displayed on the back include  food counter complete with coffee espresso maker and food warmer with chicken leg  home office complete with laptop and the ubiquitous coffee cup  flip up roof granting access inside of beach house note the satellite tv dish and even rain gutters along the roofline opening the box is a matter of breaking two seals were back to the reusable cereal box type tab system that we saw so often in 2007 sets note the parts inventory is on the side of the box as well this is a nice feature once inside the box we are greeted by eight sealed bags plus two yellow 16x2 plates and a green 32x16 baseplate thank goodness there is no dss dreaded sticker sheet but alas there are no minifigs in addition there are the three manuals one for each model and they were stuffed into my box with the care of kid trying to put 10 gallons or liters if you prefer of candy in a 5 gallon bucket but hey were not collecting manuals here so who cares if the manuals are all bent and warped the manuals the three manuals are 74 72 and 48 pages in length they are laid out well and are pretty standard with all the usual trimmings  piece call outs for each step  parts inventory at the end of the primary model build  page numbers color separation in these manuals were fine for me plus we get the usual verbose lego instructions on not dumping all your pieces outside in the grass and not to dump all your pieces into a single pile thanks for the tip tlg parts list the pieces pretty standard stuff here and as i mentioned lots of 1x1 plates and tiles at least 100 however we do get quite a few windows and a couple of doors a majority of the color is black and yellow i did see a few pieces that i was not familiar with so im going to show them below keep in mind im not a parts jockey so bear with me if i think a part is brand new for 2008 and it was actually released with the classic space line 2x2 window fixed and 4x3 window that opens the follow photo shows the window glass same as in corner caf door glass and new black parts turns out these black parts are used as wheels i showed the window glass because it still contains the molding circle just like they did before it is hard to see from the photo but it is there the door glass i think might be new i dont recall seeing these 2x2 round plates with clips before and i thought i would show the mail only because it is printed and not a sticker i know these are common but didnt they have four studs on top these only have two how about this sloped 4x3 window that opens overall a nice assortment of parts with nothing juniorized the build the build was fun and was fairly straightforward once you figure out which of the three models to build it goes pretty quick here are a few shots see how the inside is made look at the detail with the flowers and even the outside water faucet outdoor seating area upstairs being built upstairs with opening roof notice the satellite tv dish check out the patio on the upstairs complete with outdoor light and rain gutters heres my favorite the bbq grill at least we know where those new parts go finally check out the tree no juniorization here here is what is left over so far i have only built the primary model the others look interesting especially the caf the design the design was well done very rich in detail i love how there are no juniorized parts the house is accessible by taking off the top floor like caf corner and market street there is an internal staircase as well there is no interior to speak of in the beach house but there is in the other two models the only real negative is that it is kind of small when you get it done it would be nice if it was about 50 bigger here are a few views of the beach house with a few minifigs thrown in check out the closeup of the caf which i think looks great also here is a photo of the interior of the apartment building where you can see the office and computer overall thoughts it is a really nice set a tad on the small side but it has some great detail and lots of features quick enough to build all three models and would fit real nice into an existing town plan is minifig scale but does not come with any lots of window parts and black slopes is a nice diversion from the onslaught of clone wars ships that we cant remember seeing from the movies final rating 84 build 910 pretty quick and fun functionality 910 it is a creator set so you have multiple varied builds diverse enough to keep the kids entertained design 1010 excellent and well thought out outstanding detail for such a small model parts 610 fair nothing earthshattering but lots of slopes and windows price 810 price ratio is good but you get a lot of little parts would be better with minifigs edited by whitefang 23 may 2009  0638 pm indexed	positive

love this set now more than ever wub i knew i wanted it from the first leaked boxshots especially with my love of yellow buildings just ask hinckley   great review especially nice to see the closeup parts shots those new 2x2 white windows are very much like replacements for the classic 2x2 windows tlg stopped regularly making a while back so its great to see them the wheels are trolley wheels common in sets including stretchers and handcarts the holder for them is a fairly recent part i think i remember a couple coming in a little single minifig jet engine repair set i picked up in a sh order within the last year oh honey be sure to wrench that chicken before it burns wacko thanks for another excellent review of a set im even more excited about than before y	positive

1 before buying even if i am city fan those new sized planes are really not mine cup of tea my love to lego is firmly frozen somewhere between years 19801995 main reason to buy was that i wanted to write a review at czech afol web kostkyorg i bought it three days ago via web advertising price was  35 usd 2 after opening the box as presumed some very big parts and three bags and as an additional bonus lot of danish air free of charge first sight told me that this will be really short and easy building 3 impressions during building and it was really true 30 minutes of lazy building bag 1  plane bag 2  plane gondols with supports bag 3  wings and propellers when i saw the way how is this plane made i was strongly thinking to play money for nothing from dire straits as a music accordant with whole set 4 impressions after building  lookout juniorized creeps this is my first plane in this scale and for 99 the last one lack of details lot of ugly big parts from whole set you can see the main development target  to keep rrp at some certain low level inner space of airplane absolutely undone no details no luggage no computers nothing at all just a lot lot of air the very only details in whole plane are the stickered pilots desk and some kind of seat constuction 5 impressions after building  playability but what is playability at this set hydroplane which cannot float as seen on enclosed photos  if tlc will make some new kind of big parts used for gondolas to make the plane floating they will for sure make no other damage juniorization couldnt be higher you even cannot drive across the carpet with the plane so how to play open the doors open the cabin part and turn with propellers weak weak weak 6 resumed impressions sadly i must say that at limited release sets tlc boat seems to sailing to the worst part of the coast after quite good 7344 perfect 7899 and 7900 strange but acceptable 7998 juniorization came back with 7906 followed with this ugly playmobilized 7732 7 final word in fact even 15 usd seems to be too much for this kind of set 35 usd expected rrp in our country is really overpriced to hell neither set nor minifig is not interesting tlc maybe knows about juniorization as well as nowhere on the box the number of pieces isnt written if you my afol friends want to spent your bucks better give half of the price to african orphans you will save your money and you will have a good feeling all the photos you can see below as i cannot upload onto this topic due to some limit httpwwwkostkyorc15954newnew edited by kanalk1 16 january 2008  1032 pm	negative

i have to agree with almost all of the replies here that this set is the most ugliest looking lego set i have ever seen if i have never seen this set and ppl showed it to me i would have thought it would be some little kids moc or something no offence huge juniorized pieces bad color theme i would say it would look better if the wing is white no interior and huge dss i will avoid this set like the plague i own the entire city line except for the airport and planning to get all the city stuff that lego releases but this set will ruin my plans coz i will avoid it unless someone gives it to me for free haha wacko boo lego boo x	negative

legoman132 on sep 11 2008 0626 pm said this still looks like a cool set but the price not so much the price is now €20 in ireland on sh which is reasonable considering the large fuselage pieces has anyone modded this set to make a reasonable looking plane i am thinking of buy it to do so but i dont want to take a risk and end up with lots of useless pieces aswell as €20	positive

well today i finally got my hands on set 7038 now since the moment i first saw pics of this set i knew it was for me so lets start with the new troll helmet and torso these are both great this troll really stands out as a leader when next to the usual trolls in the dwarf mining set ok so heres a few shots of the front of the set now one thing i really like about this set is the way that lego have placed the back wheels higher than the front this allows the set to really appear to being pulled here we have a shot at the missiles on the wagon these are better than some around i have to say if you look just behind the bottom missile you will see a simple firing device simply push it down and then let it go to see those missiles fire the troll flag is moved behind the missiles for firing one thing that does bother me about this set is the lack of anything on the rear ok its easy to fix with a little mocing so its not the end of the world but i would of liked something placed there now lets move on to the crownies wagon this is simple yet good for holding weapons as for the crown knights themselves well there the ones from the impulse sets which is great imo heres a few quick shots of the 2 larger trolls we have so far i prefer the sand green one what about you well thats the end for now requests for pics and comments are welcome overall i rate this set as a must for anyone whos a fantasy castle fan i know ill be getting more of this set as for the new wagon well its joined up with the other trolls i do hope the impules crownies i bought today can handle them oh and yes i did change the knights heads xd  fantasy war on vader	positive
seems like a good set should i get it btw how did you get you hands on this	neutral
commander andrew of 501 st on jan 19 2008 1251 am said seems like a good set should i get it btw how did you get you hands on this well if you like the fantasy line then yes if not no i had to get this set through shop  home took ages to get here im sorry to say	neutral
looks like an ace set  i may get this just for the sand green troll even if im not a great castle fan i do want one of them things wub i also love the goblins new metal flaked helmet and the same style with the wheels they look very nice the chicken leg fishing pole is always fun too 	positive
batbrick on jan 19 2008 0119 am said one pic request if you have time vader could you please post a few pics of the new helmet on its own and on a human soldier please batbrick is back  here you go front side back vader	neutral
batbrick on jan 19 2008 0139 am said thanks for that vader i love this helmet wub it will certainly work great as an asian dynasty war helm i reckon thanks again batbrick is back  yeah its alot better than the other one ill have to buy some extra ones now just to replace the old ones  still lets hope the new impulse set has the new version y	neutral
this is fantastic i love the new helmets for the goblins sweet ive always loved the chicken leg thing really screams lego to me at least how lego used to be  great little bit the goblins are awesome too and the sand green one should look good next to the tan onesgives a nice feeling of a real species in reality not all members of a species are identical its great seeing them in different colors great review xd	positive
those extra helmet pictures just seal how much i love those new helmets wub they look so great	positive
thank you for the review vader that set looks worth buying 8 i think you gave me a good reason to buy it 	positive
great review vader  as ive said before this is a nice set but doesnt really come with anything that doesnt come with the other sets of the line for this reason it will be somewhere at the bottom of my list for 2008 also i like torso and helmet of the dwarf mining orcs much better the colours make the torso look rather dull and boring while the other more brown one looks much clearer and more exciting i think i like the knight helmet better too looks more covering and threatening than this one although ill save my judgement until i have one in my hands thanks again vader  edit forgot to mention hilarious pic in your sig vader d edited by tinypiesrus 19 january 2008  0828 am	negative
a troll driven by a turkey leg what a wonderful little detail d d thanks for the review vader very clever using a flag to hide that crazy firing device i find it rather odd they used blue pins for this black or gray wouldve been alot more discrete about the big trolls i think using different colours is good i dont think a troll force would be very organized so different colours would make the effect complete y  as for your troops looks quite fearsome definitely compared to my pathetic number of soldiers  a nice set but i would rather get the attack on tower though no matter about the price difference	negative

vader on jan 19 2008 1245 am said heres a few quick shots of the 2 larger trolls we have so far i prefer the sand green one nice comparison shot judging from these pics i think i have to agree with you that green suits the troll better especially since the orcs are sand green as well indicating some relation between the two races if they are indeed separate races great review very detailed and with lots of pictures i was already interested in this set but after reading your review i want this set for sure y	positive
tks for the review mate  now i have to bloody wait long because lego france has this line available in freaking march  pissed yoda on  d i love the new goblin p that helmet is really cool why on earth tlc didnt include that one in the dwarf mine  such another idiotic move  anyone keeping track of tlcs stupidity lately  that would be interesting  i clearly want a huge goblin army now hehe  and i totally agree with you mate the troll lokks better in sand green the cart itself is pretty lame imo  just a sordid excuse to include yet another annoying shooting crappy device but for a 21 set its okie i say  need my bad guys on  yoda	positive

question whats different with this special edition btw nice shots	neutral
the forklift is amazing and nice design of the opening side doors aswell thanks for the review i may actually pick this one up 	positive
adiksalego on jan 18 2008 1157 pm said question whats different with this special edition btw nice shots im guessing the main difference is the fact that the box says special edition	neutral
brickmaster on jan 19 2008 1227 am said its either that or its a toysrus exclusive set as my armoured drilling unit box also had special edition on it special edition mean that its a store exclusive set the cargo theme is a tru exclusive and another example is thr tie crawler is exclusive to target also can th doors be opened on either side	neutral

highlandcattle on jan 20 2008 0915 am said this set looks pretty good to me it is six wide isnt it that is nice for a truck like this yes 6wide the only problem with these big trucks is how they look on the city roadplates ive always thought too big compared to classic city trucks getting off topic id like to see lego make a car transport truck i dont think ive ever seen one in lego it would definately have to be 6wide or even larger	negative
great review my only grip with this set is you can only fit one pallet in the truck it should have been the same size as the trailer so you can at least fit 2 pallets seems like alotof wasted space if im going to transport cargo i want to use the maximum amount of space aviable xd	negative

i got this set last week and just to add a few of my own points cons  the forklift spring feels a bit flimsy  i dont know how long it will last or how much stress it would take  and the end coil isnt really heavily secured to the lift mechanism time will tell on that one  30 stickers its the exoforce of city sets the truck set does look less plain with them on though i would reccomend lining them up with the green brick in the second container rather than applying the first lot without a guide or they may end up uneven  its very hard to put the minifig in the forklift without dismantling or breaking open the set slightly  the cargo box attached to the main cabin of the truck doesnt hold very strongly  minifigs are dull  that dark blue torso with pattern is way overused  green stickers are a different green to the bricks themselves pros  lots of nice pieces including the large white panels and cargo pieces and i like the green white colour scheme  the cargo doors open well and the hingeing mechanism doesnt stand out to the detriment of the rest of the set as some people have complained about the mail airplane  studless floor in cargo containers makes it easy to move pallets in and out  fits in better than the heavy hauler to a minifig sized city  new 1x1x4 slope at least i hadnt seen it before overall  nice set with some good pictures although a bit flimsy and way too many stickers  the same issues i have with the cargo plane as well although that had more colour issues	positive
ricecracker on jan 21 2008 0528 pm said hey thanks for the review the brickster i was just wondering if you could possibly upload a picture of the instructions for the forklift and if possible tell me the piece  of the 1x4 slope bricks to bricklink them thanks i dont have a scanner for the instructions but the 1x4 slope is listed as piece 4515362 in the instructions	neutral

well since noone seems to have done one for this set here we go heres the complete set in all its glory yes i really like it but then tabletown has the capacity to support it and my green army have their eyes on it as a potential military transport as well  ill start out with the little airport ground car thingy  very neat and functional here are views front and back next up the steps which allow the plane crew to embark and disembark and to round off this little trio the cargo loading platform here in its lowered position note the prong thingy sticking out from the rear and here raised the prong thingy is now hinged up to support the back of the platform and keep it level heres a slightly different angle so you can see the pieces under there the allimportant cargo itself hmmmnot much for a plane this size the cargo pallet slots neatly onto the loading platform heres the complete set of ground equipment  all attached and so onto the plane itself note that unlike the other large planes the main wing sits at the top of the row of bricks making up the side of the fuselage i took it apart a little so you can see the internal construction of the fuselage note that the cargo area is really small right at the back what else is this thing carrying illegal immigrants  a picture of the rear of the fuselage just because i like the sticker front landing gear way better than on the other large planes i dont know if this is a new piece or what but ive had no problems with it at all and my kids have been playing with it as well the rather sexy rear undercarriage  this area reminds me of one of those giant russian transport planes  wicked those angled grey slopes atop each side of the rear undercarriage annoy the heck out of me as they keep coming off whenever i pick the plane up i think a 1x4 plate on top to bind them together might solve that a slightly blurry view sorry from underneath the gear looks like it might be capable of retracting internally but alas no this is a shame as theres certainly enough room in there and its a wasted opportunity imo might have to modify that a view of one of the four engines i personally think they look too small and should have something under the wing as well to make them rounder cockpit crew door open i love the smooth action of these doors and the way they seal flush against the fuselage when closed cargo door open crew door with docked ladder cargo door with docked loading platform cargo slots inside and locks into place the same way it sits on the loader neat the minifigs sorry this one is a bit blurry and that concludes this weeks show and tell dr s	positive
sweet plane looks much better than in the catalogs sweet	positive
thanks drs for this great review this is your what second one anyway this aint half bad i actually kind of like the bigger planes despite the annoying big pieces and this one looks to be the best yet batbrick away 	positive
lt veers on feb 4 2008 1142 pm said i do admit the amount of cargo is rediculously small but it still looks good say how much can the plane hold thanks for the review sweet thats all the space you get now it might be possible to rip out that rear bulkhead at the back of the wing and fill the middle area with tiles so cargo pallets could slide up the fuselage but that would definitely prevent the undercarriage folding internally if thats what you wanted to do as well dr s	neutral
doctor sinister on feb 5 2008 0953 am said there are two  hopefully these are the numbers you need 4525919 4525920  dr s they are perfect wub thanks very much sweet its built very oddly wacko	positive
wow thats a great review of a great set dr s y as you yourself have already noted this has the potential to be a fantastic military moc with a bit of modification you can get the engines to be rounder or perhaps do away with them completely and replace them with jet engines sweet though i cant think of a system to retract the undercarriage at the top of my head it seems like theres indeeed more than enough potential to do so it reminds me rather of an ilyushin il76 one of my favourite cargo planes 	positive

thanks for the review that seems to be a nice set but as far im concerned i dont think its worth eur 4999 there arent so many parts though those new curved slope will add some more building possibilities y what lacks   a 2 x 4 cut out in the lower part of the nose to retract the landing gear  a 4 x 6 cut out in the lower part of the tail to allow passagers to get off through the back like in a dc10  some real plates and tiles instead of these crappy wings this part is the useless one that tlc ever produced n	negative
nice review dr s i have been thinking long and hard about the scale of the planes in my town i would like to keep my passenger planes in their classic 4wide fuselage style but i really dont mind the new plane hull pieces if they are used as an enormous transport plane like the ilyushin76 unfortunately i cant afford this lovely new green one at the moment which would be perfect to go with my green army as i took too much of a hit buying the new 2008 star wars sets but i have modified my white one to take huge cargo loads in fact my apc is designed specifically to fit inside unfortunately im a bit busy to take pics at the moment but hope to put some up soon	neutral
if i do end up geting this set it will be for my slowly growing army btw nice review y	neutral
at my local walmart there was most of the 2008 sets including the indiana jones ones  i picked up this one and the motorcycle chase name 7621 lost tomb price 2000 parts 277 figs 3 box art first off we have the great indiana jones box art i must say the designers did an excellent job on it i love the little temple design with skulls as well as including indy in the right hand corner the back of the box is just as cool showing all the neat play features of the set as well as an advertisement for the indiana jones game figs first off we have our hero indian what the hell why is there a freaking cw anakin head on indy there was a production slip up as instead of indys head i get anakins   i open the box up and there staring me in the face is his ugly face tlc is defiantly doing to here a gnarly complaint from me  ok now here we have the  real indy fig that is supposed to come with the set d i just noticed that his fedora hat goes down in the back bonus picture time here is a jacketless indy with his sleeve torn off like he looks in the temple of doom sweet the next figure up is our lovely marion wub wub wub plus her head is reversible with a scared face xd love the new hairpiece in black finally we have our undead skellie with second style head and poseable arms the well of souls the set itself is a nice model and playset the anubis statues are very cool and i love all the hieroglyphs on the walls 8 here is the sw link with artoo and 3p0 xd the ark in its resting place the ark removed its very cool indeed but tlc should have made the whole thing in chrome gold  not metallic gold with brown and yellow the closeup of the anubis statue yes the eye is a sticker but at leasts a gold color playability first off you can pull the pin on the anubis statues which send them falling and taking out the walls behind the wall a skellie swings out there is a lever in the back of the model where you push down and the snakes shower down upon the figs hehe with the snakes all around marion is both modeling with the new carrot torch and fending off viscous cobras d in the meantime indy uses his whip to scale the wall and avoid all the snakes which he is afriad of in the meantime leaving marion behind to fight them off p the whip is bendable but it will always snap back into a coil its some type of bendy hard plastic scoring figs 910 model 810 playability 8510 overall satisfaction 410 would be 910 if it wasnt for the stupid anakin head error in the end this is a charming set and could easily fit in with the adventurers it has the cool anubis statues as well as the ark plus indy marion and a skellie great selection of figs but sallah would have been better since he actually removes the ark with indy however i am still wondering the point of the anubis statues this set does seem pretty silly p p	neutral

hello and welcome to another oh wait first batbrick and iamded review today us two sworn enemies will be reviewing the creator cargo chopper here is the front of the box and while pushing iamded to his doom here is the back haha ouch oh dearhere are the parts anyway here is the instruction of the first model the cargo chopper i love creator sets for the different models they always excite me just ignore me finishing off my nemesis in the background something very interesting that i liked in the instructions was this step where you must add those three 2x2 yellow rounded pieces under the chopper this is for support while you build which is handy and later you take it off and even later use it as the cargo i found that to be rather innovative and clever as well as  hey what are you hitting me for both instruction booklets have the same back now heres the chopper itself i love the design of it it isnt quite minifig scale but its great all the same this is my first nonxpod or house creator set and it sure is fun here me and iamded go for a dizzy ride i love the nose of the copter and the landing gear is fantastic a shot from the other side oh dear it seems weve been a bit sick from that ride and were vomiting transgreen 1x1s the cargo itself is nicely made though i forgot to put on two tiles here   it fits in real well with the chopper to and the line is great for giving iamded the wedgie he deserves this is my first power function set so i was pretty excited the motor is intergrated really well into this set and is activated by pushing that little 3x2 plate with the 1x1 slopes on it forward until it hits the motor button that orange knob another point of interest is the use of bley barrels on each side i like this as i dont have those pieces in that colour a shot of the motor its really simple all you do is pull the hook out to any length that allows then press the orange button and it will wind it back up this makes the chopper pull the cargo up into its bay and iamded pull me here reluctantly to a whacking a top view is that my head a view of the chopper without the cargo in it i love the lowered cockpit the leftover pieces from building note iamdeds head does not count as set piece and a final shot of the set with me and iamded oh it appear were dead oh dear hope you enjoyed this review soon i will post the two alternate models i loved this chopper its great to play with and has nice construction it also has some handy pieces too the motor function sounds like a gimmick but is well intergrated into this model well worth the price so far this is another win for creator i say so far i recommend this model but later well see if the alt models are up to scratch also since this is my first review comments and criticism welcome on everything batbrick away  edited by whitefang 23 may 2009  0637 pm indexed	positive

thanks everyone heres part 2 the second instruction booklet includes instructions for both alternate models which is good i hate having too many manuals here she is the plane its very nice and well proportioned but where did iamded get that laser overview the landing gear is very sturdy and nice and the wings are surprisingly good top view iamdeds head fell into the propellers i was trying to save him honest a view of how the motor on this one works by pushing the orange button you can make the prop spin it is well integrated like the chopper though the prop only spins for about 2 12 seconds still its a nice feature the tail is also well made simple but lovable oh and check out that tank the prop spinning agh is that my hand final view there seems to be some sort of explosion here 8 well i think i got iamded more than me atleast the second model is also great though not as good as the chopper the lack of space to fit something into the cockpit brings it down a bit but it is a very nice model overall i recommend it though unlike the chopper it will be hard to mod into minifig scale so far so good with 4995 here are the leftover pieces from the model enjoy batbrick away 	positive
lt veers on feb 11 2008 1155 am said great review batbrick iamded got what he deserved xd xo  p great review batbrick this looks like a wonderful set i love that plane it doesnt bother me that its not minifig scale as it looks more for display imo wub looking forward to seeing the final model y peace	positive
i really like this set even though i was hoping for a minimotor d chock full of great parts too thanks for the review sweet	positive
thanks guys heres the final part the instructions for the boat begin on page 46 the overall set its actually much nicer than i thought it would be the pictures on the box make it look ugly top view tommy guns do not actually come with set  side view the designers have done an excellent job with the hull considering the lack of many slopes pieces you can see it is pretty much minifig scale too here you can see that by pushing in the red technic axle the anchor on the front will be hauled back into the boat back view these outboard motors are pretty cool though i wish they could go own into the water more overall though the weakest model its still a lot of fun and has a clever way around the lack of a shapely hull i was impressed with it after the building it it even has two rounded snotty bottom pieces on the nose of the boat to give the impression it is speeding through the water with the front lifting up lots of leftover pieces for this one the pieces sorry about the poor photograph there it was getting late  overall the cargo chopper is another great set in the fantastic creator line loads of fun great play and some clever designs it challenges you to make your own things and even includes some nifty pieces bley barrels wub  i wont give it a rating but ill just say i certainly recommend it to fans of the theme and lego fans in general now finally iamded and i teamup in the face of a larger foe get that lord of pies batbrick away 	positive

6258 smugglers shanty overview smugglers shanty was released in 1992 it consisted of 69 pieces 3 minifigs two pirates one imperial and it cost 925 usd the set itself is a small but rather sturdy den for the pirates review the minifigs consist of two pirates and one imperial the minifigs are not all that rare which is disappointing i would of liked a rarer fig but still it is a good cheap source of pirate and imperial figures here is an overall shot of the set which includes the three figs the shanty which is made using palm leaves pieces and a nice grey shark nibbling at the soldiers oar a close up of the soldier rowing hard in his boat i would have preferred to have a normal soldier with shako hat as i have more officers than normal soldiers now and a close up snap of the main structure note the wine glass which was a nice touch funnily enough only 4 pieces of treasure were included in this set compared to the usual 8 gold coins in other sets a view from the back which also gives a good view of the pieces used to construct the shanty mainly simple black 1 by 1 bricks the shanty looks good from most angles but their are a few where the roof construction looks rather odd but that is just a minor nitpick yet another view from the front this time at a slightly different angle the yellow base plate looks rather nice too i prefer it over the tan pieces we trend to get nowadays attack the stupid drunk pirate in the background does not even notice overall i think this is a rather good set despite some shortcomings such as the lack of treasure and odd roof from some angles the shark imperial soldier and useful parts make up for it and of course the price is cheap on most auction sites i got mine for a mere 5 10 with the cheapest price on bricklink being 8 rate the set then leave your comments thoughts and opinions	positive
first ill comment on the review and at a later date ill comment on the set youve done a top job lord of pies y youve captured the set from a variety of angles and posed the minifigures interestingly	neutral
very nice review lord of pies thanks for taking the time to put this together and especially for all the detailed pics y i very much regret that my dark ages occured when they did basically i missed out on all the cheap and easy troop building sets and this one is certainly no exception the big sets are nice but these are the ones that always make me wish just a little harder for a return of lego pirates  i gave it a 4 out of 5 just because id buy 4 out of 5 sitting on the shelves today were it possible	positive
wow i remember this set from when i was a kid i got it for my birthday and opened the package first sadly i had to go to school so i had to leave it at home and not build it or play with it until i got home needless to say that was one of the longest days of school ever good review great set	positive
great small set that can help you add to you minifig count the little boats are always cool and the den isnt that bad either	positive
another firstrate review its a nice little set with a big number of minifigs and 2 flintlock guns is also a nice bonus	positive
a very nice review of a pretty and neat little set thanks lord of pies guess it´s a 3 for me with strong tendencies to 4	positive
first of all excellent review 55 for me i have yet to attain one of these sets it has a nice trio of men including a redcoat and a nice assortment of weapons the rest such as the leaves is great for mocing imperialshadows on feb 19 2008 0841 pm said i gave it a 4 out of 5 just because id buy 4 out of 5 sitting on the shelves today were it possible if i saw 5 of these sitting on a shelf i would certainly buy all 5 then i would ask to speak with a manager to see if there is any way i can attain more pirate lego stuff simonwillems on feb 19 2008 0847 pm said nice poll as well but you made sure nobody can give this set a 1 which is very nice but probably a little mistake d  i gave it the toprating one should not step into the pirates domain and give a mere 1 to any non4 pirate set duke	positive
woow d this was my first lego set ever	neutral
this set shows the awesomeness of classic pirate sets i really have to get me some more xd great review on a great set	positive
a nice review and a nice little set for anyones pirate collection a 55 for the review	neutral
id give the set a 3 12 out of 5 it needed 1 more imperial to get a 4 a bigger basplate would have been nice as it appears to hard to fit all the minifigs on the island thanks for this great review	neutral
laurinator i dont mind an occassional old review coming back to life for discussion but it seems youve replied to many old reviews that have been stagnant for years please try to refrain from bumping a lot of old topics as it pushes down new content that should really be the focus of discussion now	neutral
hi guys i picked these up the other day but its taken me this long to get round to posting the reviews so here we go tub comparison with a minfig thanks brainbox the lighting changes a bit throughout the photographs as it was going dark outside so i only really had my desk light and i kept getting in the way 4837 mini trains now the box i really like its no different to those of last years sets but the colour here is simply fantastic and really seems appropriate for the theme so this is what you get inside all the pieces are still inside the bag the optical illusion was accidental d  no pieces of particular outstanding interest but the dark green cheese slopes are rather nice look out for those later 1 2 3 this is the main model and uses all the pieces in the set bar these two which according to the inventory are spares but as with all my other creator sets im cheating and leaving them in this is far and away the best model of the three and evokes the iconic version of a steam train the green looks superb but im not sure whether thats due to the model itself or the actual colour moving on we get to the second model 1 leftovers yes i admit i was using a piece of paper this isnt actually a bad model i dont think its quite as nice as the previous one but its not bad its different from the first model as well which is good too muich of the same can be a bad thing finally we come to the third model leftovers now ill be honest i dont really know what this is its not that good a model compared to the other two thats all i can say really and of course all the pieces fit into the tub overall i have to say i do like this set despite the weak third model the strength of the primary and secondary models make up for any weaknesses in the third and i can imagine the pieces being fully usuable in building other trains while the basic idea of these tubs isnt quite as good as the xpods with regards portability and general niceness they arent bad and for a fairly cheap price 34 as well 4838 mini vehicles this is one of those set boxes that you see because of the ridiculously loud colours sound marketing scheme if you ask me ive managed it again there are pieces outside the bag or are there now these i like y  1 2 i dont know what the clip is for there isnt one on the other side 3 4 5 this is the main model of the set and again all the pieces are used bar these three the spares its quite a nice model although the cars a bit odd still i like the ramps and the colour scheme reminds me just a little of g1 ultra magnus hmm i think that boom arm could do with refixing 1 2 leftovers this is actually quite nice as well its that classic breakdown truck and the boom arm itself is quite nice with quite a bit of movement another solid model 1 leftovers im surprised by the amount of detail here actually not only have tlc included a spare wheel at the back but also what looks like a trailer hitch which all adds to the realism another nice model to round out a nice set and in the tub overall im not sure which of the two i like better when i bought them and on the way home i much preferred the train set but after building this set im not sure this is another good set from the year when tlc seems to be giving us so many there are some good pieces in here too and while theres nothing unique theyre still good so thanks for reading hope it helped someone and if there are any requests ill see what i can do thats requests for pics not songs   edited by whitefang 23 may 2009  0656 pm indexed	positive
why not they are all very nice i have all six of them especially the helicopter my least anticipated but one of the most detailed thanks for the review brainbox	neutral

mmmmh i wub love the train great review it looks like each model can be connected to the other to make a complete train y y it makes me want to get 3 of them or more to make a long one d	neutral
so here it is finally my first ever review of a lego setoh wait its actually 2 sets so i dont really know how to do it right but ill try the best sorry if some pictures are a litte bit dark but im not really into photography and i got bad light here lets start with the dwarfs mine defender theme castle 2008 set name dwarfs mine defender number 7040 pieces 86 price 999 eur first as always the box the back a few instructions on how the defender works for those how dont know   and the instructions we continue with the minifigs sorry i forgot to make a closeup of the dwarf and finally the mine defender itself i personally think it isnt as bad as maybe some people think the chain for the catapult is great i think i kinda love those controls the mechanism with the rubbe rband actually works pretty well but only on a notglossy underground thats pretty much all of it its small but i like it a lot so lets go on to the tower raid now which would be my absolute favorite of those new sets  theme castle 2008 set name tower raid number 7037 pieces 364 price 2999 eur again first the box  instructions we got 2 sets of instructios here one for the tower and one for the siege tower the minifigs we got one archer and one soldier here both with the torsos of the 2007 sets now thw orc side starting with the great leader with the new armor and the golden helmet i love those pieces closeup of the armor  helmet then we got another orcknight and the prisoner with handcuffs the crownie tower looks great overall though there is something i dont really like about it but later on that now the back and that is what really bothers me there areno walls on the first floor except the one with the wallpiece and the door and theprison also is open at the back the orc easily could jump out there not sure what these are all about they really dont add much to the set enough rant now lets go on with a pretty sweet detail the golden crystal on the little table the wall piece on the first floor you can ram in and finally the very best thing of this set the amazing orc siege tower from the front the great working ram you can pull it back very far and it got pretty much power here we got another sweet detail the siege platform that moves out by pulling a cord in the back of the tower finally a picture of a bit siege action if you ram in the lower wallpiece the brown shelfs of the prisonfloor collapse and the prisoned orc is finally free summary likes as i mentioned before i really think thats the best ever produced siege tower its got so mich details and works extremely well also the overall look of it is magnificant the destroymechanism of the tower is pretty cool too the brown door is a fine detail too nothing much to say about the mine defender i like this little set and theres nothing really to bother about it dislikes the back of the tower thats really the only thing thats a bit bad imo they could have put there 2 more walls on the first floor and something to lock the prison easily final thought the tower raid for me personally is the best of the 2008 sets so far its got great playability and looks simply good my opinion buy it	positive
tks for these cool reviews metalandi  i love these orc sets  i am so going to get these  im happy to see that scared face again i love it really  and the use of that handculfs  that new armour looks really cool that tower is really nice and i wont mod it that much which os cool and the battle ram is freaking sweet  tks again for sharing  yoda	positive
great review pictures and all thanks for showing all the mechanisms of the tower i didnt notice them from either the pics we had or the instructionsit didnt hit me that when you knock down the wall the second floor breaks that is a genius idea this looks like a superb set unfortunately my priority right now is the troll warship still if that really is us 80 i might skip it and go for this instead which is only 20 us one note though i think there might not be a back cage on the second floor of the tower so that the mechanism can work did you try to see if the second floor ground still falls if you add it a fourth cage wall also you could just pretend that the tower is built against a mountainside it would fit perfectly and add more defense to the knights great review  vk	positive
tks for those so much  y nice reviews i love that tower raid and the defender and will buy them both quote really dont add much to the set oh but they do more pieces higher price 	neutral
this set didnt come with the new jail door piece id have guessed it would have since there is an orc in prison nice review im looking forward to picking up these sets steve	neutral
thank you for these fine reviews metalandi y therere really some nice playable features in the tower raid set and all these great orc torsos just sweet and it even looks like that black orcarmors a new piece lovely 	positive
cheers for the reviews theyre both nice sets and i think i just may have to buy both or maybe ill get two of the dwarf set the figs in each are really cool as well the dwarf well theyre just cool anyway but the troll with the golden helmet and armour thats just wub	positive
thanks for the double review i like the dwarf catapult but the real deal is the tower raid set i love that siege tower and love that new armour cant wait to get it thanks for the review batbrick away 	positive
thanks metalandi these are 2 great sets im definately looking forward to seeing these in new zealand stores the collapsing floorprisoner freeing mechanism on the tower is wonderful a great touch some slight modifications like some walls will make this perfect and the dwarfs mine defender is a sweet little set with some neat minifigs thanks for the reviews y peace	positive
thanks for the review i personally think the siege tower is probably the best one which lego has ever produced	positive
well i dont think orcs are that sturdy seeing that theyd have to jump from the second level of the tower i dont see survival as his chief objective p awesome review im loving these sets more and more the tower raid is definitely the best and the cheapest set there  oh and pirhana its not really a king its more like an officer remember the wizard rules these goblins edited by trooperdavinfelth 22 february 2008  0249 pm	positive
sweet wow another excellent review haha that tower does reminds me of kk ii of mistland tower x well overall i love these 2 sets very very much sweet	positive
thank you for the nice review pity the tower is not designed better but i still want to buy these 2 sets if only there were 2 dwarves in the dmdefender	neutral
xwingyoda on mar 1 2008 0632 am said its still looks good but the crappy rubber band system is really not well thought off yoda i totally agreed with your comments the rubber system is not effective at all i bought 2 defenders recently and i found out that when the wheels move the rubber just stuck there without rotating the blades at the front  i have not really found a solution for mine yet so far i only took out the rubber band placing the blades on the ground removing of the red technic part on the left side in this way when the defender is moving on smooth ground the blades will move too 	negative
thanks for the great review y the siege tower does look great ill have to look out for these sets edited by zouave 14 march 2008  0724 pm	positive
the rancor on apr 22 2008 0554 am said i perfer using the batle wheel to knock down the towers walls not the seige tower i love all the siege machines the orcs have they are certainly a much bigger threat than the skellies batbrick away	positive
yeah the open towers are kinda funny although they were also typical of for instance 90s pirate sets the trolls vehicles are cool though they look evil i cant wait to start collecting 08 castle setsi didnt buy any castle in 07 i only got one set for xmas so im catching up on the 07 stuff first before its all sold out	neutral
now that this topic has been brought up again i just want to say that the rubber band on my dwarf mine defender actually works	positive
theyre so beautiful 4 more months	positive
green grocer reviewed by dunamis set 10185 2352 pieces 14995 from the lego store glendale ca build time 65 hours holy guacamole almost exactly one year after caf corner was released we get the third installment in the increasingly popular lego exclusive town series combined with the famous 10182 caf corner and its trusty companion 10190 market street this trio makes the foundation for an amazing city block of lego goodness for those new to this series of sets check out my reviews of the two previous sets in this line cafe corner market street i would not necessarily recommend reading too many of my reviews in one setting as you might experience loss of brain cells andor drowsiness you have been warned so how does green grocer stack up to the two previous sets you ask well follow along kind reader and i shall attempt to unravel this question the box the gigantic box is pretty standard and looks amazingly similar to the caf corner box the back of the box shows some of the features of the green grocer as well as a lot of the cool interior that was absent from the previous sets in addition we are shown an image of the three sets together and a small insert image showing how they connect together as if we could not master that difficult maneuver opening the box is a matter of breaking two seals as it seems to be the norm now we have the reusable cereal box type tab system that we saw so often in 2007 sets however upon opening the tabs we are pleasantly surprised to find a cardboard tray have not seen one of those in a while as you can see in the photo we have two 32x16 green base plates three instruction manuals and a bunch of bags that are broken into four groups group 1 has 12 bags and goes with the first manual and builds the first floor group 2 has 9 bags and goes with the second manual to build the second floor group 3 has 14 bags and goes with the third manual for the top floor and roof and one bag that is not numbered and hence you can open it whenever you feel like it there are no stickers  yay moving right along we get to the three instruction manuals the manuals the three manuals are 55 47 and 47 pages in length they are laid out well and are pretty standard with all the usual trimmings  piece call outs for each step  parts inventory at the end of the second manual  page numbers color separation in these manuals was fine for me except dark bley and black we get a nice photo of all three sets together plus we get a nice tip showing how to split up the bags and what goes where those additional pieces you see in the photo just below the numbered bags are the pieces that come from the single unnumbered bag along with the base plates parts list random manual shot the pieces upon opening the first set of bags one thing is clear there are a ton of little tiny pieces the minifigs are included in this first section as well interesting to note that there are a handful of printed pieces and as i mentioned previously no stickers we also get a host of new and exciting pieces to add to our collection keep in mind my scope of lego sets is generally centered around star wars technic creator and the occasional racer set so what is new to me might have been around 15 years at any rate here are some of the more interesting pieces again note the printed tiles this time around lego has decided to include 33 more minifigs than the caf corner and market street sets yes we get four minifigs instead of three here are the cast of characters pictured left to right is sir top hat miss jenny blue overalls patti o furniture and little timmy cub scout ill leave it up to the minifig aficionados to decipher which torsos are new and to tell us all about the hairpieces i can say with reasonable certainty that the four yellow smiley heads are not new somebody check that dont forget the lovable little cat named tom he is the archrival of the mouse jerry that lives downstairs overall there are a lot of pieces large variety and wide range of colors the build if you have either of the two previous sets you will feel right at home here just like in the previous builds it seems like the first ten build steps are consumed with laying a bunch of 1x1 1x2 and 2x2 tiles everywhere almost feels like 30 of the pieces are used up right away see below there are several sections where you build various parts of the interior take a look at the cash registercounter below and the beverage cooler and the produce stand and everything that goes in it looks like someone has mail looks like someone just had a baby this set is incredibly well done and gives inspiration to go back and add similar items to caf corner and market street as before the average builder is introduced to some new building techniques like using the hinge plates to make the angles on the front of the building as shown below also the top of the roof shows some interesting ideas overall it is a really fun build that kept me entertained the whole way the design this is a great set with lots of little details i especially like the little mouse hole in the wall leading to the jerry the mouses area they even included a little slice of cheese it seems the designers cant get away from the usual staircase which i always feel is way too big maybe future designs can incorporate a spiral staircase to save room for other things in the model one welcome addition is the fire escape as seen below im going to show a bunch of examples of various items in the set so you can get the feel of the amazing detail in this design take a look at the lamps torches just outside the door and the streetlight with fire hydrant brickwork and archway awning here is the back side of the building note the trashcans and yard tools here is a closeup of the railings on the second story balcony and the second photo is the finished product with curtains in the window nice use of cups to make the banister on the second floor here is the fireplace on the second floor second floor staircase with toms hiding spot check out the radiator on the third floor more third floor nice grandfather clock and rug third floor check out the deck that is up on the roof complete with two chairs table umbrella flower pots and grill interesting use of minifig hammers on the roof finally here is what is left over when were done a couple of shots of the front a shot of the back and here are all three together overall thoughts this is an incredible set and the best of the three in my opinion it is hard to top caf corner but i believe green grocer just did i absolutely love all the details and building techniques that went into making this set there is a ton of different parts and wide color selection as usual we get a bunch of tiles and small plates but that goes with the series also we get four minifigs and lots of minifig accessories im giving this set a score of 100 i thought about it and i really dont know how they could have made it any better in short run dont walk to go pick this set up final rating 100 build 1010 excellent  lots of nice interiors details and accessories to build functionality 1010 outstanding raises the bar with interior and detail think caf corner on steroids design 1010 excellent  cant say enough good things about it parts 1010 great selection and diverse colors great minifigs price 1010 price ratio is excellent but lots and lots of little parts well worth the price as alway feel free to comment complain and question what you see here id like to hear your feedback on this amazing set	positive
wow thats a great review im glad you took so many pictures this set is far better than i ever expected it to be the detail inside is great is it the first set youe given 100 to	positive
damn you to hell dunamis  now tks to you i really want the 3 sets put together xd wow that is what i call a sweet review 8 tks for taking the time to make once again such a fantastic one  the overall look of the building is brilliant and i love the nice additions they did the cheese and mouse jerry d  is hilarious  i didnt know green grocer had a rodent infestation  and the use of the new built furniture and detils like the radiator is freaking awsome  also that set has a definite plus for me its the back details  i love the stairs the deck with table  wowx that is what i call sweet backdoor details  now its clear that i will need to buy the 3 sets asap  tks once again dunamis  yoda	positive
very nice very nice indeed lots of lovely little details even at the back this review hasnt changed my opinion one bit im still looking forward to when i can finally pick up mine at the post office im crossing my fingers that there will be more buildings following after this one im guessing that legos just testing the waters to see how far afols are willing to go regarding price vs details green grocer is still epic though	positive
what a beautiful set tlc give the designer a pay rise immedietly i was lucky to order one of these while they were on sale to us aussies  but dont worry lego the 100 you saved me will be spent on more sets like this carnt wait to watch my kids rescue residents in distress from those upper level windows with the fire fighters	positive
man these sets are so awesome incredible work done by the designers there must have took a long time to get all this ogether if they werent too expensive i would go and buy them all 3 right away wub	positive

thanks for all the feedback as you can tell i really enjoyed building it cardinal brick on mar 8 2008 0926 am said is it the first set youe given 100 to yes it is i gave cafe corner a 96 and i felt this was a better set and improved on the things that i dinged cafe corner on lack of minifigs was one thing thats why i enjoy reading the comments so i can see if my ratings are in line with what everyone else thinks and to see if i missed anything i cant wait for some of you to build it and share your thoughts as well	positive
a very fine review with great and informative pictures thanks dunamis y and what a wonderful set a masterpiece and far beyond everything i wouldve expected just one year ago the amount of details is exceptional from the different railings to the mousehole and the radiator sheer brilliant  and two female mfs or hippies you never know and a child only one adult male character who nearly looks like well anyways its simply a milestone and a very creative and inspiring beauty wub easter parade on and sweet gg will you marry me 	positive
o m g i must have that set  y wub i remember you telling me that you were going to do a review of this set and i was so anxious i love these reviews thanks so much great pictures wub y y this will dent my wallet 8 i am so envious	positive
a very informative review indeed thank you so much for doing so now i know that the price is worth every penny leaving my pocket  what do you guys think is tlc putting up as the next modular set is it asking too much of tlc to produce 1 modular set each quarter 4 times a year	positive
a million thanks for this review this is greater than i thought i especially like that clock im going to get this set as soon as possible	positive
thank you for the amazing review dunamis this set looks amazing wub i wont be able to afford it though  congrats this is on the frontpage y sweet	positive
great review thanks for taking the time to do this this has been a great line at the risk of abandoning my castleadventurer loyalties ive got to say this is rapidly becoming my favorite line and this set looks to be the best of the lot while it still hurts to shell out 150 i think ill still be happy to do so steve	positive
wow another old technic set review by you nice set and thanks for that review	positive
looks like you have the original 1989 version with the yellow top cylinders  i got one too several years ago although i probably paid too much for it p on a side note if that pneumatic tubing feels harder and stiffer than the modern type i highly recommend that you dont use it and buy some of the newer stuff off bricklink instead tlc originally used a different material for the tubes and this stuff degrades the nozzles on pistons switches and so on over time the old tubes also grip the nozzles much more firmly and if you arent careful when removing them its actually possible to rip off the nozzles completely xo i had this happen a few years ago although tlc replaced my broken pistons for free i got rid of that stuff for good after that although the pistons on my power crane still have slightly discolored nozzles edited by cp5670 10 march 2008  0457 am	neutral
cp5670 on mar 10 2008 0553 am said the old tubes also grip the nozzles much more firmly and if you arent careful when removing them its actually possible to rip off the nozzles completely xo i actually noticed that while taking it apart but didnt really pay any attention i just thought thats because its an old part well thanks for the information	neutral
as i bought it i didnt even know i would also get a box it just said all parts with building instructions after opening the parcel i was like woah woooaaahhh and so on  i love legoboxes because as a child i stood in the toy stores starring at the boxes only seeing the front and the back nothing more this brings back some memories 	positive
blakbird on mar 10 2008 0945 pm said i wrote about it here httpwwwericalbre1984htmlparts eric thanks for that information it opened my eyes as to the function of the threaded axle 	neutral
thank you very much for that review	positive
this was my first pneumatic set	neutral
this was my first technic set aged 7 still a great one in terms of function density and a great bmodel in the uk im certain it was called the salvage hoist	positive
yeah if i rebuild and wash a model i will record it glad to see you liked it	positive
this set is really cool i might actually get it	positive
ah a good old retro review those old school days had some pretty impressive sets with alot more complexity than modern sets if you have it may i recommend 8880	positive
nice pictures i also sort out the pieces the same way if im rebuilding a model y this set packs a lot of functionality into a fairly small size but was rather expensive for its size 70 when it was still available compared to other sets of that time you can also rig up the technic flag sticker that it comes with to the main model ive done that on mine you may want to reinforce it with tape if youre going to leave the model on display though as it will break up over time due to uv exposure like many stickers do i had to do that with mine after it started to crack although it still looks pretty good	positive
thanks for reviewing this classic set i got it when it first came out and still love it the suspension steering and robust look of the model havent been done that well ever since this set puzzled me though back in the days the rear suspending part containing the differential and some gears was shown different on the box from the instructions in the instructions it showed that the grey part of the suspension in the back had to be made using a 1x2 smooth tile and 4 cornerplates 2x2 in grey the box however showed a much sturdier solution using a 1x8 tile and a 1x8 plate it is also visible on the cover of the instructions the pieces i mean are in this picture bernddasbrot on mar 9 2008 0705 pm said otherwise great set	positive
thanks youve just motivated me to go on a senselesspreliminarydesignerrorshunt a few things ive discovered left side alternate model the steering link can only be put in place with a little violence the handlebar  is turned far more than its actually possible although the wheels are straight right side the 1x8 tile simonwillems pointed out the half bush right next to it is cantfindthewords wrong could be that the technic triangle is missing the windscreen 1x6 technic plates are mounted with 12 pins instead of axle pins with half bushes who can find more xd	neutral
hmm seems like the wheels are recycled into the harley truck in the 2008 batman set	neutral
natelite on mar 10 2008 0557 pm said hmm seems like the wheels are recycled into the harley truck in the 2008 batman set nope the harleytruckwheels are thinner and somewhat more modern i do believe theyre the same like in 8274 aaaaaaaand for a long time in my life these wheels have been the best and coolest looking ive ever had so wheres your deference d recycled  xd	positive
a neat review of a cool set with very informative pictures thanks bernddasbrot y	positive
i can remember that ive seen a few color variations on brickshelf and on ebay they sold well its new and familiar at the same time that makes it more interesting	positive
i read blackbirds technopedia page on this truck the other week went onto ebay and picked up a misb copy for £25 gbp bargin great to get old sets unopened peeling the plastic off of the specialist parts was always cool love the front suspension	positive
that price is exceptional its less than what i paid for mine 9 years ago and is even less than the original price of the set note that the stickers in this set are the bad variety that will crack and peel over time if you want to preserve them the technic flag in particular you will need to tape over it	neutral
somehow i also managed to get this set in very good condition including box instructions and all stickers for a mere €22 a few months ago this is indeed a very special set and was a pleasure to build the only flaw i noticed was weak support of the rear drivetrain which was easily corrected with a few extra plates	positive
grepin on mar 24 2010 1237 am said  the only flaw i noticed was weak support of the rear drivetrain which was easily corrected with a few extra plates huh like where dont have that much problems with that rear train at least if i you dont trow the model down the stairs or something like that	neutral
junkstylegio on mar 23 2010 1117 pm said huh like where dont have that much problems with that rear train at least if i you dont trow the model down the stairs or something like that maybe its unusual but this section of the drive train didnt hold that well on my model this is how it looks now the parts made redundant were left in the built model thats why theres that useless 8tooth gear there p	neutral
hello my dear friends heres something new i am actually making a review with pictures yes i got a new camera for christmas now i was testing to see how the camera would reflect so some of the pics are a bit blurry i have based this review from dunamiss reviews he is my inspirationso without further ado i bring you the review set  7693 name etx alien strike price 1999 1299 pieces 246 box okay so as you can see below the box is pretty simple as always european versions wont have the piece count name etc just the number i believe mine having the american version has the info on it as you can see it has the classic mm logo and the red planet as well as the set in a pose itself very nice i linked it because the pic wasnt resizing httpwwwbrickshelkedscn0017jpg below is the back of the box it shows the other sets and some features of this set contents next we have the contents this set includes a medium sized dss xwingyoda a bag labeled one and huge bag labeled two the 1 bag contains a smaller bag and the two bag includes two smaller bags 5 bags in all also pictured are the instructions i have linked it due to the nonresize httpwwwbrickshelkedscn0019jpg figs included in this set are three figs two jellies and 1 astro the jeelies are fine but i pefer the lom ones but they glow those new alien commanders for summer look promising though the astro is nice and includes an extra gold visor moc on astro miner in all mm sets there is a human and alien set the astro par of this set is a miniminer here is a pic of construction and that wonderful space logo sticker not much of a cockpit  finished minerthe set number too overall i like the miner and it is nicely designed i feel the cockpit is lacking though aliens the alien vehical is the main part of the set this pic shows the beginning steps solid and sturdy but those four axlespin partsblue are pointless no support and they dont get used at all nice tlc  now we get cooking this pic shows the tail added on and the more bulk being built we get a little repetitive and build the craft up in this pic and this pic from the instructions shows how the alien craft transforms for battle the completed set and extra bits parts 810 figs 810 price per piece ration 910 playability 910 overall 85 the alien craft is great the attack feature is nice and there are a ton of trans green parts the alien falls out of the cockpit when turned upside down i love this set and its perfect for mm fans or beginnersit has nice parts and read the above part for more details gallery when moderated keep an eye out for future reviews please comment 	positive
thanks for the great review vbbn y i already own 2 of these xd on your camera there should be a little flower sign switch to that to go to micro mode  its a really good first review y sweet	positive
a nice review well done y the set itself doesnt look quite interesting to me compared with some of the newer ones like 7647 or 7648 the way the driver fits into the cockpit looks not very clever and pretty uncomfortable as well xd	negative
thanx for the review i have one question do these aliens have moving arms as far as the set goes i think lego did a bad job on the alien ship i dont think any of the alien ships look good in mars mission the human fanction got a lot better this year and i would have bought this buggy if it came by its self	negative
sweet first pic review y i got this set for a birthday present last year and it is pretty fun overall the alien ship in this set is actually one of my favorites it just looks cool and the way you can fold it out is really clever the only negative for me is the cockpit of the mining unit not really because it isnt detailed but because mine is top heavy and keeps falling forward its kinda funny if you think about him driving along and then falling forwardbut not funny at all when youre playing 	positive

hi this is my forth oldschool technic set review since blakbird pointed out that all my technic reviews are red i chose a yellow dune blaster for today just kidding this set is red as it should be dont worry my next reviews will be yellow and black uhhh forshadowing   i will start with some facts 277 elements and released in 1994 thats enough 1 the box 2 the parts 3 building instructions and catalogues wow no folds no wear marks  simply wub was lesen coole kids  klick das super magazin fuer coole kids how obvious 4 building no differential i really love the way the 1x8 technic bricks on the sides will be positioned later fun fact the engine contains no 2ltechnic axle and finished a real quick build 5 spare parts for the alternate model the yellow technic handle should be from 8412 maybe a bonus feature from the seller 6 random shots 7 final thoughts this is my second 8829 and i also noticed that the engine turns very hard the alternate model is really sorry to all those of you who like it crappy i mean a nice idea but not with this wheels  anyway a really beautiful technicset reminiscing this word exists does it thanks for viewing the pictures i hope you enjoyed it please comment if you want to edited by bernddasbrot 21 march 2008  0209 pm	positive

toaofjustice on mar 21 2008 0810 am said that looks like a very nice set  in your opinion how does it compare to the current dune buggy toa of justice imho 8829 is much better than 8296 first 8829 is a lot bigger i really like the huge rear balloon tires they both have rack and pinion steering and they both have trailing arm rear suspension with a v2 engine i think the body on 8829 is a little more well done for 8296 i think the alternate tractor model is much better for more comparisons see technicopedia eric	positive
blakbird on mar 22 2008 0949 pm said one thing i noticed is that a bunch of your pictures are missing the beam that goes over the left hand wheel as a fender oh no i forgot to put it back i wanted to make a photo with this beam alone 8 blakbird said what kind of camera do you use the pictures have very good depth of field meaning that both the foreground and the background are in good focus this is usually hard to do without a very small aperture the camera belongs to my dad its a panasonic lumix dmcfz30eg blakbird said one of them works well mated with an 8 tooth on parallel axles and the other one doesnt the difference is only supposed to be longer teeth so it really should not matter but it does if your set works bad try switching the crown gear to one of the other variety worked for me wow youre right never thought of that thanks i made a scan  of those two gears you can notice the longer teeth first pic edited by bernddasbrot 23 march 2008  0303 pm	neutral

hello all apologize for digging out a such old post recently i got a bag of lego technic parts where there have been mixed three sets 8858 8829 and 8235 the resurrection of 8858 has been described by me in a separate post going back to the dune buggy – when i saw it for the first time back in 1994 i did not like it as i was always big fan of 8840 which i consider to the day the best looking buggy and set 8829 looked to me ugly so there were those all parts in the bag… then i though why not build it  and i started to do it when i finished i was very surprised how the final look of this set is really taking my words back unfortunately in the bag there were missing some parts and i could not rebuild the back spoiler so i made some changes to it and make it from spare parts that i have and it came out acceptable i also added some additional parts such as “fake” steering wheel “rally” logo antennas i have also reverse mounting of the rear tires – why lego did them like that i never know – as i think they look better this way set well the review has been already made by owner of this post so i will only add few things into it engine – v2 aired cooled is driven by 4 gears  from the single wheel no differential as in 8840 using two old school z14 tooth bevel  then by z24 tooth crown and z8 tooth type 1 actually the as in most old sets the pistons are moving very fast not as in current sets and smooths – i needed to extra clean all engine parts as there was a lot friction suspension – set has “engine bay” working using two old gray shock absorbers 65l – the movement is not big but works very nice better then in 8840 in my opinion steering – this is a bit odd as there is no direct connection to hog as in most old sets but first the gear rack is moved by z8 then two z14 tooth where reverse movement is taking place later connection of two old school z14 tooth bevel goes to hog details – this is the most that i like in this set specially how the use of axle pin connector perpendicular and 1x10 bricks with 3x3 cut corners and plate 1x5 toothed ends 2 studs with center axle hole are making the body shape – is just wonder tires – the balloon rear are pretty nice the front is a new version of those that were in 8840 what i do not like 1 missing of technic figure 8840 had it 2 no steering wheel in the original set 3 no differential – but having in mind that lego has introduce 2412 teeth would be difficult to build the transmission in such small space where the engine is i will shortly upload new pictures and post them here later on  over all – i think it is worth buying it as it is very payable  actually very payable and runs smoothly  the steering suspension – perfect thank you and regards	positive
pictures of my restored set 8829 i was almost 96 complete and for missing parts i add of my own the seat is black and not blue as one was missing in my 8858 the spoiler is different steering wheel added not connected to wheels and some additional items to make it look better this is how i change the tire orientation the new rear spoiler i still need to clean front rims edited by aow 26 november 2015  1232 pm	neutral
wow this buggy was my very first lego set i like this review  it remembered my childhood i also liked its body with those 8 studs long bricks on sides i can also remember trying to build engine in such way that it works smooth without success anyway i think its studless version  set 8048 is much better	positive

hi this is my forth preoldschool review as promised a yellowset  my 8862 arrived today survived the washing machine coaster and actually was real fun to build 1 information this set contains 664 parts only i thought i’d be far more and was released in 1989 in the technic theme be sure to visit technopediaif you want to know more 2 building instructions wow these instructions are used im not used to this after all this sets with unread instruction booklets the pneumatics page the last step for the alternate model 3 the parts wow look at all those technic beams gears pins a few parts are missing in this photo 3 building the left worm gear is for the outriggers the right one for turning the “rear boom” the three 12l axles left one outriggers middle one steering right one erm… rearboomrotation the two worm gears in the front part left one lifting the bucket right one dumping the bucket the turningmechanism for the “rearboom” is finished once again a toothed 10l axle the boat weight 2x6x2 is hidden underneath the radiator grill okay… many hoses and a nice comfy seat have been added now you can recognize the backhoes real shape only with a little violence it’s possible to lift the bonnet  through the pneumatic pump yeah outriggers same technique that the 8854 uses the finished “boom  jib  scoop thing” bjst  xd the finished loader bucket and to end the building process the same picture from the introduction offtopic “it is all part of the miracle of nature  the circle of life” 4 functionality this time i tried something new i hope you can spot something  if not technopedia okay here we go 5 random shots i’ve got way too many pictures this time so i refer to my brickshelf folder until it’s moderated you can follow the multilingual links eins deux three quattro fem zes sédem osiem 6 final thoughts definitely worth buying as a child i thought it looks hideous  but today i’ve found out it’s totally fun to build and freaking functional three things i want to mention though the bjst can only be slewed a new word if the outriggers are deployed it is also possible that the bjst will reach the ground danger of grinding or sticking even if the outriggers are deployed the two mechanisms for the loader bucket can actually interlock and the 14 tooth gears might break  disentangle from the axle thanks for viewing the pictures i hope you enjoyed it please comment if you want to	neutral
ah what a very fine classic set and all these lovely technic beams with studs wub thank you very much for that excellent review bernd and you did a fantastic job with all these great pictures  y	positive
another nice review the slow shutter speed pictures are great i think that was the only set with 8 distinct functions for a very long time and was only displaced by the 8455 backhoe in that respect the turntable on the back doesnt turn very well though as the weight is all distributed on one side the screw axle prevents it from popping off but there is still a lot of friction in it i dont have mine built anymore but it might be worth trying to put a weight brick or something on it quote do you have 8455 as well id love to see how they compare side by side it looks bigger than 8455 but i dont own any of the big old chuncky tires so i find it so hard to tell yeah its quite a bit bigger when everything is fully extended it becomes something like 26 long although the 8455 actually has morebetter functionality edited by cp5670 24 march 2008  0815 am	positive
thanks for your feedback i like both but i would say 8455 is far more than just a studless version with 10 pneumatic cylinders and 2 pneumatic pumps its a wonderful set for every pneumatic freak unfortunately i dont own the 8455  yet  sinner said i hope you have more planned any chance of a supercar one i foreshadowed a black review a few days ago guess which one xo xd	positive
a great review for a great set it even had the old technic tpieces and bevels which i actually prefer to their modern counterparts cp5670 on mar 24 2008 0814 am said the turntable on the back doesnt turn very well though as the weight is all distributed on one side the screw axle prevents it from popping off but there is still a lot of friction in it i got mine for £20 in a second hand shop it said complete but one of the screw knuts was missing xo so its practically impossible to keep the back arm on with only one  and theyre rather rare on bl too 	positive
yesterday while building i accidentaly dropped a axle nut of course im working in a total mess and so it tool some time til i found it again there are 324 axle nuts on bricklink with an avg price of 089 i didnt know of this accessoryset 51102 you can buy it for 4000 8	neutral
bernddasbrot on mar 24 2008 0508 pm said there are 324 axle nuts on bricklink with an avg price of 089 but i wants it cheap sing and i would still call 324 quite rare and i also want to just tack it onto another order sad	negative
yeah i meant theyre rare  but i can imagine that a normal axle with the old half bushes will help sometimes these are really strong if you put 23 in a row edit i just tried it a normal 10l axle with 2 interlocking old half bushes type 1 on each end i chose those who only can be moved very hardly along an axle i slewed the bjst  back arm a few times tried the pneumatics parallel to it and it didnt loose edited by bernddasbrot 24 march 2008  0606 pm	neutral
quote there are 324 axle nuts on bricklink with an avg price of 089 i didnt know of this accessoryset 51102 you can buy it for 4000 8 i was thinking of getting one of those off bl several years ago back when the price used to be more like 15 or so but i realized that i hardly ever use the couple that i already have p they came out with the modern turntable the year after this set which mostly negated the need for these screw axles i think their only use now is to hold nonlego objects onto models like the technic pen in 8094 i guess you can try to make linear actuators out of them but theyre often too rare and fragile for that	neutral
bernddasbrot on mar 23 2008 0232 pm said hi this is my forth preoldschool review as promised a yellowset  my 8862 arrived today survived the washing machine coaster and actually was real fun to build the finished “boom  jib  scoop thing” bjst  xd thanks for viewing the pictures i hope you enjoyed it another great review and a wonderful set of pictures i like your nomenclature for the bjst acronyms always sound nicely scientific much better than digger no one would know you made it up until they found out what it means i also really like what i will call your kinetic photos they convey a sense of motion and show the range of the mechanism without the big file sizes of animations how long of a shutter speed did you use the secret to not getting too much friction in the turntable is using extra nuts and jamming them together you dont want to actually clamp the nuts tight across the turntable you want to jam two nuts tightly together at each end which prevents them from unwinding but still leave a little free play gap this way it will hold the assembly together but not prevent it from moving mine moves quite easily this same concept is used on the pen plotter or 8094 slewed i think thats a word how about slewn or slain or slewifacated i think rotated is best sweet eric	positive
wow thanks for putting up this thread that reminded me that i own that one too sweet and i loved it as a kid	positive
by the way dont forget to build the alternate model of 8862 it is a combine farm equipment which is just as good as 8274 i liked it so much that i bought two copies of this set so i could display both my favorite alternate model not counting universal sets is the 8480 submarine maybe it is time for a white set review skull white is pretty rare for your blue set i recommend you review 8462 there are only a couple of green sets and 8479 is the best and then of course 8458 is silver i think we all know what the best black set is and according to your photography you have lots of them but dont forget 8868 eric	positive
quote how long of a shutter speed did you use 15 seconds quote by the way dont forget to build the alternate model of 8862 i will review it too and post it in this topic quote slewed i think thats a word how about slewn or slain or slewifacated i think rotated is best actually i took it from your site xd quote white is pretty rare unfortunately i dont own 8480 but i think 8824 is also a very good though small white set 8462 rocks as a blue set i just got it a few weeks ago lets see 8462 also is one of the last technic sets i would call oldschool 8479 okay too but 8458 is imho not 8868 and the totally mysteriously black set will follow quote i was thinking you could somehow attach a 16tooth dark gray gear the one that spins freely around axles to the nut which would make the axle move in and out when the gear turned and convert the gears rotary motion to linear motion in a fairly compact package did you had something like this in mind if the toothed 10l axle rotates the axle nuts want to rotate too but they cant because of that 2x4 technic plate so theyll decide to move along the axle the 1x6 bricks on each end make sure that the axle wont move in or out thanks for your feedback	neutral
bernddasbrot on mar 25 2008 0346 am said 15 seconds wow thats a long exposure i would think you would get way too much light and overexpose the image the aperture must have been tiny quote i will review it too and post it in this topic cool i am also planning to write about the combine on technicopedia combine quote actually i took it from your site xd i thought that word sounded familiar quote unfortunately i dont own 8480 but i think 8824 is also a very good though small white set 8462 rocks as a blue set i just got it a few weeks ago lets see 8462 also is one of the last technic sets i would call oldschool 8479 okay too but 8458 is imho not 8868 and the totally mysteriously black set will follow you dont own 8480 that is unacceptable it is imperative that you put a mortgage on your house immediately to get it sweet yes 8824 is a good white set i also see from your room photos that you have the 8839 supply ship which has lots of white this is a really nice set 8462 is hard to call old school but at least it uses regular beams the air tanks are the best part of the set i wish lego had used them more often especially on the highly pneumatic sets the tank makes all the difference on 8459 you are right 8458 is certainly not old school but it is a great set with wonderful suspension it is of the same era as the super street sensation with all of the panels for body contouring 8868 is technic at its best there is nothing else like it especially with the compressor quote did you had something like this in mind if the toothed 10l axle rotates the axle nuts want to rotate too but they cant because of that 2x4 technic plate so theyll decide to move along the axle the 1x6 bricks on each end make sure that the axle wont move in or out thanks for your feedback while the assembly you have drawn would work as a linear actuator i would not recommend it the torsional stiffness and strength of an axle are proportional to the polar moment of inertia a section property most of the stiffness comes from the outside of the cross shaped axle but in the threaded axle you lose all the stiffness of the outer area because it is not continuous this means you only get stiffness and strength from the small core i think the threaded axle would bend and break very easily if subjected to much torque eric	neutral
quote 8462 rocks as a blue set i just got it a few weeks ago lets see 8462 also is one of the last technic sets i would call oldschool 8479 okay too but 8458 is imho not yeah the tow truck was the last set that still used mainly studded beams they made many changes to technic the following year with models becoming predominantly studless and making heavy use of the flexible axleshoses and decorative panels the technic logo and box art style was also changed a lot i really like the overall construction of that set the model is fairly lightweight but extremely sturdy it must be one of the strongest large sets theyve released quote did you had something like this in mind thats basically the idea as blakbird said though it wouldnt be very powerful and would put the axle under some stress the linear actuators theyre bringing out this year do the same thing and should work much better	positive
im very sorry for that doublepost i made a picture for you sinner but forgot to upload it your dad patrick parrot driving a giant backhoe sadly his second job as photojournalist and the fact that bianca lamb was strolling by distracted him as a consequence he spoiled the whole construction site bringing death and doom with a technic backhoe to fabuland and a little walrus baby y p	neutral

some time ago i sort of complained about the fact that there was not much technic represented in the eurobricks community this was the topic if someone is interested i am glad to see someone took that complaint serious and started reviewing technic sets on large scale to show us how fascinating the theme really is this review is once again an excellent one i really enjoyed reading it i must buy this set sometime soon because i always liked the threeway pneumatic system it came with and the overall look of the machine for many years it seemed out of reach much to expensive and hard to come by as a kid now as an adult there are many ways to acquire this wonderful set keep on reviewing y	positive
this is a review of speed racer set 8159 raxer x vs taejo this is my second review and the first review of this paticular set and the only one on eurobricks at the moment xd so without further ado i present to you my review i like that saying so much i decided to use it again in this review its originally from my review of 8158 which can be seen here note sorry that this review got delayed but there was a hostile takeover of the computer xo dont worry everythings fine now xd set 8159 racer x vs taejo theme speed racer price 1999us pieces 237 minifigs 2 note 2 i did not take photos of just the new pieces this time because theyre the same new pieces as in 8158 just in diff colors if you want to see a picture of them click here first off pictures of the box instructions dss and minifigs not quite as many stickers as set 8158 but there still are quite a few can you guess which ones which d yes taejos hair really is red and black for racer xs head tlg just reused the baddies head from 7620  now onto the build first racer xs x racer d thats not its official name i think  back end of the car the cockpit and yeah there are no seats for racer xs hiny just a flat 2x2 dark bley plate the cockpit and rearend of the car connect using an sshaped connector piece the front part of the car the fornt and the cockpit are also connected using an sshaped connector piece adding some details including yellow fenders the underside of the car so far adding some more detail newly added motor vents and smooth details adding a front bumper amongst other things side view of the car so far no backseat driving wait a minute theres no backseat the underside with newly added axles demonstrating how hubcap piece is put on the car now onto taejos grr glorious red racer p front part of the car cockpit regular seats check cocpit and rearend of the car connected using sshaped connector piece adding some detail the front part of the car front and cockpit connected also using the sshaped connector piece adding some fenders to the car underside of the car so far adding some smooth details taejos is the only car with an actual hood side view of the car so far underside of the car with axels now some finished shots of both cars first racer xs fine black and yellow racer reminds me of an older ferrari from this angle up close and personal im guessing the 3 holes are exhaust outlets racer x rollin now its time for taejos red racer i couldve sworn i ordered some hubcaps guess who taejo racer x admiring taejos fine red automobile up close with big red rearend shot of the car i challenge you racer x taejo racer x bein a complete badass and smokin taejo  now for some comparison shots the silver pocket knife is just to hold up taejos car now a shot of the extra pieces now if you combine 8158 with 8159 you get this go go go now its time for the summary this set is an excellent buy at 20 dollars its well designed and has lots of details it also has very unique minifigs which are always good in a set its only downfalls are the lack of acessories for the minifigs and that there are no cool contraptions on the cars and by cool i mean lethal to the other racers now to the scoring of the set price1010 pieces 810 too many stickers for such a small set minifigs 1010 unique and creative playability 910 would have been perfect except for the lack of acessories and cool contraptions on the cars but both are easily modifiedfixed hence the nine overall 3740 a great set bonus try and count how many times my silver pocket knife appears and win the knowledge of knowing how many times the silver pocket knife appears p d this concludes the review more pictures of either set 8158 or 8159 or both available through request via pming me  see ya next time folks of course i dont mean that literally xd  general tarful edited by imperialshadows 01 june 2008  1205 pm	positive

a very good review thanks generaltarful y that´s an interesting set for sure and especially the red car looks really fine air intakes very nice 	positive
thanks for the review general tarful i only saw the knife 27 times  i like this set but i probably wont justify the price the other set has orange  wub and the mach 5 as well as better fleshie head i reckon to the batbrick cave 	neutral

generaltarful on mar 25 2008 0143 pm said nope p and thanks hollisbrick they are both really similar so it really depends on which colors you use more in mocing or which characters you like more my personal choice is 8159 as it has cooler minifigs except for racer xs recycled head  and the colors are more useful to me then again if youre like batbrick the only thing that matters is if a set has orange in it p regards general tarful thanks y probably will get this set although the orangeoh the orange peices 8 haha anyway once again thanks for the reveiw and meditate on the decision i will yoda xd	neutral
nice it is probably the only speed racers set i will buy  and i will buy multiples those cars look awesome	positive
thanks for the review and for giving me directions p i think the design of these two cars looks to be better than in the other set the drivers are positioned lower compared to the windscreen and the design of the front on th red car is really nice im missing details of motors and cars this big could use a working steering mechanism	neutral
thanks for the review mate i may get this as well so i can get racer x axctually i see what tlcs done here splitting up the two more wellknown characters speed and racer x so you have to get both sets matn on mar 25 2008 0809 am said lego should have used this for their helmets you can put a protectingglassesdont know the name in front of it visor id have to agree with you with regards the helmet i wouldve preferred this especially for speed interestingly my pocket knife is the same as that one i didnt count its appearances though	neutral
speaking of pocket knives i just got speed racer and snake oiler at kmart and might mod the helmet so it actually looks like the cartoon the problem is  i dont want to shell out two bucks for a clear visor  by the way i know transclear visors are nonproduction but where did they come from a pickabrick if so what store well at least if i do go through getting the elusive clear visor its not as bad as the insane 25 red vader helmet this set is great i would have gotten this along with the one i purchased but i didnt have enough dough with me to get both	positive
crap now i want these sets great review	positive
thanks for this review its a nice set with some cool pieces and nice techniques i like the way the roof pieces are used to make the spiders back for instance lasse d on mar 26 2008 0948 pm said alternate models 3 it is hard to come up with alternate models with so many small pieces and plates that are only 1 stud wide the colors might make you want to build a spyrius space ship ouch thats not a good thing lets refrain from that 	positive

enchanted island 6278 pictorial review original price 66 pieces 412 figures 7 this 1994 set marked the beginning of a new era for lego pirates  it became a theme more centralised around playability and not so much grand ol ships 6278 enchanted island was the flagship set of the islanders subtheme heavily based around polynesian and native american concepts in fact tlc was successfully sued by a number of tribes for using bastardised maori names such as kahuka it was released as a legend set in 2001 but due to poor sales was discontinued again the largest of the islander sets enchanted island is a portion of an island with a river running through the left hand side features some sturdy buildings built into a treelike structure on a rocky outcrop whilst the left hand side features a tower built out of wooden posts and a large tribal statue the box cover shows all the details it does however differ from the instructions finished product in that it has been more aesthetically arranged  bushes etc have been moved to fill in gaps and to not obscure other things the sides of the box show nothing particularly special although in one scene it depicts the islander canoe chasing the pirate boat with the treasure just one way to play with the set the back of the box however is superb featuring a large number of alternative models a toothy statue a pirate tree think wolfpack with an islander base kahukas throne a firebreathing statue and a soupedup boat for the pirates these and many more can be easily made because of the large diversity of pieces the set has a huge number of minifigures for its size the third highest number in the pirate range the ses and the bsb being first and second respectively  a whopping 7 5 islanders including the alltoocommon king kahuka the elusive islander babe and 3 standard warriors  this set alone will never leave you short of enemies 2 pirates ironhook in his standard attire with a scurvy dog at his side attack the island although they are only moderately armed  2 cutlasses and a pistol between them a musket wouldve been nice the islanders on the other hand have 4 shields a bow and quiver and 6 spears not to mention the big pokey thing with horns on top weapon idol staff a monkey parrot and crocodile provide the obvious creature features with a fair amount of gold to finish off in the instructions the goblet does not have the lid although it does on the box its a nice touch anyway  adding a little more diversity to the monotonous treasure stashes the pirates boat is a nice 2 sail vessel with oars for when the wind stops and a treasure map the sails are similar to those in lagoon lockup but with an extra front sail its an awesome little boat better for raids than a rowing boat but not too big that it cant sail up rivers it can comfortably fit 2 men and at a squeeze 5 the sails are expensive if you buy them seperately normally this wont be a problem but they can cost aroun 5 each the islanders boat is a canoe with a sail and an outrigger to stabilise it the sail is beautifully done with 2 spars taughtening it there is a clip for the rower to leave his weapon when at se and the mast can turn to get as much wind as possible its quite a topheavy boat but it doesnt look hideous and without the mastsail it looks great 3 islanders can fit in it and more if they sit on the outrigger the markings on the canoe are stickers but they look fine and are probably more robust than markings for their job furthermore theyre waterproof sing kahukas throne can be carried by 2 loyal subjects or strapped to his pet crocodile the clips on the side can be used to rest his weaponry or hold spears for battle the throne looks nice although im not too sure about the blue against the red  id have prefered white as it would clash less an overview of the island it is built in 2 halves  left then right and then joined together loosley so it can be seperated for transporting around the back to the left and right there are large open spaces that are great for battles  this set isnt so much about a large solid build but creating a village  smaller structures linked by bridges and the back to the far left is a platform built onto the rock with access from the river via a ladder theres the standard islander drum with the lovely zebraskin part where did they get that ive never understood the white flag  i was under the impression it was used for surrender further along the rocky bank there are some hinged palm leaves that swing upwards to reveal the treasure its an ok hiding place not the best place to hide it right where the pirates sail past but it feels fabulous it fits right in above it on the rocky bank is the main structure it looks very disjointed when you build it bricks all over the place but once its done it looks nice and rural with leaves everywhere and the balcony where kahuka is standing you get a nice roof made from 2 large palm leaves tilting down around the back theres a slight shelter a table for picnics and a ladder to access the upstairs i was rather annoyed that it is so open but the set is designed from just one perspective to the left is the bridge to the other building a nice one piece bridge made of the softer plastic used for muskets and the post1991 cutlasses it looks good but be warned it tilts when you pull a pin sending the pirates flying this contraption is a good idea but it is very stiff and so doesnt swing even when burdened by a minifigure  youll want to modify this bit if you get it the other building looks like it is made out of posts and beams they are all red brown would have been better but it would have added too many colours to the range just like the use of black for trees in some forestmen sets there are 3 clips for spare weapons only 2 of these will ever be used when all the islanders are armed but it gives the pirates scope once theyve been disarmedtheres another nice palm tree roof on top 2 ladders give accesstheres a total of 4 in this set  worth getting eh although theyre 5p on bricklink for a kabob theyre like gold at the top theres another hidey hole the palm leaves lift up on hinges to show the treasure or hiding islander it can be seen from behind but this set is designed from one perspective only nice cattlehorns tooalongside the slats you can see in the floor  5 years later and it wouldve been a solid plate the big statue is one of the main selling point of this set alongside the tilting bridge  theyre the action features shown in every catalogue at the time but it is not really special just original the statue fits in with the theme perfectly  kahukas mask his shield and this statue all depict the same deity which is a nice collectible idea the back is rather plain except the angled 1x1 bricks  a good touch im not sure why theres a black brick in the back of the head but this is easily remedied it could even be done with a brick from this same set just swapping the two over aside from the head turning the back can open to store sacred objects or in my opinion prisoners hence the gaps for breathing either way its a lovely piece of architecture and deservedly a flagship element of the set theres your standard cooking pot floating around although a 1x1 yellow stud as human flesh remember minifigs are yellow no matter what the licensed themes say is a superb finish this set is a stunning set for both kids and afols who are just getting back into legopirates  it is a great army builder and due to its release as a legend is extremely cheap on ebay  you should be able to pick one up for £18 or £15 if youre lucky for that you get a lifetimes supply of islanders 4 ladders some wall panels 2 baseplates one raised and both with rivers and printed vegetation around the edge a ton of weapons a fair quantity of standard bricks but most of all a heap of vegetation this is an easy to buy set with normally around 5 on ebay at any time and is well worth it for the parts the play and the nostalgia it can be easily modified when used in conjunction with any other outpost a much larger fortress can be made especially if more rope bridges are used if you pick 2 of this fine set off ebay itll still be less than the original price a huge complex can be constructed giving you an instantaneous village for around £35 other information lugnet rating

thanks for a lovely review i only recently bought this set off ebay pretty good deal misb for 30 euros and i enjoyed putting it together and mixing it with the other piratesets when you put two sets of two baseplates together youll get a large pond with an island in the center just to achieve that i bought two more baseplates off ebay the result is this moc i always loved the islanders and have most of the sets not all of them but that is going to change in the future y	positive
excellent review i really like this set and so i gave it a 55 this set is on my list to get i especially like the speedy pirate boat and the also very fast outrigger canoe with a sail i dont think a small number of these cannibals will make much of an impact on gaming though even if they get a bonus with spears duke	positive
a mighty fine review youve created slyowl y after some sleep i shall immerse myself more fully within it	positive
nice review  although im pretty sure eldorado fortress has 8 minifigs making this set no 4 in the minifig count i gave it a 5 the number of islanders and vegetation pieces comes in very handy for land based scenarios ive got 3 copies of this set 1 of them costing me less than 2euros from an ebay auction in scotland along with forbidden island its easily one of the most common and affordable pirate sets to be found on he second hand market	positive
a great and informative review with very fine pictures thanks slyowl sweet a wonderful set this is indeed full of nice details and pretty playable and a cool subtheme that offers a lot of fantasy and charming characters in a marvelous layout i really love that little boat with the outrigger and the neat buildings and sweet landscaping works together very well tlc got sued for using some names of native sounding origin now that sounds really strange to me such names´re widely spread within novels movies and such stuff i didn´t know that there´s some kind of copyright on them 8	positive
good review mr slyowl and good pics too i know it probably deserves better but i only give him a 3 ill be surely the only saying that i dont like this set but i remember i had it for christmas when i was a child and it disappointed me very much because i expected it much larger after seeing it in the lego catalogs well its just a little trauma i had p lol anyway i must admit its an interesant set specially because of the large number of minifigures and accesories it brings with and the two little ships edited by bluebard 31 march 2008  0113 am	positive

yay pictures thank you for the review you made me actually consider looking it up on ebay but i already have so so many things to get on my want list drat my easy ability to get sold on something lego	positive
slyowl youre a legend thank you for taking the time to do such a comprehensive review youve captured enchanted island in impeccable detail and anyone who doesnt own this set should know it insideout by now i shall write my thoughts on the set itself directly	positive
for some reason i never considered buying this set but your review changed that ill try to get it on ebay thanks for your efforts to make this wonderful review for us its now added to our index	positive
thanks for the review i am getting very interested in the classic pirates sets and i wat some now this seems like it would be a great starter	positive
great review i recently got this set for only 150 sek around 17 and it´s really good	positive
everytime i saw this at a toy store i always cried to my parents for one but never got it i got the smaller islander sets but the more i see this now i dont want it i could buy it but naahh i am hoping lego does an updated version of the islanders with this new pirates line one can hope right xd	neutral
fortunately i got this set on 2000 not the released version the original one and i said fortunately because its a lovely set how could i rate it but awesome a little islander army the islander girl ironhook and that cool boat with two sails the jailpolynesian statue i must recognize that i have a thing with the islanders i know that they are weird poorly based on the polynesian aborigens etc but they are very original broke with the traditional enemies and gave to the pirates theme an exotic and wild look	positive
i realized that building the chess set from the new pirates theme they are two grey heads that reminded me of the king kahuna throne which goes to say that i am hoping they bring back new sets i just wish they were bigger i would love to build the old ones but i would side more towards the newer model if they ever released them	negative
what an amazing old set i loved pirates in my childhood but that was before the islander and spanish stuff mine were the bsb and soldier fortress with the big baseplate as im now returning to pirates ive tracked down most of the 2009 sets and of course bought the new 2015 sets but knowing i missed this middle period of islanders vs pirates makes me a bit sad those islanders are soooo monkey island those of my age likely feel the same to my eyes oh for a lemonhead minfig  im curious now how much this set sells for given it was apparently one of very few lego actually rereleased i recently bought a misb bsb that was an early 2000s rerelease and it was very pricey but then i suspect the bsb has a lot more of a nostalgic following these days than this set can anyone give me a rough idea what this set goes for in asnew condition these days regardless a fantastic review with some great photos of the whole set and minifigs even though this is an old thread i am glad someone else bumped it recently so i can add my thoughts too  one thing ive noticed comparing the newest pirates sets to the 80s ones i had as a kid and these from the 90s is the move away from baseplates and big panel pieces i actually like that in a lot of ways whilst i miss baseplates being included as they are a great starting point for creating new things and make the sets easier to play with visually i think legodesigned model sets look better without them	positive
here is a preview of my review of speed racer grand prix race i will try to get a full review up later today pics when public sorry about the blur i am not a great photographer also if there are any pictures you would like that i havent included just ask	neutral
judging from your pictures there seems to be many interesting torsos and new fleshy heads but i dont think this set is for me fueling my dismissal of this set is that i saw the trailer for this film at the cinema today and it looked pretty terrible x thanks for taking your time to review this set though ricecracker  edited by casewindu 29 march 2008  1018 pm	negative
no problem casewindu i actually like this set for the pieces and torsos especially sprittles	positive

thank you for the pics y i want a trixie impulse set wub and otherwise that little boy with his monkey i like the print on his t shirt	positive
doubt ill get this i used to like the anime but the the film looks cheesy as a cheese sandwhich	negative
i picked up this set a few weeks ago along with the smaller sets that come with the mach 5 and racer xs car and i was pleasantly surprised the commentators stand is nothing to write home about but the assortment of figs is great numerous new face prints in flesh i believe and in spite of the large amount of stickers the three cars are each unique and very welldesigned my only gripe about them is that cannonball taylors car the black and yellow one was a missed opportunity as in the movie its yellow and purple i know tlc is dropping purple for the future and had a bunch of problems with it in the past but it would have made for a great looking car imo	positive
well thanks for your posting but i couldn´t care less about fleshie minifigs or movieaccurate cars  or the cars at all this set would really only go into my parts bin therefore i need to know what parts are in there and if they are cool enough to go into an exoforce collectors parts bin	neutral

hi ive promised a lot lately ill review 8868 8880 space police ii blacktron ii and i will its just the time that is blocking me and my university and the fact that i just picked up 8460 in original box for only eur 3650 sweet the other reviews will follow  please bear with me and this set review is also a gift to this nice fellow who gave me the title thats what im talking about 1 useless information with high numbers this set contains 841 parts and was released in 1995 in the technic  tech build  advanced sub theme the bricklink price guide displays for “used” a qty avg price of 12585 and for “new” a qty avg price of 21282 i got it for 5698 still can’t believe it  this set was rereleased two times 8431 in 2002 and 8438 in 2003 2 the box front back open the box is higher than other technic boxes why i don’t know 8460 doesn’t have any real large parts whatever inlay i wonder why tlg doesn’t make inlays anymore… they’re noisy and brake easily but are great for pre sorting 3 building instructions i will quote myself from the 8862 review quote wow these instructions are used im not used to this after all this sets with unread instruction booklets triplewow ‘nuff said this is the “first” page fortunately peeron offers scans the last step for the alternate model and a few nice photos showing how the pneumatic pump will be erm pumped yeah random page i forgot the overall thoughts to the instructions these are technic instructions as we’re used to them part count easy to understand okay the string part at the end was too much for me and the color distinction is okay too 100 pages long and if i can trust my eyes the pneumatics page can be fold out i don’t have this page but i assume it 4 the parts 5 building an easy and fun build okay this could take some time my longest building review up to date the front steering the rear steering the axle pin between the rear steering is for the axle which rotates the crane the two worm screws in the front are for the outriggers they’re not linked one for each side the small wheel in the back is for the rotation adjusting front and rear steering outriggers are finished you can notice a 8 tooth gear that will rotate the technic turntable a steering wheel has been added could be the same stickers like the alternate 8880 used to have the steering can be operated with both actinic lights  no we’re far from finished i’ve got a lot of parts left at this point wow a 4x4 corner plate pneumatics and a winch if you can’t recognize it on the photo the technic beams are the erm wrongother side up the 1x6 technic beams on the left side are normal the axle that will extend the crane 7 gear racks 1x4 the 1x6 technic plate will keep the two pneumatic cylinders straight sad 8 huh did you blink you missed a special part the whole rotatable thing will be attached to the technic turntable using two long technic pins the pin on the right side should be in the middle of the three “turntable holes” on the right side it’s the first hole asymmetric why because we’ll add a cute cab 6 functionality you can find the features in comparison to other technic cranes here technopedia of course i made one sentence out of it please don’t find any mistakes p “two axle rack and pinion steering pneumatic luffing and gear driven telescoping via crank for the boom which can slew 360° on turntable driven via gear crank driven hoist and gear driven outriggers at four corners which snap over center” 7 random shots comparison to 8854 uuuh… once again a depth of field i tried to make it look authoritarian like 8858 but i failed somehow 8460 looks cute 8 comparison to 8421 mobile crane  crane truck i feel that a question concerning this will be asked so i deal with it right now first of all i don’t own 8421 yet i know a technic freak really should own it anyway 8421 has more than twice as much parts as 8460 is motorized features a v6engine and a very neat mechanism to extend the craneboom twice using a braided string with end studs try to find out how of course 8421 features far more than 8460 imho 8421 should have been a copy of 8460 a set so successful that it has been rereleased two times but the designers overshoot the mark 8421 is a breathtaking monster compared to it 8460 looks cute  not pale 9 final thoughts i got it on ebay in kind of good condition for about 50 dollars i know that it has been worth the money in any point of view wub i didn’t use the word “oldschool” for now i’ll change that 8460 belongs to the favored few of oldschool technic sets thanks for reading and viewing the pictures i hope you enjoyed it please comment if you want to	positive
ah thanks sommuch again for that great review y sweet man i am so happy they made this set the new one seems too boring 	positive
somehow i competely missed your review when you first made it i saw your pics on brickshelf and wondered about the review you have managed to review my all time favourite technic set it was the first large technic set i was given by my parents when it first came out in 1995 i played for hours with this set making minifig seats in it it was so huge there was room for four minifigs to sit next to eachother in front i made various applications for it a bungeejump system with a large rubber band and lots of containers to be lifted the first changes i made included the inverting of the wheels and the disabling of one of the flashlightsteering wheels because they obstructed eachother by the way the nob for your winch is yellow instead of black i know this set by heart so watch out p  i always liked those nobs i do own the 8421 and i can tell you this 8460 is much much stronger it can carry more weight because the boom is lighter then the 8421 they are powered by the same two pistons you know when you made it right when the crane is in upright position fully extended and you release the brake from the winch does the hook lower without having to pull it if it does you succeeded in constructing the set right the alternate model was great fun too the pump is cleverly hidden and the crane folds up great between the cab and the loading platform you could easily mod it with a pneumatic claw on the crane a motor to turn it and a compressor the only flaw was the loading platform which had no floor only some axles thanks so much for reviving my memorie concerning this great set y	positive
im in the same situation as you i have this set but missed out on the newer 8421 this was a great set for its time but the 8421 definitely looks better to me ive been trying to find a good deal on it on ebay but its pretty expensive considering that it only went out of production last year quote inlay i wonder why tlg doesn’t make inlays anymore… they’re noisy and brake easily but are great for pre sorting the box designs in general are crappier these days than they used to be 10 years ago you dont see the old featured parts trays anymore and the boxes dont have the different sections either these also acted as internal supports for larger boxes so they were less prone to being crushed the cardboard material is also quite a bit thinner i think its a result of tlcs overall costcutting moves since then most people toss the boxes and probably dont care but i keep all of them there was actually a time when the boxes used to be even stronger i have an old 8859 set and the outer box is made of a hard styrofoam material although they probably stopped using that for environmental reasons edited by cp5670 06 april 2008  1013 pm	neutral
a great review thank you i do not know these old sets like this one but it is very cool to see how they were made i have an unopened 8421 maybe i should do a small review of that when i get to build it btw boxes are expensive so at a given price point its a choise between more bricks or nicer boxes i have no doubt what most people would chose front edited by front 06 april 2008  1021 pm	positive

thanks for the review sweet for its size and parts count this is a remarkably featured set i dont think ive never seen the alternate model before personally i prefer 8421 because i think it looks much better and i love the six wheel steering i also love the three segment boom and the transmission they fit it all in so neatly i realise that it has trouble even holding up itself but ultimately it doesnt matter as its not like you are really going to construction work with it what bothers me more about 8421 is the design change in the boom from chainlinks to strings i would try to mod mine but all i have is the prototype picture to base it on and i dont have enough links anyway p bernddasbrot on apr 7 2008 0729 am said yeah somehow i wonderd why only vbbn thanks responded indeed i have been very busy the last few months and i kept meaning to reply at last i managed to find the time to reply today bernddasbrot on apr 7 2008 0729 am said another reason for the 8460 as favorite set its got a real alternate model not just a different erm crane yes that really sucks somebody i havent got the time to look  on brickshelf has made a quite good alternate lego have been a bit inconsistant with alternate models lately the recent tow truck had a good one i even made both	positive
thanks guys  sinner i hope you refered to 8285 so my answer will match 8285 is interesting main model american styled truck alternate model european styled truck i dont think tlg produced many european styled truck edit i just found a wonderful mocalternate on brickshelf 8436 by industrialdesigner if i got him right he designed a few offical technic sets for tlg  all promises promises promises hm and again its ebay thats blocking me i want to foreshadow my next review although itll take some time to make it i know you know but please act inconspicuous until youll can act very astonished edited by bernddasbrot 09 april 2008  0325 pm	neutral

i was already thinking of buying this set and youve totally convinced me thanks for the review alex btw i think they are ants having that shape moreover we already have spider molds and they have already been used in theatre themes see spiderman  luxorv	positive
ok i think its a nobrainer that this is a musthave for pretty much anyone who likes lego its cheap and a great minifigs  parts pack ill be getting at least 1 of these here is what i like about it 1 great minifigs with nice torsos sweet faces and awesome hair gotta ask em where they get it done  2 golden katana 3 chicken leg yum 4 nice campfire and this is what i dont like about it 1 dark bley knife seriously they could have at least made it silver like the sword if not chrome 2 rehashed tent 3 spiders with 6 legs i actually dont really care about the tent and the multilegged creatures those go straight into the sorting boxes perhaps i might use the tent someday for a steampunk moc of some kind or a stopmotion film or maybe some kind of contest anyway whats up with that thing that holds the katana the sword and the saber its in the airplane set too is it perhaps one of the treasures of the new movie or is it something indy takes with him everywhere in this film 44however nice pics nice review thanks dude edited by oky wan kenobi 16 april 2008  0938 am	positive

i simply that tent i guess i´ll have to buy three of these just to make a proper expedition moc somewhen a great little set indeed with marvelous new mf torsos and that new black feminine hairpiece´s also great and very useable for creating some characters related to the sixties and seventies and finally a pan that´s not black and a knife in grey that´s very handy indeed the chrome one always looked a bit too shiny to me thanks for that sweet review alex	positive
thanks for that great review this is a very interesting set filled with nice parts for customisation somemore the price is not that steep i will need to get ready for the second wave	positive
set ref 7625 name river chase number of minifigs 4 number of pieces unknown price 2290€ a general view of the set we’ve got an amphibious vehicle a small boat an observation post and a dark green croco so beautiful  for the figs we’ve got indy of course marion and two russian soldiers nothing special here in the back of the tree there is a box to put some things the amphibious vehicle is very nice the proportions are really great not too big not too small and there are a lot of details everywhere like the propeller a back view an inside view the small boat is a dark grey zodiac but the details are nice too giving it a retro look in the same way of all the indy vehicles the outpost has a net to permit to the bad guys to capture some nice guys and girls… but it seems that the girl marion is scared of the nice croco so indy comes and help her pushing the technic axle with this round inversed tiles which push out the net and capture the croco now marion feels happier and she takes a can of oil and whacks the poor croco without defences who has said marion is a nice girl so i’ve bought this set like an add on to my city in fact the elements of this set can easily be integrated in a town layout i plan to use the outpost for my forest section and the amphibious vehicle is always a nice touch of originality in a layout yes you can use all those military things without creating an army in a layout just put the violent parts out and you’ve got nice things like a biologist car in the case of the amphibious vehicle	positive
is that a laptop its on does it come with the set seriously though it looks liek it has some good pieces particularily the soldiers clothing and the crocodile hehe hooray for new indy sets lets hope the film is as good it will be	positive

sweet review again alex great pictures i loved the little comic with the croc youre quite right here too alex54 on apr 16 2008 0917 am said yes you can use all those military things without creating an army in a layout just put the violent parts out and you’ve got nice things like a biologist car in the case of the amphibious vehicle without the gun that vehicle is a nice little amphibious car with a tent i assume strapped to it some tools a spare tire the little tree hut is quite cool and a nice touch with the box in behind there i love the design for those gasoline cans too thanks again alex youre lucky to be getting these sets peace	positive
thanks for the review i really like this littleish set quite alot of detail it reminds me of sets from the late 90s more soviets are always welcome too and the new torso for marion is nice as is the new dark green alligator all of the neat little accesories are great too a cup shovel binoculars and of course the cans of gasoline again thanks for the review alex	positive
merci beaucoup for the great review alex  where did you get the sets  that set is called river chase this is a great set  i love the amphibious vehicle with all the darj green part  i agree with you that the the dark green croc is fantastic  im also happy to have a dark bley zodiac and a new marion torso that tree hut is a fun feature where the playability doesnt screw the design  i really love the commies  its fun how lego reuses those fleshie heads and i really dont mind at all so its evil for evil since one of the commie has the zazi face i also love the ptrol cans  ingenious  i still have rants on that set  why oh why another similar indy  arghhh i cant stand it   why oh why the same marion head  cant wait to have those sets 	positive
just like 7626 this is a must buy in my opinion i just the amphibious vehiclevery nice for army building	positive
i like the creatures in this very much and it is good to see the vehicle from different angles thank you i think i shall buy this	positive
i cant wait for these	neutral
oh man thanks for the review imo this looks like the best set in the new indy line do you have any better pics of the colonel	positive
excellent review alex thanks for sharing i cant wait to buy this set once available i really like the dark green leaf pieces i like the cavetemple which will look great in my jungle diorama blending the dark green and light green works well for the vehicle overall a neat little set	positive
great review thanks for that i love almost everything about this set the ants commies general can we please get a shot of his face dark green treads foliage and other creatures great stuff ill have to get it on sale though batbrick away	positive
this is a great set it is probably my favourite indy so so far great reveiw although the set is great the price is greater have to get it on sale	positive
wow in the protype pics i kept thinking this thing looked lame a boat on treads with saw blades but this is definetly something i want now lots of great plant and animal parts and looks like plenty of wheels with those treads its just begging to be made into a propor tank	positive
great review thanks a lot for all the pics i agree that this is probably the nicest set of the indy 4 wave so much dark green and i love all the plant pieces its been ages since weve had enough pieces in a regular release to build nice forests so its great to see 11 of the dark green leaves in one set and all the vines the design of the cutter looks very solid and brick built as well giant ants are great looking too	positive
a great detailed review for an excellent set i love the jungle cutter vehicle itself and all the dark green its great to have the trees and cave entrance you can never have enough extras the figs are nice too two russian soldiers the coollooking general i think his name is dovchenko or something and the repeatedbutstillnice indy with rpg thanks again looks like ill be picking this up along with jungle duel by the way i think this set is called jungle cutter	positive
wow those trees look so weak compared to those enormous blades anyway a highpossibilityandappealtouscompulsivelegoshoppers set so ill try to get it which means ill obsesively look until i find deforestation of puny trees on	neutral
thanks for this fantastic review alex those trees are a neat add on to any jungle as is that sweet cave but the main part of this set the jungle cutter man that is wicked packed with that awesome dark green and with those wonderful treads not to mention the smoothly spinning buzz saws however this sets a tad overpriced in my opinion and looking through the instructions they have that crazy colour syndrome again using blue yellow and red parts in the internal build still thanks for this sweet review with neat pics thumbup peace	neutral
thanks for the review alex i agree that this is the best set of kotcs sets although the airplane comes quite close although im not too fond of the trees the cave is good and the jungle cutter is brilliant plenty of great features and very detailed with much of the engine showing and a decent cockpit if thats the right word the general and the two soviets are great too could we have a closeup pic of them please  good to see that neither torso has exposed fleshy skin like the nazis as said though it is quite a pricy set i was expecting it to be just over the price of race for the stolen treasure great set thanks again alex	positive
here some closeup pics of the russian soldiers and the general  and i know that you have seen that i dont have put the stickers on	neutral
ahhhhh now this swamp vehicle looks great to me when i first heard lego were making it i was worried that it would be a poor version however im pleased to see that its not even though im not a great fan of those treads the trees dont really add anything to the set which is a shame still the parts are welcome at least the entrance is good though it could do with being bigger but i guess we can moc that i really like the commie general he looks like a real bad megablocks	positive
xwingyoda on apr 16 2008 0537 am said great review again alex  same question in case you didnt se it in my reply to the other set where did you get those new sets  i really love that set  its called jungle cutter the trees are really cool and make a great adition to it imo that temple entrance or monument is really cool  those bionicle parts do make fantastic vegetation  you mean the spiny dk green things that hang from the holes around the secret entrance they were in the indy temple escape i totally forgot about that green frog  thats cool  those are so cute  5 more ants is great  the vehicle look really sharp ah ah ah 2 more commies yeay  that officer is really freaky actually  could have been a high rank under pol pots regime in the s21 yeay looks more asian than russian imo yeah tlcs really cranking out the new molds for both food and wildlife so lets see if i get all five sets i get 11 russians and six are basic soldiers although two are duplicates and triplicates yes that officer definitely has an italian look to him those cheekbones are a little too high now its time for my gripes  same bloody rant about indy   i havent read the instructions before but once again there are so many parts in crap colours that need to be changed look at all the crap red and yellow in there  i will need to look for those parts before buying the set like i always do  mod while building on  same rant any chance we could see the rpg i am really soimpressed with that indy line  i sincerely hope it will have a long and healthy life  agreed responses to the yodameisters review of alex54s review of the jungle cutter are in red now to my opinion great review more reviews on	neutral
xwingyoda on apr 16 2008 0842 am said whats that funky name lol just making sure your yodaee awesomeness is known yep indeed and i have that set if i remember correctly the first line to use it as vegetation is aqua raiders tiger shark attack 7773 aha it was in aquaraiders it was also the squids intestines or whatever lays inside his baggy head why its just a flick fire missile in a wrench ill use my brickarms rgp which is way better oh yeah i forgot that ok so i just finished reviewing the instructions and look at the parts you need to just change the horrendous colours  damn its really getting worse and worse ahh thanks im definitely changing them they may be bearers of the red star but they dont need red lining inside their vehicles	neutral
what a lovely set i think i have to put this on my wishlistjust for that beautiful woodcutting tank thingie 2008 is gonna get expensive for me	positive
the thing and the set is called jungle cutter and the reason the front pops off is because indy blows it up with a bazooka incase you wanted to know thanks for the nice review	neutral
heres a review of the second largest set in the dragon masters subtheme for castle month dark dragons den figs the set comes with 3 dragon knights two of which have the dragon wings on their helmetssad thing is one of my knights was missing the left wing on the helmet there are also the definitive dragon wiz the wizard or majisto if you prefertwo horses and a hawk try to find him in each picture the set theres a large spot under the mountain for the dragon to guard the treasure chest the chest has 2 red and green 1x1 circles in it another gate in the back along with a door for knights the right side of the mountain has a ladder and a removable rock face the left side has some stairs leading up to the top i love this tree design simple yet effective a shot of the top hey what are you doing no throw him in the dungeon overall this set when first released in 1993 was priced at 43usd although that might just be because of the juniorised pieces 6 burps its a fun set that provides excellent playability if you can find it at a 2030 price point pick it up overall grade 810 edited by kimt 10 august 2008  0133 pm	positive
this is around the time that many consider the decline of castle in which point i somewhat agree but admittedly it still looks like a very playable set and the tree is very well done thank you for the review	positive
thanks every much for the review i remember having this set and making really terrible stopmotion movies with it very playable this brings back lots of fond memories thanks majisto on	positive
ah the wonderful dragon knight or was it dragon masters sets i personally preferred the black knights but these guys still had some awesome sets thanks for this review this looks like a neat little set although those modern stairs look a little out of place that tree design is indeed a neat one i remember having that in one dark forestmen set i got the interior sure is roomy may i suggest for future review you photograph the set on a cleared table that way you wont get distracted by the clutter in the background and can focus on the main part of the image the set peace	neutral
this is probably one of my favourite sets andor one of the sets which i wish i ownedthe 90s was probably my favourite castle era tobad i was to young to buy this set when it came out man i wish i had one of those dragons they were one of the best type i reckon although all the dragons are good thanks for the reveiw edited by hollisbrick 16 april 2008  0741 am	positive
agent rick youre definately the dragon master around these parts what a great little set i really like the classic dragon which reminds me of a similar style used for the lego crocodiles and the dungeon is pretty slick too i like the use of the large gates plus the doors plus the set contains the blue wizard awesome great review	positive
this was the last castle set i got before my dark age really liked it although the big rock parts looked really bad  i am kind of used to them now unfortunately i lost the little wand and i never understood who is good and who is bad does the wizard own the dragon well they dont seem to be enemies but isnt the dragon supposed to be evil	positive
i own this set and i think its a great for a smaller fortress building there is a good selection of mini figs the burps do detract somewhat from the set but they do make it feel as if its in a large cave the cloth flags that are included are really nice and mine have lasted a long time	positive
i think the green motocross bike looks great i like the use of fairings on this bike the only thing i really dont like about the technics bikes in general is the clumsy design of the chaindrive it sticks way to much out to the side if they made a really big bike model it would be more in place with this chain drive im not sure if it wouldnt be possible to design a shaft drive to the rear wheel ala bmw style but the green kawasaki look great with the front and rear suspension i have the street bike 8420 a somewhat larger and more complicated set and will probably add the motocross bike to my collection soon it would be great if lego could make a line of bikes like they do the ferrari line front	positive
i saw this set at my tru for only 2000 now i might go get it thanks sinner for another nice review quote hoped to find a figure the right size for it but none of mine would fit well just sit your booty down and ride it wourself  okay well maybe if you have a bionicle lying around or a halo figure	neutral
a very good review thanks sinner that´s really a pretty cool model very detailed with useful parts too hmm perhaps that one´s gonna get the first technic set i´ll buy beside that 4481 hailfire droid um thank you sinner	positive
i have just finished building this set i was a bit disappointed with the amount of bricks when they were out on my table but the final model is really nice and totally makes up for that i like the small details like on the handles and fuel tank and the only real negative thing i can say is that the cog seems a bit oversized in the rear i dont know if the designer frequents this forum but im sure he will be happy about how much you like it  it took quite some timeprototypes to get to this design sorry about the size of the picture  it isnt mine	positive
best review of a lime green technic dirt bike ever really it is i just dont understand the allure of the bike very much where does the fabuland fig go anyway very insightful review thanks for taking the time and effort to review it for us im not really interested in the set but wanted to support my buddy since i know how much work you put into these now i shall go read the cherry picker one i look forward to it because theres a walrus in it lasse d on apr 22 2008 0455 pm said it must be cold in that room nice shirt but the vertical hold is broken	neutral

sinner on apr 23 2008 1037 am said ill try to take a photo this weekend well i took the photo but didnt get around to posting it here it is with a smaller gear i think it looks better the problem is that its too tight and it doesnt rotate as freely anymore adding another link makes it too loose thus the set is probably the way it is as its the gear that fit best	neutral
how did i manage to miss this review i must have overlooked it somehow thanks for making this one sinner its always nice to see reviews of technic sets im not so sure whether i like this set i am not that much into motorbikes but lego did a good job on this one it looks a lot like an upgraded version of one of the first bikes lego made namely the 8838 shock cycle i also believe the back gearwheel is somewhat oversized it looks better with the smaller one you attached it is good to see that lego is back to making the technic sets the way they were except for the green that is 	neutral
great review i never have been interested in this set i am saving my money for a grey technic set or thatt technic ferrari set	neutral

thank you for your detailed review sinner i´m not that much into technic building because i´m lacking the inspiration to build something different with all those technic elements so i´ll pass on this one and stay to classic bricks	neutral
looks like an interesting set i didnt realize the motor controlled two functions through a transmission switch thats always good to see ill probably pass it up though until the price falls a bit the overall design is a bit too studless for my liking i think the 8275 bulldozer has a much better balance of studded and studless pieces and the wheels somehow look too small to me i also have something of a backlog at the moment i still need to pick up that bulldozer along with the 8421 mobile crane on ebay	neutral
wow its a smarty set with drive shafts we are everybody and technical junk the specs and stuff kind of lose me but the walrus looks really cute in the cherry picker i imagine hes saving a kitten but really this is a great review and has a wealth of detail and knowlege for techniphiles thanks for providing such a cool resource for eb i really did enjoy delving in to the world of technic for a few moments the walrus rides it  oh hes so smart	neutral

set 7627  indiana jones  temple of the crystal skull pieces 929 price aud14999 out of all the indy 4 sets this one seems to cop the most flak  which may account for the fact that the other 3 were reviewed weeks ago and this one has sat unloved and alone waiting for someone to turn their eye upon it or yknow buy it luckily im a sucker for spooky old temples filled with devilish traps and hidden treasures hissing fountains and overgrown foliage creepy skeletons and crumbling stonework so here it is indiana jones 7627 temple of the crystal skull part 1 the figs first off the figs  6 humans and 4 skellies or should that be skullies  indy mutt irina and that sneery russian guy thats in the 2 smaller sets nothing new here aha what have we here  two natives i wonder if hair is a sign of power in this culture since one guy is completely bald and the other one has the most extraordinarily luxurious black mullet somehow i doubt the movie will answer this question back view  as you can see the scalp tattoos are also popular in this tribe fashion conscious note in the background the paws of the fearsome black jungle panther ie my cat curious as to see what the tribe was up to also dont ask me why these guys are carrying axes rather than say spears and what everyones been waiting for the skullies  three of em and a conquistador skellie  very cute note the backs of the crystal head have a plumesized hole  or maybe thats just where they injected the blue brainplastic spooky i love these skulls i wasnt sold from the initial pics but they have a very creepy smile and the head shape is just weird with the large eyes its kind of homer simpsonesque and here we have the token vehicle in the set  a weird little tank thing with treads kind of looks like a cross between the amphibious boat and a minitank im sure theres a military expert around here who can tell us exactly what it is supposed to be the treads are nice but the rest of it is a bit thrown together you can tell they wanted to keep the dark green colour scheme but the budget only allowed them 5 parts to do so  all in all a mixed bag with the figs 4 repeats from the cheaper sets which means we have one new native figure and the crystal skullies there are heaps of the oldskool skele heads scattered around the sets so those that prefer can replace the skullies with ordinary skellies bizarrely the top of the box which has the line of 11 figs pic you know what i mean doesnt have names for any of the characters whereas all the smaller sets do part 2 box parts front of box back of box two instruction books parts this set has come under criticism for being overpriced  myself included  but the official piece count is 900 plus which is pretty good considering it also contains the baseplate 6 big bags and 2 of those 12x12 bricks in dark tan note set does not contain live black jungle panther™ the dss helpfully comes prescrunched thanks to tlc even in a aud150 set they cant get that right sigh the dark tan baseplate say what you like im in love i know some people dont like these but they were such a staple of castle pirates for so many years that i dont consider them a juniorised piece at all this one recycled from the 05 police hq and 06 hospital is much better in design than the king leos castle one as the different heights and asymmetry make it look much more like a natural piece of ground perfect for mocs and its dark tan  how could anyone not love such a huge slab of dark tan note this love doesnt extend to applying the stonework stickers which are frankly crap random instructions page part 3 temple of doom  or just a doomed temple the complete set front view isometricish view back view top view first impressions its very dark tan isnt it and green and bright green and dark green and dark red and normal tan and dark bley and pearl gold in fact its a bit of a mishmash of colours im of two minds about this i kind of prefer the palette to be a bit subtler but i can see that a playset designed for kids isnt going to sell bucketloads all tastefully done in shades of tan with lashings of darkgreen foliage theres a huge amount of dark red in this set which is always a welcome colour but im not convinced it quite works with the 2 shades of tan on offer here on the plus side theres also a huge amount of dark tan in ordinary 2x2 bricks tiles plates and 1x1 and 1x2x3 slopes which is great for anyone wanting to stock up lets take a closer look ill do this roughly in order of the build itself a the big scary face this is a simple fun build and very effective at projecting menace at the temple entrance it actually detaches very easily from the temple as pictured on the box art to allow easier access to the inside the eyes are flickfire missiles with scary faces hair conveniently providing ammo refills should you run out all in all from me b the back spin the skelly head and stone steps appear  we havent seen this feature in a while nice to get these pieces in dark bley a conquistador hides under the stairs  this is a bit useless as the stairs cant fully extend while hes there  moving right a trapdoor  what could possibly be behind it answer not much really a little red stair i really like these 2 stickers though  very intricate the staircase leads to what i like to think of as the crystal skull transmogrification chamber now i know nothing about the movie except that its supposed to be have a kind of 50s bmovie plot rumoured to feature look away spoilerhaters aliens these weird creepy gold chairs look made from the bones of aliens if you ask me with their strange vertebrae and silver claws it wouldnt surprise me if bringing these aliens back to life was part of the plot of the movie hence the crystal skull i guess well find out may 22 in any case transforming aliens clearly like a disco whirl as when you pull the handle the whole of this assembly spins giddily around a very clever and simple trick  its basically just a wheel under the platform but the effect is great also under here is a bottomless pit stickered i would very much expect a villian to be thrown down it at some point so do you come here often i dont know who designed this club these chairs are really uncomfortable nb i am really really over those pearl gold 1x2 roof corner slopes which started popping up in the 2006 castle range infected exoforce and have now spread here can we please have these in a different colour or a different pearl gold piece pretty please  c left tower looking from the front a small tower with a trans clear gem d right tower waterfall with booby trap i like the sticker its very cartoony which fits with the set somehow when you turn the wheel flick fire missiles spray out and hit whoever is on the stairs both towers have a trap where if you move the skull another one pops out from the dragon mouth e central turret thing this thing is kind of annoying and doesnt really sit or work well its kind of like a laser beam sending messages to space i guess as the central dome rises the two plates peel away i find it is a little bit tight to work smoothly and the two plates doesnt really sit well together at the top maybe i just need to rebuild it im sure this will also be explained in the movie f final trap  the stair that isnt there the final trap is at the front  as indy goes down the staircase you can push the red heads and all the 1x8 bley bricks come tumbling down simple and works well g alternate view heres how it looks as pictured on the box with the head removed as you can see this allows better access to the centre of the temple as you can see sadly there is nothing actually interesting there except a staircase to the turret and 2 dark tan slopes which are just stuck there and look a little out of place i mean come on everything else has a splash of dark red and gold your destination nowhere part 4 in conclusion so after all those endless pics what about the set itself consas a playset 7627 doesnt quite make sense admittedly the traps that are there are welldesigned and unobtrusive on the other hand theres a great big whopping entrance at the front  but i wasnt sure if the figs are supposed to sneak in through the backdoor and go up the spiral staircase and past the waterfall as shown in the box art or if they were meant to end up in the golden skull room the middle area doesnt really connect with anything nor does the giant space turret it may be that some of these questions are answered in the film but whereas with 7624 7625 and 7626 i could at least picture a story myself eg with river chase is fairly obvious whats happening  a chase down a river with a croc and a communist staking them out the temple set is a little all over the place the design feels a little off to me  not really bad but not really great either pros on the plus side the natives and crystal skulls themselves are great at 900 pieces this is also a great parts pack for dark tan dark red plant pieces gold oddments etc i especially love the baseplate in that shade i like the overall shape of the temple  a big staircase with secret nooks and crannies the build is reasonably interesting and there are some clever tricks with the traps but upon reflection i shouldnt have to sell this set  it should be able to sell itself as i said before im a huge fan of dark mysterious old temples so for that i have to give it some love it reminds me of the big old adventurers sets and the whiff of nostalgia is itself a powerful intoxicant however for the price lego is selling it in australia europe canada i couldnt recommend it as a mustbuy for full price when the smaller sets in this series are themselves so good review done  woo edited by imperialshadows 01 june 2008  1159 am	positive

thanks sveltecorps i was really hoping that the conquistador helmet would end up being silver in the final set but i suppose its good to know that the helmet is being porduced again anyway and is the armour the skellie is wearing pearl gold thanks again i look forward to the rest of the review edit the dark tan baseplate is in fact very nice although the fact that you have to put stickers on it is a real downer but i suppose it is good for those who want it plain edited by tinypiesrus 01 may 2008  0219 am	positive

brilliant review and great pics thanks hmmmmm i would actually like one of these now where before i was unsure	neutral
thanks for the great review sveltecorps ive been wanting to see this set in detail since it debuted at the conventions i have to say that on the one hand i agree that the minifigures the crystal skulls and the colors are great i even like the waterfall but on the other i kind of think that the set itself is a disappointment it looks like they tried to accommodate design and playability needs but really didnt come through on either so as you pointed out the mid section doesnt really fit in with the other parts and the trap sequence doesnt really flow either but perhaps your right and all will be answered in the film i was surprised at just how empty the temple looked in the photo taken from above they really should have gone the extra mile and made the temple look more like a temple and not worry so much about the action features eh but so it goes but i too am a sucker for tombs and temples so i wont be able to pass it up archaeology on	negative
damn youve convinced me to get it now thanks for the review tan is my favourite colour in lego batbrick away	neutral
thanks sveltecorps for the great review if its out in aussie then it should hopefully be reaching nz soon i cant wait this looks like a great set for me at least i too am a great fan of spooky old temples they are such fun i love the look of the base plate but the stickers dont look all that great i wish they printed it like they always used too i have to get this set and the other ones too thanks again you have brightened this sad day	positive

i know that alex54 had already reviewed this set beforehand but i wanted to give my 2 cents it is really more like 150 on this set i bought from toys r us on friday guess what the price had not been increased by a dollar like all other sets  this is my first review of a set ever dont be too mean 1 box it captures the potential i dont know how the scene plays out for now  action of the scene nicely and is very pleasing good job tlc  on the back it shows some of the play features of the set and a net little comic indiana jones seems to be surprisingly calm considering that he is about to be captured under a net and attacked by a snake the thing he fears most 1a comic not much to say on this 1b screw up at the top of the box both russian guards have the same grining face in the set one has the generic bad guy face from 7620 2 contents the box opens up to reveal a quartet of bags an uncrumpled manual yay and a sticker sheet boo 2a dss yoda said every for of rambling imaginable about this accursed item i have nothing to say meh 3 minifigs the only thing that has not really been discussed about the figs that you get in this set is that marion has a slightly new torso 4 parts of interest when i opened up the baggies these were the components that grabbed my attention a dark green alligator a net piece that i know has appeared in sets before hand  i needed it for a moc i am working on some raft part that is probably very old a ladder with two pairs of hindges and a dark brown version of this part 4 build amphibious vehicle this i one of the more enjoyable builds of the new line but that is just my opinion you start of with some thing very simple by the end of the next page it starts to bulk up more detail beginning to look like a car 4a build rear attachment bulk it up and add taillights done slap it on to the main vehicle 4b build front attachment i am running out of things to say bulk it up add some detail add a gun and headlights and attach to the rest to get the completed vehicle add stickers i honestly think that the amphibious vehicle looks much better with the stickers than without 5 build boat this build goes by rather quickly and adds to the playability of the final set base apply clamps add more to engine build more detail and a gun base finished boat plus stickers i love how lego slips in the product number into their stickers 6 build tree fort this is the weakest part of the whole set but i find my self liking it more and more for some odd and inexplicable reason that tan 6x6 will most likely see use in a pirate themed vinigete soon not mine  install netlauncher you spend the next two pages building this and putting it on a tree branch that is an ugly mix of brown dark brown and frown our commie friend seems to like coffee a lot second branch 3rd a wee bit to much on the coffee there dont you think final step the only redeeming value of this section is how well the net launcher works fantastically the rest is just utter fail 7 spare parts very little in terms of what is left over finished set all in all this set is a fine build and an excellent parts pack for dark green components i recommend this set strongly despite its few weaknesses	positive

nice review although you need to use the macro settingaka the flower setting for better pics are you using a digital camera you really need macro the idea is turn it on and hold down on the take picture button halfway until the pic focuses then press it down all the way to take the pic im glad this one also comes with the new uzi i wanted an extra	neutral
goodthorough review some of the pictures were a bit blurry though	neutral
thank you for the nice indepth review i have to say lego did a good job on the amphibious vehicle ps if you need photo taking help pm me and i can give you some handy tips	positive
nice review wilhelm screamer very thorough the pictures are a little dark and blurry though i made a tutorial here for amateur photography tips i also edited your first post to include a link to alexs review great job	neutral
very good for a first review i bought this set and jungle duel at target the other day i was going to wait and buy them when i go to downtown disney this summer but how could i pass up saving four bucks that i can spend on storeexclusives  and i have to say i absolutely love them the amphibious vehicle dont they call it a duck in the movie is definitely my favorite lego vehicle ive ever built everything about it is wonderful the size the colour scheme and its accurate to the one in the movie and irina spalkos hair is to die for on a side note i dont get why they made marions arms white in the set the shirt underneath her vest in the movie is obviously blue i switched the arms out for light blue ones and it looks a lot better and it makes marions eyes look great ryan	positive
an extremely thorough review  you definitely do this set justice looks like a fairly interesting set and that comes from someone who isnt particularly a fan of lego indiana jones tom	positive
what a fantastic set im overwelmed with feelings of nostalgia by seeing this review the playability factor of this set is as high as it can be thanks for making and sharing this awesome review 	neutral
thanks for this review you have reviewed my most favourite town set of all times i am so happy to own this one i actually is a story to go along with it in the summer of 1998 i went on holiday with my parents to the country of luxembourg in the city of wiltz we encountered a small toystore which still had this set for sale 9 years after the release i did not had the sufficient amount of money to buy the set and had to leave it at the store i was practically in tears four years later we passed through luxembourg and i remembered the city and the store we made a detour and stopped by the same store every other old set was sold the only one remaining was this one i bought it immediately and treasured it ever since i use the baseplates a lot in my cities they serve well as roads with parking spaces next to them this was the first set i owned which had the huge 6x24 plates in them i remember my surprise when seeing plates of such enourmous lenght i recently made an entire racetrack together with this set and to promote myself i will place a link here	positive
metalandi thanks for this wonderful lovely review i enjoyed myself very much when i am looking through at the lovely pictures i must admit this is what i called a real classic race prix i miss those cute sweet little race cars which is able to contain a minifig furthermore this set offers 4 race cars and 13 minifigures in addition if town collectors remember the car number tiles are printed instead of using stickers this is the other set i owned which holds the similarity above 6381 motor speedway overall great review simonwillems on may 9 2008 0220 am said i recently made an entire racetrack together with this set and to promote myself i will place a link here i saw your entire racetrack it looks real exciting and i love your layout real nice edited by whitefang 15 may 2008  0956 am	neutral

adiksalego on may 15 2008 0829 pm said wow simon you got two yummy id be happy if i had two no its just one but extended with the baseplate of 6381 mentioned above and some more plates and small fences alex54 on may 15 2008 1020 pm said looking at the pics ive got a question  is the rescue rig trailer one piece or is it brick build it is one piece not even the wheels come off this trailer is always ready to go and was only used in a slecect number of sets	neutral
thank you very much for that fine review of a really classic and wonderful racing set and i really wish that tlc would continue with showing some great alternative models on the back of the boxes just imagine on	neutral
awesome review batbrick i dont see any appeal at all really in this set but thats okay as i want to stick to castle anyway the car is the best part imo which you can get in a different set with another cool car and for a cheaper price but the main downfall to this set is the fact that the trucks trailer is half blown up and the survivors are magically staying inside and not being sucked right out of there as you have mentioned i would have thought tlc would at least included some sort of cover that you could take on and off easily kind of like the modular buildings having said all that though the front of the truck does look incredibly cool and those minifigs are sweet too bad they all have flesh tone printed on them so while this may not be my set of choice i can see the appeal well really i cant but its just my opinion im sure there are plenty others who would love to scoop this set up peace	negative
warning this reply may contain several minor movie spoilers if you havent yet seen the movie and want it to be a complete surprise do not read batbrick on may 10 2008 0605 am said but it is cruncher block his lady driver taejo that really shine look at those awesome suits the cool faces taejo has a ripped shirt i was originally skepitcal about the driver figure—i like the head but i was trying to figure out why they put in a female minifig with no hairpiece after having seen the movie i now understand why crunchers driver is a fairly manly looking woman and most of the lego hairpeices would make the minifig look too girly for the character  now that i know why taejos shirt is ripped up i dont mind the bits of fleshie color that are printed on it but i do wish they would make some of the new torsos a little more headcolour agnostictheres no real reason why cruncher and his driver couldnt have had ties that came all the way up to their necks instead of having those little wedges of flesh showing through loose collars yeah they are lowlevel mafioso type scum but they arent complete slobs batbrick on may 10 2008 0605 am said front view the new windshields are fantastic they are indeed very nice its the main reason i started looking at the speed racer sets in the first place batbrick on may 10 2008 0605 am said while a very cool car it is rather silly of tlc to give us the exact same one we got in the smaller set i didnt get the smaller set with this car so im still happy but it is a bad marketing move i think the error they made was in the smaller set though in the movie the only time we see crunchers semi is when hes being chased by racer x racer x and taejo do end up on the same team for a cross country rally race along with speed of course so i guess thats where they were going by putting those two together in the smaller set but it would have been much more interesting for them to have made up a set with taejo and one of the cars from the very goofy comic bookgimmicky teams they are racing against especially since one of the teams that is chasing taejo specifically is a bunch of armywannabee loonies—im sure more people would have loved some sort of darksand green racer with one of the ij soviets at the wheel than another racer x to summarize two racer xs is bad but it is the smaller set that should have been changed imho batbrick on may 10 2008 0605 am said annoyingly enough this part opens up to shoot a pointless rubber projectile thus blowing the front part open and launching itwell not far really as much as i normally dont like the stupid techic launcher thing and would rather not see it in a set ever again although one of these days i will make a giant multilauncer rig out of them just for fun at least there is a reason for it to be in this set as crunchers semi has a missile launcher in the front end of it in the movie i think youre supposed to lift the panel that hides the missile before launching it similar to the way that panels slide out of the way on the semi cab to allow for firing in the movie batbrick on may 10 2008 0605 am said and now for the most disappointing part  step three the trailer thats right almost the entire thing is open even the filled in side has holes id certainly be cared to be back there one bumpy hill and back you go im gonna chock this up to the standard lego philosophy of playset rather than model design for a lot of things the semi rig and raver xs car are the models the trailer is the playset seeing as how the trailer is crunchers mobile office rather finely appointed with lots of paintings and his pirahna babies in their tank behind his desk and the intent seems more or less to have a playest bit in order for kids to reenact the scene from the movie im not going to give them too much grief over this they tried to capture the basic bits of the movie set which we see mostly from the inside during the movie and translate it into a playset type environment that being said i do wish the back walls were more solid as i see no reason for there to be gaps in the back wall when the front wall or the fourth wall as the case may be here is already conspicously absent batbrick on may 10 2008 0605 am said there are some pluses too though like the ridiculously awesome minifig paintings ill be using for wayne manor also note the control on crunchers desk that when turned turns the gun at the bottom its an alright feature could have been a little better but its such a minor bit of this scene in the movie that i can see why they didnt spend too much time and effort on it it would have been nice to have more paintings though had the back wall been more complete and i like your idea of how to use them   batbrick on may 10 2008 0605 am said and though im not a massive fan of stickers this is just too cool the little aquarium is very simple but very clever using a printed piece between two clear windows to create the illusion of a tank definately a feature which is not showcased nearly well enough on the box art since it is one of the major features of this set in the movie its nice to see it translate rather well into brick batbrick on may 10 2008 0605 am said design 25  pretty poor considering the best part is available in a cheaper set and only the front part of the truck looks cool but still not truly awful that may be a bit harsh but not much given what ive said further up this post but it probably only deserves a 3 at best so im not realy going to quibble the point  i still think that racer x should be exclusive to this set and a different car should be in the smaller set with taejo which would have improved the cachet for this set overall batbrick on may 10 2008 0605 am said price 25  overpriced easily but rogue shadow is worse truethis should have ideally been about a 30 set especially given the general awesomeness of the ij race for the stolen treasure set unless they made the trailer a bit more detailed better back wall perhaps some drop down gun ports like in the movie or at put least one or more of crunchers goons in the set then maybe i could agree more with the msrp on that note if i remember correctly from my visit to my local tru yesterday in search of the new ij sets since local targets seem determined not to get them in stock yet they had this set on sale for around 35 along with an offer for a coupon good for 750 towards the purchase of a ticket to the movie with any speed racer toy purchase over 25 i may be wrong on the sale price but i know the ticket offer was there so if you havent seen the movie yet and are interested in this set tru may be the place to go right now to get both at a slightly cheaper price batbrick on may 10 2008 0605 am said fun 45  the mere concept of such an open truck kept me playing with this baby for hours so you did enjoy the playest aspect of the trailer even though you didnt care for the designlooks like they didnt do too badly then on what they wanted out of that bit  batbrick on may 10 2008 0605 am said overall im really glad i bought it as the minifigs are fantastic and the paintings and fish tank are cool its fun stupid and downright ridiculous but while not a great set by any means certainly isnt as bad in the brick as it looks in photos i was actually thinking about going and getting this set now that ive seen the movie and i understand what the heck is going on here more your review has definately added an additional impetus to that notion my pocketbook does not thank you	neutral
thanks for that fine review batbrick the most interesting part of the set for me are the neat mfs the trailer looks really pretty skeletal however it´s a nice little play set and´ll fit its purpose i guess	neutral
nice review good pictures thanks i think i may get a couple of the smaller sets as i think these will become collectors sets in years too come not sure this range will be that popular love the minifigs though	neutral
thanks for the great review it seems like the most awesome part of the set is the sticker sheet which is a reversal of the usual situation	positive
i bought this set a few days ago and agree with what you have said about it the trailer is fun to play with but just so plain overall great review	positive

great review as always although i know you dont take many pictures in your reviewsimho  but can we see a little more about the tumbler is that little windshield down near the bottom front a third seat what is in the framework of the back behind the cockpit i know theres a blunt shooter and flick fire missiles but is it all framework	neutral
thanks a lot for the review brickbitz i really love this set sure the figs are annoyingly not new but the ice cream truck is fantastic and the tumbler is a marvel of black slopes i see now that it is far too huge though i reckon i will either keep it that way as a mega tumbler mod it to become another battank keep it as a model tumbler or pull it apart and use the bits to make a tumbler like wetwires awesome one love those popsicles though and those wheels are very nice so overall as a loyal batfan i love the set even though it couldve been better batbrick away	positive
a nice review of an interesting set thanks brickbitz a great new batman a funny ice cream truck and a pretty detailed tumbler and although i wish that vehicle would be just a bit smaller i almost wonder that it´s not even bigger compared to tlc´s other batvehicles and well the interior could be better too	positive
brickbitz on may 16 2008 1141 pm said ill get some set up tomorrow in better light to be honest there isnt a lot to see most of it is just basic technic blocks underneath with all the slopes built up on top some more pics of the tumbler	neutral
hey brickbitz i love how your review is not biased 10 ups in the end you said overall slightly disappointing most people post reviews only with praise but im glad you take both sides  enjoyed the review just like others have thanks so much	neutral
general grievous reviewed by dunamis set 10186 1085 pieces 8995 from lego shop  home build time 35 hours it is the start of summer here in california and along with the weekly deluge of new action films we start to see some of the next wave of star wars lego sets the latest offering from our favorite building toy company is none other than the infamous general grievous no doubt you all know the story of grievous two parts technic and one part human and his hatred of the jedi follow along as we get a closeup view of the mighty general no doubt the observant will wonder why i purchased this set from shop  home instead of my trusty lego store in glendale well it’s really as simple as two things i’ve been traveling a lot and didn’t have time to drive to the store to get it and gas is now 4gallon and i would likely spend more in gas than the 9 shipping cost to get it to me so there you have it the box a gigantic box much larger than expected held the mighty general we’re back to the perforated tabs on the side and two stickers on the front that let the box lift open inside we have 17 bags two manuals and three stickers on a relatively small sticker sheet the manuals the manuals are not terribly thick in fact the second manual is noticeably thinner than the first they come in at 75 and 31pages interesting to note on the back we see the next and more interesting wave of sets later this summer nothing new to report on the manuals as they provide the lego standard of high quality and features we expect  piece callouts  models divided into sections  large images  page numbers since there were links posted to the pdf files of the instructions online i’m sure you can all get an idea of the manual and the parts inventory however for those of you without access to the internet here are photos of the parts inventory pages random manual image features page the pieces the short answer is you get lots and lots of little pieces in white gray and black plus some big pieces in white gray and black mixed in the set is a fair amount of oddball pieces like minifig tools jedi hood and trans yellow dome fear not despite the eclectic collection of parts it all comes together in the end not unlike a typical day at work for me… it is probably worth noting again that there is a heavy amount of technic parts and pieces here the build the build starts off with a rather indepth build of the stand in which general grievous stands on once you think you are done you keep adding on to this rather solid base i bet there are 250 pieces just in the base alone it is quite nice when you get done with it though and really adds to the display i’m glad lego didn’t skimp on the base as it completes the model once you get through all that the rest of the build is a real thumbbruiser anyone who has built a decent size technic set knows the feeling of your thumbs being sore when you are done you get the same effect here it is actually a fun build and i really liked seeing how the designers used all the various pieces to recreate a fairly accurate model of grievous the model is built from the ground up as seen in a few of the progress shots here is what is left over the design the design is quite good and is very accurate some might be disappointed that since this is a technic set we don’t have more articulation in the shoulders and have the ability to separate two arms into four as seen in the movie however it would seem the real intent is for display and not functionality here is a shot of the torso and the detail involved here are grievous’ organs careful observers will note that my model is lacking two “arrow” stickers from the two white chest pieces i failed to see these on the sticker sheet and only grabbed the large grievous sticker so note that there are actually three stickers and not one chest protector and respirator head and arms i was a little disappointed that we got two yellow blades and no green blades on the lightsabers note how all the lightsabers have different hilts which is a nice touch here are some shots of the completed model with a few other sets shown for scale he is actually pretty tall you have the option to remove the top two arms and put in shoulder plates if you so desire detail on the back overall thoughts i’ve been saying for a few years that we should have a technic grievous set and we finally got one designed more as a model and not a fully functional swooshable figure grievous is a tad flimsy you won’t want him to veer too far off his massive and sturdy base it would have been nice to have is cape with him like the technic vader set i do like the size of the model and it is impressive to look at lego star wars system fans will likely want to think twice before purchasing but technic and ucs fans should be satisfied final rating 75 build 810 very good – fun relatively quick build technic fans will be more pleased than others design 810 very good – some nice snot and technic techniques a bit flimsy but the base is kind of cool parts 710 a mixed bag of stuff probably can’t get too many diverse builds from this except for other robot type models price 710 just ok – a bit stiff at 90 usd for a nice display model with limited functionality as always let’s hear your thoughts and feedback	positive
thanks so much dunamis for your awesome review  yeah i think tlc miss the cape it would be cool to own one but when we were talking of the 2008 sets around july of last year i can remember someone said it would come with cape finally is a little dissapoint tlc miss it  edited by darkrebellion 16 may 2008  0720 pm	negative
deinonychus on may 16 2008 0921 pm said hey dunamis think you can get a straighton shot of the face the red pieces inside the eye sockets are topped with transgreenishyellow studs which make his face look eerily alive and very close to his screen appearance its a nice little detail that seems to not show through on pictures ive seen of the set the legs are a little wobbly im scared that hell be leaning too far forward in about 5 years sure ill get a few photos tonight and post them the eyes are a nice effect you are right about the legs as the model does wobble a little i forgot to mention that the base does turn which is another nice feature	positive
nice review dunamis  i built it two weeks ago on the legoworld speedbuild in oslo and didn´t have time to get the feel during that crazy race i agree with you that the base is nice  sturdy makes it stand real still  i´m looking forward on your next score four eyes arms on copmike	positive

thanks for that fine review dunamis i really like that set gg´s an interesting and well designed movie character and that lego version of him´s indeed well done and very detailed and although i would wish for a some more functional or playable  feature of move and even splitable arms i guess it´s an already very cool ucs version of that grumpy old kaleesh	positive

thanks very much for the review brickbitz i love this years mars mission line and though this is the weakest set it is still a major improvement the mech is very cool and well made and the commander is one of my favourite alien figs ever the alien ship is pretty good better than last years ones but not extremely good either but i still like the set batbrick away	positive
thanks for the sweet review brickbitz that really is a neat little set that walker is fantastic most likely the best part of the set though the alien craft does also look neat and its cool how it can fold down into aa walker or rather a sentry turret seeing as it cant really move while in that mode still its nice my favourite part is the mini mining robot though so cute peace	positive
thanks for that interesting review brickbitz the alien fighter looks pretty nice nothing special but streamlined and fast nevertheless that transforming feature´s a nice addition for sure and these new flicker missile with its launch apparatus hmm i hope i won´t spend quite some time in search of that little rocket piece however there´s still something i miss with these alien crafts i don´t know i like some more organic looking design and they even come in some nice and different shapes but still perhaps a real space fighter just needs a solid cockpit cool windscreens and controls to satisfy my odd likings that exo suit looks really good and i wonder why it´s a little underrepresented on the box art the jet packspace scooter´s a really good idea and the only thing i hate´re those darned studless technic beams it could look so much better with a studded version of these parts but of course that´s only due to my personal preferences	positive
excellent review as usual brickbitz i really love this set the moonwalker is amazing and the alien craft is really nice too i might get this someday	positive

hi yall guess what happened today when walked into my toys r us in fullerton ca just to buy a simple tiny turbo racer what do i see all the agents sets sitting on the shelf ready for the taking i didnt have too much money with me so i just got 2 of 8631 mission 1 jetpack pursuit its a really cool little set so i thought id review this puppy for you i shall proceed in the order of the instructions so lets get started the minifigs lets begin with the minifigs saw fist and agent chase they are really cool some of the coolest minifigs i have seen in a while i took off saw fists wig  chainsaw so you can see his head and cybernetic arm better here is a back view of saw fist and  surprise agent chase has a double sided head one side with his cool mission face with sunglasses and headset and one with his casual bruce wayne type face note though that it is not really the bruce wayne face his wig btw is mutts hairpiece in black very neat poor saw fist seems to be forced to always drag his chainsaw around for it is way too long to just hang down from his shoulder like a normal arm the snowmobile next up we have the snowmobile a sleek little vehicle with only minor design flaws the container with the jewel is attached to the vehicle by a single stud so it doesnt fall off but is easy to pick up in the pic below you can see the only two tiny design flaws thanks to the exhaust pipes the laser cannon or whatever its supposed to be cant be lowered any further than this also the corners of that slopeish piece that the handle bar rests on are sticking out a little at the sides other than that its pretty well done the jetpack finally there is the jetpack imo a name like autogyropack or something would make more sense but whatever although a little bulky the jetpack is very well designed the rotor can be tilted back and at the lower back of the jetpack there is hook with which you can grab the container with the jewel from the snowmobile what i like best about the jetpack is that although it is attached to the minifig in kinda the same way as that of the riddler this one doesnt rotate around so the agent is being held in place steadily see ya later chainsawcyborgdude stickers this set comes with a surprisingly large sticker sheet the reason is that half of it are extra stickers there are two large agents logos and one inferno logo  perfect for agents mocs there are also a star and a small round sticker portraying the number of the mission the star seems to be part of some kind of game where you collect the stars from all sets on an agents id that you get from the mission 5 set i dont know though if you get any gain from this except for becoming a fullstatus lego agent below you can find the list of parts from this set click here for a better quality pic thats pretty much it i hope you liked this review and will run straight to your next toy store to get one or more of this set this was my very first set review so any questions comments or requests any more pics you want me to take would you like me to exchange the chainsaw with something else or do you want me to try the agents new hairpiece out on another fig if so just tell me see ya edited by oky wan kenobi 25 june 2009  0821 pm	positive
thats a great review for your first one i think the jet pack if far to bulky it could do with some minimising but that’s life i assume that you can’t fit a standard hand in the chainsaw arms are the hole would be to large but would you be so good as to confirm this for me overall i quite like the jet ski and the ability to lower the arms to much doesn’t both me how much was it just so i can get an idea of the price finally thanks for posting this review so quickly	neutral
thanks for the great review oky wan the two vehicles look quite nice for a small set and the minifigs look great the two sided head is nice although it wouldve been nice if it was a new head rather than the standard frowning face the cyborg looks good nice and cartoony i like the printing on his back the belt on the hips should be useful not to mention the robotic hand i assume that anything that fits into a 1x1x1 cylinder can fit in it i hope so thanks again oky any chance you can get any more sets	positive
thanks for the review im looking forward to some of the new parts and ideas in this line the figures look great the actual sets themselves dont really appeal though	neutral
huhm  i like the idea of the agentid  but offcourse all they want with that is that you buy all six sets  but it can be a good idea for children they wouldnt think of hey they get all money only because i have a little card with stars or something well not to rant i think its good also can you make that name yourself maybe set 5 comes with a extra stickersheed with all letters that would be nice agent rupee a very nice review oky wan kenobi rupee	neutral
thanks guys i really tried to make it a good first review now to answer your questions the robot arm can fit ef robot claws and anything that a minifig can hold in his hand or that would fit into a 1x1x1 cylinder so normal minifig hands are too small to fit tlg is using the robot claw idea for the main villain of the agents line do you still want me to try it out and take pics the price was 1099 usd at the tru i bought it at i bet itss be a dollar less on sh and im sorry but i probably wont get any more sets any time soon i have to save my money for all the other good set that are to come but if i would get another set it would just be the one with the helicopter and the allsilver car if anyone gets this set can heshe please review it thanks any other questions i can answer for you guys edited by oky wan kenobi 18 may 2008  0859 am	neutral
i kind of like the set as said it has a very cartoonish style to it so im guessing the kids are going to love it and as a parent ill love it if the construction isnt to fragile  ill probably be getting a few for myself but only as parts pack copmike on may 18 2008 1129 am said and the excaustpipe is a new peace also i think yeah and its all over this years releases from what ive seen so far its found in racers speed racers mars mission and exoforce sets i just wish that instead of a 2x1 plate with an exhaustpipe in each end they would have made it an 1x1 plate with a single exhaust that would have been a lot more useful	positive
omg omg omg im coming to the us in just under two weeks really hope i see them somewhere does anyone know what ny times square toys r us is like for new sets	neutral
i love the way the bad guy has a special attachment on the jewel case just to allow the agent to grab it with his hook its like the two of them sat down beforehand and drew up the plans for the vehicle together cyborg ok and then ill make my getaway in the special snowmobile and you can follow me agent and ill scoop up the jewel and return it to foil your plan cyborg perfect see you tuesday dr s	positive
good review thanks oky wan hmm although i really like the villain not just the new arm i think the color is very villanous as all bondvillains with class have minions in uniforms its even possible to fill out their numbers with exoforce grunts of the same color im not that hot for the agent himself his uniform nah it doesnt even look like clothes just give the man a suit or some nifty leather i think ill try to grab some sets from the agents line just for the new parts to begin with mocs may follow who knows when they are available in stores here in sweden havent seen them yet though indiana jones just got here so there might be some further waiting for me now i want to see reviews of the other sets 	negative
hmm interesting set great review i might pick this one up for the wonderful parts vbbn	neutral
what a lovely set thanks for that fine review oky wan kenobi the mfs´re wonderful that helipack looks solid and well done and i especially like the slightly asymmetrical design of the neat snowmobile a very playable little set for sure and the most interesting part´s for sure that new cool mf arm	positive
yay oky wan wow the agents line is looking good so far the jetpack is pretty nice and the minifigs my dad was in portland just yesterday and if id have called an hour sooner he might have been able to get to the tru	neutral
thanks for the great review oky wan at first i didnt think i liked the agents sets but the more i see them the better i think they look i will definitely pick up 1 or 2 of the sets i really like the jet pack and the figs look great that double face is very nice tlg should make more figs with these faces in my opinion	neutral
great reviewthank youvery much i think this line is much more promising than most orginally thought it would be im onmy way to see ifican find the big rig right now	neutral
thank you for the nice review it has some big pieces i dont like but the minifigs are good	positive
that would be great i still wonder why the instructions arent up yet though	neutral
mmm this set looks amazing lovely pieces and i actually like the minifig faces that jaw helmet is cool aswel  are those stickers on the crocodile heads or is it printed	positive
thanks for the review this set is wonderful u love the two dark green crocodiles and awesome minifigs especially break jaw that bike is awesome and the base like all agents sets comes with great pieces like the barbed wire orange anything leafy pieces and brown log pieces thanks for the review ill definitely get this one batbrick away	positive

cantresistthe unibrowmust obey	neutral
nice set im definately gonna pick it up when i see it i like the design of the base and it comes with lots of usefull an neat pieces	positive
wow thanks for the great review sirnadroj the overall set is what attracted me in the first place that elevated hut and swampy setting just sucked me right in it all looks really nice to me a definite buy that agents head would make a great indy for those opposed to fleshies and that monobrow i mean villain guy looks very er well the monobrow is unique thought i noticed the suit looks a bit skin tight in the crotchal area dont look at me like that you saw it too anyway the helmets the best part about the villain great for warhammer 40000 orks peace	positive
very useful pieces that new agent head i think its new could be used for a gordon freeman minifigure and break jaws head for otis the security guard when you take his donuts away from him	positive
i always joked that our house would have a moat around it with mechanical alligators now i can build the house in lego thanks sirnadroj for the review and pictures this is definitely my favorite agents set	positive
great review and a good confirmation of exactly what i suspected this is a parts line for me much like exoforce before it this will be the theme i pick up when im out of other things or its on sale plus those dark green alligators bring tears of joy to an old pirate alice on may 22 2008 1243 am said i always joked that our house would have a moat around it with mechanical alligators you were joking what about the monkeys and the miniature golf course dont ruin my dreams 	positive
thanks for the review i the bike and the bad guys helmet	positive
agentrick57 on may 23 2008 0917 am said why do all of the reviews that we have for agents sets have the agents getting hurt is this a new trend no its an old trend and its because villains are cooler actually it could be longsimmering resentment towards the nothighlyregarded alpha team dino attack sets bubbling forth see dr luckys hilarious post here for an example of what i mean im sure the new agents will learn to fight back soon	negative
does anyone know if the turbo car chase is out yet	neutral
ive copied another thing because i dont know how i must do a review and i cant do long reviews set ref 7884 name the buggy the escape of mr freeze number of minifigs 2 number of pieces 76 price 1395€ front of the box back of the box the comic very close whats in the box without the set the set with the box the time wow this is a funny set but its a little expensive and a little to small but i like some pieces like the fire and the mr freeze gun and the best of all here it comes no stickers thats one of the greatest things but i understand why lego has made this set some people want batman lego and they are most of the time expensive and the mr freeze set is also expensive but this set not if you want more pics you msut ask for exaple for the minifigs or the mr freeze and the blaster ask it and this is my first review and sorry for the great and blurry pics the final verdict 7510 figures 810 playability 610 build 710 pieces 7510	positive
grevious on may 23 2008 0954 am said indead the only reason to get this set is if you couldnt afford the batcave back in 2006 and want a mr freeze fig for a cheap price and anyone who did get that kit really have no reason whatsoever to get this ill get it i admit the vehicles are extremely poorly designed i mean really poorly designed but the mrfreeze fig is fantastic and i would buy two of this set just for him as his head and gear are very useful for mocing it also comes with some nice pieces like the grappling hook little wheels exhaust pieces and such still a pretty bad set build wise but it has atleast inspired me to make my own batbuggy thanks for the review theriddler appreciated batbrick away	positive
as others have said this really is a set for those that didnt buy the batcave thus i want it the cars are pretty horrid though thanks for the review theriddler	neutral
like many others ill buy this just for mr f quickly recycle the parts and pretend this set never existed the flame detail is indeed terrible the bat is back  and hes flatulent this third batwave isnt really doing anything for me ill get the penguin set as well for pretty much the same reason  although the sub on that is pretty cool  but skip the others maybe batbrick can make us all nice altmocs to improve these sets thanks for the review though	negative
pretty nice review for a first time theriddler next time though if your camera has it use the macro function little flower icon and perhaps a tripod that should get rid of any blur and provide you with better pictures apart from that a good little review keep up the good work	neutral
thanks for the reveiw the figs are bloody great but those cars are a bit well ill put it blantly retarded although they shall be good after some modding and whats with that grapple hook does it even have a rope so i guess batman will hokk it to mr freeze so his ride looks more ugle anyway can you pleese take some pics of the figs	neutral
thats a great set itd be even better if it were sold as two separate little cars they remind me of the dozens of little lego cart vehicles i got as a kid those were always fun quick builds that resulted in lots of cool play i think this set is aimed more at kids and in that respect its a pure winner it doesnt hurt that you can get freeze and the newly designed batman both in this set for a reasonable price	positive

thank you the riddler  for this highly informative review despite the fact that i still consider it to be one of the weakest sets in all batman line i guess that now i may even get more than one of these for the same reasons as batbrick  good day gentlemen 	neutral
thanks the penguin and more pics on monday	neutral
thanks for the review this set was poorly design when i first heard of it i think it was like a car with a much better design than this one i think i will get it for the minifigs	negative
thanks for the extra pics i dont think you could have gone into much more detail than that nice pics of the joker van too will you do a review of that one batbrick away	positive
thanks for the review i dont know if i would get this set though the cars are not that great and the price is a little too high	negative
i got this yesterday and built it this morning apart from the figs it is very crappy mr freezes buggy is ok but the bat buggy is easily the worst vehicle ive seen for years colours are all over the place the grappling hook feels cheaply made the inclusion of those odd pearl silver parts which have been in the exoforce sets seem especially random here the terrible bionicle flame piece its the first lego vehicle ive built where ive immediately had the urge to disassemble it and pretend i never bought it really i only got it for mr freeze so i shouldnt complain but still its a real step backwards the comparable catwoman dragster set was heaps better the penguin sub is sweet though thanks for the review anyway	negative
coming in at around 50 us turbo car chase is one of the bigger of the new agents sets a big box with a helicopter car and gate in it seems like a winner but how good is it really and is it worth the cash lets start with the minifigs this set comes with a standard inferno henchman spy clops and agent chase the henchman is you basic lego criminal type with a gun and a jumpsuit nothing real groundbreaking here spy clops on the other hand is very cool for technically half of a minifig his head has a neat electronic goggle print and the rest of him is a torso mounted onto a set of six legs made from exoforce robot arms the whole thing is really well done and neat as hell agent chase turbo car chase  seems to have a standard agent body and a doubleprinted face with one side a sunglasses and headset print the other face is a determined agent look the set also includes a laptop with doctor inferno wallpaper the laptop is a new piece and works like the lego books that are in a lot of harry potter sets molding on the keyboard is really well done and the thing can be held by a minifig along either corner but not in the middle and not while closed the gate in the set is nothing revolutionary by itself and i sort of get the feeling that it was included to drive up the piece count and the set price point that being said there are some things to like here for instance the gate has four wheels of barbed wire attached to it the barbed wire is new and makes me want to start building some world war i trench mocs the rest of the gate is fairly big and it has a handy ramp attached so that vehicles can roll through it easily the main feature of the gate is a sound brick its much better then lego sound and light units of the past when the gate is opened it depresses a button and an alert klaxon blares that sounds every bit like a prisonbeak in progress the triggering action works surprisingly well and its pretty much for this feature alone that im not going to immediately break the gate back down and add it to my parts bin the designers did make an effort to create more then just a fence though a nice control panel connected to a big spotlight crowns the piece and a pair of cameras watch the opening its really hard to mess up a lego helicopter and this set is no exception the inferno chopper is a nicely proportioned and well built machine it looks properly menacing and has the uniform orange and black of other inferno property its armed with a set of four technic pegs cleverly used as guns on outriding mounts as well as a pair of the newerstyle flickfire missiles i personally dont care for flickfiring missiles but these look decent enough and seem to stay put so i really cant complain about them along the fuselage are a pair of intake pieces that ive never seen before and im guessing are new theyre pretty well designed and will come in handy for mocing down the road the action feature of the aircraft is the wench system this is very different then other lego wenches in that you build the entire mechanism and housing you can then use it to raise spy clops up and down from the bottom of the chopper using the rotor now this also keeps you from sitting there and just giving the rotor repeated spins to simulate flight im not too thrilled with that but there are a hundred other lego helicopters out there with fully rotating rotors so i guess i can let it by just this once as youd suspect the bottom of the cockpit is completely open which makes this a vehicle pretty much solely for spy clops sorry henchman but there is plenty of room beneath the body to attach a plate with some seats on it to accommodate another pilot without drastically altering the design or even removing existing pieces the turbo car is a slick little honey of a lego car and the silver pieces that make up the body work contribute a lot to that fact the front license plate appears to be an exofore code brick but it also hides the activation lever for the passenger ejector seat the seat works about as well as the spruce goose which is to say not well at all but here its the thought that counts the interior of the car is really well done theres even a radar screen for keeping track of pesky helicopters but the bondlike features dont end there a lever in the compartment raises pair of guns in the hood and a knob on the rear deploys a quad rocket system with more flickfire missiles this is a car that wont be stopped easily the rear has two cones sticking out id like to think theyre smoke nozzles or oilslick sprayers allinall this is a really good set the car is pure lego vehicle love and looks fantastic the silver pieces are very nice and its a shame lego doesnt use metallic colors in system sets more often there are however a lot of sticker for this set and i know how much that bugs a lot of people i personally like how much detail the stickers add to these sets and dont mind them so much the set also comes with an agents id card for chase which you can put little star stickers on from other sets as you get them its printed on a real nice piece of sturdy plastiboard and would be cooler if you could put your own picture and name on it instead of pretending to be chase sold by themselves the car and chopper would be musthaves all tossed together with the gate sort of makes the set a little less then the sum of its parts and with 498 parts most of them small thats not so hot its only slightly overpriced in my opinion but if you do shell out the money you wont regret it im very comfortable recommending this set to anyone close to perfect but the price and some minor flaws bring it back just a little id say 433 but out of 5 is close enough	positive
chrome cant wait for the review deino	positive
cant wait for the review the car is ly	positive
yay cant wait for your review i plan to get this and the giant truck the brick rat on may 23 2008 0731 pm said 2this set contains the best lego sound brick ever its just begging to be incorporated into my arkham asylum what is a sound brick	neutral
the brick rat on may 23 2008 1031 pm said 1my set came with defective instructions in 2 places pages are missing and duplicates of other pages repeated for instance the car instructions are missing steps 1621 fortunately i was able to make out what pieces went where in the missing steps by studying the illustration in step 22 i hope you have better luck with your instructions everything was just fine with my directions sounds like you just ran into some bad luck there my friend quote 2this set contains the best lego sound brick ever its just begging to be incorporated into my arkham asylum i agree 100 and i didnt even see it had a sound brick until i read this last night usually lego promotes stuff like that pretty loudly on the packaging not here though	neutral
wow thanks deino for this great review i cant wait to get this myself but right now i gotta save for the cw sets the car is with no doubt one of the most mind blowing things tlg has come up with and we can only hope that there will be more models made out of almost only metalic colors the spider cyborg while not as innovative as some of the other cyborgs is a very nice fig and his head will be very usefull for splinter cell mocs and those intake pieces are only relatively new btw they are in almost all of the current 10 racers sets any chance of you taking a pic of a lineup of all the silver parts in this set edited by oky wan kenobi 24 may 2008  1132 pm	positive
i love it  fun playable cool looking and killer minifigs sweet	positive
wow thanks for the great review deino this set is really a must have for me the sound brick seems great the helicopter looks very nice and the car is superb all of the james bond features are really cool though im very interested in how the ejector seat works or doesnt work the car itself is very sleek and full of beautiful silver and the inclusion of the new rims and windshield mean that i wont have to buy many speed racer sets as for the minifigs they all look great especially spyclops though it looks rather easy for him to fall off of his spider legs can you confirm this a great review of a great set thanks deinonychus	positive
thanks deinonychus for another great review i must say i do look forward to people uploading reviews of new sets it really helps me decide if i want it or not if its a good set imo then it adds to the excitement of picking up one myself this i must say is one of those sets the only concern for me like alot of others is the price i will just have to wait and see and continue to look at these photos deinonychus has provided for us so much for thinking the agent line was going to be weak i wonder if the exoforce style code brick number plate is a hint from tlc as to what will replace exoforce at the end of this year jb	positive
thanks for the great review im really liking these agents sets the more i see them the car seems to have alot of features its to bad the the ejection seat doesnt work as well as one would hope oh well makes me want the big rig even more now	positive
looking closely at the red cones on the missles and grey cones on the cars rear these appear to be a new piece note how there is a slight stopper ridge at the base of their top stud interestingly the trans green cones on the helicopter seem to be of the older mould style	neutral
great review deinonychus i really like it can someone record the sound os the sound brickmaybe on youtube i really want to hear it this sets are really cool deino can you post a picture of the agent card it comes with	positive
great review and fantastic pics deinonychus and a big thank you to whoever pointed out that you could use the sound brick for arkham asylum my addled brain didnt make the connection the car is just beautiful and with a good use for the most expensive part of the gate this is on my wish list for sure just have to see how much cash is left over after buying the new death star in a month or two agents has to be the biggest surprise from lego for ages without any pics it sounded soso but theyve done a brilliant job with it love those metallic coloured pieces	positive
great w im totaly gonna buy this set	positive

whitefang on may 25 2008 0614 am said for a single battlepack like this with an attractive reasonable price you obtained a series of 5 skeleton minifigs with tons and tons of useful castle accessories to me its a very very great buy and its a must to stock up for my army building i wish these battlepacks had a reasonable price click here to see the canadian price of these battlepacks 18 dollars thats 6 dollars more than the starwars battlepack yet you get the same amount of lego or less then a starwars battlepack how the megablok does lego price its items  im gonna have to skip this set and a few others that i wanted because of this bloody outrageous back on topic thanks for the detailed review whitefang i also like your little changes to the set they really make this set look better	negative

no offence make this 799 can too expensive to be coming with only a few figures 20 earns you the same amount of figs plus a catapult barricade two horses and a jousting divider	negative
mack on may 26 2008 0130 pm said you cannot say that the battle pack contains the same amount of stuff that the other two sets have and therefore should be priced the same it just seems that lego is ripping off canadian army builders to me if the battle pack contained a small catapult or wall so that it contained about the same amount of stuff that the other sets had it would be fair it seems stupid that you will only get minifigs from one set while you can get about the same amount of minifigs plus a bunch of other stuff from two other equally priced sets that’s why to me these battle packs are a rip off because of what they contain imho the battle packs seem to be only worth about 10 dollars mack i can understand your concern when pricing is concerned pricing is always a big issue for us to determine whether to buy or not to buy a certain set in a particular country pricing varies differently across different countries such as us europe canada australia and etc this is something very hard for us to decide on we cant be sure why tlc placed their pricing strategies this way well i think we should appericate what tlc is trying to do for us by not using price as the only factor to judge whether to buy this set or not at least i am sure there are many of us trying to request for battlepacks to muster armies for their mocs armies collection and etc different people have different judgements towards different sets and different themes i respect your opnion imo lets dont let price be the only determined factor to decide whether to purchase a particular set or not instead consider an array of factors that is offered however i do know that consumers like me and you are always affected by price iamded on may 26 2008 0140 pm said thanks for the review whitefang your additions look great i like your mace much better than the use of a small technic cog your looks much sturdier and that helmet looks really great on skellie soldiers i never thought to use that before very cool indeed iamded i am glad you enjoyed the review and my slight modifications that mace was a much looking weapon it looks much firm than the orignal look the design was inspired from dwarf mine and dwarf mine defender i would not want to have so many troll flags hanging around the nose cone helmet was to give the soliders a whole new look to me it retains the classic look yet it belongs to present theme suitable for my skeleton elite guards	negative

great review for a great set man i loved the adventurers although the new indy sets are good they will never match up to johnny thunder most of all no stickers great review	positive
thanks for this great review voltio i never knew of this set till now and it really looks great i never paid much attention to those aztecincan style sets which i now regret i love the bright colours used here and all the great traps theres so many of them which is exactly what we can expect from an old incan temple like this one im surprised theres no catapult anyway the minifigs included are also great and am i right in guessing those bricks are printed that would be fantastic as they look amazing that boat hull is new to me too although i guess the fact that its mainly in belville sets explains that pretty well thanks again for the sweet review do you have any other jungle adventurers sets you plan to review peace	positive
ive always wanted this set ever since it came out in 99 i have never seen it close up unless you count driving over it in lego racers 2 so thanks for the pictures and the great review voltio on may 26 2008 0443 am said el conde you are too beautiful a woman to be wandering alone in the jungle miss storm please allow me to accompany you gail storm im with johnny and i have a cutlass el conde ill be on my way hehe	positive
a real classic thanks for that nice and funny review voltio a well designed set very playable with a lot of nifty traps a very good use of that raised baseplate and really nice crafts the mf characters´re excellent too and although the color scheme´s great and original especially with all these neat printed pieces it´s perhaps the only part of that set that looks a little out of date today nevertheless the set´s plain charming and shows clearly that tlc don´t need licenses to do some distinct adventurer sets	positive
great review i saw the instructions of this set but never atracted me until now a great set an a excelente review	positive
thanks for reviewing this rare set since it came out in 1999 i have only seen this set in a toystore one single time one single copy as well it was in the summer of 1999 in belgium arlon in a store called maxi toys belgiums tru i think they had the three biggest junglesets for sale there these ancient ruins the set with the beautiful black boat and the zeppelin being into adventurers at that time i had never seen the entire jungle theme not even in a leaflet or catalog and surprised as i was i bought all three sets that was one happy dutch boy in belgium surprisingly the two smallest sets made it in very small quantities to my local stores in holland except for the pontoon plane and small raft which was my very first shop at home order the spiders secret i bought off bl which makes me the proud owner of the entire jungle serie back to the set this was the first time in a long history of collecting lego that i had a deformed piece an 2x8 red plate was twisted i twisted it back and it still serves its purpose i loved the whole steamidea in this jungle serie the two boats both including the one in this set had nice steamengines and a very cool mechanic yours has the wrong hathair btw to come along with them the skeleton falling down on the end of a chain was the most intriguing part of this set for me it worked really well and when you were done scaring minifigures you could winch it up again ready for the next go the only thing i did not really like about this set was the difference in wheelsize on the car front small back large and the way the palmtree consisted out of just three parts all in all a great set that is becoming more rare and expensive as we speakpost get it edited by simonwillems 26 may 2008  0759 pm	positive

wow good review i used to love this old sets as i was greatly fascinated by inca and aztec cultures and the mayans technological marvels astounded me i was thrilled to death when lego released little aztec figures so of course i jsut had to buy some your narration with the sig fig was hilarious and the review was all around wonderful keep up the good work mate	positive

welcome to cardinal bricks review of 7736 its a small set but as i bought it the other day i felt that it probably did merit a short review the box is ofcourse far larger than necessary theres plenty of air inside the contence is one bag and the instruction booklet you could proably build it inside the bag if the desire took you we have one new coastguard with the slightly stubly head found in the castle range and a transclear visor the build was challanging and arduious the final product is quite nice at one 300 its a good set only 50p more than an impulse set and with enough extra parts to justify the increase in the price a good set for a little gift or so on the buggy moves well theres not that much to say really for i cant really think of additional models to build with the parts but then what do you expect for the price edited by cardinal brick 26 may 2008  0647 pm	positive
thank you very much for the review cardinal brick thats indeed a very nice little set klausdieter	positive
i might buy a second one of that set and build it in the bag i just wanna prove that it is possible	neutral
so i just piced up a new digital camera and i thought what better way to try it than doing a review of my newest set the new 7738 coast guard helicopter itsmy first review so go easy on me lets start off with the small stuff first the mini figs you get 4 figs total two helicopter pilots a diver and a civilan to rescue the torsos are nothing new on the pilot and diver same ones as in the last coast guard line but i like the colors alot better in this coast guard line than the previous generation the yellow and blue really work well together and the coloring on the badge looks great the civilian looks to be just a dock worker with an overall torso and a beenie the diver has nice vented helmet and a pair of flippers that suits his duty perfect next we have an absolute work of lego art the rescue raft the orange flaps can be moved back for easy entry to the raft as well as the white support beams with the caution tape i put support in perenthaces cause they really dont support anything just there to fill in the gaps at the top of the raft is a red locator beacon ccommunications antenna and a cargo loop for lifting the raft lets move on to the interior of the raft not much here but you can see the techinc beam that attaches to the top loopand to the floor of the raft so far this has proven to be very sturdy and has supported the full weight of the raft quite well you can also see the white box that holds the equipment of the raft here you can see the life saver tube heres a shot with our dock worker peaking out the side the raft says max ocupants 4 but with the storage box that might be a tight fit now lets move on to the helicopter in my opinion this is one of the best helicopters tlc has come out with to date i really felt they captured the look and proportions of a real coast guard helicopter it uses a lower hull and tail section of the new airliner and cargo airplane it really seems to work well with this application the engines have good detail using new cheese graders as vents as well as the new engine stacks that come in the new speed racer sets the rotors also appear to be new as well lets move on to the cockpit we have two seats for our pilots with a sticker sheet for intruments on a flat 4 wide plate theres also an antena being used as a flight stick another shot with our pilots at the helm now lets moveon to the high lihgt of this heavy lifting machine the med bay and lifting winch httpwwwbrickshelicopter020jpg here you can see the winch arm at rest along with the medical strechter the bad part is that the med strechter doesnt include the ussually included fold away wheels heres a shot with the winch arm extened ready for rescue in the second shot you can see the drum that the wire coils up in it coils up via a recently new power functions pull back motor to operate just pull out the winch cable hook on your load and presse this orange button on the side the bad part of the new power functions winch is that although its very smooth in its operation its not very strong it will only lift the raft a couple inches before it runs out of torque it also has a tendency to want to pull the crane arm backin while its lifting it doesnt matter if its a light load or heavy load the bay doors open on both sides for easy postioning of the figures and accses to the strechter here we have our diver looking over his rescuee nice and roomy if you dont mind a crane arm being in your way at 3999 and a peice count of 445 i felt this set was a great good considering what your getting the raft construction is very creative and is probbly the highlight of the set by itself the helicopter is probbly one of the best if not the best helicopter tlc has ever came out with if you can get over its size in a scale of one to five price peice count playability design overall 5 i would have given it a full 5 out of five but since the winch cant pull the raft all the way it didnt fell it right even with this minor flaw i still highly recomend this set	neutral
this has gotta be the coolest chopper ever i love it its so accurate plus your review is great because it shows all the inner details	positive
nice review a must have for my city collection	positive
great review this does look like an excellent set great chopper	positive
thank you very much for the nice review 5150 lego the helicopter is  apart from that it is very very big and that it does not include any interior  a very nice set  the most i like the life raft becuase it is simply  nevertheless i dont know if i buy it probably not  but its very nice two questions  where can you fasten the stretcher on to haul it up and down is the motor working with batteries klausdieter edited by klausdieter 28 may 2008  0919 pm	neutral

i could tell from the pictures that a lot maybe all the designs on the raft were stickers in the whole set are there any printed parts besides the torsos or is it all stickers	negative
all stickers im afraid though imnot a fan of stickers myself some sets like ferrari for example take longer to put on than building the actual set this one is not as sticker heavy as it seams though and the ones that areon there really give the set that extra touch printed would have been preffered of course but in this case i didnt mind it	negative

thats a very nice set im having my doubts about getting it though still the overall shape and size of the helicopter remind me of the reallife ch53 military cargo helicopter a very nice review youve got the photography down very well i feel perhaps a bit of nitpicking but at the end where you assign a rating if you do a rating with faces which is fine by me you may want to seperate the faces by a line otherwise it may become too crowded to the eye	neutral
this is a very good review thank you but i have some questions about the grey new parts in the life raft are they 1x1 like their counterparts with the clips or 1x2 and can they be held by a minifig by the handle if so these could be very useful for brickbuild weapons  tools also im looking forward to some orange eta 2 jedi interceptor mocs now who wants to be the first to make one btw which jedi has an orange eta 2	positive
im rather fond of helicopters and have built many different types this doesnt really remind me of any particular model other than perhaps an eh 101 merlin and even that resemblance is very superficial just for the record this is a sikorsky sea king and this is a sikorsky mh53 a derivation of the ch53 the only resemblance i see with the former is the colour scheme and with the latter the fact that its got a fat rearend sponsons and six blades it doesnt matter though because i really like it the colour scheme is great the shape is nice its got quite a bit of detail and i just have to get my hands on the cockpit window and those new rotor blades when i first saw the large aircraft pieces a few years ago i figured they were very much singleuse parts but the tail end doesnt look too bad pretty clever i like the raft too it really does look like the real deal that the helicopter cant lift it really isnt an issue because in real life they wouldnt lift the raft either theyd use the rescue hoist to lift the occupants of the raft into the helicopter one by one or perhaps in pairs imagine a storm with a helicopter hovering over tall waves with a big fat raft strung from a cable underneath it the raft would catch a lot of wind and flop around quite a bit causing it to loose all its occupants and also yanking the helicopter around possibly causing the pilot to loose control and crash bad idea cheers ralph edited by ralphs 30 may 2008  1109 pm	negative
i noticed that you said the torsos are the same as the last line the last line had orange torsos this one has yellow torsos chuck	negative

great looking set loved the review pictures were good sometimes blury but i think i will pick this up after i get the rest of the kotcs sets riddler a tip i learned in photoclass is to take a breath in and hold it while pushing the shutter so you dont accidentally move while breathing i thought it was silly but it does work again great review looking forward to more	positive

thank you for clearing that up i felt that it was ok to review an old topic as stated rather than just go ahead and start a new one a shame that this set as all other batman sets have gone up so highly in value but still all things considering general after market lego price hikes it is still a wonderfull set even with its market value today that is if you can ignore the mrsp	positive

i bought this off ebay while not having been collecting space as a child it was mainly wild west and city i have decided upon reading kdogs mtron bar brawl mania strip in his space comic to buy as many mtron sets and figures i could find except i got distracted and bought some different sets as well to start off with heres a picture of the box heres a general shot showing the entire set a front view the buggy another shot of the buggy without the minifig the flyer the flyer without the minifig mtron crate with some equipment and hoses i dont know the use of the hoses though  the cockpit open the cockpit closed with the crew the magnetic crane another shot of the crane rear view with hatch open one of the side slots that can carry either the buggy or the flyer top view of this excellent vehicle excellent for getting spyrius or blacktron out of your way  final shot excellent set one of the biggest space ground vehicles and one of the best sets made by lego undoubtably better than its newer counterpart the mt101 armored drilling unit a great addition to any collection and has a lot of cool neat features that make it have a lot of playability simply excellent five out of five	positive
great find and thanks for the review inertia on may 28 2008 1108 pm said undoubtably better than its newer counterpart the mt101 armored drilling unit care to explain why personally i think that aside from the colour scheme the new one is far better why suspension more enclosed cockpits buglike appearence i suppose its a matter of personal opinion though	neutral
great review of a great set i always figured the hoses were welding torches attached to jetpacks yeah as the whole thing had the vibe of a mobile repair center much like many of my favorite sets this one has a base of simple bricks and plates and then from that solid foundation the rest is built out to be decorative or have the action features this gives sets a very solid feel as demonstrated in this set the first snowspeeder and galaxy explorer the mm armored drilling unit has a more technic base giving it a less solid appearance and though i like the set that jet that luanches from the back is horrible partially because of the useless orange containment things the mega core has a nifty crane instead of a big useless jet tohst	positive

it looks like youre right about the old magnets i got a few off pab two months ago but they no longer have them i guess i should grab some while theyre still widely available on bricklink as they can be useful in a number of situations on a side note one interesting thing about this set is that it seemingly had two uscanada names mega core magnetizer and multi core magnetizer brickset lugnet and all the other sites ive seen call it mega but i have some north american catalogs from that time period that call it multi and the box also says multi on it i actually didnt know the mega name at all until many years after the mtron line	neutral

inertia on may 29 2008 0844 am said i just thought that the mt101 was very skeletal and couldnt really steer that well although i do like it also the mcm has a better design in my view as the wheels are closer together making it look a lot more tankish than the mt101 also space in the rear isnt wasted on having a shuttle thanks for an answer ill shut up now so we can focus on your review	neutral

asuka on may 30 2008 0217 am said of course i don´t want to offend some technic lovers and although i always was more the system kind of guy why can´t they just use some technic beams with studs at least thats because of cost the older beams needed a four sided mold and the newer ones need only a two lego do seem to be using both types more as of late though asuka on may 30 2008 0217 am said i grew up with just imagine with pictures of alternative models on the box and i don´t think it´s that easy especially for younger kids to mod some of these terrific blownup sets like it once was with sets like this one here implosion off ive never heard an official word perhaps i should raise a topic but i think that they dont show them any more because it became a support nightmare what do i mean i bet tlg was tired of letters and calls saying timmy cant make this model shown on the box can you send instructions and the extra parts i know that for some recent models they were designed but not published how do i know this the creator said so	neutral

harley  mistah j i want to preface my review by admitting that i’m an unrepentant harley quinn fanboy i’ve been enamored with the character since she first appeared in batman the animated series back in the 90’s and i’ve since followed her misadventures through her introduction into the regular batman series during no man’s land into her own series and even on the shortlived and notsogood birds of prey tv show so please excuse any proharley bias so down to business the 267 piece set retails for 30 us 35 at toys r us and builds up very fast and easy it consists of batman’s bat cycle harley’s hammer truck and brand new batman and harley quinn minifigs there is also no lack of weapons in addition to the usual bag of bataccessories and guns the set also comes with a pair of gray revolvers batman in this set has the new “armor” torso print and the hips are the same color as the legs hinting that this is supposed to represent the movie style batsuits more so then the traditional comic book “underwear over tights” look harley quinn is a very cool looking minifig and i haven’t grinned so much at a new batman character figure since my first batman minifig a couple years ago the figure is very true to the character and the torso has been accented with a few shape lines to try and distinguish her as a female despite the boxy body harley’s jester cap is an interesting new piece it seems to me at least to be made of a slightly different grade of plastic then we’re used to it’s molded in red and painted with black and white and it comes packed in its own separate little baggie i expect that this piece may have cost lego a little more then usual to produce harley also has a buildable accessory a giant mallet sure she can’t stand up all that well unless it’s held in specific ways but it’s neat and most importantly it’s funny it’s especially fun for smacking the everloving crap out of other minifigs with the bat cycle is in bag number one and is a very fast build this isn’t some little japanese sport bike like nightwing’s cycle this monster is almost a car and seems to pack just the right amount of intimidation for the caped crusader to exploit thanks to the thick tires two in front one in back it stands up just fine on its own and rolls very well the huge exhaust pipes are a nice touch and give the thing a look of engine power the only real flaw is the inclusion of the flickfire missiles mounted on the sides but as with any lego model they can be easily left out without hurting the look of the vehicle the hammer truck is the bulk of this set and a lot more fun then it looks of the monster truck persuasion the vehicle is designed and built with a surprising level of solidity the axle mounts are particularly impressive the big wheels and tires just beg you to drive this thing right over the bat cycle or batman the megamallet gimmick is also a surprise not so much for its technical complexity there isn’t any really but for the fact that once you start turning the knob at the rear to swing the mallet back and forth it’s really a lot of fun there are some low points to the truck design again the flickfire missiles are tacked on and there’s a cargo cratebed set into the back for harley’s loot of jewels the crate would have looked a lot better molded in black in brown it breaks up the look of the truck a little speaking of which the look of the truck is very pleasing the red and black harley quinn color scheme works really well on the vehicle there are a few stickers here and unfortunately the diamond patterned ones are applied over multiple bricks the rest however are great not only does she have an “i love joker” bumper sticker but she has a joker playing card taped to her dash i guess serving as a picture of her beloved puddin’ there is also a sticker for activation of the hammer which boldly shouts hit me this is a fun set a neat new batman vehicle and a big truck with lots of playability the harley minifig is a musthave for any batfan and if you only get one of the batman sets this year i’d recommend this one the price versus piececount on this set is a little bit of a deterrent though this might not be the best set for collectors on a budget or people looking for something completely new and innovative but anyone buying this for a child can rest assured that the kid will get your money’s worth out of the set through its play value when added together and averaged out the pros and cons of this set combine to give it a score of out of 5 even if harley herself is a clean 6 out of 5	positive

hi all so i was at the walmart yesterday and had the munchies and was looking for something to eat somewhere along the line i stopped caring about food and decided to browse the toy department to see what they had legowise usually they have jack squat but on this particular day they had a lot of new sets i impulsively picked this set up along with harley quinns hammer truck and the new little campsite from the indy 4 line i must say when i first saw images of this set i wasnt exactly thrilled or anything i mean i didnt really see anything particularly special about it but after purchasing it i must admit that i would consider it a must buy for any lego fan but enough babbling about myself onward with the review my first of an official set in this picture you can see everything you get with the set i thought the boxart was pretty nice looking the manual on the other hand took somewhat of a beating within the box a common problem with most more recent sets i do have to say that i wish they would at least make some effort in fixing this they could just make a little thin cardboard folder to minimize bending and tears for batman minifig collectors the highlight of this set are the robin and penguin figs previously you could only get them in the pricey batcave set but this set provides a much cheaper alternative one thing you will notice however is that robins hairpiece is a new mold as it is actually a black version of mutts hair from the indy 4 line personally i think it actually looks better than the hairpiece used on the older version of robin as the batcave had before it this set comes with some bricks to make two cute but deadly penguins they help add more charm to an already charming set when youre finished building youll end up with a nice little assortment of extra parts 1 black cheese slope 3 1x1 tile black yellow and white a revolver a technic pin and a 1x1 red round plate heres robins scuba jet its nice and sleek looking notable parts of interest would probably be the green turbine engines my only complaint on this one would have to be the use of decals on the 2x2 round yellow tiles for that type of a part printing seems as though it would have been the best way to go now for in my opinion the best part of the setthe penguins sub this set has more decals than robins scuba jet but they seem more necessary in this case i actually wanted to put the decals on the sub as i think the it looks great with them obviously it looks like a penguin but wow does it ever do it with style it has a lot of interactive features the first of which i will mention being the periscope which raises up and down and for the collectors of parts in new colors it has a few parts in medium orange such as 2x2 tile heres a shot of the bottom of the sub another nifty little feature is how you can lift the top off and fit the penguin inside and there is enough room inside so that you can firmly place top on again and without interference to the movement of the periscope another little feature is the rear springloaded missile you just tilt the small lever toward the front of the sub and it fires and the last small feature are the flickmissiles on each side overall this is a great set with a lot to offer for a decent price a lot of fans might view the only drawback to it as being the use of decals but if you plan on keeping the kit together they make it look really fantastic buy it if you can matt edited by imperialshadows 01 june 2008  1142 am	positive

clonecommando007 on may 29 2008 0653 pm said great review though you really seem to like this set and it probably is a great one im not a fan of the penguin sub or at least im not from what i see its not for everybody personally i just bought the set for the figures and i was originally just going to sort the parts and put them away in storage asuka on may 29 2008 0713 pm said thank you very much for that neat review brickadier general  i´m glad that you changed your mind a review of a burger wouldn´t be half that interesting for sure it´s just a mediocre set to me but of course it´s always cool to get important mfs in less pricy sets i like the penguin´s sub from the batcave more just because they did a fine job on resembling a penguin without using a sticker robins craft looks fairly nice but the most useful parts of the whole set for me personally would be those indeed very neat green engines yes it probably would have been nicer if they would have at least done a brick built beak for the front of the sub unfortunately i never got my hands on the batcave set so i never was able to build the original sub	negative
yay another technic shooter whew i need a spare one in case the 14348 other ones that i have all happen to break seriously do lego set designers get some sort of bonus for incorporating catapults technic shooters and  or flickfire missiles anyway thanks for the review looks like a cute set	positive
thanks for the review i love this set i didnt think it was much at first either but i really love it another cheaper robin and penguin is great and those nifty mini penguins are awesome the spare pieces are even nice i love robins little scuba jet those green engines are very nice and i love it compactness penguins sub is even better at first i was annoyed at getting two subs but now i realise it means i can have a fleet of them ill be sure to mod over those cannons though but the details are very slick thanks again batbrick away	positive
thanks for the great review brickadier general the sub looks very nice and i like the idea of a raising periscope did the batcave sub have that feature and the details on the sub look very nice the inclusion of the penguin robin and two of those great brickbuilt penguins really confirms that ill be getting this considering that i didnt purchase the batcave however i am rather dissapointed that this set is so similar to the vehicles of penguin and robinin repectively in the batcave set i feel that it only really caters to those who havnt bought the set and i wouldve much appreciated different vehicles overall a very nice set perhaps the best of the 2008 wave despite its lack of originality thank you very much for the review bg	positive
i was never considering getting this set as i dont really like batman but if i found this set and had some money with me i would buy it ii would use it for indiana jones or something and the revolevers and top hats the only problem i see with the boxart is that the penguin is drowning	positive

wow like others have said i was unsure about these when i first heard about them but then looked at the first leaked pics and thought they actually look pretty neat now i have seen all the reviews i have to have all these sets at first i was thinking they would be great as parts packs but the more reviews i see the less i want to use them as part packs and just keep them as built or buy 2 so i can do both  cant wait till they hit the shelves in the uk thanks for the review	positive
thats an awesome review and a great set it seems with all of this years star wars i still havent got rogue shadow i cant afford agents too which is a shame looking at this	positive
thanks for another wonderful review sveltecorps a very fine set indeed i absolutely love the way all of the vehicles fit into the command centre very clever the projector is really cool it looks very nice its great to see these light and sound bricks in the agents sets all of the little nooks and crannies in the centre are great too i really love the amount of detail featured mixed with all of the playability of this set the minifigs  as usual  are brilliant the uniforms look fantastic dr inferno looks especially great i love his white suit with hints of orange and who can forget his hair im really tempted to buy this beast now though im not sure my wallet will forgive me for it i suppose ill have to cut back on indy and castle multiples for now thanks for the truly great review sveltecorps nice work	positive
wow this set looks so amazing amazing genius davinci art i say youve done an excellent job reviewing and really this is the review ive been waiting for so cool so classy i love the mission briefing feature to think that lego could go so high as to put something ingenious like that in there too bad lego figures dont have fingers to make shadow shows eh genius the jet lauching feature is pretty slick and they even put a control center in there too thats beast loving that the bottomi dont see how that big buggy can get out or in there but awesome too the back of the truck could use more detailing i think but the jail popopen feature is pretty cool as is the speed boat storage rack cabin its great that roof opening feature is a great part of this set also i think you can have multiple figures up theremaybe you can mod it to put a bed in there it certainly looks big enough inferno plane wow that think is smooth baby i love how the wings contain rotors inside of them thats awesome detail right there that is a sweet ship thingy so slick the rest of the command center is pretty awesome too we get a 4x4 wheeler and a crane and lots of room wow just wow great review great set you are well worthy of your custom title im gonna go buy this for only 90 woot	positive
great review thanks thats one hell of a set i think lego has reached a certain kind of peak with the design cleverness and fun of this one im so relieved that agents seems to be shaping up to be even better then i thought it was going to beand i thought it was going to be cool to begin with agent charge not only does he look like dash justice but he has the name of one of dashs alpha team squadmates i call shenanigans	positive
woah i got to have this set i shall buy it asap thanks for the review expertly done	positive
splendid review i love everything on this set no question bout it somehow i knew i should have saved up and buy that when come to trubut the sight of turbocar chase and jetpack pursuit was to tempting to pass up	positive

i first i thought the whole agents line would not be very good but boy have i changed my mind this set looks amazing as do all of the other sets in the line i really like how the small vehicles all fit into the truck i dont like it when sets come with smaller vehicles and dont have anywhere to store them so they just float on the side that light projector is fantastic i cant believe they are actually printed this is definitly on my tobuy list thanks for the amazing review	positive
7645  mt61 crystal reaper piece count 600 price aud7995 4995 euros in most countries 3999 gbp usd 4999 its happened in the wider world and it had to happen to lego  yes the 80s are back space invaders holograms compulsory seatbelt wearing legislation and the return of classic space ok we dont have a fully fledged classic space theme back yet but if 7645 is the way of the future i think lego is ready to do it properly i wasnt a huge fan of last years mars mission sets and only picked up a few on clearance but this set is light years excuse the pun ahead of 2007s offerings this mining vehicle is solid compact and welldesigned it looks impressive and even better it has fantastic power functions operability behold 7645  mt61 crystal reaper ps i wasnt joking about the holograms or seat belts part 1 box instructions dsss dreaded sticker sheets parts front of box back of box 2 x instruction booklets dss numero uno  for the reaper dss number two  apologies for the blurry pic but i wanted to capture the sweet shimmy of the metallic holographic background on this sheet the way it catches the light really makes a difference to the small alien craft and makes it look much more interesting from the plain stickers of last year theres heaps of spare silvery stuff once the stickers are applied for those who use the leftover sticker material for customising parts bags  4 numbered with one extra with larger pieces parts everywhere  woo i know the lego instruction books scold me if i mix bags but im a devilmaycare kind of guy in your face tlc i love mixing all the parts together before i build it reminds me of my youth when the days were long anything was possible and i didnt need strict instructions not to build on grass or poke my eye out with a technic shooter interesting parts  these may or may not be new my technic knowledge is not that detailed the little scoop parts are so cute and have a heap of potential uses i love em theyre like smurf hats at miniland scale these technic wheel things in orange are also cute they kind of remind me of marigolds giant fabuland marigolds the track pieces  you get 70 of these  heres the section of track for one side  as you can see its about 52 studs long these hold together better than the small ones on the hailfire droid jungle cutter part 2 minifigs small mining transport alien ship i have to confess  i forgot to take an individual snap of the astronauts  its the usual bunch though  scaredy face guy sunglasses in space man and a third one i cant remember you dont really care though youre only interested in the alien commander and his matching arms legs combo deal as brickbitz noted in his review of the smaller set the glowy eye is just a 1x1 cylinder the set also comes with 2 normal jellies  one pictured here for size youll see what happened to the other one soon enough the alien craft is nothing exciting apart from the gorgeous glinting stickers heres the road safety angle the commander actually clips onto a 1x2 plate with handle so he cant fall out then the lime tentacle thing descends on top of him to keep him firmly there like a baby seat not very brave for an alien commander is he i mean did darth vader ever use a seatbelt tssk with cradle up this part of the build also includes the small astronaut mining buggy  small and effective please note in this build ive applied stickers to everything bar cockpit pieces this comes with radio and saw piece part 3 the reaper the first part of the build is the detachable shuttle i really like the retro aesthetic of this with the angled wings and the side hoverpod things it is much better than the comparable vehicle from 7699 the new flickfire piece is a waste of space  its fairly limp i prefer the simple flickfire technic pin to be honest theres also a very nice little side workshop as you can see i really like how the control unit is plugged into the wall via 5 1x1 round plates third pic its a bit dark great detail the technic pins on the back are there to connect the power functions battery box its odd theyre included at this stage of the instructions  maybe the intention was to release it originally with all the necessary motors etc but the price point was too high and they scaled it back the base the shuttle sits on that bley technic axle in the middle when the reaper is fully assembled the little vehicle scoots down the ramp at the rear which folds up to hold it in place when the reaper is in motion you can see theres a crystal container here as well  another nice small detail which i found the 2007 sets lacked theres also an alien here  thankfully not in those horrendous transorange tubes so prevalent last year the complete assembly isnt it snug its just the right size too  not massive but large enough to be a serious mining vehicle the ominous black treads contrast nicely with the white orange colour scheme of the vehicle itself the trans detailing  blue for weapons neon green for energy  is carried nicely through the whole set the blades and the scoops whirl nicely as the machine trundles along top down view tread detail whirling blades of death the buggy descends probably the most disturbing aspect of the whole set is this pic the jelly has an orange pump plugged into its heart which is connected to an energy supply on the left hand side this vehicle runs on alien jelly juice either that or its milking the jelly in some equally disturbing fashion how amoral is that i know theres been debate about this  the jellys arent innocent theyre evil energy crystal thieving maniacs etc  but i find it a bit odd that the humans respond by chaining the jelly up to the bowels of their mining vehcile and suck energy from its heart people debate about violence in lego as represented by realistic minifig weapons but i think the moral lesson here is even worse  its ok to exploit foreign life forms for our own gain if they treat us badly first whofans i think the ood should have a word with the jelly commander  that aside this set is welldesigned and fairly good value at aud7995 its definitely a notch above last years mars mission sets overall with improved detailing and more useful functions the holostickers are fab and its nice to have an alien commander even if he is a bit bulky and his fingers are identical to his toes however if all these reasons by themselves werent reason to recomend this set the following is part 4 power functions the best part of this set  and the reason i bought it really  is the integration of power functions bizarrely this isnt mentioned at all on the box and i only found out about it from the instructions when they were posted on eurobricks instructions for book 2 which has the power function stuff available here this is a great idea and hopefully we will see more new sets take this kind of approach especially with the new train sets luckily i got monster dino 4958 on sale for half price earlier this year so already had most of the necessary motors etc  the only one needed was an extra small one what you need is listed in the instructions below with redirections to shop  home to buy the motors note theres actually a mistake on this page the 2 small motors you need are both 8883 not 8882 which is the large xl motor way to confuse the kids there lego attaching them was a dream and only took a few minutes in contrast to 4958 where it was almost impossible to remove motor elements without dismantling the model basically the back platform and some plates and orange slopes come off you attach the motors and then the smaller plates go back on these parts are now left loose overall the look of the reaper isnt badly effected as youre mainly viewing from the front anyway sadly i cant show you how it moves youll just have to trust me that it does  the way it is steered is demonsrated in the instruction pages above basically each motor is controlled by a corresponding switch on the remote move them both forward to move forward move one right to turn right move both back to move back etc it zips along its a speedy little thing personally i wouldnt want to be in its path as it comes roaring down the martian canyon my cat was scared as it was it is oodles of fun and definitely worth trying if you have the motors or can get them cheaply and adds a whole new dimension to the play aspect of playset it is also as i said very quick to switch between modded and nonmodded reaper in contrast to the more fiddly dino creations the only problem i had is that if it moves too fast the weight of the battery box at the back tends to pull the whole thing back and it rears up it does correct itself though i only trialled this on carpet last night so it may behave differently on other surfaces  i will need to experiment part 5 summation this is a great set made even better with the addition of power functions at aud7995 its wellpriced buy it buy the motors as well kmart still has stock of 4958 at 89 wait for a 15 off sale you wont regret it buy 2 and make competing battle machines the only thing is just dont torture that poor jelly edited by sinner 24 june 2008  0325 am	positive

so is there some way to get all those motor bits at once or do you have to buy them on their own i dont think ive ever seen them in a store here	neutral
iron moose on jun 4 2008 1128 am said so is there some way to get all those motor bits at once or do you have to buy them on their own i dont think ive ever seen them in a store here only from sh so far or if you buy sets which they come in all the ones you need apart from one additional small motor are available in the 4958 monster dino set which i got half price i ordered the extra from sh at the same time i bought the set  but only because i had already looked at the instructions and knew what i needed if people have the ferris wheel set as well i think the small motor comes in that	neutral
this should be reported to the news 	neutral

really nice review i love those sweet looking power functions on it if only the orange bits could be replaced then you could have a futuristic and motorized jungle cutter anyway the alien bit was disturbing but the overlytall new commanders look very very cool all in all a great set but i wont be able to buy it because in a few days sh will become 600 richer and my wallet will writhe around in pain on the floor	positive

algernon on jun 5 2008 0203 pm said why is it that agents and star wars get their own news articles but this fantastic set is totally ignored i think maybe theres a bit of star wars excitement on the front page which has probably got a few members frothing with excitement not every review needs to be frontpaged anyway 	neutral
no but this is one of the most anticipated sets of 08	neutral
well title says it the description youll understand later i ordered this off of sh last tuesday and oddly enough its listed on sh as mx81 hypersonic airplane id like to apologize for the random horrible faded pics i took the review outside and the clouds kept shifting changing the lighting and then i had to go inside because it started raining its been raining for a week its raining now as i type this so i foolishly went outside to take pics the front of the box not bad as far as boxes go it features a liftup tab which shows the various functions back of the box still not much to say two manuals i think this is just right not too thick but not too many manuals either oddly enough the box came with a little folded up piece of paper telling us not to mix the bags it comes sorted into 4 bags by the way minifigures the set features 3 normal mm figs 1 normal jellie and one of the new commanders i really like this guy he has a few issues like his hands being stuck sideways and still being hollow but still a great improvement hell make a lovely addition to any halloween moc stickers the set comes with a fairly big dss for the spacecraft pretty normal but i do like the dragon sticker then suprises of suprises a technicolor sticker sheet for the aliens how cool is this huh the tops of the actual stickers are shiny which is hard to see in the pic even the bottom is shiny who said stickers cant be cool the mining craft the little guy is pretty cute and well built my only gripe is that theres nowhere to spin the drill it seems so lifeless without a feature the alien craft youd think a commander would be important enough to have a seatbelt rather than be stabbed with a clip and stuck on the ship like those other grunt aliens i think this thing has some potential shiny stickers different body shape and when you look at those engines this thing could be an alien corvette but then you look at the back pretty bare no flares or anything its a cool little craft but it justlacks the modules these things have some potential as well with some modding they could be pretty cool unfortunetly its pretty boxy there are no engines and the wings are too small the top is pretty nice though the greebles are all right the controls as usual are a sticker pretty spacious mind you the cockpit doesnt stay flush with the body though the front plate underneath it can be easily replaced with a brick to fix that im not gonna comment on this the main body too bad the labratory isnt much of a lab a transred panel and some tray thing are all that compose the lab i was expecting more but true to form this mars mission set has no impressive interior to speak of there is a lot of space though so it shouldnt be hard to mod phew the lab folds up like so pretty simple and would allow access to the lab if there was one and then we have this thing what is it defense laser communications array satellite tv the modules connect like so sorry out of place too bad the pins stick out various pics as you can see this thing has more of those bars than an att commercial there you understand the topic description now  the rear it uses a white city plane wing for thewings when i first saw the prototype pics i thought they slanted downwards that wouldve been really cool ah now to the platform from the position of the drill i think this could be a really cool turret location when i mod it to more military space back to the bars if we had space monkeys theyd love this this set has more bars than a jungle gym  here we see the button that drops the platform pretty clever and its not in the way best of all it really works really well actually good job tlc 2 more bars and a shooter mechanism jeeze this is really setting itself up for a joke a shooter mechanism walks into a bar never mind here we have the handle that allows you to pick it up safely a good idea but its placed waaaay to far back way off the center of balance you have to hold on to it pretty well to keep it angled up though it does stop your hands from getting in the way of the platform ah the platform in action this is really a neat little feature not only can the ship land in a reduced footprint but it also prevents the nice white paint job from getting red dust all over it its centered pretty well too and you dont have to worry about knocking it over just dont shove it back at all here we have the latch when the button on top is pushed this gets pulled inward which pulls out of this hole and allows it to swing neatly down good luck and happy mining again sorry for the lack of inprogress review i wouldve liked to take pics of the mechanism and so on but typical of the mm sets you cant really take it apart well this is really a nice set which can hopefully be upgraded with a better lab with little difficulty some of my military mod plans include strip the lab and install a command center get rid of lots of bars the thing has more bars than alcatraz install some turrets this is a big command ship so why all the forwardfacing weapons itll need some aa defense mod the landing platform to be a troop dropper with installable aa turret mod the cockpit pods to be more aerodymic so thats all folks shall i include one last bar joke	neutral
i appreciate your review mr mandalorian but why the negativity id try to find more positives about the set instead of kinda criticizing it after each picture i personally think it looks freakin awesome the size is very impresive and i nearly fell of my chair when i saw the first pics earlier this year its quite unlike anything ive ever seen from lego edited by radiant7 04 june 2008  0827 am	positive
thanks for the review i really like all the mars mission sets this year the usage of the big wing is a bit annoying but you cant blame lego for reusing the mold ive been considering doing the same with mine mr mandalorian on jun 4 2008 0219 pm said so thats all folks shall i include one last bar joke i wouldnt have a bar of it	neutral
thanks for the review mr mandalorian this is an er interesting set lots of frontal firepower very big too and i like the idea of those two little craft that attach on the sides sort of like little escape pod things anywho not one of the things on my to buy list but i do like that radioactive sticker that could come in use looking forward to seeing your modifications too peace	positive
thanks for the great and very detailed review i love the new holostickers im still not sold on this set though im not sure why i think its the big wing piece and the tootechnicy build from looking at the instructions the platform seems kind of out of place and for the size of the set the functionality doesnt seem as good as it could be it reminds me of 7699 armored drilling unit  looks impressive but doesnt seem to do that much i do think mars mission has improved this year though bar none this is the weakest of the new mm sets i think	negative
thanks for the review mr mandalorian the alien craft is a bit small in my opinion could have done with being just a little bit larger the main craft however despite its few minor flaws looks very good while space isn’t my normal theme i’m certainly being tempted this year	positive
iron moose on jun 4 2008 0234 am said that certainly feels like an homage to the deep freeze defender which itself feels like an homage to the galaxy commander thats the observation i had when i saw the first pictures of this set online a few months ago i am a proud owner of the 6973 deep freeze defender and 6980 galaxy commander so im looking forward to see how the 7644 stacks up next to them there is a definite lineage here and these sets clearly demonstrate the evolution of lego set design over the years the mx81 may not have the most playability out of all the new mm sets although it has alot from what i can tell but its hard to beat the look of a large sleek space cruiser sitting on your shelf or dresser at least for myself anyhow this is my first post to the forum and hope my welcome wont wear out here anytime soon edited by spacefan 04 june 2008  0643 pm	positive
thanks for the review i have to concede this does appear to be the weakest set of the summer mm lineup ive noticed a trend that the larger sets have plenty of parts potential but when assembled the model is not more than the sum of the parts eagle base certainly didnt seem worth the asking price at least this is one large model on a positive note the lame aero tubes darts and martian carrier pods have disappeared dont get me wrong i love mm and most of the lineup is great this one just seems to fall a little short of the bar	neutral

algernon on jun 4 2008 0934 am said i dont understand why theres so much negativity this is actually my favorite of the new mm sets the finished look is very sleek and not very gappy at all the deployable landing pad is great and itll make it easy to put on a shelf without taking too much room lots of greebles although i will concede that its just begging to be modded still though im definitely buying this one  it has a really great look to it i dont understand the negativity either one mans treasure is another mans trash i suppose that said having grown up with lego during the 80s this set has a certain nostalgia factor in its overall look and feel that harkens back to that earlier period in my life which i fondly remember aside from the factory star justice set elements of which i loathe i expect the 7644 to be the closest thing to a classic space revival that well ever see again from the lego group but i hope to be pleasantly suprised someday though im not living in the past and do appreciate everything lego is doing now and will do and has done since and like you im one whos definitely buying this set no matter how few of us there may be	positive
iron moose on jun 4 2008 0215 pm said do tell im being curious not confrontational  well first and foremost like many other people im no fan of those dreaded unprinted minifig torsos and stickers but also the cost to piece ratio of the set it just seems too expensive for everything that you get such as too many small parts and a lighter than usual piece count for the price though if it had included printed minifigs and other elements i maybe would of been able to swallow its 100 usd cost a little easier but star justice is still lego space in the most classic sense thats available today and i will probably pony it up just because anyway i hope were not breaking forum protocol by not discussing the 7644 review of the original poster or that particular set in general	neutral
wow ill definately have to check this one out i always tried making a big mining deployment ship but it always turned out crappy edited by maiq the liar 04 june 2008  1052 pm	neutral
thanks for the review i actually quite like this i cant afford it so im not getting too attached to it but in its own way its great its certainly reminiscent of space sets of the past as others have said and the dropdown ramp section is just really cool as an idea you understand sure the lab is a little crap but at least the effort was made sort of  the sheer fact that its so big though really makes me like this theres just something appealing about large spaceships not capital ships just big space ships with lots of guns spacefan on jun 4 2008 1034 pm said anyway i hope were not breaking forum protocol by not discussing the 7644 review of the original poster or that particular set in general hey its no worse than batbrick and i no really it isnt even in the same league	positive
thank you for that nice review mr mandalorian wow somehow it´s almost like classic space´s back indeed it´s a great star ship it looks stream lined original and impressive and even the huge plane wing part looks rather cool and smooth on it it´s equipped at least with some kind of engines on top of the wings and although they´re made with only two a little juniorized parts it´s better than nothing there´s a lab or some sort of engine room with enough space inside to allow one or two mfs to play scotty yeah the two cockpits´re nicely detailed with a cool use of these orange 1x1 round plates and to detach one or all two of them reminds a lot of the playability of the good old space sets it seems even like it´s easy to attach them to some kind of cloud city twinpod car thanks these hinged wings looks like some solid fun to me of course the cockpits aren´t airtight and even this reminds unfortunately of the post blue grey and trans yellow era of cs anyway there´s no real fun without some moding i guess another great advantage of the set´s that it´s not overpacked with shooting things one technic shooter cool in grey and only one trans orange prison pod too well i can surely live with that especially since it´s nicely asymmetrical the drill rover´s very charming a little like a rebuilt oldsmobile convertibe stranded on mars sweet and that platform feature´s plain nifty and well done too very playable and useable for a lot of things hmm recently i complained a lot about the dense use of studless technic beams for the inner structure of vehicles like these exoforce tanks par exemple which makes moding in an economical way pretty frustrating but the beams here´re used in a very proper way it should be fairly easy to mod let´s say the back of that lab section up to perhaps even the cockpits to create a larger airtight area that could be boarded from the platform just to fit this certain spacers need for um realism there´re many more nice details too like that satelite tv thingy and that cylinder with trans blue 2x2 dish for the knob or these cylinders with cones on that handle and that alien craft´s pretty nice and detailed as well like i said before i really feel like classic space´s back	positive

sorry mr mandalorian i guess i was just getting a bit defensive because when this set first appeared here there were literally 2 pages of people just bagging out the new mm sets but then the thread took a turn and people started to warm to them much like the agents i do agree that it definitely needs some mocing but with that work i think it has the potential to be a really amazing set in terms of what you could cram into it the lab is a little disappointing ive always wanted an enclosed cabin space in a vehicle this size because then all the little space guys can have a true meeting place the dropdown landing ramp is my favourite part it has lots of potential uses maybe its even possible to integrate pneumatics d	positive

hello eb yes im cranking out the reviews the other day i picked up this gem for an okay sales price at devonport tas while searching for the new batsets i informed iamded of this as he is a spideysuckup   and he informed me this was the only set he didnt have of the wave 2 of this theme so i ask you great eb members to please remind him of this when commenting here we go with the review of doctopus lair anyway unlike other reviews this stars more people the batbrickiamdeddragonatordaisy review daisy is the mouse that came in the set first up re the figs and i must say they are great i love fleshies and these are excellent to expand my batman world plus having a spiderman to beat up is good too doctopus is great though his tentacles are annoying to keep in order peter parker is a nice addition i love that torso eve though harry osborn was totally absent from this scene i welcome him as he is a good fig also best of all is mary jane fleshie females are hard to come by and i love that hair my very first one oh and even better is bley daisy on the far right another fantastic thing is that by mixing mj with doctopus you get a far more deadly and real villain than anyone couldve forseen  the hippy oh cmon tell me that aint cool anyhoo here is a pic of doctopus showing his might random fact did you know i influence both dragonator and iamded in their sigfigs dragonator adapts his from my ia series while iamded added mutt hair when i had him like that in a pic i posted now onto the box sorry about the lighting the art is good and the cartoon spidey in the corner may have beenthe inspiration for a similar style in the new batsets back of the box again sorry about the lighting and blur it was gtting late and these were the last pics finally we get to the first part of the set the catapult is that movie accurate or what i love the part in sm2 when he uses his homemade genetic spider powered catapult to launch himself to the scene oh well it does comes with a cool spider web an trans blue spider so it gets some points and it is really fun i launched spidey several metres once i dont think he ever recovered infact he almost certainly webbed himself slightly cooler extras are these two this awesome little boat is great for city as is the simple but nice bouy daisy approves naturally dragonator ruins everything when he found out the dragon that would be riding with him was our nickname for daisy now finally the main attraction  coctopus dock iamded and i threw dragonator in the water to see if he could swim he er couldnt one sweeney todd later we continue the overall construction of the building is very good i know a lot of people hated stickers and i hated applying these but they do look spectacular and perfect for any city setting like a bank a gotham bank as iamded has already noted below me the black lifesavers a very cool as are the web piece and log pieces the inside contains the neutron copperplate triple bypass humdrum holy hum 5000 which does does see movie anyhoo it is very cool and includes a little control thingy on the yellow brick next to it unfortunately the inside is plain but for that the other side has no wall too which is a bit of a letdown really but atleast it allows daisy easy access one gripe is those yellow 1x1 bricks they serve no purpose and break up the colour scheme better shot of the thingy thing i quite like it the use of technic parts actually works and the whole set is worth it for those purple flames and dishes alone it closes up pretty well too unable to hit the dish which is a nice feature me and iamded liked it so much we threw a revived dragonator into it unfortunately it disagreed with him but it was fun another shot of the dock i like how they have gaps in the jetty i know the movie version was pretty wack and although the set isnt very faithful to it looks more like a seaside library to be frank it still is very nice this is my first large blue baseplate too which is wonderful though funny how the set only uses about half of it the roof is a well designed and fun feature it uses some technic connections to render it flexible of any degree as you can see here by my opening of it better shot of the roof design it can lie flat or at any angle i might use the design myself in the future as much as i love the building this feature bugs me for in order for it to work this wall has to stick out which not only looks ugly but makes you be able to see through the corners still easily modded and log pieces are fantastic for mocing it also means that there are 7 windows all up for a good sizeable building by pulling out the piece in the center the walls both collapss sideways outwards which is actually pretty fun and works everytime overall view of the set including characters now for the story that makes no senseat all spiderman is dead after falling down the wall mechanism see above only daisy can save the day for dragonator is being held by the evil doctopus and iamded and dragonator are too busy not caring and brainbox is too busy complaining that this goes against all marvel continuity unfortunately daisy is on a lunchbreak so tough luck dragonator and daisy goes on a search for fortune and glory okay this is what i think of the set build 35  fun but those stickers ruin the experience somewhat and if you dont apply them the instructions are a bit hard to follow playability 45  great little gizmos and bits not the kind that keep you going like with the 2007 aquabase but good fun still design 45  not very movie faithful no but still a great little building and a smart design for certain aspects minifigs 55  great figs with all different faces and very useful bits price 25 far far overpriced even on sale sadly total 1825  a good set that couldve been better with a few minor changes nothing wrong with it but it doesnt really cross the line to greatness that said it has a lot going for it and definitely worth buying or atleast a look

lookin good so far though i must say its doc ock not dok ock the catapult is well ridiculous but the boat is very spiffy and the buoy is a nice addition i actually like the stickers on the window pieces perfect for this building and great for postapoc scenes black lifesaver rings are a nice addition tooanyway hurry up dragonator and batbrick and daisy i want to see the rest of the review iamded away	positive
thanks for the review even if it is a number of years late i picked this up whn it came out and thought it was a rather cool set besides the catapult plenty of cool pieces and the baseplate has found a use in the batcave although i think my dad managed to spill some beer on it at one point that was awful to clean off batbrick on jun 13 2008 1044 am said and brainbox is too busy complaining that this goes against all marvel continuity i wasnt expecting that there i was casually scrolling down when i stumbled onto a picture of me	positive
where is my soap haha anyway nice review as always batbrick i too have the set and hate the wall jutting out catapult and missing wall but hey review	negative
great review batbrick i was curious as to what the interior of the building looked like i still think that there should have been a few random chains or something lying around as they may add to the abandoned feeling that the ware house had though i have to admit that i really like the roof dock and minifigs as some of them make good average civilians that are somewhat hard to come by in todays sets  great comic as well it seemed to add a lot to your review hope you can review another spider man set soon  btw as adam mentioned i believe you owe me a bar of soap for reading your review  edited by mack 14 june 2008  1259 am	neutral

hi everyone please note that this review was done back in 2006 so do forgive me if you happened to notice any dated comments product 6205 vwing theme star wars no of pieces 118 release date feburary 2006 rrp sgd2990usd990 availability lego shophome target toys r us us  europe bricksworld sg legocom said rule the spaceways the sleek vwing fighter can adapt to any situation position the wings and flaps in attack mode to protect palpatines shuttle from enemies or position the wings in flight mode to survey the area for intruders either way the vwing is ready to strike for the republic includes clone pilot and r4 droid position wings in attack or flight mode sorry to all for the delay since this was supposed to be done 3 days ago anyway to get on with it quite a minimal amount of baggies for this set as noticed and the best thing is no sticker sheet yippee bounce the completed vwing though not really a complaint it would be nice if the entire astromech body was provided instead of only the head dome p of course then it wouldnt be movieaccurate since the q7 series astromech is integrated with the starfighter lol hes definitely wellpainted for a simple minifig since even the back is painted too i have to assumed this is the same minifig provided for 7259 arc170 starfighter too since i dont have that set anyway this minifig is much more accurate for this vwing since his suit is rated against vacuum while those in the arc170 arent  p one thing thats lacking is the instruments panel in the cockpit its totally nonexistent here i wonder what went wrong during the design stage personally this is the second most anticipated set for 2006 the first being the tie interceptor for me one thing is that theres no known release of the vwing starfighter by hasbro nor the other wellknown brands the other thing is that being a star wars vehicle collector i would really loved to see a replica toy of the vwing and the vwing by the lego group does not disappoint its nearly movieaccurate except for the cockpit transparisteel cover which could used some paint like the xwings also theres a permanent landing gear that quite neat since it allows you to land the craft on uniform surfaces the sfoils on the other hand can be quite a pain to pose into flight position very difficult for the sfoils to remain symmetrical during play the swooshable or play factor of this product is quite good just check out the pics for yourself d crackle general skywalker we have incoming to conclude the vwing starfighter would make a much better companion to the eta2 actis interceptor jedi starfighter than the arc170 coz the arc170 seems more like a longrange bomber to me than a snubfighter p and a final pic to show it at rest comments for 2008 just an updated pic to show my latest display on the clone wars hmm off the record i do understand that sometimes reviews by most tend to a certain set of guidelines like naming the set and showing the boxed and out of boxed pics and of course the grading portion regarding my review i prefer not to grade any of the lego sets at all as far as possible because to each hisher own my reasons to put up a review is not to belittle the efforts of tlg in coming out with these products nor to help them market them but to show my appreciation and enjoyment of these products i hope noone is offended by this and would like to apologise for any misunderstanding that this may caused for those who do not understand the above paragraph care not for it and play on like me	positive
thanks for the detailed review valentin it had good picture quality and a nice little comic near the end although this is a slightly older set it still was a good one i remmeber that i bought two of them to build up a small airforce for the republic and if i see another one i may buy it for use in the starwars comic game keep up the good work 	positive

commanderbly42 on jun 16 2008 1111 pm said great review and what are the stands that you used they look much better than the white bricks that i use oh those stands were once cdr spindles its from the container that can hold 100 cdrs hi whitefang cant deny that they were once my fav hunts for lego and yes that price tag is a tad hard to remove well while am delighted at the vwing i still kinda wish it had come with a printed brick for its instruments panel	neutral

heres the 3rd of the whole batch of complete reviews done back in 2006 hope you guys enjoy them so far product 6206 tie interceptor theme star wars no of pieces 212 release date february 2006 rrp sgd3990usd1990 availability lego shophome target toys r us us  europe bricksworld sg legocom said challenge the rebels blasting out of star wars episode vi return of the jedi the tie interceptor is the fastest fighter in the imperial fleet open the cockpit canopy and fold down the instrument panel to put the tie pilot inside and recreate your favorite classic star wars battles includes tie fighter pilot cockpit opens and instrument panel folds down it does seem to have more pieces than the average tie fighter but this is actually cheaper than the 7263 tie fighter of course theres no lightup feature in this set sweat yesh finally a tie interceptor this is probably the most anticipated for all set for all lego tie collectors worldwide since the fighter bomber advanced and even the expanded universe droid fighter had been released by the lego group this set is near movieaccurate since the bottom part of it aint p the cockpit and pylons uses the same design as that of the tie advanced piloted by darth vader except for one minor change that is the aft interior of the cockpit is strengthen this time and this is indeed good news since the older models had a problem of hard hinge and loose brick connection theres no landing gear for this set but it doesnt require it anyway this tie interceptor balances perfectly on its wings standard instruments panel and of course standard imperial pilot the swooshable or play factor of this set is definitely very high just take a look d camera view from own craft camera view from tieadvanced combat simulation of endors battle from the archives no bomber since i started late in recollecting p to conclude for a typical lego fan this set is a 6040 60 due to its good design and for a typical star wars fan this is a mustget the only flaw for this set is the same flaw for any lego set in sg the price doh commentcurrent in 2008 being a starwars fan no being a typical toy collector space is definitely a premium so much so that i turned to lego starwars to sate my appetite for more starwars products when i already have no more display space for the next few nonlego pictures they are the crown of my starfighter collection in 118 scale so just view them for fun eh and no i havent had the chance nor the time to do up a scene of my lego starfighters blowing up spectacularly since the pieces would be very hard to put back hmm then again isnt that what lego is about doh	positive

i picked up this set mainly because of the many 5spare glow in the dark parts and the promise of 2 racers and one helicopter for the price of a little more than two racers 90kr vs 2x40kr the box the back of the box shows the two alternate models you can build if the polybags rip there are 3 cheese slopes and two 1x2 tiles that glow in the dark where the tiles are exclusive for this set the total parts count is high at 142 but there are no really big pieces among them inside the box you will find the building instructions a sheet with some odd sticky labels thrown away and 3 polybags marked by the bag building difficulty the models the lime colored car doesnt bring out anything new we have seen racers built like that before but it does contain some nice bricks for the collection the police cruiser surprises with an interesting design along the sides as seen here it is harder to build because of the greater level of details the helicopter is without doubt the hardest vehicle to build in a bag i cant finish it because its larger than the bag you cant put on the top blades nor the tail of the thing so it beats the forklift from 7733 where the top bar is the new kind that doesnt completely fit there is also instructions for the alternate models but it requires the bags to be opened the vehicles are pretty standard for the racers theme with the police car being the highlight of the set conclusion i like the difficulty curve between bag 1 and 2 but the last bag should be labeled 1000000 instead of 3 it requires some inhuman skills to build that helicopter in the bag  lime colored car 3  we have seen it before but it has some nice pieces and lime police cruiser 9  it has a massive diffusers rare parts and a high level of details it is a shame lego relies so much on stickers helicopter 6  if you see it as a set for one fourth of the price of the cars it is quite amazing but you cant bag build it and i would personally prefer some more detail instead of the big size overall it is a nice little set but the police car is the main attraction i wouldnt get the other vehicles if they were sold separately brickshelf gallery edited by whitefang 23 may 2009  0703 pm indexed	negative

seeming as there were no reviews of this set in the index i have uploaded mine from jabbas hutt  here is my review for lego set 10178 motorized walking atat because i live in the uk i got this set with 6 free duracell batteries which was great its just twice as expensive as the us heres the basic set that is from the instructions this is the cockpit but please note after i took this photo i realised it was slightly built wrong heres one of the feet in proportion to a minifig to give you a general size this is luke skywalker swinging on a wire trying to destroy the atat i really wish lego didnt make so many lukes because i want differnt minifigs it would also be nice for a thermal detonator piece underneath the atat you can see the shaft that moves the back legs the motor and squeezed in on the righ t the massive battery box a load of cogs that move the legs these are the included figures snowtrooper general maximilian veers atat driverpilot or whatever you want to call him and luke all whithout there wepons please note veers should have a dark stone snowtroooper torso with 4 red and blue badge things not 3 these are the figures with weapons i gave them and the included ones snowtrooper has new style blaster veers has standard light grey pistol like the ones from the old adventure sets atat driver has old style blaster which i call heavy blaster and luke has shiny handle blue light sabre  the shiny blue light sabre was included with the set which is a bonus because i really dont like the grey ones httpwwwbrickshelsc00521jpgjpg this is the switch which is attached to the battery box on either side of the atat underneath the lift up side panels you push the forward to walk forward and backward to walk backwards simple eh  a front veiw with the the panels open here are the drivers controls which are simply a cotrol panel and 2 exoforce robot hands which are joystick things seen in the film if you look closley the almost useless carry handle this is the weird back piece looking down the atat from the back where you can see the the battery box and switch troops decending from ropes and cables and vader leading the assult for this i hadnt got any more imps so i used clones pilots i now have a whole load more snowtroopers solo and chewie sabotaging more troops to squash rebel scum huzahh a very bad picture of everyone packed up inside the size incomparison to its predecessor overall i would give this set 910 because it should come with more snowtroopers or it could be and endor version with loads of strormies and scout troopers aswell as this you can really sit any one down because of the battery box but i stilll find space to put all the shown figures on this review in the interior as you can see on the above image the chains and ropes are hanging down a bit tjis set is now limited to 5 per customer in the uk and now no longer comes with free batteries the walking on this is a bit wonky and dosent really walk like they do in the film as it moves two legs at a time i am currently attaching a motor to the head to make it move independently	negative
great review indexing it as i write this how come you think the ctt is the atats predecessor do you mean the motorized atat or atats in general i think this is a great set and i am very fond of mine its one of the few sw sets of mine that is on parade at all times most are packed away in the attic kimt btw its not alone the older version of the atat is keeping it company	positive
i mean by the clone turbo tank turned into the atat i think in the films when they changed all there technology and vehicles when they became the empire	neutral
nice job with this review skipper	neutral
nice review i echo the sentiment that more snowies would have been better	negative
nice review  the driverpilot whatever you call him   s helmet looks kind of odd and why does have a long red pole instead of a kickbutt lightsaber	negative
smithboy on jun 20 2008 0601 pm said i doubt that the atat was used in the clone wars well you never know maby veers was around then just because it was used in the clone wars dosent mean that veers didnt design it to wookiepedia	neutral
i never got the set it looked way to skinny i came close to buying it for the figs but then decided not to if you compared this one to the later one there is a big difference this one just didnt seem proporshined with the legs and its body	negative
thank you for the review skipper i never got this set because it was too expensive and motorized it completley reminded me of the old robotic toys called zoids or maybe even gundum at least the figs are great a chrome lightsabe hilt for luke ecxellent and the pilot is cool too and another snowie doesnt hurt and i didnt even know about the commander guy whatever you call him so people could have made a custom ds this whole time thanks again	positive
this is one of those sets that you just have to have i mean a motorised atat is a dream set for original trilogy fans and has an awesome set of minifigures	positive
10143 death star ii production year 2005 pieces 3441 minifigs 0 price 299 usd peeroncom 10143 gallery the review ph4tdud3ds review  u 2 kewl 2 do diz meyes ph4tdud3kewldo u have pix of the minifigs meerhmwhat minifigs ph4tdud3the ph4t figs from the ds1 methis is the other death star ph4tdud3omfg theres more than 1 meyes ph4tdud3keeeeewl must have megoodbye pushes the incinerator button ph4tdud3wut nooooooooooooooooooo and on that note lets start the reivew of the ucs death star ii now this is an older set 2005 and ive only gotten around to buying it a short while ago it took me around 2 evenings to build it and i must say that i am fairly impressed by this set time for a box pic the build since i started building this huge small moon size set at mortens appartment i wanted to keep as few polybags open at any given time as possible with this set it is actually possible to have a minimum of bricks scattered over a table or two while building not sure why but the division of bricks in the different polybags just work very well and that is great with a set this size  3441 bricks the building of the set is divided into several build this times x for example the upper and lower part of the unshielded ds are completely alike this is difficult to see when looking at the model but heaven when building it and this is how they solved the problem of having the wings connected to the buttom of the death star  geniously done imo note that in the first pic the skeleton is easily seen the skeleton holds the x to which both the upper and lower part is clicked on with technic pins also theres a steering wheel im sure theres a pirate name for that  like the one in the bottom in the top of the model to hold the upside wings so after having build duplicate wings upper and lower the belt all the way around the star and the upper and lower part of the unshielded side it was time to step back and watch the death star ii in all its glory such a great ucs set now i did have a few huhs during the build huh 1 in the instruction the technic lesserdragonhead should be dark grey but i got it in light gray go figure and thank you replacement parts ive experienced this before and apparently tlg uses different colours when outofstock all one has to do is call them and ask for the right colour and its on its way still a huh experience huh 2 again it appears that tlg changed the design of the technic axleholed 1x2 bricks the bottom has changed and i got the set where it was mixed up between old and new version not that annoying but still got me perplexed as to am i doing this right kinda stressing to consider taking most of the star apart to check the remaining 231 technic bricks 1x2 with axlehole now for a verdict  1 looks great 2 even my wife likes it  female appeal 3 its a great build 4 the polybags work for you 5 its star wars 6 the design is awesome  1 it wobbles if you touch it 2 very small parts come off if you touch it 3 parts come off when you try to move it somewhere safe 4 zero swooshability so in short yes even shorter the dsii is a well designed ucs set that has a great design like most other ucs sets it is not meant for play  hence dont play with it ucs verdict the numbers 510 designinstructionsbrickssturdinesscolourscheme design awesome look and great greeble set instructions easy to follow steps with bricks mentioned hard to see wether its black or dark grey bricks loads of great bricks a zillion bricks of the same type sturdiness dont touch colouscheme grey in grey with a little touch of black need a missing instruction then click the logo	positive
thanks for the review kimt  it comes at a confusing time you can take off the top disk and lift it like the millennium falcon from the top now i actually dont like this set that much it takes about 5 hours and 15 minutes to build if you do it in one go but the repeating sections makes this built the most tedious i have experienced it has way too many holes from which you can see the colorful skeleton and is overpriced compared to the older 10030 isd i remember thinking it was too expensive when it was 50 off at sh even the snowspeeder was kewler to less than half the price	negative
hmmm ive still got this set and i must say i think you did a good job of reviewing it but overall i hate the set probably the worst ucs set so far apart from the naboo fighter but that hardly even counts as ucs from my experience unless you really really want it and have nothing better to spent your  on in that case go for it but in my case it was a very repetitive build and final model was quite well bland not must variety to it if you know what i meanfor the price i would really reccomend the ucs star destroyer because thats a much better story	negative
grevious on jun 24 2008 1012 pm said thanks for the review eh honestly i though this was awful ever since i first saw the pictures to me an incomplete grey ball doesnt really work as a special ucs kit for the sole reason that its boring extremely so now the new death star playset is a whole different story they should have done that in the first place theres nothing to add to grevious post thanks but i never like the big grey ball benny	negative
good job kimt it´s a really nice set it will be interesting to see the size of ds2 ucs compared with the new death star playset keep up the great regulator job you are doing morten	positive
mortensonne on jun 25 2008 0336 am said it will be interesting to see the size of ds2 ucs compared with the new death star playset i was thinking about the same as for the review  thanks	positive
i think its a very weird and boring ucs set but what a lot of grey plates you could build something much better out of them but it would be fairly flat it looks very fragile though  my ucs atst is edited by shoc 25 june 2008  1028 am	negative
the build was a bit boring and i suppose a big grey ball isnt all that interesting but since the death star ii in the movie is a big grey ball too i dont see the problem i didnt think it was particularly fragile i dont care about minifigs or playability either a few plusses in my opinion it looked pretty damn impressive sitting in my lego room and the construction is really clever all in all i actually liked this one but perhaps i have a different expectation of sets than most of you sets are mainly parts packs and would you look at the quantity of grey plate in this thing its new grey btw i paid half price for it at shophome uk which is still a lot more than half price from the us and i didnt regret it for a second cheers ralph	negative
kimt on jun 25 2008 0834 am said i dont agree that the isd is better  imho theyre exactly them same  big and grey this is a question of personal liking  which is the coolest ds or isd not comparative here are some advantages that makes isd win for me  a lot more fun to build with less repetitions  it is easier to build alternate models from it how many alternate models of the ds2 have you seen  the bricks are more varied  you get magnets  it is a larger set if you look at the size	positive

kimt on jun 24 2008 0322 pm said 4 zero swooshability i think its very swooshable assuming you swoosh it at the same speed it moves in the movie d while i would never do something like this i bet if you packed this sucker with a bunch of m80 firecrackers it would make for a fantastic end to a stop motion movie with it being as delicate as you say it is i bet you wouldnt destroy any parts edited by gotoandlego 03 april 2010  0257 pm	positive

7656 general greivouss starfighter release 2007 number of pieces 232 minifigs 1 brickset welcome this is my first review so contstructive critisism is very much appreciated on to the review first we start out with the box the box art is the same as always since 2006 nothing special then we start the build the build is fairly easy and will take the seasoned builder about 1520 min to complete here is the finished model and birds eye view as you can see this ship is very sleek the fins or wings each have an outer slope and an inner one with the guns in between there are also cones on the front of the fins which give the ship an even more sleek look in the middle of the wings there is the main body with a big slope and stripes decorating it this set has a very good playability factor as im about to show you now the guns on the ship are pretty cool looking to begin with a bley slope attaching a lightsaber hilt and a transneon green stud to the fin on each side but theres more than what meets the eye yes the guns flip up and they can flip all the way back to hide them for whatever case they need hiding lets have a look at the back there is a tail fin used as landing gear and some lightspeed boosters but wait the tail fin can flip up for flight thanks to a hinge attached to the back of the cockpit heres another playability factor the cockpit can slide open very smoothly and easily heres how this is possible a clever system under the hood allows the cockpit to open see those two bley pieces on the black ones those bley ones attach to the tan plates under the hood and the hood and windsheild attach to the black peices the black and bley pieces work together as a sliding system so the cockpit opens viola and then the cockpit snaps in place thanks to the red hook and clip its a very accurate system and works very well youll want to open and close it over and over again now finnaly to the fig the general himself a very impressive fig with a new head and torso mold in this set which is one of only two with greivous in it he comes with 2 green and two blue lightsabers all with bley hilts   i was hoping for chrome hilts but its a minor fault grievous also comes with a new mold pistol blaster not pictured heres the general in the cockpit sadly a weak cockpit no details he just half lays down on a small slope in this set he doesnt come with a cape beacuse with it on the cockpit doesnt close thats about it heres the final verdict build 710 fairly easy but fun a little bit weak playability 810 many playability factors but some are boring or pointless swooshability 810 very fun to fly around sometimes pieces break off minifigs 1010 one amazing fig with 4 lightsabers and a new blaster what more could you ask for design 910 very sleek but hardly any real texture i like it but others might want greebling price 1010 overall score 910 a very cool ship with a very cool minifig and accessories one of the best sw sets i have ever seen for its small price i highly recommend it to any kind of sw lego or sw lego fan hope you enjoyed my review please leave feedback edited by jimbutcher 15 september 2008  0301 am	positive

jameseh on jun 28 2008 0824 pm said does the sliding cockpit come off easily my friends brothers breaks everytime you touch it but he may have built it wrong it put me off the set im very sad to say that sometimes it does but thats only if you hold it from the top and bottom with your fingers and thumb respectivly but if you hold it in your palm or from the sides it wont break emphasis on sometimes but dont try to mess around with it by removing its pieces or adding new one or modding it in any way because the sliding mechanism wont agree with the mods and break but this hardly takes away from anyone liking this set because imo its perfect just how it is	negative

hello all eurobricks members i will be doing the second wave of the 2008 impulse set series which had released recently i bought this set earlier ago and will like to share this comprehensive review with everyone of you name troll warrior theme lego system  castle year 2008 pieces 19 minifigs 1 an image of a 5618 troll warrior let the march begin the mighty brave troll warrior carrying a dangerous cart equipped with a flick fire missile marching into the lands of the crown kingdom crown knights must be ready for this new troll addition from what i see this set has a very minimum piece count since its an impulse set there is no unique parts found in this set however this set has a couple of useful accessories such as 2 spears and 2 wooden wheels and a grey mouse running around this set is another alternative for castle army builders to buy multiple sets to build a massive troll armies in addition the flick missile really works use a little bit of force from your finger and flick it the missile will fly well it certainly does not impress me at all with such playing feature base of the cart different angles there is one thing i dislike about this set the wooden wheels are too big and it is the same as the ones in the crossbow attack i prefer the smaller wheels that exist in old castle sets that produced smaller cart since this cart size is similar to the old cart size the old wizards cart is a very good example of the proposed wheel bits and pieces closeup on the warrior and the mouse summary review playability 5510 the playability feature is not fanastic design 6510 design is adequate if the wheels is much smaller and the flicking thing disappear the score will be much higher price 810 an inexpensive set to get a troll warrior and a mouse overall 610 to conclude this set is good only for army builders a new range of millitary vehicle to be added thats all hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine comments and critics are strongly welcomed pictures can be found in my brickshelf when moderated edited by kimt 10 august 2008  0129 pm	positive

guys thanks for your kind comments i am glad to know that you have enjoyed viewing this review trooperdavinfelth on jul 2 2008 1115 pm said its a rat i thought by calling it as a mouse it will be a little much friendly unlike calling it a rat brainbox on jul 2 2008 1120 pm said thanks for the review bearing in mind that the whole point of this set is to get a cheap troll warrior i actually quite like it the cart isnt brilliant but for 13 pieces its not that bad the troll fig is great as always and i guess the rats are always nice to get not so much in real life though the sets that contain the trolls have a fairly solid number each i mean tower raid has three but nevertheless i think i may have to pick up a few of these norro on jul 3 2008 0610 am said a more affordable troll warrior for those of us avoiding the large sets me is always nice thanks for the review i must agreed with the both of you that this is a much easier way to acquire these troll warriors at a much affordable price i am glad these trolls are available in impulse sets now will there will be a dwarf impulse set in the future i supposed that will be much interesting glman on jul 3 2008 1215 am said its a good review but you forgot another thing the troll needs a shiled like they used to in the 2007 castle line the sets always had shields for the minifigs and it could be better if it was 300 instead of 350 but yes it is a good impulse great army builder if this impulse set includes a troll shield my rating will defintely go higher this is a troll army builder set with minimum feature and limited weapons range if the troll comes with an armor or a shield i will think this set is worth it troll armor is hard to get by as it appeared only in troll warship and tower raid edited by whitefang 03 july 2008  0306 am	positive
grrr you beat me to it i got two of these in the mail today and was so eager to do a review of it thanks for saving me the work edited by wilhelm screamer 03 july 2008  0330 am	positive
hey your review is great as usual as for the set itself  well its an impulse set after all  small and cheap nothing special well the rat is special hehe for me the rat is the most interesting in the set cause i dont have a rat i dont have a troll warrior either but im not very interested	neutral
quote in addition the flick missile really works use a little bit of force from your finger and flick it the missile will fly well it certainly does not impress me at all with such playing feature something to toughen up kids fingers thanks for the review cant wait til i get this comes to oz	positive
whitefang on jul 3 2008 0406 am said now will there will be a dwarf impulse set in the future i supposed that will be much interesting i certainly hope so i only have one hollisbrick on jul 3 2008 1025 am said thanks for the review cant wait til i get this comes to oz hey im still waiting for somewhere in the uk other than tlc itself to get the first wave of impulse sets	neutral
nice review i will definately need a few of these	positive
whitefang on jul 4 2008 0543 pm said well mouse sounded more friendly because it can associate with tom and jerry but calling it a rat equal calling it a pest its just a matter of putting it in different terms thats all the thing i dont get is how jerry is friendly	neutral
hello all eurobricks members i will be doing a continuation of my impulse set reviews i was pretty excited when i laid my hands on these new impulse sets yesterday hope to give most of you a good insight for this set name street cleaner theme lego system  town  city year 2008 pieces 22 minifigs 1 an image of a 5620 street cleaner let the cleaning begin the street cleaner has a job to do it is to clean the rubbish on the streets after a new year countdown it seemed the cleaning agency have a new equipment to use its not as big as the previous street sweeper machine the cleaner will need to operate the equipment manually by pushing it look at the mess after sorting out look at the pieces offered its not a very complicated set since its an impulse set there are some pretty useful parts lying around such as the broom spade however i was quite surprised when i could not find the lid of the rubbish bin i cant used this rubbish bin to place it around my town without a lid on top of it i believed it is not a norm by not including the lid look at that bin well that rubbish bin seem to be containing his equipment in it instead of the rubbish the cleaners face looks pretty sad i think he wants to have a change of job front view i love that blue brush very much quite fun to play with especially pushing the rubbish aside thats why a spade is there to help him to dig out the litter and the broom to brush it away ok now i know why his face looks so sad where is that street sweeper machine summary review playability 6510 not bad to play with design 7510 the design is relatively interesting with the use of the technic part to be its foundation price 810 an inexpensive set to get another cleaner and some neat accessories overall 710 not a bad set after all pretty average but still quite good to buy if your towns required more cleaners hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine comments and critics are strongly welcomed pictures can be found in my brickshelfwhen moderated edited by whitefang 04 july 2008  0344 pm	positive
thanks for the review  not a bad price of course its impulse for a fig a little cleaner thing and two accesories the brush fig and spade i dont have yet so i might just pick this up	positive
looking at this is making me want to build one of the favourite sets of my childhood 6649 street sweeper might do that today actually cheap good pieces despite the lack of a bin lid thats just inviting disaster isnt it nice fig and one of those blue brushes which ive always loved but never managed to use thanks whitefang	positive
wow what a great little impulse set i relly dig the face as well as a chance to get some cool accessories like a broom bin no lidsigh and a mushroom top hat a really nice review and story too whitefang i think this guy will be joining my set of lego when he shows up in australia cheers isc	positive
hello all eurobricks members i will be doing a continuation of my impulse set reviews this will be the third review at a go hope everyone of you will find this review useful in a way name coast guard kayak theme lego system  town  city year 2008 pieces 21 minifigs 1 an image of a 5621 coast guard kayak roll roll roll your boat it seemed the coast guard has a kayak of his own roaming in the sea making sure that swimmers will be safe in the beach now i am illustrating him as a life guard instead this set is simply wonderful among the 4 new impulse sets coast guard kayak is the best looking set in my opnion the kayak design is very simple but looks realistic  furthermore if you dont need it to be a coast guard kind of stuff use it as a leisure water spot instead down in the marina i will think any lego citizen will love to have some water spot in their busy life so come down here and wind down with this new sport bits and pieces kayak and the bouy the bouy is very useful to position it at the coast of your water to highlight the boundaries in the sea and warning incoming ships or vessels oh i did not make it tilted purposely there is a white round base which allow it to tilt on both ends useful parts these parts are useful to add on in your city somehow when i see that red cone i can use it as a police stop to inspect vehicles on the road or form a barricade with it the bouy base shape is unique too i like it very much it is great to attached it by the side of the boat as a life bouy the coast guards life vest and helmet are very useful for water activites the life vest was produced in past sets and now it resurfaced again i am glad these vests made their way back a look of him without the life vest summary review playability 7510 fun to play with especially the bouy when you see it moving up and down design 8510 design is simple but straight to the point especially the kayak design price 810 an inexpensive set to get more coast guards and more kayaks overall 8510 a very good set to have in your lego town the kayak is simply so lovely to me hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine comments and critics are strongly welcomed pictures can be found in my brickshelf when moderated	positive
thanks for doing these impulse sets whitefang this set looks like it has a good number of useful parts i dont have the minifig torso or head nor the oar or the life jacket	positive
whitefang on jul 3 2008 0318 am said this set is simply wonderful you know thats exactly what i thought i love it its simple well designed and cute there are some nice pieces in there as well and i really do quite like the fig the new coastguard torso looks great thanks	positive

hello all eurobricks members this will be my last impulse set review for the second wave hope everyone of you will find my reviews useful and helpful in your purchase name crystal hawk theme lego system  mars mission year 2008 pieces 26 minifigs 1 an image of a 5619 crystal hawk alpha 3 in sector 5 reporting to base alpha 3 crystal hawk reporting for duty sir may i present mars mission latest scout craft code named crystal hawk this spacecraft looks very sleek and cool with its usual white and orange color combination i am not a fan of mars mission but these white minifigs simply attracted me for it in fact i only owned its impulse sets and none of its main sets nevertheless this set has the swoosh factor i was swooshing around in my home last night well i am not swooshing it like kimt though am i seeing double haha the answer is no it has double sided face i combined the pictures to illustrate the two facial expressions bits and pieces different angles love the way how the wings bend upwards and downwards the only thing i find it a little bit wierd for spacecraft normally i thought joystick is the typical navigation controls for a spacecraft instead of a steering wheel i am not complaining about a steering wheel in a spacecraft to me its quite an uncommon sight anyway the white steering wheel is an useful part for making vehicles mocs summary review playability 810 fun to play with when you bend the wings up and down design 8510 design is simple but creates a sleek and cool look price 810 an inexpensive set to get more scout craft and mars mission minifigs overall 8510 a very good set to have for any mars mission fans and for collectors like me whom cant afford all mars mission sets this set is a very great alternative hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine comments and critics are strongly welcomed pictures can be found in my brickshelf when moderated	positive
thanks for pics the hawk it seems to me lacks a cockpit theres not even a seat to keep the pilot from falling off perhaps it theyd redesigned it to be a backpack jetpack sort of unit using similar pieces itd at least make some sense based on the other mm impluses can we assume this goes for 35usd at that price it seems to me that the astro fighter at 5usd was already a superior impluse set guess id buy one on clearance for the minifig	neutral
thanks for another review whitefang this is quite a nice set actually it evokes some of the design elements of the mx11 while looking different enough to justify me buying it the head on the astronaut is one i like so even better i hadnt realised it was that one actually does 26 pieces make it one of the bigger impulses sets i think i may have to get one if not two plus its called crystal hawk how can that not be considered cool	positive
nice review good little set probable one of the only impusle sets i will be geting untillif they make agents theme impulse sets and i like the neat doublesided face edited by darthlegois619 03 july 2008  1035 am	positive

thanks for the great review now i just have to have that set	positive
thank you for the nice review this set has a very classic space feeling so i dont care about the lack of cockpit a nice little set with a nice minifig	positive
i really like the look of this impulse set even though i sold off my mm sets to buy sw i kept my astro fighter and this impulse set really appealed from the moment i laid eyes on it i feel the swooshability and cool extras like the double sided face far outweigh the lack of cockpit thanks for another great review whitefang	positive
i like this one aswell it has a couple of parts i need for an moc train locomotive and i dont have any of those space guys yet and a double faced guy is always a winner in my book	positive

excellent review sc thanks for sharing the figs are awesome i really like the female villain  an excellent face i also like the agent uniforms the laser gun is perfect it has that peter sellerspink panther dooms day device look that i envision when i think of laser destruction the volcano has some neat features as well like the trans redorange lava it is a bit heavy on stickers though as are many new setsthemes but overall i think this set will really appeal to the kids  a great review of a neat set	positive

i didnt exactly know where this belongs the best but i think it fits the best in here cause its somewhat space related i got this nifty little set yesterday from an auction ebay new and sealed i think the rock raiders theme was a great theme and i wish they would have continues id back then but anyway lets see what we got here set nr 4910 name hover scout number of minifigs 1 number of pieces 39 release year 1999 first a picture of the little box  instructions a general overview of the set and here we have the lovely  miss jet yes the minifigures had odfficial names in this theme  the little vehicle and finally the crystal analysis station i like that very much even if its simple but it does a good job and the amount of equipment also is cool thats it little set little review but big fun i can recommend that to everybody its great for the parts and the minifig is lovely gets a 1010 from me	positive
omg iamdeds torso  spoiler oh my god spoiler	positive
excuse me butwhat	neutral
when i got this set my first rock raiders set i thought it was the best set i ever had maybe that was a little bit of an overstatement but i like a lot the pieces mainly and this is a nice little review are92 rowar on jul 10 2008 0822 pm said omg iamdeds torso  spoiler oh my god spoiler what would be more appropriate is commenting on iamdeds torso saying omg jets torso	positive

7663 sith infiltrator year 2007 number of pieces 310 number of minifigs 1 price 2999 usd brickset hello everyone and welcome to my second review on eurobricks the sith infiltrator lets start with a pic of the box shall we as you can see its a limited edition set meaning the fig and set could be worth a lot in the future this set takes about 20 minuets for the seasoned builder an overview of the infiltrator also know as the scimitar as seen in the picture this ship is very sleek with very few studs on top snot studs not on top basically its the cockpit with two wings with two fins on each wing attached to the hull heres a side view of the scimitar very cool looking it lands on two feet in the front while the cockpit rests on the ground rear view the back the outer cockpit is beautiful a printed piece on the back no dreaded sticker sheet dss and a large printed disc on top heres a look at the middle there is a flickfire missile transred cone attach to technic pin on the inner wing a transred lightsaber blade in the back of the hull and a transred lightsaber blade in between the fins on either side all of those lightsaber blades may come in handy hey look the fins open from the wings the fins open due to double hinges on each fin unfortunately you have to hold the ship up in order for the bottom fins to open now lets have a look inside the cockpit to open you lift the back printed part which is attached to the printed disc on top which is attached to a hinge it opens pretty smoothly but is somewhat loose so sometimes it closes on its own also the disc isnt secured well enough to the door and often breaks off even with the smallest movement to it inside there is an elevated control panel and two sliding pieces near the floor this ship also comes with a small speeder bike its very cleverly built and is a really neat addition see that clear disc on the bottom it fits perfectly into the sliding pieces in the cockpit hmm whats this a hidden compartment now this was a very cool idea by tlg a secret compartment found by taking off the top slope of the hull contains darth mauls weapons and tools which include a chrome lightsaber hilt a pair of electrobinouculars and three probe droids a closeup of a probe droid just a plain black minifig head with a black lever on top finally the fig darth maul in the flesh plastic a good fig altogether with a black hood and lightsaber blades taken from the ship he did come with a crisp new black cape packaged in a small white cardboard box but i am currently using it for another fig note that this is a limited edition fig so stock up a comparison pic of the two mauls the 2007 version is on the left and the 1999 version on the right note a few key differences between the two the new one has smaller red tattoos and a smoother torso also the new one has bigger eyes and a more cartoony look maul on the speeder bike of course he fits perfectly in the cockpit wile sitting on the bike and he can reach the controls well thats about it here is the final verdict build 810 easy and fun breaks every once in a while playability 710 this set has many features but is very fragile between the cockpit and hull and between the two cockpit pieces swooshability 110 too fragile to fly around plus the flick fire missiles fall out minifigs 910 a great fig with a chrome hilt and a double sided blade a little cartoony design 710 very clever techniques very sleek but very fragile price 810 fair enough could be a few dollars cheaper overall score 6510 a very sleek ship with clever building and play techniques but very very fragile and shouldnt be picked up off of the shelf too often and with that my review is over but all of yours are not comments and thoughts very welcome edited by jimbutcher 15 september 2008  0259 am indexed	neutral

jimbutcher on jul 10 2008 0944 pm said a hidden compartment now this was a very cool idea by tlg a secret compartment found by taking off the top slope of the hull youre supposed to slide the front of the hull off rather than lift the top piece off	neutral
led zeppelin on jul 10 2008 0446 pm said youre supposed to slide the front of the hull off rather than lift the top piece off yeah i was looking at the construction booklet and it reminded me of that i forgot about it but that makes it more fragile	neutral
i got this set last year and i think you made a mistake when you have remove a piece to access the probe droids and equipment you just have to slide the entire main part and i have a question is this equipped with the new flickfire missiles that dont fall off	neutral
thank you for the nice review i like the design although i didnt want to buy it the new little speeder is very nice but maybe a little to small darth mauls eyes are looking a bit more dangerous now	neutral
a very neatly designed sith infiltrator though i think it lacks the size of the older version a fine ship but not what i would call a sith infiltrator it should be bigger thanks for another fine sw review kimt	negative
hey all so i purchased the remaining three agents sets i needed and saw that there was no review up yet for this set heres the first batch of parts and the first instruction bits the mini figures the first small vehicles heres a mistake that i found in the instruction booklet there is no difference between steps 2 and 3 the team inferno boat this is a nice chunky boat that looks fairly heavy duty and evily its nice to see the smooth disks on the bottom that lego seemingly havnt done in recent boatplane sets and the agents submarine this is a nice build aswell nice and long with a few hidden compartments one for missiles a place to put the treasure some final shots of the completed set the spare bits another special mention has to go out to slime face i think he is my favourite ever lego character the detail on his unique torso is brilliant his head is fantastic and his costume just looks great with the black and green plus green is my favourite colour check out the back of his torso with the slime pouring down deep sea quest was £3499 price  910  this is a pretty reasonable price for a fairly substantial set parts  810  a lot of nice bits few nice boats bits and a lot of smooth disk things minifigures  1010 as i said slime face is my favourite lego character and the details brilliant vehicles  810 both very good with some interesting features build  810 a pretty fun build overall  910 its gotta be if just for slime face alone but this really is a great set	positive
im not real fond of slimeface he looks too much like the jokerbombs i was hoping for something newer the slime printing is a nice touch though steve	negative
he does look a bit different thoughalthough it hasnt come out well on the photos there is some green printed slimey bits on his head aswell he honestly is amazing	positive

pencoin on jul 10 2008 0113 pm said thanks for reviewi hope svelt corps still reviews it  slime is pretty cool i knew about the torse for a while but its no less cool now youre so mean  isnt one review good enough  do you just have to be picky  nice review by the way 	neutral
nice review rezourceman i wanted to see one of this set it seems there isnt much to it other than what it looks like in the official pictures but i may well get it i like slime face	neutral
great review rezourceman your pics really show off the sub well and its good to see the build in progress i also have this set but i didnt apply stickers to the sub as i was planning to reuse the nice dark blue pieces however as shown in your review they do brighten it up a fair bit i cant say this is my favourite agents set the boat is a little oddly proportioned and the sub although retro looking has practically no interior and would be difficult to customise to put more in unlike say the clever job batbrick did with the penguin sub in his review the sub kind of looks like some jules verneish sea creature  i would have liked it if theyd gone all the way and made it some kind of giant robot jellyfish or squid i do agree with you about slime face  he has a fantastic torso with all the slime dripping down which is a bit obscured by the air tank its really encouraging that in the last 2 missions weve had great extra villains added in the only thing i would add about the octopus is that the glow in the dark plastic is mixed in unevenly with the aqua blue so it doesnt glow in the dark evenly  its kind of like the mars mission jellies in that respect though much cooler thanks again for the great review	negative
sveltecorps on jul 11 2008 0914 am said i would have liked it if theyd gone all the way and made it some kind of giant robot jellyfish or squid coughalphateamcough anyway i was about to reply earlier and say  great review svelte then i realised it was not you nice reveiw anyway the only reason i would get this set would be if i got all the other agents sets  all the sw cw sets  all the pieces i need on bl  all the new city ect setsthen i would think about geting it	neutral
darthlegois on jul 11 2008 1028 am said color0000ff coughalphateamcough id forgotten about ogels mutant vehicles i guess i meant a bigger cross between the 8636 sub and the big squid from 7775 aquabase invasion  that is such a great design sort of keep the retro feel but make it bigger with the 8636 sub theres really only room for one agent to sit and despite its size theres just a few not amazingly great functions such as the hidden chest and missiles	positive

it was £3499 so usd its likely to be 4555 i would imagine	neutral

great review really thanks i slime face even slimey as my slime sense nice that break jaw is also in it undersigned mowo	neutral
great review this set totally owns alpha team deep sea the sub design actually looks like a sub the figures are way better the acessories are better  everything is better agents may have my vote for the best theme of the year quote i wonder if it will last longer than one year unlike other recent oneanddone themes oh dont worry  a second wave will be coming next year this was confirmed by both legomilk and in an interview with an agents designer	positive
batbrick on jul 19 2008 0953 am said is it impossible or just very hard to mod nothing is impossible to mod probably the easiest part to change would be the front where the missiles are and the treasure chest slides out  you could make a sizeable compartment there however the middle section is so narrow and the end fins are just that  fins  that it might be harder to expand without changing the shape of the sub youll find out soon when yours arrives batbrick on jul 19 2008 0953 am said the octopus sounds great thanks for that is he meant to be on any side im guessing hes a mutant inferno creature about slime face is his head much different to the joker bombs i know he has slime marks on his head are they very apparent its not really clear but since all the other mutants are evil or at least controlled by dr inferno its probably a safe bet the squid is too slime faces head is different to the joker bombs  different eyes and teeth although the smile is similar i guess and the slime marks are much more apparent in the flesh or abs although they dont photograph that way joker bomb face below for contrast	neutral
wow thanks for the review that is one awesome set slime face is excellent i must add him to the collection i think we need some new agents theres so many inferno minifigures now maybe next year thanks again	positive
great looking set and that glowy blue octopus is really cute i might just get it for that be great in a space moc wondering from the pdf instructions i saw it wasnt clear what the agent in the sub is sitting on hows his seat work and it looks like theres a compartment below him	positive
6927 all terrain vehicle year released 1981 piece count 167 minifigs 2 list price 1450 a very unique vehicle in the classic space collection was this allterrain vehicle which i always considered more along the line of a mobile lab the set introducedinfused white and black bricks with classic blue space pieces the result was this great classic vehicle the set includes two figs still red and white heres a view of the vehicle which is really two components the vehicle itself and the lab section i absolutely loved the the blue windshield slopes 2 included and the unique upsidedown large blue slope in the back of the vehicle is the blue lab the back section of the vehicle has hinges that allow the jets sections to open the brick design fits perfectly into the lab and when opened the lab falls to the ground note the little round trans red 1x1s allow the lab to slide up and forward when the jet sections are closed i tried taking off the red 1x1s and the lab does not lift as easily with them the design is very clever esp for a classic set heres a shot of the standalone lab unlike earlier classic space windows this set has train window frames with yellow windows the top of the lab lifts up for playability inside the lab are several computers and a swivel chair back to the vehicle heres a shot of the cockpit with white steering wheel the left side has an upsidedown wrench and black antenna the right side a walkietalkie and another antenna the antennas can be used as breaks to keep the middle wheels from moving heres ashot of the under carriage and a final shot of the complete set for those of you following my classic space reviews this is review number 9 of 10 my final review of anall time favorite will be coming soon hope you enjoyed this review comments are always welcome	positive
thebrickster on jul 10 2008 1048 pm said for those of you following my classic space reviews this is review number 9 of 10 my final review of anall time favorite will be coming soon no more of your great reviews why a good review right here got into the thick of the set without becoming boring with an absence of pictures or not having enough text this looks like a good set and id better catch up with the rest of your reviews asap	neutral
this is a great little set i like how it combines two very different color schemes for different parts of the model i have made some slight modifications to mine adding a roof on the vehicle and a back wall on the outpost also those white 1x1 headlight plates at the front are thinner than the modern kind and seem to be quite weak i got this set off ebay a while ago and one of them was broken in shipping even though the set was otherwise in display model condition and the other one broke off while i was building the set i replaced them with the newer variety mutex on jul 10 2008 1137 pm said my only complain about this set was that i found that the wheels where too small  i had some trouble passing the rover over the little cratersmountains of the space plates the only bad thing about this set is the name it cant even roll over a single plates height not very all terrain at all edited by cp5670 11 july 2008  0743 am	positive
give me an excuse to sneak into your house and let me have a feel of these classic space sets i never had a chance to have any experience with the classic space sets through your recent reviews on these it gave me a wider perspective of space i loved to play space as a child such as the late classic and futuron sets back to the review this 6927 is a great mobile command center vehicle suitable for all kinds of harsh terrain in the unknown space the 6 big wheels are real solid and firm back in those days transparent blue windscreen at the front is wonderful i just love these parts especially when its in blue 4 computer printed tiles arent lego so generous back in those days when printed parts are more commonly available unlike now its a real nice set however there is one thing i dont understand about this design why is the driver seat has a wide back with no cover behind and the command center has no door at the back i understand that these space guys are always carrying their helmet around for oxygen supply i wonder if there is a better answer to it	positive
oh man this review takes me back i got this set when i was 8 years old and loved it i remember modding it to remove the lab in the back and i put in a giant laser cannon instead cause when youre 8 years old everything needs a giant laser cannon cp5670 on jul 11 2008 1243 am said the only bad thing about this set is the name it cant even roll over a single plates height not very all terrain at all ha very true the vehicle is built so low to the ground that the front end catches on everything	positive
quote great buy on this one what did it cost you it was 30 which was a pretty good price given the condition it had no box or instructions though this set is actually fairly common on ebay though considering how old it is i see them pretty frequently on there quote its a real nice set however there is one thing i dont understand about this design why is the driver seat has a wide back with no cover behind and the command center has no door at the back i understand that these space guys are always carrying their helmet around for oxygen supply i wonder if there is a better answer to it i just modified mine to make everything fully enclosed edited by cp5670 11 july 2008  0639 pm	neutral
thebrickster on jul 11 2008 1016 pm said yes the extra space was probably for the oxygen tanks on the figs it makes taking them off a lot easier as for the labcontrol center i never had an issue with it being open i think this was just for playability one could always pretend that some sort of invisible force ray closed the side when activated invisible force fieldray that is a very neat idea i dont have much problem with it either was just curious about the design as i am not very familar with classic space i supposed the oxygen tanks is quite big to carry around especially when the vehicle is so cramped these allowance of space makes them much mobile to move about in the vehicle cp5670 on jul 12 2008 0239 am said i just modified mine to make everything fully enclosed great job thanks for sharing and answering the question i posted above i love the way you modify the front and back now i need to find where is the entrance to the mobile command center	neutral
ive always associated this set with 6929 the voyager theyre of the same timeframe and more or less the same style 6927 is without any doubt my favourite ground vehicle of space it was pretty simple but it was such a creative set the stories you could tell with this model g most defenitely in my top 5 of space sets	positive
this set never got me as a kid i suspect it was because of the wheels i had mostly basic sets so it would have been more of the same looking at it now i can see i have misjudged it and i love the lablift method im going to have to build this to see it in action thanks for another great review	positive
awesome review brickster i didnt you are also a space fan oh how i love classic space the all time perfect lego space related theme everytime i see one i want to buy them more and more when compared to modern fang dangled sets with detailed figs and cool new accessories they have nothing on classic space simple beauty maybe its the bluegreytrans yellow color scheme classic space forever edited by piranha 30 august 2009  0751 am	positive
yeah first time that i am getting a set before everyone first of all the package the european version has no limited edition button hooray sorry for the blurry backshot we see the hospital back a few bubbles with set functions and a little comic comic bubbles the figures are injured spongebob patrick and the new fish doctor spongebob has a headprint and a backprint other than the normal spongebob spongebob and injured bob the set comes with two litters the ambulance car is a bit extraordinary i don´t know how the car is like in the show and i saw a lot of episodes but it looks a bit strange mostly because the weehls are too small of course we get another ss not so d this time the litter fits in the back with help of this lid i wish it would be the hingelid from before 2004 now we come to the meanpart of the set the hospital the entrance has got babyblue traindoors and a hudge sign that shows emergency the tubes are nearly everywhere in this set i was getting insane when i came to the part where i must put the stickers on the tubes this parts are very usefull but i wanted that the set looks good because i will display it so i stickered just two of the parts and not all four now we come to the interroir the doctor has a desk with computer sadly it´s not very well placed and he must duck because of his fin next to the door we get this little case wash basin and two drawers again we get stickers not that i don´t like stickers it´s just everytime i get to the part where i must put the stickers on i think how i can reuse the model and if i rebuild the model later and and and i hate it to deside a few posters are in it too the set is a great addittion to your own bikino bottom but the playability is not very big for the kids they can just play that patrick steals the ambulance car like shown on the package and is hitting spongebob than the drive back the doctor gives spongebob two medicines and let him go i bought the set mostly because of the parts tubes in lightbley and a few woodpieces but i am thinking about let it stand in my little bikini bottom just consist of crusty crab and chum bucket playability 310 figures 1010 price 810 design 910 total 3040	positive
oh so spongebob was the injured one i thought this set depicted the episode wherein mr krabs was the one rushed to the hospital	neutral
i love the sponge bob sets i have all of them nice review	positive

ronan nissen on jul 15 2008 0709 am said the fish doctor is supposed to have a new torso says who i think the one he has is fine	positive
i never have buy a sponge bob set but this looks so cool so maybe just maybe i will buy it  i am curious of why tlc haven´t done the flying dutchman ship it was in the first rumor list of sponge bob sets that surely will be a must 	neutral
this set doesnt have much playability but the hospital is better than the one released by lego recently it has more detail i like it	neutral
theres a lot great pieces in this set i would be willing to get the set just for them thanks for the great review	positive
my fish doctor has the torso from 7902 doctors car which is unfortunate because the other torso is more stylized and cartoonish i think however i did have that mad scientist lab set so a bit of digging through my old collection will hopefully yield the better torso	neutral
i recently bought this set for my daughters birthday its the first belville set that ive bought for her so its a bit of an experiment the house is 5 rooms and its made up of mostly large pieces there still is a decent amount of normal lego in it though the doorways in the house align when it is opened out starting with the bathroom included is a shower toilet sink with vanity and a baby potty the mirror sticker is one of the few that i put on the open plan loungekitchendining room is well appointed as well and it has a nice glass table and coffee machine the kitchen chairs are fabuland parts and dont work really well it seems they are having jellyfish for dinner the clock is the only printed part in the set upstairs is a baby room and the master bedroom the radio and the tv not shown were stickers to my disappointment up top is an extra room suitable for reading those antenna things were made from spare parts by my daughter i have no idea what they are supposed to be  there are some stickers that go on the back but i didnt put them on as it is the set looks ok this way but since it is a dolls house it doesnt really matter i do think though that the fireplace should have been given a back the bbq is made from normal parts and is quite effective i think it uses the same light brick thats in the 4998 stegosaurus set my kids were using it as a torch before my grumbling ruined their fun like all belville sets the highlight is arguably the accessories ill be borrowing a few of these from time to time here is the controversial baby catapult as you can see it works ok but lego probably should have tried a bit harder we also bought for her 7583 playful puppy it also comes with some nice accessories but not enough to justify buying unless you want the rest of the parts poor puppy where does he sleep here is my daughter assembling it she made me make the house though as she wanted to play a game we bought her note the lego drink bottles  i didnt take any photos of the figures as they dont seem to be anything new but i can if people want me to at the time i was in bit of a hurry as i took these before bed so i wouldnt be stressed if the kids broke it the next day overall these sets seem overpriced to me and hard to justify unless you actually want a buildable dolls house which we did its still too early to tell if my daughter likes it or not but at this stage it seems she lost interest in a few days she does tend to go back to toys though edited by whitefang 23 may 2009  0703 pm indexed	negative

excellent review its nice to see how its nice to see how   its nice  okay i cant get over the sex in the bedroom and the unattended baby crawling into the oven i didnt read anything else except where does the puppy sleep and my daughter made me build this you are sick and twisted and thats why i love you it seems you are coining the belville edge now will you please stop sitting around eating clams and get that baby out of the oven or make the fun in the bedroom a threeway please thank you ps ok i read it i want the baby toilet and i think the jellyfish is supposed to be a jellomold i bet you knew that the fireplace lattice look like the harry potter one and not the fabuland one boo wienies when your daughter outgrows it will you turn it into a belleville star wars moc please thank you in advance	positive
baby catapult you say puts a basenet to shame top review by the way lego drink bottles for the win edited by mrs pegleg blockbeard 12 july 2008  0637 am	positive
i was sort of hoping for a flickfire baby still this looks decent for what it is i guess obviously it really is all about the accessories and its got em but not enough to make me spend that kind of cash and i dont even mind having a pile of pink parts around if you throw in a complete turkey or some birthday cakes its a slam dunk but as it is eh thanks for the review though its very nicely presented and leaves no doubt in my mind as to just how easy this set would be to misuse for other purposes	neutral
nice review good to see your almost letting your kids play with your lego i like the functionality of the baby catapult its good that they include some working features in a build this big are you not showing the figures because its really hugh hefners playboybelville mansion i dont see the grotto though must be an add on set like the poor puppy its just so darn pink	positive
the lego lives on but you are one evil parent getting your kids addicted to belville like that but uh whats that doll doing on the bed whats underneath it and look what you found a bucket	neutral
great review sinner i havent seen a bellville set review before i just realised what you meant by fore in the topic subtitle too imperialshadows on jul 12 2008 0931 am said obviously it really is all about the accessories and its got em but not enough to make me spend that kind of cash and i dont even mind having a pile of pink parts around i agree a lot of the pieces are good but i dont think i would get it however i do think i will get the set with the dogs so my minifigs can have giant mutant hounds jimbutcher on jul 12 2008 0645 pm said and look what you found a bucket a bucket in disguise as a watering can	neutral

sinner you know i had never seen a belville set in any review with such great pictures before i just cant take my eyes off in the master bedroom the scene is quite a little hot enough of me peeping up there lets take a look at the interior i am very surprised by its construction of the house its quite big and is nice of you to buy a great sweet gift for your daughter i am very sure she will enjoyed playing with it somehow it reminded me of barbie doll products maybe its too pinkish for me the accessories is the plus factor in any belville sets it offered quite a handful of great accessories to add into any types of mocs construction to add in the plus factor in it sinner you are a very nice dad i like how parents buy educational toys for their children to expand their imaginations instead of sitting in a couch playing video games and etc	positive
thanks for your report and the pics my sister wants this set but shes already got the last house and she doesnt play very often with it but the new one looks very good too	positive
sinner on jul 25 2008 0947 pm said im still undecided on if it was a smart buy she played with it a lot this week but last week she ignored it and i had to fix it twice my daughter is 12 and she still plays with all her belville stuff mostly the fairy princess castle sets if your daughter is anything like mine you will definitely get your moneys worth out of it however  as soon as my daughter says shes done with it i plan on raiding the sets for all those great food and accessory bits patience  great review by the way the belville sets are indeed overpriced but theyre probably legos best attempt at wooing the girl audience i still hate the fact that tlc thinks they need separate boy themes and girl themes but whatever theyre a very nice alternative to barbie  you get posable figures with realistic body proportions plus some creativity and building aspects thrown in	positive
i bought this today mainly because it was 25 off but id been eyeing it for a long time the accessories truly are brilliant theres so much here to be pillaged for other uses as people have said i picked up heaps of new parts ive never had or rare ones in even rarer colours to be honest i was surprised and impressed by the range and versatility of the regular bricks as well when you look at the box art what jumps out at you are the giant pink walls and curved pieces but theres a nice amount of white arches and lime green bricks not to mention all the windows and the trans blue 1x2x5 bricks and plants its a good thing the target audience likes stickers though theres more here than ive seen on any set except the 7709 sentai fortress i think they were aiming for one sticker per page of instructions i hope belville returns in 2010 thanks for the review sieggy did your daughter ever go back to it	positive

7655 clone battle pack year 2007 number of pieces 58 number of minifigs 4 price 999 usd brickset welcome to my third review on eurobricks i hope you enjoy while at any store that sells lego target walmart tru etc you will notice that the clone battle packs on the shelf are way fewer in number than the droids battle pack as you might guess the clones are way more popular and finding them gets harder and harder as the release date of this set goes farther into the past so stock up alright heres a pic of the box a small box as expected for inexpensive sets like these note the build your army button on the front tlg obviously is encouraging customers to buy multiples and with good reason which will be explained later in this review well lets get straight to it the contents of this set you will notice a speeder bike a gun turret and some clones looking good so far lets have a look at the turret an excellent star wars element to have around especially for mocing it is very cleverly built using a tire guard from city sets for the general shape of the turret mount all you have to do is attach the new mold explained later gun to the 2x1 plate with the center stud and presto i wonder how the clones build these turrets to fast in the middle of battle a rear view with a clone mounted my only gripe about the turret is that you have to take off the gun in order for every clone to have a gun now we move on to the vehicle of the set the speeder bike a rather sleek and good looking bike with some useful pieces on it as well such as the blue cones the megaphones and the engines some say it looks bare without the figs mounted on it but i think it looks just fine the commander drives while a trooper shoots on the back a side view and a rear view my only gripe is the same as the turret you have to remove the back gun for all the clones to have weapons while on foot the back pistol attaches to a 2x2 round studded plate with a technic hole in the middle finnaly here are the new guns this set comes with 1 new blaster rifle and three new pistols it could have included one more rifle for the turret and of course the figs includes 1 yellow commander lovely fig 1 shocktrooper comes with a pair of elctrobinouculars and two regular troopers so clean and white the figs are excellent all that any sw or lego fan should want it could have maybe included one more regular trooper but that might be pushing it thats all for now folks here is the final verdict build 810 extremely easy should take the seasoned builder about 5 minutes to complete a fun build though playability 510 i guess you can get this with the droid battle pack and make them battle but this set has no real play features of its own but it is good for collecting troops and using them for mocs swooshability 910 i guess you can zoom the speeder bike around minifigs 1010 four great figs that should be bought in multiples a great army builder design 1010 a clever turret an awesome speeder and four great clones what more do you need in a 10 dollar set price 810 not bad i suppose but if you calculate a dime for each piece this set should come out to 56 dollars but still billions of these are being sold worldwide and tlg is making a ton of money off of them overall score 9510 a truly memorable set one that will be a favorite for ages to come and very popular a great army builder for a small price plus vehicle and turret with only a few very minor flaws this set is one of the best of star wars and this concludes my review and as always comments are most welcome	positive
i got like 5 of theses hope we get the new clone battlepack do you ever think we will we will only get 5 clones if you buy all the new republic sets	positive

7654 droids battle pack year 2007 number of pieces 102 number of minifigs 7 price 999 usd brickset hi everybody and welcome to my fourth review on eurobricks today i will review the droid bttle pack set note this set originally came with four megaphone blasters for each battle droid but i replaced them along with the crooked arms with the new blaster pistols and new twisted arms a picture of the box as it is on the shelves of majorretail stores a small box as expected for inexpensive sets like these note the build your army button on the front tlg obviously is encouraging customers to buy multiples and with good reason which will be explained later in this review an overview of the sets content you can see a droid carrying vehicle a stap and some battle super battle droids a look at the carrier a light tank note the guns on the front the guns and cockpit can turn a little bit left and right from the main body also the guns can move up and down free from the cockpit and check out the cockpit two 2x1 center studded plates side by side for the pilot to stand on now moving on to the stap a small very useful vehicle in the sw universe these are seen frequently in both the movies and games as well as other multimedia the design is very clever using vertical building and a clear stand rear view the guns handlebars can go this far back and finally the figs the figs are very good but very common we havent seen sbds in a while and now instead of metallic blue they are metallic dark grey the worst part of this set is that the battle droids have the old arms and guns while the droids in the mtt and clone pack both of the same year as this have the new ones i wonder why tlg decided to do that again this set originally came with four megaphone blasters for each battle droid but i replaced them along with the crooked arms with the new blaster pistols and new twisted arms so thats about it heres the final verdict build 810 very easy should take the seasoned builder about 510 minutes playability 610 has a few play feature but nothing exciting is good for mocs and army building swooshability 810 i suppose you could fly around the stap minifigs 710 the battle droids are good but very common and the dont come with new arms or guns the sbds are very nice and in a new color all figs are great for army building design 810 the stap was clever but the carrier was a little bulky price 1010 as fair as it gets overall 7510 the figs are great to have and make mocs and armies and the vehicles are pretty cool the carrier is a little lame the main problem with this set is that the bds dont get the new guns or arms so they dont fit in with all the new sets also droids arent as cool as clones but the price is very fair and now my review has ended unfortunately i believe this will be my last review for a long time for two reasons one the remaining sets that arent done according to kimts index i either dont have or are broken or have missing pieces and two my budget is low right now and i wont be able to get the clone wars sets right when they are released so someone will probably beat me to reviewing them too bad because i would love to do an rgs review well as always comments very welcome	positive

thanks everyone glad that you guys enjoyed this review rriggs on jul 13 2008 0806 pm said as for the wheels these were primarily technic wheels but did find their way into some other models in white i can only find a handful of minifig sets that they are included with theres half a dozen space sets but apart from the 4wheelin truck the only other town set appears to be the 6524 blizzard blazer tractor with snow plough the wheels were also in a train set called 4549 road  rail hauler where they were the wheels on a big forklift i never realised that i supposed these wheels is one of the earliest technic parts appeared in system sets zzz on jul 14 2008 0549 pm said minifig is really classic made only for this set appears in some later train sets as well and shows the exact image of the truck on the shirt including the motor piece one of the most detailed and loveliest little sets from a sweet era of legoland city i will show it to you in a few days time that this minifig torso does not only appear in this set in fact i am quite fond of this lovely torso with its symbolic truck printed on it snefroe on jul 14 2008 0737 pm said hmmm i probably would not have bought this as a kid in 1987 unless i had money to spare or the shop had no other set from space or castle the two other big lines in 1987 and no better set in the town section i think its a great parts pack but the model itself does not look very attractive i never really liked those wheels honestly theyre from the basic sets mostly and they work pretty well in those but im just not a fan the roof on the other hand was very popular and the blue modified bricks at the front were quite rare in those days but generally speaking this was not the star of 1987 i wouldnt agreed less this set is a good to have and is defintely not the main highlights in 1987 this is actually a great addon to your classic town vehicle collections after seeing so many typical police cars ambulance fire engine and etc i need more variety of civillan vehicles roaming down the streets	neutral

i recently got a few still sealed and new sets from the 90 on ebay and after the rock raiders hover scout this isthe second one ill review i really like the space port theme even if the sets may be more simple than earlier space city sets i like the overall look and the color scheme but enough of that lets go on with the pictures set nr 6455 name space simulation station number of minifigs 3 number of pieces 240 release year 1999 first again a few pics of the boxes and the instructions the main box this theme had a kinda strange seperation of the pieces the parts for the control center and the shuttle are in seperate little boxes and the others are in polybags with the models printed on them also seperate instructions for each step a general overview we got 3 lovely minifigs here from left to right the control engineer the mechanic and the astronaut the i dont know the english word for it testingthing the astronaut is being tested to hard nerves there the mechanics little car on the back an extinguisher and a radio device is attached the takeoff station for the little shuttle with the shuttle itself on it and without it tools tools tools the shuttle as standalone i think that would be fuel tanks i like this little detail and finally we have the controll room would have been better with seats but its alright a really sweet midsized set if you ask me a few juniorized parts but it fits perfectly with the set the theme itself is also great and i wish that tlg brings it back i could see stunning sets with the quality city sets have right now	positive

minibump wow id completely forgotten about this theme which is suprising since i absolutely loved this theme as a kid minus the sound n light brick which i thought was pretty big and ugly sure brings back memories of looking at those little catalogue booklets that came with the sets	positive
i had never seen this set or this theme before it was released during my dark age and i had missed it its nice to see such sets surface once again to educate members like me that there are some good sets we had missed during the dark age and i must admit that this is a very good set its comes with 3 minifigs and staudie with it geez i never thought he was an astronaunt back then the testing facility is great and i love to see it spin by putting staudie in it for a testrun the buggy is cute as well but somehow i dont really like the white frame at the back it looked a little odd to me the tools are simply wonderful to have furthermore these are grey tools the last time we had so many tools are the aeroplane mechanic the shuttle is nice but does the shuttle supposed to come with a cover as well i guess since this is a simulator they must have cut down the budget for it the control room is good and it will be even better with chairs included metalandi thanks for the wonderful review	neutral

update i will be merging reviews as they go idle this is now the dino attack review thread what jays not doing viking reviews nope i think christopher110 took care of those just fine instead i have brought you what is most possibly the highestanticipated set of the year  d  the t1 typhoon and i gotta say  dinos apart its actually really cool the dinos lets get the worst over with yes those are all the parts in that dino	negative
the copter this is one bigass copter the photos really dont do the size justice lower cockpit with cool computer too bad its a sticker although ill definitely leave this one on upper cockpit with cool computer see above awesome gatling gun yes even the technic beams have stickers im actually really fond of that little canister thing i can see using it elsewhere yes  thats a sticker the rope and hook i forgot to mention it before this set comes with two accessories besides the machine gun  binocs and one of those little things to slide down the rope also the thing that extends the rope turns the other side because theyre slightly asymmetrical one of my favorite stickers the door says survival equipment its on both sides definitely a keeper	positive
the base of the propeller it wobbles a bit but doesnt fall off very sturdy right side of the rear propeller and the left and better side the tail it uses construction similar to the xwings nose but on a larger scale definitely cool a very neat part of the copter the guns are constructed so that  they turn without turning the cockpit the interior is rather blase though	positive
another of my favorite parts  landing gear this is the front section  and it retracts unlike most ships with landing gear this does not retract without effort coughxwingcough very sleek the back landing gear  and again smooth retraction gotta love it final score 8410 parts 810 figs 1010 dinos 210 copter 910 value 710 dont buy if  you can wait for vikings  you dont like any set with stickers  youre not a space fan buy if  youre a space fan  you dont mind stickersdont apply them  youre like to create cool figures overall i think it was worth the price even at 605 pieces however id suggest buying vikings even considering this well hope this review unexpected as it was  helped someone out there until next time bloody jay	positive
as unexpected as it was this was very helpful  three questions though 1 is the front green rubber missle a traditional launchable missle or does it have another firing mechanism 2 concerning the guns on the side are they fixed in one postition or does it have any functions 3 why did you decide to buy this set just curious	neutral
i really want those figsdamm you bloody jay	positive
thanks bloodyjay another brilliant review i really like the helicopter though i hate the stickers it seem like there are a lot of it it wont stop me from buying it too bad that when will the dino line arrive in singapore    guess ive have to wait for the meanwhile	positive
sam89 on jul 25 2005 0111 pm said that looks like a really great set although i dont think id have anywhere to put it i dont think ill ever be able to get the set anyway since it doesnt come out over here sam missing your point the set should come to europe as 7298 but without guns large crate instead	neutral
does anyone have photos of the ones being released in europe id like to compare the ones here in the us to the ones in europe	neutral
no there arent any pictures yet	neutral
wow great review for a great set thanks jay i really like it although to big for my city  i too really like the mfs because of your review i am definitely considering it thanks again legobmw	positive
thats interesting news about the european release id definitely be interested to see how they modify the set  chains ropes and crates are definitely useful pieces cant wait for pictures to everyone looking for just the figures  dont skip out and get the smaller set and the tank spend the extra 20 and get the t1 its well worth it i might pick up the steel sprinter and the fire hammer myself still trying to decide if i do ill review them	positive
i guess well have to wait for the photos officially announced by lego the dino attack line is going to be made available in europe in october 2005 edit check out the official dino attack site here	neutral
yeah i picked up another one i really liked the chopper lets cut straight to the chase dinos first the worst of course these things are so horrible they dont deserve more than one photo theyre rubbery one piece and the only things that remotely indicate that theyre made by lego are the holes on the bottom of their feet theyre unrealistic to an extreme unmatched by even the previously reviewed dinos in that they are waaaaaaaay too thin one is pink and theyre all grinning fig one interesting thing to note is that this one has the same torso as the ironmasked dude in the chopper not his own barearms torso pic for the sake of comparison now i dont consider this fig as good as the others because the other heads are useful for vikings and assorted castletype people but this has sunglasses all in all youll probably find it useful but i dont still great torso for special ops stuff hummer those headlights  while stickers yes all prints are again stickers although there are much less than the chopper  are great pieces i can see using them as furnace covers or stove burners the windshieldhood area not much to say about this one drivers side my question when this is brought to europe will the steering wheel switch sides  seriously though i love that little steering wheel piece more than i love taffy and im a man who enjoys his taffy left side in its entirety  and the right side view through the right side  no seat here couldve done with another fig to fill the nonexistant seat as well	positive
the weapon whatever its called this uses the same mechanism as the longboat for those that dont have either you snap the little sports stand thing which hits the missile which fires and since theres nothing holding the technic beam up to that height any more it drops down so that the next missile drops into place pretty cool if unrealistic the two on the side do not fire i think theyre mainly there for extra ammo my biggest problem with this set open bed this could have easily been remedied with a few plates interior opened the fire hammer next to the t1 they look very cool together dont they you can also see my curio shelf final score 7410 dinos 110 fig 810 but thats just me hummer 8510 parts 910 im a harsh reviewer i still think that if spacevehicles are your thing you should buy this however if youre a bigger castle fan or just like to get all sorts of lego i would still suggest buying the viking catapult before this however i do think that these are some of the coolest sets of 2005 this is something you will eventually want to get until next time bloody jay	positive
thanks bloody jay any chance you could be reviewing the other dino attack sets	neutral
mr legobildur on jul 25 2005 1011 pm said thanks bloody jay any chance you could be reviewing the other dino attack sets possibly the steel sprinter and urban avenger but i can say with finality that i will not buy the tank until i find it available for 30 or less on that note if anybody does find it for 30 or less shoot me a pm 	neutral

thanks for the awesome review metalandi your pics are very clear and you go into detail about all the functions of the set i agree this is a great set  one of the best of the cg line for sure way better than the boat set with the tower on the bionicle baseplate and cheaper too i even like the helicopter better than the oversized version lots of great parts and a really nice build by the looks of it too i cant wait for this to be released in oz	positive
seeing the pictures in this review certainly reinforce my original thoughts on this set heres an oilrig mod waiting to happen	neutral
very nice review and nice set to boot lots of little features that increase the playability great pics too i remember you had trouble before with the tower raid castle set as i just got mine and was looking to review it but saw your review in archivesshakes fist at how slow aussies get sets  great reviews on	positive

thebrickster on jul 18 2008 0235 pm said excellent review metalandi its always great to see early pictures of new sets this set really reminds me of an oil rig and could probably be easily modified as one if one wanted an alternate model the two components that i like most are the boat crane and the control room but other sections are pretty slick as well are those printed pieces in the control room or stickers im really starting to gain an appreciation for these new coast guard sets theyve come a long way over the years httpwwwmajhostcguard09setjpg 575 coast guard station released 1978 i picked up the control boat  tower 7739 a few weeks ago but havent opened it yet in any case thanks for taking the time to review this set and share it over eb first thanks to all your great response for my review im glad you like this set aswell as it comes to stickers the tiles ant slopes in the control room are printed pieces the rest as coast guard logo patterns and so on are stickers i forgot to make a photo of the sticker sheet unfortunately	neutral

i agree with both of you first i have to add that a few of the stickers were a bit annoying as it comes to put them on espacially the ones on the helicopter where you have to put them on round parts but i didnt really see this at a bad point i really can live with it second it was a very hard decision believe it or not on which new set to buy cause i got a huge 2008 setwantlist i guess itll take some time before i can get most of the other sets i want	neutral

thats a great review of a great city set thank you very much metalandi first of all i wanted to buy the 7999 cg petrol boat  tower but now i surely will buy this amazing platform instead of the 7999 if my local toy seller sells the 4210 reason 4210 is something very unusual set i think we wont get a set similar to that in the next 20 years and because of i dont like the petrol boat inside no backwalls  nearly no interior  klausdieter	positive
paramedic unit set  6364 year released 1980 piece count 140 minifigs 2 list price unknown well let me first say that the english name paramedic unit is not really a good name for this set the function of a paramedic is to take a patient from an emergent situation and deliver them to a hospital for treatment generally an emergency room this is a rather small clinic that i would imagine is more for family care than an emergency room in addition the car looks more like a doctornurses car rather than an ambulance or emergency response vehicle i would call this a clinic rather than a paramedic unit in any case its a great set esp for table towns that need medical services what i like is that this set is small enough to place anywhere in your lego city or town starting with the instructions like all the classic town sets alternate models are pictured although i never tried building one i like the little medical busvan the set includes two minifigs that include a female doctore or nurse and what i presume is a patient based on the torsos i really like the vehicle its a 4stud wide two seater the colors work well and i like the use of the white bar between the seats and the 1x1 blue plates for lights unfortunately the emblems are stickers heres a shot of the neat little clinic i like the use of the blinds for the exam room it shows that lego considered patient privacy when making this set the interior includes an exam room desk and two blue swivel chairs and a neat little eye chart although the letters l e g o would have made a nice touch lastly a picture of the complete set i must admit that i remember buying this set back in the 80s and i regreted it after taking it home im not sure what i didnt like about it perhaps the girl back then but now i really think its a neat set well theres a line of patients waiting to have their eyes checked comments welcome	neutral
thanks a lot for the review brickster i never had the chance to get some classic town sets but i wish i couldve i just wonder why lego cant release sets like this anymore	neutral
paramedic unit does not seem to suit well for this sets name it should be named as clinic outpatient treatment family doctor and etc from what i understand parmedic unit is a standalone unit that is on standby 247 ready for any emergency rescue in lego town ambulance with a group of paramedics will be ideal for this kind of situation i love female doctors especially with that lovely hairpiece the cruiser is a neat 4studs wide design just love these small car designs back then i wonder what can be used at the back of its boot the clinic is neat maybe we can send holodoc for some medical audit to make sure that this clinic is up to standard what surprised me the most is the neat little eye chart you dont see such details in any regular lego set the red and white color combination for the building works well for me most of the hospital buildings and vehicles always revolved in red and white i gave this a 4 thanks you so much brickster	positive
i just cant believe someone would rate this set a 1 it appears to be a trend among these classic reviews never with a comment of why	neutral
thebrickster on jul 19 2008 0230 am said i just cant believe someone would rate this set a 1 it appears to be a trend among these classic reviews never with a comment of why maybe a tfol it is our destiny to show them that lego existed before 1997 and was imho way better than today we need more classic reviews i hope i can continue with technic sets	neutral
people giving this 1 g id give it a 4 id give it a 3 but added a point out of nostalgia i think its a nice town set from the old days the only problem i always had is the lack of an ambulance and we got a female doctor 	neutral
brickster strikes again with another awesome review ah one of the few hospital related kits lego made wasnt this the first hospital with modern minifigs because i seem to remember seeing an even older hospital online that had the armless faceless figs regardless this would be great as a little doctors office in someones town layout  although the vehicle is a little silly and that eye chart sticker has to be the coolest decal ever quote maybe a tfol well it sure isnt me i personally love older kits even though im only a teen i like a lot of the newer sets a bit more than some of the classic stuff but i have always agreed that the 70s and 80s were an extremely high point in legos time even though i dont really own any kits from the period edited by grevious 19 july 2008  0505 pm	positive

thank you for all these reviews thebrickster and the idea with the polls is a very nice and interesting idea it will only take a while until i will have commented on all  so please give me some time  i gave this set a four the vehicle the minfigs and the design of the house are excellent  only the interior could be a bit spiced up telephone some other equipment klausdieter	positive
whitefang on jul 18 2008 0911 pm said paramedic unit does not seem to suit well for this sets name it should be named as clinic outpatient treatment family doctor and etc the definition of a paramedic is someone who assists physicians in providing medical care i think in more modern times a paramedic is generally thought of as a more qualified and experienced ambulance technician but the dictionary definition would seem to fit with the lego model quite well cheers rog	neutral

hello all eurobricks members and town lovers today i will be doing up a review on hook  haul wrecker this name is quite wierd to me i will prefer to call it the regular tow truck this is one of the service and repair vehicle that are always ready 247 on standby for any emergency towing in our towns name hook  haul wrecker theme lego system  town year 1989 pieces 44 minifigs 1 price usd600 an image of a 6660 hook  haul wrecker let the towing begins hook  haul wrecker is the typical 4studs wide vehicle that takes care of broken vehicles that is left stranded on the roads this tow truck is pretty useful as you can see current city sets hardly have any tow trucks available to tow new cars design this tow truck is catered for 4studs vehicles for classic town can you imagine yourself this truck towing a speed racer car i think it looks really out of proportion in addition the minifig which is included in this set has the regular truck print on its torso i am very sure they must be a fan club for trucks otherwise they should really need a change of clothes nevertheless in my honest opnion i really love this torso very much somehow it makes them look tough even though their face looks very friendly side view this vehicle has a combination of two primary colors which is white and red this color combination looks very good you cannot mistook it for an ambulance since they made use of this two colors too in most emergency vehicles this is my guess i supposed the designer will have tow truck concept as a form of emergency and considered red and white as its combinations this vehicle setup has the typical sunscreen on the top of the vehicle frame however this baby has more unique features installed in it these are the source of its brutal strength allterrain vehicle this tow truck equipped with the best wheels in fact these wheels offer suspension on the roads even when its travelling uphill the truck will move accordingly with its tyres when you act pressure on the top of the vehicle it will either be shifted leftwards or rightwards closeup of these unique tyres take a careful look these wheels have springs installed in it that is the magic of these vehicle and is defintely suited to run on any rough roads with least problems if any eb members know which other vehicles has this unique features please highlight it to me because if i remembered correctly i only remember seeing this pair of tyres in this great set he is ready for some serious towing the driver had finished hook up the pizza van on its back its pretty simple you just have to lift the back of the vehicle and placed it onto the hook presto the van is ready to go this vehicle provides so much fun you can really tow any 4studs vehicle in your town and here we go to the service station poor pizza guy summary review playability 1010 superb fun you will love to use this truck and tow any vehicles design 9510 excellent design especially with the use of the suspension tyres price 910 an inexpensive set based on the 1989 pricing this set is made up of less than 100 pieces overall 9510 every town must need a tow truck if a vehicle breaks down whom will be ready to tow i gave it a 5 based on my review score card what about yours hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine comments and critics are strongly welcomed pictures can be found in my brickshelfwhen moderated	neutral

another great review whitefang this is a wonderful 80s vehicle  and i think it might be one of the first  if not the first  that had the spring suspension system i know of at least one other set that had that the biggest extreme team set from 1998 had a vehicle with those pieces quote this tow truck is pretty useful as you can see current city sets hardly have any tow trucks available to tow new cars design this tow truck is catered for 4studs vehicles for classic town can you imagine yourself this truck towing a speed racer car i think it looks really out of proportion firstly speed racer cars are out of scale even with city vehicles also i have hope that in the next few years we will get more octan sets to go with the wonderful gas station  and i suspect that a 6wide tow truck will be at the top of the list it wouldnt be a hard set to make and i bet it would sell well edited by grevious 19 july 2008  0531 pm	positive
oh never seen that set before fun and strange that wheel supension system has it ever been used in any other sets	neutral
indeed they have theyve appeared in 15 different sets in total they also have an identical width with the wide 2x2 wheels holder which is used on cars today they are still excellent today since retrofitting these suspension parts onto todays offroader trucks wont give them weird proportions or any problems and it looks perfect plus they are useful if youre lazy and dont feel like constructing the pinsuspension used in the early 90s for trucktrailers altough stability probably will suffer	neutral

exxon gas station set  6375 year released 1980 piece count 254 minifigs 3 list price approx 20 one of the gems of my sets from 1980 has to be the exxon gas station it has very nice colors lots of great details and a high level of playability starting with the instructions the backside with a great picture of the complete set the set includes three minifigs including two gas station attendants and my favorite the urban cowboy one of the best things about this set is that it includes not one but two very detailed 4stud wide vehicles heres a picture of the red one which is a twoseater the car has two working doors a hood that opens and a little holed brick on the other side for pretending to fill er up heres another image at an angle isnt she a nice set of wheels heres the yellow car i always liked this one better perhaps it was the color with the black pieces in the back although it is a oneseater the set includes four fuel pumps that are numbered with decals and included a string as the hose heres a little accessory rack for oil and tools and another rack for tires the set had a nice exxon logo on three 1x6 bricks a large jack allows the cars to be lifted high into the air for tire and under engine repairs i love the office with its large 5x6 window inside is a chair and desk and the entire set happy motoring in legoland	positive

i think we only got shell stations in europe in the 80s never got this one but it looks like a typical lego gas station  once again i just dont know how you were able to keep stickers and prints in such a great condition i am sooooo jealous the tires of the cars are a problem though it was difficult and painful to put them off the wheel and back on later the black hat g i would have looooooved to have that when i was a boy	negative
skipper 24 on jul 19 2008 0820 am said nice its like an alternative to the shell petrol company sets we had over here in the uk or did you have them to we have shell as well snefroe on jul 19 2008 0823 am said once again i just dont know how you were able to keep stickers and prints in such a great condition i am sooooo jealous thanks but these stickers are in pretty bad shape esp those on the fuel pumps the tires were hard to remove in regard to the cowboy hat i think my avatar is still wearing it welcomestranger on jul 19 2008 0824 am said i much prefer the shell version of that station which had the full awning over the roadway and the special road plate with the extra lane to pull into to fill er up i have another gas station but i think its an octan	negative
great review of a classic set man this is sure a wondeful kit even today the level of detail is astounding for the time and the whole kit is really cute you know i honestly dont get why some people have complained about the city gas stations figure count  the majority of lego gas stations had no more than three figures  including this one and the wonderful gas and wash express which i actually own i also dont get why people complain about the stickers so much  because even older kits often had a lot personally i think stickers are okay because printed pieces cant be used in as many places if the stickers are really specialized	positive
excellent review its nice to see review of old sets that i dont own i hope to see many more was this released under the esso name int the uk	positive
thanks for the fantastic review of the esso petrol  station i like this set a nice contrast to the shell ones it adds a bit of variety to a lego town the cowboy hat is a nice addition too	positive
brickster once again this is another excellent gas station awaiting to be in the limelight i dont understand why i always loved these classic gas station such as shell exxon and octan they just look so lovely no city or town could ever survive without these important key installations around to pump gaspetroleum for all vehicles that depend it for fuel consumption as always all gas station will always inculde a road plate and i am glad i am still seeing roads included in such sets such as the recent 7993 service station however town plans gas station did not include a baseplate though nevertheless let me continue with this review 3 lovely minifigs included in this set its not common to see exxon torsos these days i just love that lady staff very much especially with its classic hairdo 4studs car just simply rocks with such fabulous simple design furthermore it gave you 2 cars instead of one what more can you ask you dont see tlg giving more cars in recent sets these days what surprise me about this cars is the ability of opening the front engine column i remembered vividly that only trucks or massive vehicles does have this playing feature nevertheless its an excellent addition for a 1980 gas station set this is a perfect set even when its going to fit into my current town buildings i am sure it wont have a hard time to match with the rest of the facade i can use this gas station and stationed it near the country side this set is so hard to resist with such elegant design of its fuel pump there are a total of 4 pumping stations the vehicles wont be fighting against each other for slots then the reparing area is very nice it will be even better if it include a shelter on top of it the office is simple and nice i had never expect an office to exist in gas station most of the time there are groceries stores for the consumers to get off buy off some stores and load it in the car no major complains from me i am not trying to be selection bias i had demostrated key points which is good enough to justify my score and i gave it a 5 outstanding classic gas station set	positive
again great topicpoll thebrickster i gave this set a 3 which is on the one hand negative is that its really oldfashioned for today  which is on the other hand positive is that it includes very nice and authentic details like e g doors in the cars  which is imo for that time a feat  klausdieter	neutral

i dont like mars mission sets but this one is just spectacular it is beautiful i must have this set even if it means selling my kidney i only have one mars mission set the etx alien mothership assault which is okay but this set blows my mind two thumbs up	positive
today im gonna review the bigger of the 2 castles from the fright knigh theme i got this one last week at a pretty fair prive at ebay new and still sealed i love opening boxes that had been lying arounf for years and being the first to build an old set since i know this castle theme is not liked so much by the general public ill try here and change their minds cause i really think this is a great set this time i have to say my pictures turned out pretty amazing even if i am still using just my cellphone cam but im really pleased now with the quality here we go set nr 6097 name night lords castle number of minifigs 7 number of pieces 598 release year 1997 lets start with a few box  instructions pictures the inside od the box with a few alternate models the back with another possibility how to assemble the 3 main parts instructions next the 6 minifigs starting with the witch on her black dragon all 5 figures of the fright section and the poor royal knight we go on with the set itself first a general overview its really high on the first floor theres a trap with which you can drop stones or other things down on unliked guests the pot comes originally from fabuland i think i love this thing in the same floor there is a second trap if you pull the bar the door opens we move on to the tower itself did i mention its really high on the ground level theres the place for the witch to do her spells the wall is a secret door which reveals a skeleton when turned over on the next level there is this little thingy first it only seems like a barrel but when you pull the two 1x4 tiles on the back a skull is being revealed scary huh  i dont really understand what this is for but i assume its a telescope to watch and observate the dragons i do find that a bit senseless since there havent been telescopes in medieval times or have there been the back of the tower with the prison and the room for the treasure chest the prison opened its secured with a chain which i like very much cause you really can lock it with that treasure chest from the highest peak we now go down to the very ground level at the back of the castle there is another secret walldoor flanked by two shields at the back half of the inside there is the throne hall for the bat lord with a nice warm fireplace in the back this is where the secret door is placed the second half is pretty empty except for these two baskets i dont know exactly what they are for but i ike the idea for using them as water places for the horses one thing that might be a bit stupid is that 2 of the 4 side entrances do not have doors so they are open and a guard would have to stand there the whole day you can see it in his face he isnt very happy with that  that was my last review of the sets i got the last weeks but im looking forward to make much more in the future overall this is a pretty good set i dont know any other one with so much details and playability the minus point is as already said that it is too open on the sides but that can be solved easily with a bit of modding also i must say this set isnt that much juniorized as many might have thought though the design is a bit unconventional but exactly thats what i like most about it all in all it gets a 910 for me hope you enjoyed the reading and the pictures cant wait to see your response edit oops i forgot to put one figure of the fright knight faction on the photo but its the one in the last picture edited by kimt 10 august 2008  0128 pm	positive
nice review good closeups and a good unconventional choice of a set as for the set itself it has its pros and cons in my eyes i like all the minifigs but especially the witch the fright knights are probably the closest you can get for an evil human castle faction as for the building itself on the other hand i like the fact that it can be modified but some of the design choices are just stupid the holes in the wall the one huge tower as opposed to several smaller ones the huge empty space in the center and the excessive usage of bright yellow i guess for a smaller kid the play value is great its easily accessible and it looks sturdy enough but to an afol its not much else than a source for bricks and figs in my opinion oh and they did have telescopes in the medieval times the witch most probably uses it for astrology and even if they didnt were talking about a castle with a dragon and a wicked witch in it so its not exactly a good example of accurate history	negative
sweet review metalandi this set always looked a bit too busy for my liking i guess i just didnt expect to see a set so tall after seeing your review though it is growing on me i like all the play features and at the very least its a great parts pack two things im confused about though in this pic is that dragon being used as a swing set and i dont get why the area where the witch casts her spells on the second floor is green green in castle means grass or forestmen  and having grass on the second floor of a building is just weird i understand that its modular and thus it would make sense if it were placed on the ground but dark grey would make just as much sense and would look much better than the green there imo anyway im just fussy thanks again for the cool review will we be seeing any more peace	negative
i love the reviews of older sets that i never had also tiny thing but you said it has 7 minifigs but the group shots only include 6 the last guy isnt shown until the very end	neutral
i thoroughly enjoyed your review metalandi thank you especially for taking photos of all the contraptions and detailing exactly how they work as a member of classiccastle the census always seemed to be that fright knights were a class 410 or 610 but as sandy stated above it is one of the closest you can get to an evil faction by todays standards the contraptions seen here are much much more sophisticated and well thought out and are definitely missing in 2007s kings castle siege i enjoy the design of this castle much more even if the towers are taller simply because the design in the kings castle siege left builders with an empty space right in the courtyard without even a base plate and its nearly impossible to get your hands in and play in the enclosed space why would anyone unless youre simply posing figs and even that was difficult this castle instead had a variety of trap doors and surprises so despite the varied colors used here its not that hard to realize that the designers for this castle really took time to think things out and tried to make the castle enjoyable for the children that will play with it whereas our 2007 castle was strictly built to give kids the impression of an enormous magnificant castle with little to nothing inside its like comparing beauty 2007 to brains this castle edited by legobear 20 july 2008  0132 am	positive
very nice of a very nice set the revolving fireplace  i wonder what movie that could possibly be from	positive
i read this review not long after you posted it but im not sure why i didnt comment if dragonator is the one to post everytime he sees a dragon related topic i would be the one to post if i see a fright knights topic fright knights is one of my favourite lego themes and this review is really good i got both of the castles in the theme and loved them and your review presents basil the batlords castle well i too thought it was a bit weird that there is a green base when it could be grey but i guess its a useful piece to use in other things fright knights on	positive
ah this brings back memories i have this set and i loved the playabilaty factor opposing to older castle sets i have in medieval times there actually were primitive telescopes you can read about it here thanks for this review great storie great pics	positive
my first post in this topic looks foolish now that i bought this set from ebay i just really wanted the minifigs although i already had the batlord and the black dragon and the parts they will help me greatly in building the impenetrable fortress of the dragonwarriors for my princess quest comic by the end of this week this set will be in my clutches	positive

well that the bricks look new comes from that they are new i got this set new and unopened	neutral
metalandi on aug 6 2008 0140 pm said well that the bricks look new comes from that they are new i got this set new and unopened i know pretty good deal	positive
ahh i remember how badly i wanted that set when it was new oh well definitely one of the most original castles if not the most i actually liked how the 1st floor was made into a throne room the tower looks pretty impressive too of course the castle has a flagrant flaw  the walls on the sides are open i also think it lacks in the minifig count though that is understandable for a castle with a dragon quote the fright knights are probably the closest you can get for an evil human castle faction totally agreed	positive
quite the topic bump but dang what a cool set and so tall this is the kind of sets i had as a kid but i dont remember this one im jealouss	positive
fire station set  6382 year released 19801981 piece count 368 minifigs 4 list price approx 20 legos third fire station was this little gem 6382 the set offered new design elements not previously offered in previous sets what really stands out for me is 1x3 car doors and torsos with printed designs a decal was used for the large sign on the building and the 1 on the hood of one of the vehicles i think this was also the first set to offer the sliding garage mechanism a feature that added a great amount of realism and playability the set also included two blue doors and the new fire hose with preconnected faucetspicket getting on to the pictures i saved the cover of the box for this set but lost the instructions over the years i was able to download some instructions from the web heres a shot of the box cover and the back of the box the set includes four figs three of which are fireman and a lady who can serve as a dispatcher as mentioned above the torsos are printed on my favorite of the two vehicles included i love the design of fire engine 1 i always loved the fire hoses included in this set no string to have to tie or freyed ends engine 2 is this much larger engine with ladder i like how it contains an oxygen tank and fire axe on the other side of the engine are two shutter doors that reveal the hose and ladder controls these are stickers the ladder is much wider than previous lego ladders and extends a good length i like the baseplate of this set which has the numbers one and two marking each garage the building is simple but has a nice design i love the sliding garage doors note notice the two windows of the 2nd floor the actual set should have blinds on these windows ive lost one of the stickered windows so placed the single blinded window on the 1st floor each of the two sides of the garages are the same heres a shot of the right side on the first floor is the dispatch area and a classic blue space computer the 2nd floor has a bed and a chair heres a shot of the entire backside and lastly a shot of the entire station this set is one of my favorite fire stations that offers a great amount of playability hope you enjoyed the review	positive
this is a great set and a great review  thanks for doing these i remember my brother getting this set i got the police station 6384 on the same day truly classic sets  its a shame that i dont have them anymore although i do have the two immediate descendants of the sets cheers rog	positive
great review again its nice to see old sets reviewed i love the control stickers theres a great level of detail this is really the second best fire station in my opinion	positive
lovely i cant stop making comparisons between this fire station and last years which is also very well detailed with great features and awesome playability the concept design of the second one its very much like the one reviewed here this is good as tlg is taking back those great values to make the new excellent sets we all are enjoying by now	positive
a 55 the set is beautiful both the remake and the original a classic and a beautiful thing like dos edited by maiq the liar 20 july 2008  0945 pm	positive
i have a slightly different version of this set and i must say it is great boy to these reviews bring back memories thanks	positive
great review i love tis set too the best firestation ever made by lego mainly because the 80s sets are the favourite with me only i miss a helicopterplatvorm well i made a little modification	positive
i must agree great fire station i love the fact that in the classic sets you were given a base plate and some other great ideas i do miss the addition of base plates and alternate building ideas the only newer set i have seen with any alternate build photos is the 7239 fire engine i miss back when	positive
great review of a great set sadly i dont own it as for the alternate building ideas on the back of every box  yes i miss that as well i really miss it	neutral
i´m glad you are reviewing 4digit sets now brickster thebrickster on jul 20 2008 0714 pm said this set is one of my favorite fire stations that offers a great amount of playability this pretty sums it up the firestation was one of the few sets in my childhood i owned and was not classic space i especially liked the roller doors this was one of the first sets they came with in the late 80´s i sold it to my nephew darn i really regret it when i asked him a couple of years ago if he still owned it and i could buy it back he also had made cash out of it i gave it a 4 there is always room for improvement like the helipad mentioned so it can´t be a 5 in my opinion take off you rose coloured glasses	positive
no question this is a 5 one of the best and most influencial town sets ever imo	positive
i honestly glad i got the latest fire station cant remember set number its waayyy better i voted 3 its realy not that great but its ok	neutral
great review great set nice look great features very playable	positive
fire copter 1 this is fc1 over im making my way to main street now the smoke is coming from the legoland hotel over thats a roger im going to shoot the 500 gallon now over fire in your tabletown no problem legos set 6685 fire copter is sure to put it out  classic style set  6685 year released 1982 piece count 99 minifigs 1 list price unknown heres a great firethemed addition to your classic legoland display starting with the instructions the set includes one classic fireman with a nicely printed fireman torso what a great little detailed helicopter i love the use of the red and yellow colors the front opens to allow your fireman to quickly climb in in the back are two round yellow 2x2 bricks for the water supply and a hose connected on each side unfortunately i lost one of the hoses and the entire set isnt she a beauty 6685 fire copter 1 is a great supplement to set 6382 fire station released one year earlier after buying this great little set i had fun puting out fires all over my tabletown oops i think i smell one now	positive
thebrickster thank you so much for all these reviews of classic town sets omfg this set was released in 1982 and i was born 1 year earlier hehe  nice little heli	neutral
a great small set i remember this set most of all because of the inverted window screen loooooved the chopper but never got it another 5 please	positive
a nice little model with some neat features for its age plus the allyime classic fireman as a bonus however this design of chopper the police station around the same time was the same design i think dated very quickly while is was good to use the hinged car roof  which was relatively new at the time  together with the inverted screen it was superceded very quickly by designs that stood the test of time far better for example 6657 also i dont think i could everbuy a lego fire helicopter because it is not something we have in the ukeire police coast guard ambulance military etc etc but no fire helicopters not something i would therefore want in my lego town great review though many thanks again for doing these cheers rog	negative
i vote outstanding because it makes excellent use of the pieces that were available at the time that cockpit makes excellent use of an inverted windshield	positive
i owned this set and i loved it great idea to have the reversed windshield	positive
hello all eurobricks members and town lovers today i will be doing up a review on snorkel squad one of the most important and basic vehicle in any fire department snorkel squad in simple english terms it refers to fire engine fighting fire always on standby ready to save the citizens from crisis trust me you will understand why this snorkel squad is superb impressive by the end of this review on a side note there is only part that is replaced by another color can you find the difference name snorkel squad theme lego system  town year 1987 pieces 151 minifigs 2 price usd1350 an image of a 6358 snorkel squad looking smart on their standby this snorkel squad is a fanastic fire engine that is ready to save people from the fires its primary color red is used in all fire emergency department and vehicles in case of any emergency this snorkel squad will be activated and arrived at the scene as soon as possible no time to waste personally this is the best fire engine that i had ever seen meet the fire fighters it comes with two brave fire fighters both of them wear the standard fire fighter outfit that is present in almost all fire station sets in classic town the torso is very nice and formal and looks real impressive onto them i love the buttons on them furthermore these white helmets are a symbol to the world of fire fighting these are the people whom save lives by risking their own lives in dangerous situations water hose compartment the water hose is a string that is stored in the front it can be rolled out and the fire fighters are able to use it without much difficulty they will just pull out the hose and spray onto the fire the next picture shows a much clearer look in its interior in addition the fire logo that is on the compartment is actually printed yes its not a sticker and that is great news for us interesting features these clamps on both sides is supposed to stablise the fire engine when the ladder is heading upwards it is a simple mechanism which illustrate clearly what it does this feature is recently seen in construction vehicle such as the mobile crane of course it is not a complicated feature it just made use of three quite common white parts swivel mechanism these swivel mechanism in my opnion are very fun to play with these connectors on the front and the back enable the long fire engine to make sharp turns on any junctions arriving at the scene fast enough this is not a fire engine that only travel straight roads try it onto your base plates and you will be surprised how well it can turn best playable mechanism in 6358 the driver will be activating the ladder at the back of the vehicle in order to adjust the height and making sure that the ladder do not fall short the tiles on the plates are acting like a stoppage the ladder are able to rotate 360 degree without much problem if you removed the driver out of the control panel it goes up as tall as 30cm look at that amazing height too bad i have not constructed my cafe corner yet otherwise i can give you a better feel of how amazing this baby can go i used the old road baseplate as a guide and roughly it can goes as tall as 30 to 35cm look at the black hinges below by shifting it to the last that was the maximum height it can move this is a very good way to adjust the height oh and i forget to mention that there are 2 storage compartments for the fighters to place their equipments behind quite easy to access no doors apart from the standard roof top on the drivers seat there is no doors present at both side i am quite sad to see that there are no doors maybe these fighters are supposed to jump off the seat instead of opening the doors well i guess this is the only major flaws that i had found in this set heading off got you meet the model 6358 fire engine summary review playability 1010 superb fun the ladder and swivel mechanism is really very fun to play with design 9510 excellent design it got an almost full 10 the lack of doors dropped my ratings slightly price 810 a very mid range price i dont think it cost very expensive but i am not sure how much it cost now overall 9210 best fire engine ever and one of the great looking one too get this model now i gave it a 5 based on my review score card what about yours hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine comments and critics are strongly welcomed pictures can be found in my brickshelf when moderated	positive
thanks for another great review i can remember the 6358 very vividly my parents bought the 6340 for me and a girl friend got the 6358 im quiet sure its my envy because until now i want to believe that the 6340 is better my reasons were these i own the 6340 and on the instructions of the 6358 stood legoland which i thought of as old but this review induced me to get over this humiliation from my childhood   and check ebay for the 6358 edited by bernddasbrot 21 july 2008  0407 pm	neutral
a truly great set i always loved the mobile crane and was gobsmacked when this popped up using some of the great features from the crane but also making it an emergency vehicle too great classic firemen and  in your version  a suspiciously blue fire extinguisher great review of a great set  just a pity i no longer have it so many sets i used to have got lost during the period at the end of my childhood before i rescued what was left from my dads house once i realised what i had left behind hindsight is a great thing cheers again rog	positive
a great review i like this set it captures the classic town feeling well and the ladder is cool i cant help but feel thought that these reviews are being churned out to quickly you should leave a gap i am being flooded with all these great reviews	neutral
this definitly is a nice set i think this was also the first set to use that white basket nice one whitefang	positive
what an awesome little set i really like this engine but dont remember seeing it during the late 80s it must have been out during my dark ages i love the basketsection for the firemen equally nice is the fire hose which extends a good length the color combination of red with white and the trans blue windshield looks goos as well this is a great engine and one that would look perfect in a classic tabletown  and its 4studs wide very nice review whitefang i look forward to seeing more of your classic town reviews	positive
guys thanks for all of your wonderful and encouraging comments towards this set this was one of my most favourite set in the late 1980s and i am glad to restore it somehow with a small little part missing which could not be that hard to replace bernddasbrot on jul 22 2008 1206 am said but this review induced me to get over this humiliation from my childhood   and check ebay for the 6358 bernd i am glad reviews like these mananged to change your perception towards this set honestly this is a very good set to pass by and i hope i had highlight the key features in this set hope you will have an easy time getting it from ebay or bricklink rriggs on jul 22 2008 1231 am said great classic firemen and  in your version  a suspiciously blue fire extinguisher good job by spotting the replacement part which is hiding among them thats why i show the orignal image lord of pies on jul 22 2008 1234 am said i cant help but feel thought that these reviews are being churned out to quickly you should leave a gap i am being flooded with all these great reviews you should really take some time off and sit in front of the town and trains forum looking through at your childhood memories where classic reviews like this are released in this forum i am leaving some gaps in between my reviews now i supposed brickster will slow down soon captain green hair on jul 22 2008 0207 am said this definitly is a nice set i think this was also the first set to use that white basket cgh you are absolutely right this is the first set that made use of the white basket component in fact there is only 2 sets in the entire lego theme which have make used of the white basket it is the 6477 which is released in 2000 i am quite surprised after 13 years they are able to produced it again thebrickster on jul 22 2008 1010 am said what an awesome little set i really like this engine but dont remember seeing it during the late 80s it must have been out during my dark ages i love the basketsection for the firemen equally nice is the fire hose which extends a good length the color combination of red with white and the trans blue windshield looks goos as well this is a great engine and one that would look perfect in a classic tabletown  and its 4studs wide very nice review whitefang i look forward to seeing more of your classic town reviews you shared the same sentiments as i do its a pity that set was released during the dark age of yours on the other hand these sets are my childhood sets which i grew up with more classic town reviews all the way edit this is my 1000th eurobricks post since i joined it has been another great milestone for me in eurobricks edited by whitefang 22 july 2008  0646 am	neutral

nice review whitefang with lots of photos  exactly as a good review should be as for the set  i own it and its a very good one the fire squad vehicle is a nice addition to my other fire dept vehicles it offers very good playability and this ladder is so long you can have so much fun with it	neutral
great set i found only one major fail  this  the hands of robot arms gets easly broken	positive
thanks for the review this set was outstanding for its time with all the features and detail the extending basket is just wonderful however i honestly wouldnt consider it the best firetruck ever i actually like the one from 2005 even better  becasue like most of the city vehicles it adds the needed bulk big engines like fire trucks need many of the older kits while awesome were honestly a little too skinny imo	positive
quote i am not against with the newer sets it just that part of the reasons which reflected in the review had fufill the basic key factors of a typical fire engine in addition it was my alltime favourite under the firefighting theme yes i agree this set is wonderful even today and is one of the best fire kits ever release and actually realistic scale is not really a necessity in lego  its just my personal taste for example ive never liked the tiny planes in the old airports that much but i can see why a lot of people like them better than the new ones edited by grevious 28 july 2008  0317 pm	neutral
one of my all time favourite i still love it even after all these years though it did always seem a bit out of place as when i was a child i’d never seen a similar looking fire appliance in the uk	positive

i have a question what is the door above the gun for pic	neutral
this sounds very similar to the first one im glad im saving this one till later in my purchasing cycle all the sw walkers have a skeletal fram with almost nothing inside its very disappointing but i guess filling them in would up the piece count considerably does this beast have any good handholds for picking it up i seem to recall a handle or something coming out of the top in the prerelease pics	negative
so basically you cited as faults what everybody had been complaining about since the first information of the set arrived skeletal interior and lack of clones although i didnt realize it didnt have numbered backs that really is just ridiculous lego finally comes up with a very intelligent solution to the frustration seen when building large sets but then they neglect to implement it wtf lame still this may be the only clone wars set i buy besides the exclusives the exterior which imo is the only part that matters looks so fantastic i dont care about clones i have enough of those already and at 90 its still a better buy than the rgs the torrent is cool but not as cool as the fighter tank or dgs imo awesome inconstruction pics	positive
thanks for the reivew could you post a few pics of the atte in all its glory kimt	neutral
just picked this set up and just took a break from building to go to football practice i have just finished building all of the legs and so far it looks like it is going to be a great set i would have like it if more clones were included but whatever i find it interesting how many clone accessories they give you i dont like it only because i cant decide what i want to use i find it interesting that at lease 2 people are missing pieces i have had multiple times where i thought i was missing pieces only to find that they were in the bag somewhere other than the fact that there is a lack of minifigures i love this set and cant wait to finish it later tonight edited by swman 04 august 2008  0833 pm	positive
i just got this set sunday and its so huge that i cant put it anywhere it is pretty sturdy and heavy thats where the handle comes in im pissed that you only get 2 clones rex has to fight on the ground while you need more clones to man the gunscockpit the legs were the most annoying and time consuming part of the build and yea i agree that if tlg had made numbered bags it would have taken only 2 hours rather than 4 edited by ih master 13uilder17 14 october 2008  1138 pm	negative
i bought this a few weeks ago and absolutely loved making it its amazing how the paneling comes together to make such a tight fit but can easily open up the legs could have been a bit more poseable and the guns dont launch easily unless you push hard and fast id like the firing mechanism to launch more smoothly but it looks absolutely amazing about price it was ¥13000 where i am but im used to lego being expensive in japan so it was good value	positive
funny minifig actions there i do love the atte a definite buy for walker fans	positive

7676 republic attack gunship number of pieces 1034 number of minifigs 5 price 11999 usd brickset hey everyone i just got the rgs yesterday at tru after i came home from camp i saw all of the topics that i missed and noticed a minireview and a review with one pic so i thought id make a huge shiny new review that has lots of pictures and all of the requirements of kimts index note i did not apply any stickers to it as a personal liking so lets start by looking at the box a shiny clean and futuristic box quite different from the other star wars box designs before this there was so much clone wars merchandise with this font and design in the huge display at the front of my local toys r us store and not just lego it so beautiful with the white and sky blue anyways for some reason the boxes of the new clone wars sets seemed more shiny than usual maybe its because they were just shipped but once you pick up the boxes they will feel really good in your hands despite the fact that only about half of the space in the boxes are used the back of the box the back shows all of the main features of the set plus pictures of the three other clone wars sets meant to be released alongside this one although i did spot the twilight and homing spider droid which were supposed to be released in september or october so on to the gunship built straight from the bags it took me about 4 12 hours with breaks it has an overall great design but somewhat fragile especially when building it the cockpits always fall apart when opened as well as the bubbles on the wings which i will get into more later the color scheme is very well done you can always find the piece youre looking for thanks to the color diversity red dark red lime green ooh blue black tan light bley dark grey yellow and white also split down the middle vertically the ship is almost all symmetrical front side now lets start with the many features that this set is hiding the front has lots of lime green a rare color but more importantly a rotating gun is found on each side they rotate in a pretty wide range although fragile cockpits there are two main cockpits right next to each other not very detailed and are the same and for some reason the whole cockpit element flips up to reveal nothing just the skeleton of the ship probe droid storage above the cockpit lies a plate that can be flipped up to reveal a storage area that holds two of these probe droids at least thats what i think they are hull in this pic two features are hidden mobile command center the first of the two is a mobile command center but essentially just a hover chair it is found by flipping up the two panels on either side of the hull bacta tank the second is the bacta tank found by just sliding it out of the storage area behind the mcc one half of the tank opens so a minifigure can go inside and heal hisher wounds obtained in battle cargo hold now this is probably the main feature for this set the two sliding doors two on each side slide open thanks to a clever technic mechanism not much in here just a gun holder and a place where the passengers wait to be dropped off in battle speeder bike i guess you guys saw it the speeder bike it is found by opening the rear flap the bike is very cleverly designed by using a brown trike body its only a few centimeters shorter than the bike found in the clone battle pack rear gun just a gun similar to the front ones engines huge engines or are they cannons that are really fun to build they really give that cartoon feel to this set missiles in between the engines are two sets of four flickfire missiles bubble cockpits there is one bubble cockpit on each wing that supposedly control the turrets at the front very fragile storage containers two storage containers on each side hold the clone accessories but i wouldnt recommend putting them in there because the antennae can fall out or you might forget about them sticker sheet the dreaded sticker sheet dss has all of the stickers you need for this set unfortunately mine was crunched up i dont like stickers much anyways but i might still apply some note the republic symbol stickers why couldnt tlg just use that printed piece from a few years back also you get to choose between a birdrat thing or a sleeping twielk as your hull decal what theyre for i dont know looks like the movie or show will explain it though minifigs finally the five minifigs of this set they are all great figs including commander cody amazing especially with the gear the orange is nice but i thought he was yellow clone trooper again amazing the gear is great and the new helmet and torso are great all of the clones in the clone wars line have the same heads also you can see the flesh beneath the helmet asaaj ventress not so happy about this one the torso and dark blue legs are cool but the dress is pretty ugly the head is alright but could do without the cartoony face yeah i know its from a cartoon also has purple markings on back of head obiwan kenobi pretty cool besides the face cool hair and torso though plo koon beautiful the true gem of this set in my opinion the head is the same material as kit fistos and the tosro is awesome good for making a custom kiadi mundi well thats about it here is the final verdict build 810 very fun and easy should take the seasoned builder about 4 hours somewhat fragile playability 9510 lots of fun features although some can break easily swooshability 310 i wouldnt recommend flying it around much as you can barely pick it up safely but with two hands gripping the bottom firmly it can be moved around but not spun or swooshed etc minifigs 810 all very great figs especially plo koon but could have included more clone troopers design 7510 some excellent ideas included in here although some spots are very fragile price 710 should have been only 100 usd if not for the new molds plus at tru it was 130 usd overall score 8510 a great set to have for your star wars clone wars collection with some flaws save up for this one so how did you like my review your feedback is much appreciated jimbutcher out edited by jimbutcher 15 september 2008  0306 am

jimbutcher finally i had seen something that is worth reading and viewing imho this is your best star wars review i had ever read most importantly it is a complete review which has substance you have my thanks keep up the good job back to the rgs this is the next star wars set i will be getting i cant wait to lay my hands on this set and start building basically how bad this set can be it cant be worse republic gunship is one of the alltime favourites in star wars prequel and ot i cant find any faults except being too expensive due to the licence cost in addition the minifigs are the next big thing seriously i am quite impressed with it on the down side my rating will go up if there is an additional clone trooper instead of one nevertheless this is a must get set no matter what	positive
thanks for the review i havent seen any other clone flashligh pics so thanks for that one starting tonight people will die im a man of my word jifel	neutral
i got this set in the spring during my buy every new castle set availableseason granted i couldnt afford all of them but i do have most of them now anyway i love the action elements to this set and the siege tower really does look wicked id like to attach the crownie tower to the kings castle to see how it fits but i unfortunately dont own that set yet i also love the turning head of the soldier and ive used it in my princess questcomic as well along with the turning head of the princess the troll leader brings good variety to the army of trolls but they still could use another face type and more torso options its a nice review in any case although the set pretty much speaks for itself	positive
hey good review and good photos i also got this set just recently and i wasnt very enthusiastic about it at the beginning but after i built it i could appreciate it the siege engine is very nice but my complaint has do with the proportions of the knights tower in respect to the trolls machine  its a bit smaller and less bulkier that complaint has to go with some other sets too for example the troll warship is really humongous  it feels like it can load the evil wizards tower and sail off other than that  a good set i like it 45 from me	positive

great review this is an awesome set besides knocking down the wall at the side can the battering ram do any other damage to the tower ex reducing it to rubble bricks and why cant the orc just jump out of the hole in the back do they need to do that much unnecessary damage to the tower	neutral
when i first saw this topic i thought oh great another review of this set however im glad you posted it now your pics are great and well it was just a generally good review im looking forward to seeing more peace	positive
pedro for your first review you have amaze me with your photo session and the strucutre of your review i am very impressed by your high quality pictures you have done an excellent job i love the tower raid very much as it offers high playability with the wall and flooring falling down when the ram hits the wall its quite interesting to play with the mechanism of the ram is very fun to play with as well i will try and pull back and released it to knock a row of soldiers this is one of my favourite sets in castle 2008 well done	positive
th set was fantastic becuase it was cheap and supplied a very good amount of pecies and had rather good minifigures	positive
name jungle duel set ref 7624 number of minifigs 3 number of pieces 90 price 900 a basic review of 7624 my apologies for the blurry and grainy pictures my camera is acting up  the build is nothing speicial on to the figs indiana jones mutt williams and irina spalkoi nice array of minifigs although i think they should have included a russian soldier or two if you look to the right on mutts jacket it has his name in script the tent is great aside from the fact that the fabric bends easily a nice amount of speicial pieces the weapons rack is pretty nifty so is the table when you swap the white piece with a black one overall it is a very nice set the 1000 price tag isnt so bad either thanks for reading playability1010 price810 figs810 build510 overall rating810 i recommend this set to all indiana jones and lego fans edited by wulf 29 july 2008  0250 pm	positive

time for my first review 7673 magnaguard starfighter peices 431  of figs 2 price 4499 usd the box pretty decent size box for the price magnaguards the normal box stuff front of the ship back open cockpit back of the box contents dss dreaded sticker sheet first manual page because its super important not to build on carpet  fig build the magna guard head imo its beautiful  the purple cone cape box the capes just one the magnaguard back the parts nicely sorted the new windshield piece beautiful the first step seccond step more steps of the main body the wing assembly sorry for the blur attached opposite wing both attached rear engine build the staffs i have mine set up differently than in the instructions i put one cone over the hump on one end of the staff and the other in the original spot then to load them onto the fighter all you do is push the original placed cone down and put it right in this way the staff looks better and it works the same see it slides right in skeletal parts of sides attached close up bottom both wings attached hidden missle launcher raised up another shot staffs attached complete side panel side pods complete swooshable finished time to complete 2hrs okay overall rating time price 910 could have been 4000 usd but due to new molds this is understandable parts 910 could have hade more dark red but thats imo plus i love dark red build time 810 i took my time on this and enjoyed the techniques the designers intricated also taking pics added to the time quite a bit playability 710 the main playability functions are the missle launchers in the back and the sliding cockpit my only gripe with these is they dont set right with the other slopes on the top also the inside of the cockpit is easily modded for regular size minifigs just pop a handlebar piece in the already provided arm in the cockpit and bam your favorite figs can have a ride it also helps keep the magnaguards in place if they hold it minifigs 1010 imo the new molds are great the only downfall is the right arm on both is less moveable due to the hard plastic turbanthing connected to the head swooshability 910 the starfighter is pretty sleek and very swooshable design 910 the most important aspect and this ones a winner its only a nine because it needs to have smoother edges in a few spots but they are easily modable overall score 87 i think its an awesome set very satisfying 2008 sw on dsr dsr edited by kimt 04 august 2008  1149 am indexed	positive

hmm a tougie i really like the world city one yet the dino one is a better deal ill vote for the dino because i regretably dont even have the world city one	positive
its definately the street sprinter for me there are many reasons for that most of which have been mentioned by others already i hate yellow its the most useless color but i love tan and dark red its bigger and more detailed than the coast guard one plus i think there is a hinge in the back of it so there is apparently some more playability to it as well i love the postapoc style fig its detailed and simply looks cool also while the digger fig has quite an individual look to it the coast guard driver has the generic hero head and coast guard uniform its an overal better deal especially if you count the ludp which gives the set a whole lot more playability no matter how u the ldp may be tan  postapoc figs on	positive
that was an intresting race and i was split between the two until i saw whitefangs reply and the fact you can use the sprinter as a militery thingwhich you could do for both but sprinter just pulls it off better and i like the radar on the back of it so ill have to go with the street sprinter thanks for the nice topic brickster	positive
i vote for the dino quadbike definately i wish i had that but ill have to make do with the much less violent european version dino 2010 not attack heres a comaprison european version usa etc version theres a subtle difference but i prefer the us one as for the coast guard quad i think its ok but not as good as the new one	positive
i like the coast guard one but dinos eat coast guard people so dinos ftw and i think the dino bike would fit in with my collection pretty well	positive
dino attack for me you just cant say no to a huge bazooka though the tan and dark red works for me too	positive

price 569 kr minifigs 2 pieces 592 stickers 9 my sticker sheet wasn’t curled up overview before i start i will apologize for the bad quality of the pictures it is getting dark here right now so some of the pictures are a bit dark 1 minifigs the set comes with two of the new clone wars clone troopers which in my opinion are pretty cool it also comes with two short blasters and a bag of clone accessories figs with helmets figs without helmets 2 the tank this thing is huge 25cm long and 22cm wide and far oversized in my opinion but looks great nonetheless i very much like the white and dark red color scheme mixed with a bit of lime green even though there is no lime green bricks   left side right side back side both of the wings contain a hidden compartment to store the blasters and a part that rotates to reveal three flickfire missiles the front opens up as well to reveal the engine the side guns and the gun on the top rotate inside the cockpit is space for two figs one seated in front of two computer screens and one placed in a moveable seat which moves up and down allowing the fig to pop up the top hatch and staying hidden while the hatch is closed this function is triggered by opening the backdoor hidden compartment and missiles engine top hatch openclosed interior 3 rating build 910 not much to say here minifigs 710 an extra fig or two would have been great eventually a jedi or a commando design 810 this only looses a couple of points for being oversized but it’s a great looking model parts 1010 at 592 parts this is one of the cw sets with the best partsprice ratio price 810 sure this thing is great but i think its overpriced at 569 kr approx 120 when build it feels more like a 450 kr set final verdict 910 despite some flaws this thing is definitely recommended and it looks great on your shelf too 	positive
finally a review of this thanks 120 bucks this tank looks tiny and though its amazingly detailed it should have been smaller and only 4050 bucks at most it just doesnt play that big a part man good pieces and mechanisms but no ones going to both buying a 120 buck tank no offence not unless it its the atte	negative

thanks for the review i love these affordable little sets not so affordable now because of the cool figs but im going to have a look on ebay and bricklink right now just in case an army of tan red droids would look great maybe well see some if geonosia appears in the new seires somehow unlikely since the confederacy was defeated at the battle of geonosis i wish i could have bought this set when it came out but id just left university so i was super skint and had to miss all the epii sets now they all cost loads even in used condition at least now there has been a redesign of the gunship and atte from the clone wars series that i can buy	neutral
vbbn the pics were 12 mega pixles which is quite a lot i think although i had to scale them down to 800x600 i used to dream that tlg would bring out these sets of the geonosis arena and you could join them together to make a massive arena but i doubt they would ever do that also look out for my forth coming reviews of 4500 snow speeder some tie fighter with a lul dv and gg wheel bike chase i have taken all the pics all i need to do is upload them also i would review the jango fetts slave 1 but i have customized it so much i dont really want to revert it back to its original state edited by skipper 24 02 august 2008  0718 pm	neutral

i am fairly confident that something involoving geonosis will be released in 2010 but any way i had this set  one of my first ones but i droped the ship and it blew up i found all the pieces but in never rebuilt the ship although i still have the figs ant the canon overall this set was above average in my opinion great review	positive

and now for something completely different tiny turbos belonging to the racers line when i saw 8147 bullet run on sh for half the price i couldn´t resist buying it we had a lot of fun celebrating a bagbuild at our event using the 8150 zx turbo of that theme so i knew what would expect me with this extended set price normal 4999€ now 2499€ well i paid 3499€ in a lego store but that´s another story bricks 796 minifigs  hey this is tiny turbos stupid stickers don´t ask or read further the open box reveals seven polybags some with more smaller polybags inside the instruction booklet 2 ramps and the sticker sheet of course i put all of the bags on the table and not on the floor hey tlc didn´t print this on the first page of the building instructions and you won´t see any piece callouts as well on the other hand this is not adifficult build so why show them still there is an inventory list of all bricks at the end of the instructions note the giant sticker sheet we all now the dss but that is a new kind of extra super large sticker sheet it holds 82 stickers more to that later on the build is quite basic the only nonconventional parts of the build were the two slammers and the most annoying part was fiddling the rubber band of the holder without destroying it bag 1 easy beginning building the lime car the limo and the two slammers nothing exciting about the lime car but the limo was neat it´s an 18 studs long car the normal racers are abot 10 studs long nice way to put the horns on the back the slammers mmmmh nice invention if they would actually do something they are supposed to give the tubros a kick in the butt to speed them up but the result is a 80 cm long run and that´s it i had expected more acceleration from the slammers but it´s also fun to play with the cars without slamming them bag 2 convoy time the tow truck and the fuel truck the tow truck is a great idea and a good addition to the set the cars are supposed to crash  how do they get back home well here´s the answer quite american layout of the truck and it´s very well done horns 5 flashing lights and a right color choice you can move the arm up and down and pull out the hook note the metallic silver antennae the fuel tank has got a secret function it may break on the middle of the trailer therefore it has a hinge build in the bottom city fire mayhem and there´s no fire engine bag 3 long longer how long can a tiny truck be the pipe truck an unexpected buggy and the red racer 36 studs long the pipe truck breaks every convention the cabin is almost the same like the tow truck and the fuel truck and that is the good part of it the trailer has to carry pipes and is functional as well as it can commute sidewarts it looks quite unrealistic as well and you cannot drive this beast on tiny roads good for another crash but there are more cars in this bag now this was a surprise a buggy this is the only 6wide car but just because the wheels are large monster truck madness i don´t care for those cars personally a disappointment i would have preferred another racer  for variety though did i say another racer here we are the red devil great looking a real fast shape and red the best racer in this set vrooommm this is the most played with car of the set not only from me  as you may have noticed i didn´t put any stickers so far i don´t like stickers especially when placed over two or more bricks and here you are supposed to do it several times of course the cars look better with stickers on but they are also great without stickers only the fuel truck looks boring without my sons didn´t know there were supposed to be stickers and they didn´t ask for them so everything is allright here´s a closeup of the sticker sheet did i already mention it was 82 stickers  the only exception i made using sticker was for bag 4 bag 4 you go here you pay the highway toll booth the only immobile part of the set but great to brake though the barriers that is fun i only put on stickers on 2x2 plates where i had the idea to use those plates further on on different other mocs this looks a bit boring without the other stickers i admit but still no cut off to the playability there are also two ramps belonging to the set these only make sense if you are able to speed up the racers with the slammers and hit the ramps correctly i had problems with that so they are on the shelves now could be a lot fun making a contest though like this picture of the inventories frontpage all cars put together the usual leftovers all in all this is a great set to call ones own i did not regret buying it especially when it was 50 off even normal price would not have been too much build great for smaller children boring to afols 510 special brickscolors none all basics 310 design i love the tiny turbos´ size and design 910 playability 1 because of the slammers another 1 because no minifigscale but that is not the intention of the set still 910 pricepiece ratio dang it´s not on sale any more but if you hurry you could still grab one in the lego stores 1010 all in all 8510 and a clear recommendation it was and still is a set to play with your children the size fits perfectly to matchbox cars and that was exactly what my younger son did can you find all of the cars included in the set ps after buying this set i won an ebay auction with another tiny turbos set  8135 bridge chase this is even more fun i will soon care for a review with some never seen phototricks as well stay tuned edited by whitefang 23 may 2009  0702 pm indexed	neutral
this set was on my wanted list for a long time and the sales at sh came just in time i also loved the set and like you only put the stickers on the toll both it looks great on a town layout with almost no modifications the racers are great the trucks and the limo are the best in my oppinion the sticker sheet is huge but ive seen bigger stickers over multiple pieces are the worst the slammers are ok but not great i played with my 4 years old son and we tryed to do what shows in the box the cars passing the toll jumping the ramps and crashing the trucks but it is very difficult to get it right but the crashes are very fun	positive
tiny turbos are good for parts but im not so keen on them as they have no minifig drivers so i wasnt sure about this set but your review has made me like them more i probably wont buy the set but i appreciate it more thanks for the review	positive
kimt on aug 3 2008 0106 pm said thanks for the review ill definately get this set sooner or later you better hurry they are not at sh any longer quote a fine set carwise dump the slammers and buildings into the spare bag and keep the cars that´s exactly what i did the slammers are already seperated to our color boxes	positive
thanks for the review i have quite a few ttstiny turbos i never got this one but if its on sale	positive
as my summer holiday was kinda wet for 2 weeks i decided to shop some sets i crossed the german border and bought me this one mainly for the parts to get time going i built the models and made this small review for you to enjoy or hate high resolution pics can be found here when public set 4994 title fierce creatures price 999 euro  1299 usd pieces 193 minifigs 0 the box the box looks awesome it has some great animations of the 3 models in the instruction the rear of the box shows some nice upcloseandpersonal drawings of each model i think it works better having the models drawn instead of a mere photo of them somehow it allows the great colourscheme to really show the instructions the instruction is easy to follow and shows which pieces are used in each building step that makes it all a lot easier especially with so many small pieces as in this set the bricks are divided into 3 polybags and the instruction is a fine small book which can be easily stored along the rest of your evergrowing amount of booklets and pamphlets printed by tlg the models model 1 is a spider and it’s nasty the 2x2 modified brick with the hole would allow one to hang it from a string this beast is sure to give you several nightmares were it hanging from a string in your bedroom – so i wouldn’t do that plus the fact that my wife threw away the box and ordered me to take the spider apart when she saw it – she’s an arachnophobian and does not take spiders lightly it looks real in a brickishnonrealway model 2 is a snake there’s not much to say other than the head is awesomely designed and the rest is bad the body is poorly designed and does not live up to the coolness of the head build the head ignore the rest model 3 is a flying scorpion or something not as realistic as the spider but still a great model with a cool head the tail is a bit poorly designed but it’ll do and it does offer some good ideas on how to use bricks all in all verdicts this is an ok creator set it holds a lot of fine pieces and the models are an ok inspiration given its size it’s an ok set but it’s nothing more than that i’ll give it an average score i enjoyed building the models and fumbling with the bricks in the shade during a “siesta” on my vacation and that’s what it is an enjoyable build and a little inspiration on a hot day with a erdinger dunkel weissbier in my other hand kimt edited by whitefang 23 may 2009  0629 pm indexed	positive

4500 rebel snow speeder review parts 214 figs 3 price £2000 edit new box pics added sorry theyre a bit blurry because of the light i took them in this is the original trilogy edition version of this set but there arent any differences to the normal one 1 manual  box the front of the ote box the minifgs on the box top the back of the box with some alternate models and overview of some of the functions the manual cover you can see it is the ote version of the set random shot 1 of 2 posters in the instructions the second poster 2 general set and minifigs the built set contents the three figs with the included weapons how i like to customize the pilots helmets luke from 4500 and luke from 10178 motorized atat the three helmets included with the set 3 turret heres the turret with the rebel gunner standing next to it the controls for the turret  the turret can rotate and tilt two fire at those pesky atat walkers i put a spider web sort of radar dish thing on like on the original 7130 to make it look more like the one from tesb 4 the speeder a front view of the speeder the pilot controls with a atat print the seats for the pilot and rear gunner the rear gunners tow cable a detailed printed plate next to the engines printed plates under the airbrake things more printed parts there is no dss with this set got tie up those walkers we might need some more tow cable  5 overall build 710 pretty symmetrical build but its fun minifigs 810 3 figs in a £20 set is pretty good i think design 910 very strong and close to minifig scale the turret could have some work though parts 810 lots of variety and includes some interesting ones such as the cockpit and rear air vent price 710 3 figs and 214 parts not to bad i guess playability 610 could be better if it came with a snow trooper overall 810 the set comes with 3 figs that only come with more expensive sets also it has a variety of different parts as well as the build being enjoyable edited by skipper 24 04 august 2008  0310 pm indexed	neutral
i once bought a entire lego collection including this set however i never have build it seeing this fine review has given me new motivation to do so nice work again skipper	positive
my review gave you motivation to build a set my review was better than i thought	positive
skipper thanks for doing up all these sw reviews it certainly had given me some valuable insights on these sets especially on the snowspeeder it kind of making me regret to pass off this set however i had bought the hoth base instead but had never built it i am just wondering if the snowspeeder had any difference keep up the good work and always strive your best to make each upcoming review a better one	positive
there isnt much difference apart form it has stickers on and is grey also the guns and tow cable gun are different as well as the engines but if you look at pictures of the hoth base speeder not to much is noticeable	neutral
i have mixed feelings about this set its one of the sets that sent my into a dark age the birth of my son contributed heavily when i first saw this set i was convinced that the earlier snowspeeder 7130 was superior in every way i liked the look of the 7130 version better i liked the coloration of it better the turret was better it used a webbed 6 x 6 dish after seeing this review i realize i was wrong on some accounts the cockpit is much more movie accurate the 7130 version had two separate compartments this version also came with a tow cable something that was lacking from the previous set while i still am unimpressed with the overall look of this set it is much less blocky which is always a good thing overall i still prefer 7130 to the 4500 version but the 4500 isnt nearly as bad as i first assumed and i regret never buying one of these when i had my chance	neutral
podracer not sure where you got that from i didnt have them out the set with treads is a dino 2010 thing which fits in well after a bit of modding also there are some of the old exoforce sets out there like the fire vulture because i always saw them fitting well with star wars	neutral
skipper 24 on aug 4 2008 1252 pm said podracer not sure where you got that from i didnt have them out i noticed the minifig between the grievous starfighter  the moddino2010 vehicle and it looked like a little person sitting in the pod of his podracer guess my eyes are playing tricks on me  my eyesight is shot  my wife keeps pushing me to go visit the optometrist	neutral
nope there is a guy sitting there hes there because on dine 2010 there were no guns like on dino attack so so i made a big gun like on the dino attack set i can see where you got the pod racer idea from now	neutral

i find myself so stupid i didnt bought this set it was 30 euro and i thought that it would be for sale after a half year it was with earlier sw sets also nice review	positive
thanks for the rewiev a nice set indeed to bad i din´t buy it when it still was in the stores	positive
you have to love the originals well i didnt like the very first snowspeeder so this is the original to me i like it more then the new one that comes with the echo base beter color scheme and more realistic i think i got this set in stores and still love it to this day 	positive
good review i like it a lot nice job	positive
not one of my favourite sw sets kinda boring and the set is poorly designed imho we do get the general but thats not nearly enough thanks for the reivew and fine pics kimt	negative
i had this set £15 rrp actually  and agree mostly with your review although on the wheel bike itself two legs can be placed at the front end and two at the back to enable it to roll properly boga is very juniorised and the set itself is very simple and contains many large pieces the minifigures are good though i traded my gg however  just to offer my personal thoughts build 510 minifigs 1010 parts 310 price 710 playability 1010 overall 710  not an average tk	neutral
my brother had this set and i think it isnt the best set but great minifigs could use a star corps clone or 2 from the bp	neutral
7153 jango fetts slave 1 review parts 358 figs 2 price £2000 i got it on offer i think the rrp was £40 the only set to include jango fett and young boba also the decals on jango are from fine clonier im trying to say they dont came with the set 1 manual worn manual random page another random page looking at this page you can that this set has numbered bags back cover look how old yodas computer looks  2 general set and minifigs the sets contents jango with his hair on jango with helmet on with front view of face twist jangos head to initiate super bounty hunter mode jangos doubled sided head boba nothing to special although i think the torso and head are exclusive to the set 3 the ship not really scaled up right as you can see the guns can rotate the central sections interior not sure what this is is it a hyperdrive or a bomb or something there are these side panels on both sides behind the panels a secret compartment trans orange minifig heads in the compartment i think theyre supposed to be saturnic charges side storage compartment the back of the ship how those trans orange minifig heads fallout there is a magnet on the inside of the ship but for what the secret prison which also has a magnet on the top so it can stay on but easily come out the doors on it can lift up to put prisoners inside 1 of 2 identical wing things they can fold for flight mode the controls bottom jet thing let me out of here the prison is great for capturing small children 4 overall build 710 impossible to build without a hard stable surface minifigs 1010 2 exclusive figs design 710 nowhere near to scale but has some nice features parts 810 good parts like that big cockpit canopy price 910 for the price i got it was pretty good especially with the figs it comes with playability 710 lots of features but it would be better if it came with a jsf overall 910 lots of features and comes with exclusive minifigs edited by kimt 04 august 2008  1144 am indexed	positive

i got the original version of this set with the luls mace windu figure when tlc released the nonluls version i managed to swap  they sent me the new version and a clone trooper iirc and i mailed them back the old version this was a great set the suspension worked great and it rolled magnificently nice review with good photos but again your price is a little off £6999 is the rrp unless the price you paid was £80 tk	positive

skipper 24 on aug 4 2008 0404 pm said did your version without the lul mace have trans blue grill things like the ones on the back of the speeder  or was my set a one off i bought mine online thinking it was the new version but i ended up with that very lame lul fig i just hate that fig its completely useless we cant use any part of it for anything although i only discovered yesterday that the lightsaber blade was a standard one and not glued as i always believed so all isnt completely lost in the end i still was rather disappointed by the set its too full of holes  hum i think theres kind of a paradox in that sentence but the barc speeder and green clone are indeed fantastic oh and yes mine came with sand blue grill parts instead of the transyellow ones didnt realise it at first and i spent half an hour cursing thinking they forgot to put them in the box but in the end i dont know if the replacements are any better  since theyre supposed to represent some kind of thruster light or something all in all i think its my worst set not necessarily for the set itself which is ok but psychologically theres too many things that went wrong with it	neutral
nice review again skipper i passed on this one because of the price but its a nice set good for you for getting the newer version with nonlul mace and an extra clone that purple blade sure is a beauty the tank itself is alright just an atat on wheels in my opinion the turret is great though and so is the speeder bike i didnt realize that the jet pack had two nailguns harpoon guns on it i thought that the nailgun was a new piece but the jetpack is very cool	positive
an ancient set revived from kimts collection just take a look at the box art this is one classic space minifig pack which deserve high rating and i gave it above average i never had any of these classic space figs before if tlg could ever released this again i am pretty sure i will grab multiple packs without a glimpse you need to build your space agentsastronauts with a little bit of accessories added to explore the unknown space i love this pack very much thanks for sharing	positive

thanks for the review simonjedi this just reaffirms that the v19 is my highest priority this fall behind the rgs of course is that new printed piece a 2 x 2 tile it looks like an excellent detail part for mocing those black pieces used on the landing gear look very bioniclelike if they havent been used before id suspect they will be not that im a bionicle expert or anything it is a shame that this set only includes one clone that seems to be the only drawback to the set everything else looks spot on	positive
first thanks simonjedi for a great review im interested in what you think of the hydrolics i could spend hours just deploying and undeploying the wings and landing gear im a little worried the very first batch of the hydrolic piece for umm i think it was the offroad 4x4 technic set was very fragile and broke after a few uses these seem to be holding up but im anxious to see if they hold up after 100200 uses quote namewalter kovacs dateaug 4 2008 1147 am post337841 those black pieces used on the landing gear look very bioniclelike if they havent been used before id suspect they will be not that im a bionicle expert or anything quote right you are they are bionicle bohrok head pieces so pretty old in bionicle terms and fairly useless in my opinion but they do make interesting looking landing gear as i deploy and redeploy the wings and landing gear hopefully well get a pilot in the battle pack to help mitigate the fact we only get one here tohst	positive
the printed part isnt new it came with 10178 motorized atat walker also nice review i would get the set if it was a little cheaper or came with more than 1 fig whyhas it got 2 instruction books the set isnt particularly big	neutral
nice review simon jedi the v19 has been one of my favourite ships since the release of cwa and this is one of the sets ive been considering most about buying its great to see tlgs treatment of it it looks like no expense was spared making it as aesthetically and functionally accurate as possible  though i think the cockpit windshield could maybe have been slightly bigger but thats just me im sure it looks pretty big compared to other starfighters too did it take a long time to build	positive
great review simonjedi  i really like that you included lots of photos of your build i put together my v19 torrent last night and i was surprised by how heavy the completed ship is it has some real heft once its finished wow it is a really cool ship i was disappointed that the central wing doesnt really lock into place once it flips down it just kind of droops there so i attached a technic pin to the locking arm so it could plug into the 2x4 brick thats on the underside of the starfighter this brick can be seen in your photo of the bottom of the ship overall the build is one of the more confusing that ive seen i had to dismantle and rebuild the first engine after i realized id left out a piece and i kept thinking of the poor 7yearold that gets this set as hisher very first lego set ever	negative
pedro on aug 5 2008 1229 pm said it looks pretty big compared to other starfighters too did it take a long time to build it took me 3 and a bit hours to build it although i had some problems with the technic and i had to take pictures during the build	neutral

actually we should care that theres only one fig in it since its kind of expensive though thats my opinion  but the ship is really awesome  its too bad theres not a battlepack that includes clone pilots edited by bricklanta 30 november 2008  0615 am	neutral
daxflame680 on nov 30 2008 0103 am said i built mine today as soon as i tried to put it in attack position the thingy rotates the wrong way and it falls apart what a waste of 55 i suggest you to check again if you put the technic gear in the correct way cause if not than maybe that the problem  also i dont think it is a waste in my opinion the ship is very well designed and is actually pretty strong or at least mine  and the pilot minifig is fantastic even if there is just one of them edited by darkrebellion 30 november 2008  0317 am	positive

i love this set and i gave it outstanding i might note though that the cylinder is just there as a dampener when disenegaged the wing function still works just not as smoothly interestingly though the cylinder is an old piece i have a few others its just that this is the first time its been used without a spring i had no problems assembling this set	positive
having just bought myself a copy of the wonderful metroliner 4558 i felt like doing a review before we start id like to thank greenhair for selling me one of his metroliners for a mere 80 euros granted the motor trainstation and tracks werent included but i did get an extra railcar instead   please note that i have included the fourth wagon in the final pic but that the official set includes just three wagons the metroliner was released in 1992 and was extremely popular amongst lego fans the set a picture of the box showing the set completely pic taken from peeron and one of the minifigs and the accessories as you may notice tlc was extremely generous supplying us with a grand total of 11 minifgs amongst which no less than 4 female minifigs ah the population crisis is finally over we also have three suitcases three cups and a small freight parcel and freight handling thingy normally this would include two bicycles a red and a black one a general side view of the three carriages thanks to greenhair and the brickster and heres one of the extra carriage thanks to greenhair and the brickster moving onto the front and back carriage which are externally identical please note that greenhair changed my back carriages headlights these would be yellow in the normal set all the doors in the entire set are printed pieces sorry for the bad picture quality in this one the interior of the two however is laid out a bit differently the space in the front carriage is occupied by a cockpit or whatever it is called in trains and some space to store your cable connecting the front lights with the engine i can imagine it must get quite cramped and dangerous for the minifig driver with all the cabling further back we have a quite random weird looking engine one part reminded me rather of a jet engine on a commercial airplane the engine is accessible by means of the two side cargo doors at the end of our first carriage we hit what looks like the trains restaurant two tables and no chairs the two middle carriages are identical both have a small sink nicely hidden from the intervening and impolite looks of fellow passengers the carriage further contains two tables and four seats two cargo spaces are nicely tucked away from view below the tables our final carriage has a back cockpit as well but differs from the front carriage in the central cargo area  where our train employee is hard at work earning his lego nickels  and the rear sleeping area the bed is a double one the upper one able to be flipped up for somewhat difficult access to the lower one the train station i could not take photos off since it was not included in the purchase judging from the building plans however i feel it was thrown in at the end just to add something to the set its construction is very simple consisting of a few grey plates on top of a few pillars access is provided by a plate which is connected to the platform with a few hinges there are however two lamp posts a timetable and a few chairs so if you dont like the platform you can still use these parts in a variety of other constructios to end off i took a pic of the complete set with extra wagon and a friendly surprised train driver opening the door and greeting the camera man conclusion being a 90s set the train basically builds itself the entire build cost me two hours and a half i lost quite some time simply admiring the set and was extremely straightforward with no suprises at all but i need to admit it has its charm the exterior is simply amazing the sleekness of the design the colours it matches perfectly i believe however that a width of 8 studs would be more to scale but 6 wide still looks amazing the interior is somewhat simplistic but is easily moddeable with a few extra pieces i basically bought the train as a parts pack the standard set three wagons includes no less than 8 train doors with windows 14 train windows 4 smaller longer ones and 4 freight doors the front and back of course count as unique pieces as well one feature i am displeased with are the printed doors i like printed pieces and while the bluewhitered stripe looks beautiful on the side the printed doors kind of limit mocing capabilities to carriages with a stripe on the side i considered simply removing the stripe but i found out i could just get normal grey ones from bricklink for a fair price i am very pleased with the train but since you already know my opinion feel free to tell us yours of this fabulous set edited by thebrickster 09 july 2009  0151 pm poll question was not multiple choice switched to radio group	positive

i remember to literally jump of joy when my grandfather offered it to me for christmas its an amazing set the train is really beautiful and it comes with 11  mfs so can somebody ask for more	positive
its great to see someone reviewing a train this set is definately a five lego hasnt made a complete train set like this in a long time the metroliner is really a legend among classic trains the great level of playability and detailing makes it a terrific model specifically i was just noticing the details of the passenger car it has a sink  how cool is that and 11 minifigs  when was the last time lego included 11 figs in a single set a truly outstanding train set thanks for sharing images as ive always wanted to see it upclose it would be awesome if you could share some single side shots of the cars	positive
outstanding train set the legend of the entire train series is the metroliner this is a super 5 set the color design minifigs is just so perfect and lovely it resemble the trains which we see on our rails in our daily life i cant find any flaws on this at all the only flaw i noticed is my mistake of not able to buy this set at all in fact i had never seen this set in the shops before in my entire life thebrickster on aug 5 2008 0923 am said how cool is that and 11 minifigs  when was the last time lego included 11 figs in a single set there is another set fufil the criteria above which is also a well known legend it has 12 minifigs which is the 10159 city airport aka century skyway airport	positive
nice review i collect all metroliner i can i have 3 metroliner and when i can i buy a other  my aim  have the more big metroliner collect in france  in first time  its my favorite set	positive
this is a great review of a great set hairy ruben i voted for outstanding since the only thing you can say about this train set is that it is outstanding it has been the best passenger train in all the time from legos beginning on until now i bought the rereleased version of it in 2003  and i really really do not regret it klausdieter	positive
i also voted outstanding for the simple reason that ive owned this set for a long time but for most of the time its been an anonymous heap of bricks mixed with all the other bricks i have so about a year ago i started rebuilding it and it now sits proudly next to also rebuilt 2150 on my shelf imo its an excellent set best of the 9v passenger trains no doubt and it combines the best of the 80s trains with that of the 90s  its not some futuristic panoramaglassed lowslung train but an honest realisticlooking train that captures many of the features that passenger trains used to and in some cases still have	positive
hairy ruben on aug 5 2008 1200 am said the interior of the two however is laid out a bit differently the space in the front carriage is occupied by a cockpit or whatever it is called in trains and some space to store your cable connecting the front lights with the engine i can imagine it must get quite cramped and dangerous for the minifig driver with all the cabling further back we have a quite random weird looking engine one part reminded me rather of a jet engine on a commercial airplane the engine is accessible by means of the two side cargo doors at the end of our first carriage we hit what looks like the trains restaurant two tables and no chairs there shouldnt be so much of the light cable in the front section or cockpit most of the cable should be in the central part of the train then it is not so crowded for the engine driver i have never had a problem with the cable and the space available for it the only problem i had was that the cable had a loose contact after some time when the train went into a curve cant remember if it was a left or right curve the light went off i have now got the same problem with the cable that i put into my santa fe super chief always when the engine turns into a right curve the light goes off my dad could repair the cable for the metroliner even though he is quite skilled at repairing electronic things he found it very difficult to repair since there were no screws to open the electronic plate it annoyed him a lot so ive been asking myself if i should really bother him with a second cable with the same problem the train set itself is outstanding and thats what i voted for i only have the legend 10001 but its 99 identical to 4558 i also have club car 4547 i dont have the legend club car 10002 the reason for this is i always had the choice between one big lego set or several small ones for christmas when i was a child i always went for several small ones metroliner 4558 would have been a big train set but i really wanted a passenger car so i bought 4547 with my savings without having the metroliner i was quite happy when the metroliner was rereleased i bought it with my own money then i could finally use the club car with the train it was created for edited by legotrainfan 15 august 2008  0755 pm	neutral
i dont like the set and i do like the set the reason why i like it it looks good the reason why i hate it this train was the first train for the new 9v system and it means to me the end of the beautiful 12v series for this last reason i own this set i voted average only strange they named it metroliner in holland when we speak of a metro i need to think at short distance trains only used in big cities like rotterdam and your minifigs at pic aint right according the instruction 	neutral

i never got this set i spent a long time after one christmas trying to get and failed miserably admittedly i was much younger then it has however remained one of my most sought after items but i’ve still never got around to getting one the set generally makes me rather nostalgic for a time when the trains were painted in simple liveries like that one anyway it seems an excellent set from what i’ve seen and the figure selection is amazing i hope lego produce something as good as this when the new trains are released next year	positive
i got my indy exclusive in the mail today packaging front back instructions minifigs this set comes with 1 minifig the standard indy with hat and whipno satchel the build i am really happy with the amount of frown headlight bricks that come with this set 12 in all the mudguards are cleverly built with 1 x 2 panels and 1 x 1 panel corners in dark green in the first 2 pages of the instructions there are a lot of great pieces this set would sell like mad if it were released for sale parts monkeys alone would go insane buying these up for the dark green and frown pieces the body of the car consists of black plates brackets and modified bricks with curved tops that allow the dark green mudguards to just peak out cool technique the grill looks cool using only six pieces i wish all small sets were this unique and cool heres the completed jeep it looks a little small for an actual jeep but for a brickmaster set its awesome imo some more detail shots of the set with indy in the drivers seat i hope they take brickmaster exclusives overseas because itd be awesome if everybody could get these my buddy copmike would probably love to be the first to review this set so ive dedicated my review comic to him my rating playability 810 you need to add some other sets and characters to really play with this set design 910 great techniques and inclusion of rare parts but loses a point for being an unrealistic size for a jeep price 1010 part of the brickmaster package it is a reasonable prize for an exclusive set and everything else that comes with the subscription overall 910 great but not perfect and definitely needs to be offered overseas lego would make a ton of money releasing this for sale imo as it really is a terrific small set	positive
super review thanks simply put id have to admit this is one of the best indy sets and in such a small package its a very detailed lil jeep and thats why i like it i have this too but i dont want to open it since its exclusive wait i thought we were calling it rown and not frown	positive
thanks for the review hinckley i love this set i still havent renewed my bm subscription but im sure i can find this on ebay or bricklink and what an addition this would be to my army edited by vbbn 05 august 2008  0132 am	positive
nice review hinckley i just got mine as well by paying quite a high price for it since its exclusive to us however i had not opened it yet and i left it in my friends car i gave it for an above average for that cool little jeep for an exclusive brickmaster set this is certainly one of the best vehicles i had ever seen i like its construction built if this is ever released in the main stream i am sure it will be a hit to get a small sized indiana jones set	positive
outstanding set and review thanks for presenting it ive had this since it first came out but didnt think it would be that impressive so i didnt bother opening it now im tempted aside from the slight size issue i cant find anything here to gripe about except for the limited availability i want 5 i think that makes me a parts monkey eek eek youre exactly right about this selling like mad its another one of those missed opportunities for tlg sure its nice to get people to subscribe by offering it as part of brickmaster but in the long run put it in the stores for 6 and sell a million just give us indys manbag we need it for postal employees and such as is the running joke whenever i comment on one of your reviews id give this a solid 985 not out of anything just 985 or in clearer terms  12 though i voted 5	positive
nice review i would like to get this set unfortunately i dont get brickmaster mag and the prices on bl ebay will most likely be ridiculous i wonder why indy doesnt come with his murse man purse in this set thats the best part of the fig the jeep itself is very nice especially with the dark green by the way what is frown brownish something i guess oh yeah and funny comic	positive

thanks for the cool review hinckley when i saw the picture originally i thought it looked good but not that good but seeing the pictures in your review i love this i voted it as outstanding because it has great parts and a brilliant construction ingenious perhaps sirnadroj on aug 5 2008 0230 am said simply put id have to admit this is one of the best indy sets i agree its so sad we europeans cant get it	positive

thanks for the good review  i can´t wait for mine to arrive and just think how close paulc was in his reverse building of this which turned into a event exclusive in billund  he was just wrong on the color of the headlight bricks black instead of frown and the rear bumper stuff which couldn´t be seen on the bag picture kudos paulc as for my badass patrol car and the sop standard operation procedure of cavity searches there´s more to see here over at brickzone  here´s a teaser copmike	positive
this set easily is above average for me i had this as a little child and whenever any of my relatives came to visit us they brought me some lego usually it was either this set or 6844 the really nice thing about this set are the alternate builds for the low price you got a nice range of parts and cool ideas what to build with them you could build a fleet of rovers or the alternates and everytime it was huge fun 	positive
i voted average its a cute set and one which i built from parts many times as a kid i didnt own the set though thanks for the review	neutral
i voted below average since im not a big fan of classic space	negative
this is by far my favourite outback series set i loved the fact that you can bend the bridge in different directions so that the suspension of the car really worked to keep the car levelled like you placed it in your last picture i had lots of fun with this when it came out eleven years ago in 1997 the bridge scene could also be used in the adventurers serie of 1998 classic highest rating buy it if you dont already have it	positive
a nice set to go with the outback theme i am kind of dissapointed they they didint continue the theme as i only managed to grab 6487 and 6550 none the less this set is very interesting as its one of the few to feature working suspention stauder	positive
metalandi on aug 5 2008 0856 pm said if youd only know what memories you brought back i think i remember this set better than any other i had when i was a child some time after i got it i decided to disassemble it and combine it with the jeep from 6552 rocky river retreat it came out pretty good though as it became the main attraction point of my town beeing the car of my favourite minifig back then and and and looong story  i kept it assembled that way from this day on until earlier this year when i finally disassembled it because i needed the parts great story i enjoy hearing people reminisce about the fun they had with certain sets i always wanted rocky river retreat but never picked it up thats a great adventure set as well i had never thought about mixing the two sets but they do have components that would compliment one another nicely if you still have the pieces you should try restoring the sets  its a lot of fun simonwillems on aug 6 2008 0437 am said this is by far my favourite outback series set i loved the fact that you can bend the bridge in different directions so that the suspension of the car really worked to keep the car levelled like you placed it in your last picture i had lots of fun with this when it came out eleven years ago in 1997 the bridge scene could also be used in the adventurers serie of 1998 i think i may like the outback airstrip a little better but its close i agree with you about the bridge the moving pieces are a nice feature and makes it harder for the jeep to cross the bridge does make a nice addition to adventurers i added it to my jungle adventure diorama a few months ago stauder on aug 6 2008 0527 am said i am kind of dissapointed they they didint continue the theme as i only managed to grab 6487 and 6550 at leat you were able to pick up two of the sets do you still have them andor the pieces bullet8542 on aug 6 2008 0957 am said why exactly did the outback adventure etc themes never quite catch onjust a thought youre right  i dont remember them being very popular yet they were really nice sets perhaps they drifted too far from the normal towncity theme with fire and police stations this would be a good thought for a future citytown subtheme	neutral

tks for the review once more jay  i totally agree with you jay  this set has very nice details suche as the mini gun movable ladder green barrels and great figs  however it is very expensive for what it is and i dont think there are that many very usefall parts in there  well i could use those treads  if i ever buy this set its really not for the design which i totally dislike	positive

this is my first review so i thought the smaller the set the better 6626 snowmobile year 2000 subtheme arctic pieces 20 1 extra note polybag 6577 is the boxed version price €1  sh on ebay misp mint in sealed polybag building time less than 2 minutes if it came out in the last months if would be called an impulse set it actually came out a few years ago being those my dark years i missed the arctic line now that im back into business i wanted some but not all of the sets were good or easily available i had the chance to buy this one and i0m happy with it as you can see below it consists of a figure on a scooter the only accessories are those chainsaws that lie on the sides unless you take the skis from the scooter and have the minifig wear them the extra piece is a transyellow 1x1 round plate according to brickset and peeron the difference between box and polybag is the sticker sheet you choose whether the nose is better with or without the sticker id say with the judgement its cheap it has a cool minifig with a cool head accessory and a nice torso i dont think i like that orange colour that much and i cant understand why those blue pieces have to be blue i guess its beacuse the whole line uses blue with orange but i have to say this is definetely a good set id give it a 4 out of 5 in its category if you want to own at least a set per every theme this could be your arctic one packaging content minifig i hear you ask whats that yellow thing on the left leg dust or something alike the snowmobile edited by the cobra 07 august 2008  0233 pm	neutral
here we are my first clone wars set and my first star wars review here we have the wonderful droid gunship one of the cheaper of the clone wars sets this set is exclusive to walmart and its one of the better exclusives out there im looking at you twilight  first off we have a shot of the entire set with the box a random page shot along with pics of the parts list the build is split up into three sections the back the cockpit and the missles the back has a lot of nice dark blue plates and is the only part of the set which uses stickers the bottoms shows various technic systems which ill get to later the cockpit has many details mostly guns and the rotating guns are a nice touch the cockpit can fit a battle droid but not a minifig im not sure why a droid would want leather though the last part is loading this baby with the missles there are four blacksmall and two dark bley large missles which are loaded in groups of three as sls the middle mechanism is for the missiles and the back part with the bionicle teeth are used ad landing gear the knob on top turns to release the missiles on the clones  leftover bits and the used ssnot so d this time around the gunship versus a time traveling agent charge  overall build 810 a basic build but at some points repetitive minifigs 1010 just your basic droids you cant go wrong design 710 a basic design with some interesting techniques pieces 910 a mix of old and new pieces along with the return of this lovely piece which hasnt been seen for almost 10 years price 810 30 for a gunship ill take it final verdict 810 a great price for a small set like this and it has a great bit of swooshability	positive
so it comes with an extra gunholding arm it looks like it and thats great that way you can make all of the droids guntotting ones	positive
this is a very nice looking set it could do with a few more clones but hopefully that will be fixed next year with battle packs back to the set i think the colors on this are great i love dark blue and the design is pretty good too it seems to be pretty accurate compared to the real thing thanks for the review	positive

emergency evac set  6445 theme town resq year released 1998 piece count 97 minifigs 1 list price 8 usd in 1998 lego introduced a new theme called resq the theme was really a quasicoast guard subtheme of classic town the theme included boats helicopters emergency vehicles and even a water hovercraft most notable was the black and yellow color combination that predominated the sets i only picked up a couple of sets from the theme including this emergency evacuation vehicle that i consider a van i never got into the theme but looking back at these sets i have gained a better appreciation for their value in classic town lets take a look at 6445 in greater detail starting with the box the back of the box providing a few alternate models and similar imagery on the instructions the set includes one small sheet of decals for the van 6445 has one resq minifig that i find pretty nice i like the neon orange reflectors he has a nice printed backside with the word resq prominently displayed this little set includes an abundance of tools a black walkietalkie is not pictured heres the emergency van i like the back section that has a nice winch with turning wheel and a few hooks for tools heres the minifig pulling the grappling hook for some resq action this is my favorite part of this set the van isnt too fancy but has some neat features while i like the blue windshield piece for maybe space sets im not really fond of its use for the van the van has no steering wheel but rather two levers for steering on the top of the vehicle are two emergency alarms and some extra lights the back of the van has a large opening piece that allows wide access to the back section it comfortably fits a long gurneystretcher heres the driver resting on the gurney he should never have tried to pick up the gurney without a 2nd resq minifig and a shot of the back section without the gurney lastly a picture of the complete set final thoughts resq is really a neat theme that has great play value for kids while its not one of my more favorite town subthemes it does offer some nice pieces and an abundance of black and yellow pieces i think a few of the resq sets go nicely with the divers theme released one year earlier in 1997 i had a chance to purchase the largest set of the theme 6479 emergency response center at half the price but passed back in the late 90s id be interested in finding out what other eb members think of this set and the resq theme	positive
wow and people complain that a military type line would be to violent here we have half dead soilders and a space shuttle bombing people with severed skeleton heads i have to say this is the first time ive heard of this theme i like the colors as most have pointed out the base plate is preety cool two could use it to moc up some garages	positive
i am a proud owner of this set like others i got it discounted and couldnt resit the parts pack this is the type of lego sets that bothers me when you look at it now youd be tempted to say hey not bad but at the same time some years ago it wasnt good enough to buy it full price i was kinda disappointed because usually sets using that kinda baseplates are excellent castle paradisa and this one is just ok one really minus point would be the lack of any opponent faction in the set	negative
thats it thanks for the review but now you make me want to build my own one thanks a lot on a more serious note i really like this set and have always wished to aquire it i have two broken tie interceptors so this should be a easy build and as someone in the pirate forum i think said it would be a great baseplate for building cave to hide the booty thanks pmg and welcome	positive
thanks for the welcome everyone though im still wondering where the drone minioncommander idea came from	neutral
set 7680  the twilight theme star wars year released 2008 piece count 882 price aud14999 or 15999 if you buy at tru 9999 euro us9999 pity the twilight when rumours of the set name first circulated speculation was swift twilight  that suggests something sleek elegant and mysterious anticipation mounted fanfrenzy grew finally a pic leaked and the verdict was clunkadunk it appeared that in the jedi offseason anakin was running something that looked like an intergalactic garbage scow like roger wilco in the old sierra space quest pc games blocky and bley seemed to sum it up the set went from being one of the most anticipated to one of the least liked of 2008 pretty much instantly its a mark of that dislike that in the eb clone wars review feeding frenzy nobody has so far even bothered to post a few pics of this set even 2 weeks after its official release im here to redress that imbalance now and find out if 7680 is as horrendous as everyone originally thought part 1 box  parts front of the box its quite big same size as the 10144 sandcrawler annoyingly its the old style with the perforated corners that you have to tear to flip open the lid detail of the back showing set functions interior of the box  a lot of wasted space the set comes with 2 instruction manuals each 76 pages and no dss sheet polybags 13 of em like the other cw sets these are unnumbered parts ahoy you can tell at a glance that this set is comparable to the atte although there a large proportion of the 800 parts here are technic pins and bley plates part 2 minifigs and build the set comes with 4 figs or 35 depending on how you look at rotta  anakin ahsoka r2d2 and rotta very disappointing that theres nothing new here for such a highpriced exclusive although i guess it is maybe movie accurate anyway to paraphrase the wise patsy stone you can never have enough hats shoes or new anakin ahsoka hairpieces so its not too bad pics of the build in progress a quarter of the way through we can already see that this is one of those convoluted technic frames with some plates affixed type builds halfway and the smaller wing is added at the three quarter mark the giant single wing is added and voila done the final quarter is a race to attach all the exterior surfaces and details such as the engine and escape pod the build itself is a mixed blessing it is very technic oriented im not a technically minded person and dont really have much of a conceptual grasp of how everything functions until i see the final result so i find these type of builds a little uninteresting pins axles and beams give me bricks any day i really liked the 7676 gunship and the 7679 fighter tank although they do contain some technic framework they are largely brickbuilt ships especially the fighter tank which is solid largely brick built and full of neat functions the 7680 build is one of the most technicy builds ive ever undergone in a system set akin to the experience of building the 10178 motorised atat but whereas with that set you could understand the need for a technic framework the thing walks a lot of this seemed excessive yes the twilight does some have nice functions and it is so large and heavy it does need a strong skeleton but to me it just seemed too much and aesthetics have been sacrificed for in some cases limited functionality i will discuss in more detail what i mean as i look at different parts of the set on the upside this is the only nonsymmetric set in the cw range so at least every page and new step brings something different part 3 a closer view closeup of the main body of the ship fronton it is welldesigned how the figs appear in line of sight unlike the 6211 where jabba and leia were photoshopped in to the box art dont ask what rotta is doing out of the line of vision there some things are better left unsaid side view showing escape pod smaller cylinder and drive top view rear view showing back door the rear deck is huge indeed the whole ship is huge oddly so i dont know if this is moviescale or not but ive seen people complain the fighter tank is too big  and that set is nothing compared to this baby its wider than the gunship and in wingspan and length is almost bigger heres a few pics next to an mtt for comparison pretty big hey turning to the dark side must be good for business even if all you can buy is a rusty old beast like this at least you could comfortably squash pretty much every vehicle in the opposing fleet just by landing on it at least now you can see why it costs so much the official pics make it look smaller somehow by truncating the rear and wing the ship is in fact so big you cant really pose it with wings open  only hold it that way i was too lazy to build a giant transclear support strut so propped it up on a shoebox instead the wing opens very neatly  you push a technic lever and a pin holding the bottom wing pops out quite smoothly the little top turret can move up and down as well to get the full crossshaped effect part 4 features and functions the front cockpit folds down very neatly although i find the build here a little weak whee it goes all the way down to the floor the mechanism is cool but it takes up an awful lot of space basically the whole front is cockpit and all lego could manage for controls is 2 printed 1x2 tiles as well not pictured here but theyre attached to the part that folds up and down theres also no way for anyone to get in or out of the cockpit and an invisible windscreen technology has come a long way side view looking from wing r2d2 is here as well as some tools you can also glimpse here one of the main problems with the set despite being a huge boxy ship theres no interior none the twilight doesnt even have an internal floor all the room inside is taken up by the landing gear which folds up  again a clever function but it really gets in the way of the set as a whole kudos to the designer for coming up with stable working landing gear but too clever by half if it means that this giant ship ends up basically being one tiny cockpit and a rear door at the back that doesnt lead to any interior underside showing landing gear when open and closed  when the wing is folded down the gear is locked in place which is pretty neat spaceconsuming but neat the rear section the door when opened reveals an orange cupboard and a towline as ahsoka uses in the box art the door clicks into place when open and can be released by pressing the technic bit at the top again clever but pointless as you cant get inside ahsoka can indulge in a little recreational bungeejumping if she so wishes the rear deck is so large that it is wasted just being used so ahsoka can bungeejump i came up with a much better use for it outdoor garden despite having one roboticised hand anakin was still quite the green thumb and his lightsaber was very useful as a hedge trimmer so much so that he set up a side business between rottarescue missions heres a promotional postcard a few other bits and pieces the gun turret on the enormous megawing can only hold one flick fire missile at a time you do get two though  rear engine detail the escape pod sits neatly on the side and is basically built the same way as the gunship bacta tank the pod sits on these tehcnic pins and is held in place by the light bley parts part 5 in conclusion the twilight is a huge ship with a huge amount of great functions  folding wing folding cockpit rear door escape pod retractable landing gear but this functionality comes at a price  a very complex technic build and zip interior compared with the gunship for example which is stuffed with nooks and crannies the twilight suffers in this respect i also think it is just too large  it doesnt really fit with the other craft and vehicles released with the clone wars line i may be wrong and it is movieaccurate but when you have all the cw sets laid out it does stick out like a poor thumb part selection is ok with the only interesting things being a few dark orange plates the orange cupboard and the big transneon green radar dish dont get me wrong i dont think this is a bad set at all its just the other cw sets are so sweet i would say its an above average set in a field crammed with excellent ones if youre a completist buy it but if for example youd rather invest in another atte to upgrade your republic army then i couldnt really disagree with you either and to finish on a light note id like to remind you that you do get another ahsoka hairpiece which can be used for all sorts of things ugha warrior upgrade dr inferno hair transplant and finally attack of the deadly blueringed octopus native to australias beaches and oceans thanks for reading	neutral
another outstanding review by the awesome set reviewer i enjoyed reading this review very much and i felt that you have redress twilight in an approriate manner i have very mixed feeling about this set especially with its design it seemed i will need to watch the clone wars movie in the theatre before i compared with it most of the time when this lego set is used in a movie you will tend to compare it and what is the actual purpose for twilight same as the rest of the sw vehicles and aircraft for a high price like this i can actually top up a little more and get the atte with the same batch of minifigs plus commander rex if there is a special figure such as the v19 torrent clone pliot it will be a much ideal scenario at the moment i have not bring in any clone war sets into my collection and i am quite sure twilight is not in my priority list especially when i am not a fullpledged star war collectors or i have strong intentions to complete the entire range in this recent release therefore i need to prioritise my purchase and likely to get two rgs since that is my favourite ship in clone war era i am not comparing it with rgs both sets defintely have their pros and cons oh i love that postcard you made certainly looks very nice sveltecorps thanks for doing up this superb detailed review which had given twilight the neccessary attention it should have	neutral
really awesome review sveltecorps  you did a really complete and indepth review of this beast and with your nice pics is really enjoyable reading your review so congrats  i like this ship even if it looks so bulky but i need to buy first other sets so maybe this beast will be landing in my collection the next year or this one if i am lucky  i can just ask for something can you post a pic of all your clone wars sets together with this one all the sets in one pic not many pics with this an each set  please  edited by darkrebellion 12 august 2008  0220 am	positive
wow certainly much bigger than i would have thought thanks for the great review and pictures  well for some reason i was drawn to this set but with the lack of interior and quite a bit of technics i think ill pass or at least get the atte first thanks again	neutral
hopewell on aug 11 2008 1124 pm said i read the visual guide recently and learned a bit more about the twilight i wont get into spoilers but it seems that the ship becomes a sort of endearing family van for the characters which is neat big bulky uncool but it gets you from one place to another if it factors into more than just the 90 minute film i may pick this up it seems that theres room for a lot of personality in this ship once you see the film it is a corellian freighter smuggling spice for the hutts thats cool right lol the minivan of the galaxy  what a selling point if i am really impressed with it in the film i suppose that would change things but i will have to see 	positive
this is probably the best review ive ever seen why it put the set in context with peoples changing thoughts about it it commented on the box why do such expensive sets have such ordinary boxes the photography was outstanding every issue that a builder could have with it was discussed in a calm and rational manner i have the same issues with technic structured sets and sveltecorps summed up my feelings on this beautifully this was an even handed review so thoughtful finally you gotta love a bit of humour in a review that gardenis brilliant i was probably never going to get this set anyway but it sets a new worlds best standard for reviews i strongly encourage anyone thats going to review a set to have a good look at this to see how well it can be done thanks for the magnificent review	positive
thanks a lot for a very nice and entertaining review your photos were really nice and there have been some reviews lately that have such blurry pics cough cough it was a pleasure to see you can 1 put lego bricks together 2 write a review 3 handle your camera i think this ship is underrated it is really nice i love the playing features like landing gear and back door perhaps just cause i had to get along with so called landing gears in the past that did not work at all 7140 for example and i simply love that there is space inside you said there is not really some cause of the landing gear mechanism but it seems it should be easily fixed do you think there is enough space to put some plates over the landing gear and add some beds kitchen und tv i think this set is so perfect to mod it into a clone wars mobile home your back garden ist just perfect for this i prefer this over the atte and over a 2nd gunship thanks a lot for the review	positive
zzz on aug 12 2008 0900 pm said and i simply love that there is space inside you said there is not really some cause of the landing gear mechanism but it seems it should be easily fixed do you think there is enough space to put some plates over the landing gear and add some beds kitchen und tv i think this set is so perfect to mod it into a clone wars mobile home your back garden ist just perfect for this it does have that homely feel there is room inside with technic beams to lay plates etc on the only issue is that its kind of fiddly to access you could do it from either the side door or rear door though maybe move that tow line at the back i have to say it is a set that grows on you	positive
thank you sveltecorps for the review i like the inside nice and cosey i also like your little garden for me this put the twilight different in a better perspective than my first perspective of the twilight i voted outstanding greets theforce	neutral
i will not be picking this one up the main thing is that it simply looks akward it is big and bulky and seems to have random pieces on it with not reall streamline feel to it i also agree that for an exclusive that it 100 it needs more than just 35 mini figures anikan and ashoka and rotta already come in the atte which is cheaper and has more figures r2d2 is a figure that i am sure everybody has at least 4 or 5 of for that kind of money i expect something with at least one unique figure and more than 4 i also want just a cleaner and better designed set this is probably the letdown of the collection so far every collection needs one	negative
seems like tlc has done a pretty accurate representation of the ship the real fault for the ships messy design has to go to lucasfilm not tlc my guess is lucasfilm is trying to recapture that what a piece of junk magic of the millennium falcon i guess well have to wait to see the movie to see if they succeeded or not the idea of a space mobile home reminds me of the winnebago from spaceballs great review informative entertaining and opinionated so many people shy away from stating an actual opinion in their review for fear of offending anyone whats the point of making a review if you dont state what you think about it	neutral
i think some people agree that this ship is better than when we first saw those pictures at least i do it looks like it has some nice accessories that come with the ship as well my favorite of you custom things has got to be the octopus its so funny and a great use for the headdress thing great review edited by skipper 24 13 august 2008  1124 am	positive

i bought four of these sets i guess this was the best selling impulse set so far great idea to have weapons and helmet choice as for the price id say 7090 is surprisingly cheap	positive
very good set indeed the possibility to alter the knights appearance hugely boosts the value very smart thinking of tlc got one of these so far but if i ever do a castlerelated comic or animation this will be the set i buy tons of	positive
argh what i was typing kept getting deleted by my stupid keyboard on topic this looks like a great little set i could use a few of these but i havent seen any at a local store too bad for me i suspose  great review and i like the green plate on the bottom never can have too many greens for my small but expanding swamp im building hope i can pick some of these up eventualy	positive
time for another of the great castle sets and yes this one is a great army builder set as well d set 7090 set title crossbow attack price 529 euro  599 usd pieces 54 release 2007 the box and as the other two sets reviewd so far 7009 and 5615 this one has a fitting box that is too easily snatched from the shelf and put into your shopping cart  not sure its a great thingtoo expensive in the end d the crossbow attack cart the cart is a neat little build that actually works and for once were not given that awful technic launcher but a buildit launcher it actually works just fine for its purpose the addition of two crossbows makes it worth buying never can get enought weapons for the evergrowing crownie army the figs oddly ive not taken any pics of the figs and therefore ill illustrate using the sh pic the figs are great i love the silver helmets and in this set you get 2 crownies and a skeleton plus a white skeleton horse thats a lot of figs for a set this size a true army builder thumbs up for that the all in all verdict another small yet super set in the castle theme i bought several of these to make a fine little army its cheap and often found on sale i can hardly resist buying it when i see it kimt	positive
hard to find in italian shops i had a friend buying one for meas soon as the set was available i always wanted another one so while in switzerland see kimts 7009 review for the full story i bought two for 5 €uros you get two knights a skeleton and a skeleton horse some hand weapons and a shooting device please remember dont aim at the eyes just great	positive
this little bugger brought me back from my dark ages as a movie fan i just couldnt resist the thought of making an animation with living lego skeletons im referring to ray harryhausens work on the classic jason and the argonauts here buying the indy sets stopped me from getting a lot more castle sets though in time i added the final joust the wizard and the impulse knight to my collection as well as buying more unique figs king princess from expensive castle sets off bricklink so yeah great little set two crownies a skeleton and a skeletal horse you just cannot resist that even if you hadnt been buying lego for 5 years as far as im concerned this set is one for the ages i love it	positive
and another set enters the scene set 7009 set title the final joust price 829 euro  799 usd pieces 62 release 2007 the box and yet again tlg has put the bricks in a box that somehow corresponds with the amount of bricks in it the castle theme has got well designed boxes  the whole set build 2 knights jousting fence and weapon rack the weapons rack another great addition of weapons flail halberd and skeleton scimitar super weapons for those close encounter melee battles fought when tipped off the horse  grinp the jousting fence not much to say its a fence simple yet it serves its purpose very well the crown knight gotta love that guy he looks like nothing can hurt him he even got a selfsufficient smile on his face im sure hes convinced that no skeleton can defeat him also the horse its barding and the headcover looks awesome a great old school sword and the ever cool normannic shield what could possibly go wrong for this knight the helmet i really love imo its a lot better than the old knight helmets see review of 5615 the knight for a pic of one of those the skeleton knight the black skeleton horse rocks i love that design and in black its even badder than than the white version the shield reeks of dread and the knight is one bad skeleton on the rampage i do find that the helmet is a little off id rather have a black knights helmet instead the kk helmet doesnt really do it for me the all in all verdict this is another great army builder set it holds a lot of great weapons some cool minifigs and great pieces the only thing that puzzles me is why would a crown knight joust a skeleton doesnt really make sense kimt	positive
ive been waiting to hold this set in my hands for about a year and a half thanks to a silly tlc decision 7009 was not available in italian stores i finally decided to buy it on the net 2x  plus some other sets and those morons at the custom charged me quite a lot after i bought it while waiting for it to arrive i found out it was available in a store in switzerland not far away from home thats for the storytelling as for the set i thought it was great and still think so a good army builder as quite a few sets in the 20072008 castle line and a time traveller 6021 being my first lego castle set ever rating 55 edited by the cobra 13 august 2008  0904 pm	positive
lovely set nice collection of weapons cool horseaccesoires for the white knight cool black skeletal horse on the dark knights side loving the printed armours of both knights and as opposed to kimt apparently i really dig the black helmet i feel theres a lord of the ringsflavour to it with those curves well designed	positive
another small set my local target doesnt have they dont have the best castle selection they only really have dwarven mines and castle seiges ill buy this if i see it there though because it looks like a great little set i could use the awesome knight and a skeleton that has a regular body so he looks like he is in armor	positive
i should really get one more of these for the figures shields and weapons this set is the only one with the scythe in pearlgrey by the way the only thing that puzzles me is why would a crown knight joust a skeleton good question for a joust to make sense this set should contain two human knights instead  which would be fine with me so long as they had differing armour and colours edited by tenorikuma 13 august 2008  0351 am	neutral
im not a huge fan of this set but it is a great way to nab a fully mounted knight complete with a very attractive barding given that in prior years it wasnt possible to get a barded horse in such a small set this set is actually a decent way to build a mounted cavalry for your kingdom looking at bricklink it would probably cost as much to buy the knight horse and weapons separately and that doesnt take into account the skeleton or the extra bricks despite my indifference to this set i actually have purchased four of them in the past year simply because there isnt a cheaper way to acquire a mounted knight a quick question about the poll are we voting on the quality of the set or the quality of the review later edited by blueandwhite 13 august 2008  0550 am	neutral
kimt on aug 13 2008 0500 am said the quality of the set feel free to comment on the review andor set also thanks  the set is average its useful for picking up a few knights but im not really partial to the skeleton the idea of a knight and a skeleton tilting just strikes me as being odd my biggest issue with the current castle line is that most sets force you to purchase a mixture of skeletonsknights orcsknights orcsdwarves etc this is fine for those of you who love your fantasy however it makes the line a bit underwhelming for the rest of us still as mentioned earlier the set does have an upside so it is worth a purchase the review on the other hand is aces with great photos and a detailed description of the set and its contents nice work	neutral
tenorikuma on aug 13 2008 0348 am said i should really get one more of these for the figures shields and weapons this set is the only one with the scythe in pearlgrey by the way except its just plain darkgrey you must have gotten this set mixed with another though ive never heard of a pearlgrey scythe	neutral
good review kimt pictures are clear and show each of the pieces in great detail i agree with your comments as well im a bit curious does the knights helm have a hole for plume ive been debating whether to purchase this set or not im not a big fan of horses so ill likely barely use them but i do like the unique minifigs weapon rackweapons and the fact that the divider has a few useful pieces that can be added to other sets however i just dont feel the set is worth 8 when compared to crossbow attack and the knights catapult unless the buyer is really wanting some mounted minifigs luckily amazon just lowered their price of this set from 8 to 6 along with another 20 if using bill me later just in case anyone was also in the same situation i was in at that price its damn well worth it	positive
dj2005 on aug 29 2008 1126 am said im a bit curious does the knights helm have a hole for plume i can answer on behalf for kimt if memories served me right yes there is a hole for placing the knights plume do correct me wrong if i had answered wrongly its been awhile since i last touched my castle sets thanks kimt for this fine review this is one of the castle sets which i had bought high volume mainly for its horses barding and the weapons a great army builder and accessories for your castle armies this is an instant 5	positive
indexed name holiday villa theme lego system  town year 1988 pieces 197 minifigs 2 price usd  there were quite a few sets in the 1980s that werent sold in the us i remember reading once that it was because they contained wine glasses and tlg felt they wouldnt be able to market a toy that encourage the drinking of alcohol this set was one of them i remember seeing this in a catalog that came with a fabuland set and wondering what it was and where i could get one i wrote to lego and got an overseas catalog which had the futuron 6990 monorail transport system in it before it was available in the us i was amazed i ended up buying 6349 holiday villa from that catalog but for some reason gave it to my best friend for his birthday ive always wanted this set and finally bought it from bricklink this year my purchase included everything except the box i really like the boxes but in lieu of a boxshot here is the instruction manual i imagine this was the image on the front of the box the parts one of the things that appealed to me about this set is its abundance of rare parts this base plate is an excellent piece and was only available in two sets classic lego telephone technically these blue windows 1 x 4 x 5 windows are only available in this set according to bricklink it was available in different form with and without fixed glass trans blue glass in other sets regardless this size and color window is rare and the blue door was only available in 4 sets this was a huge selling point for me as im a window monkey never heard that term its like a parts monkey a collector who buys mulitples of sets just for parts or large lots of bulk from bl and sorts them into bins but just for windows tell your friends i coined the term these sloped windows have endless possibilities in many themes maybe not with the curtain decals applied but are another great rare part that appears in this set the build remember this piece id like to see a badass agents car built on this car base  i am a fan of the sixwide car but i see the appeal of the four wide it has a very nostalgic feel to it theres no denying that this is a beauty of classic lego 4wide cars this set comes with two minifigures one of which appears to be a painter classic vintage lego figs onto the house which begins with the basic floorplan a kitchen thats open to the rest of the house and a little oven and hood vent is one of my favorite touches its one thing to throw an oven into a house set but the designer of this set made it a cool part of the architecture of the house which gives it a unique feel the completed first floor and carport i do wish the sides of the roof were white with a little overhang like an actual roof this method of white on bottom red on top looks more like a childs drawing than a real house this is easily fixed with some modifying still you get a lot of roof pieces in this set here we have the completed set the husband cleans the yard while the wife gets plastered on wine dont tell the american kids another angle working in the kitchen getting smashed before dinner i think she may have a serious problem the bedroom a little stark but the bed looks comfy overall shot of the interior rating playability 910 the possibilities are endless with drunky mcwinewine and husband really playability is up to the imagination of the player its a house not really very actionpacked design 9510 great design with plenty of rare parts love the classic car too loses half a point for the all red roof price na i believe this was inexpensive but since i have no proof i will have to leave this factor out of the overall rating overall 92510 classic sets like this all deserve 10s in my book but looking at it with an objective eye its excellent but not perfect	positive
this looks like a really great set i wasnt around in 88 to get it but i like it it actually has things inside the interior thanks for the review hinckley on aug 13 2008 0611 pm said there were quite a few sets in the 1980s that werent sold in the us hooray sort of in england we dont get in normal shops batman and spongebob sets and not at all  avatar sets and brickmaster but america gets all of these maybe its revenge for americas lego neglect in the 80s hinckley on aug 13 2008 0611 pm said i remember reading once that it was because they contained wine glasses and tlg felt they wouldnt be able to market a toy that encourage the drinking of alcohol this set was one of them they didnt want to encourage the drinking of alcohol in america but were fine encouraging it in other places maybe thats why my country has such a big problem with binge drinking or maybe not	positive

lots of rare parts and a good baseplate sounds great how much did this cost you and where did you get it from	positive

this is my favourite house which i owned during my childhood although its in the crypt but i hope to build it back one day looking at your review makes me so envy of you to own a complete set the baseplate is very unique especially for its stoned pattern classic lego telephone is just so lovely especially when its printed the entire house layout is simple and very nicely constructed in fact the simplicity just showed how much lego could do with such parts there are many nice furnitures included in this set such as the little ovenstove dining table bed and car porch the little black car is a classic example of a true 4studs car i love this house very much and my verdict is a full 5 no doubt about it thanks hinckley for this lovely review	positive
ive 2 of these sets one is for sale 	neutral
this is a really good set what makes it nice is that it is so simple but perfect a feeling that sets dont emit often these days i voted outstanding hinckley on aug 13 2008 0711 pm said remember this piece id like to see a badass agents car built on this car base i was bored and i needed inspiration its not agents but hey nothing is perfect dr brick	positive
cool review i never knew that those wineglasses could be the reason for this not being sold in the us	neutral
i wish i could find this set some day including the right baseplate some of my house mocs are styled after the classic 6349 and sometimes ive rebuilt it after instruction scans exchanging the baseplate i dont own one of these with 2 at 16x32 each and this city house out of an older thread of mine its offensive that ive used styling elements of 6349s just enlarged in terms of interior details not much but still enough for classic town i voted outstanding mfg widdi edited by widdi 09 october 2008  0122 am	positive
this is an awesome set man and a great review just too bad it is so rare i voted 5 by the way does anyone know if there is a review for this or other sets that come with a camper perhaps also i was wondering if the creator houses are in scale and could be used with minifigs and such	positive
this would be great for any pirate fan the extraback pack for the soldiers some spare owes for the row boats a female face for a wench and a rather simple raft for that unlucky pirate lost at sea over all a nice set i am a little confused by the dynamite though perhaps an easy way to go fishing or perhaps to clear a rock in the forseen future or is it that she is just a suicide bomber attacking the white house water joke not ment to be tasteless or offensive to those lost in the act of terrosim greatest respect to those who have lost loved ones great review regards cpt pb	positive
overall an excellent set concerning the price range nice review whitefang	positive
again a great review whitefang i voted for average the minifig and the accessoríes are excellent  but the raft itself is very poor klausdieter	neutral
glad some of you like this set for the wide variety of good accessories it seemed some are unfavour of the rafts design well i think for an impulse set the rafts design is quite good at least it took care of the color scheme well its just a simple raft for the adventurer to move onto the river stream and throw some dynamitte to blow some obstacles away cpt pegleg blockbeard on aug 14 2008 0329 pm said this would be great for any pirate fan the extraback pack for the soldiers some spare owes for the row boats a female face for a wench and a rather simple raft for that unlucky pirate lost at sea your comments make me feel like i has just done a pirate review instead of an extreme team review	positive

aerial recovery set  6462 theme town resq year released 1998 piece count 201 minifigs 3 list price 25 usd my personal favorite of the resq theme released in 1998 was this helicopter 6462 aerial recovery the set offered a pretty modern helicopter raft threewheeler rescue gurney and net and three figs including a diver the set is actionpacked and offers a high degree of play value starting with the box front side and back front back i always liked the rough oceansea water pictured in the boxart the same image from the front of the box appears on the cover of the instructions but the back of the instructions picture a plain view of the copter one sticker sheet with a few resq stickers is included mainly for the tail section of the helicopter interestingly the set includes three figures one being a diver what i always found strange is the inclusion of an xtreme team diver who has the logo on his torso although its a very nice fig back shot i think this was my first set with a lego threewheeler i always liked it a lot the set includes a yellow raft also found in the divers sets and some scuba gear note the raft has a black piece in its center for lifting up by the helicopter for sea and emergent rescue a gurney can also be lifted by the helicopter the set also includes a net with hook to lift the threewheeler and other items an extra string pulls the net closed heres a shot of the helicopter the front section has a large trans blue piece enclosing the cockpit inside is a printed radar slope a smaller trans blue piece appears a bit higher for access to the middle section of the helicopter andor a small storage area in the middle section is an place for the gurney and a box for storing some of the adventure gear heres a picture showing the gurney on the side is a pulley mechanism that swings to the right when not in use on the opposite side is the winch to raise and lower the grappling hook heres a picture of an open storage box i like the tail section with propeller decal is not shown heres another shot of the copter from a different angle and the final image the entire set final thoughts personally i think this is pretty nice set i like the thought of using the helicopter to rescue people at sea using the working winch extras like the trikethreewheeler and the rescue net make the set even more fun hope you enjoy this resq review	positive
cool then i think ill do a review of 6451 river response later today or tomorrow stay tuned	neutral
i got this set as well as a resq hovercraft this set is cool because of all the accessories and it come with a x team guy your set is also in much better condition than mine you have made me decide to rebuild it another great review thebrickster keep up the good work	positive
looks like a nice helicoptor i love the 2 cockpits i love the divers head i really need one of those	positive
this helicopter is so cool and i agreed with you that this is a high playablity set its not common to see such a big scale helicopter which has two cockpits back then the color scheme works well for me with so much features such as the lowering of the grappling hook storage box storing of the gurney and etc one thing which can be improved onto the helicopter is the rotors it could be extended a little longer as the size of the helicopter is too big it makes the rotors rather weak as it is not able to support the weight i am confused why there is an extreme team personnel there i thought he was supposed to be recovered from the resq team although there is so many questions in my head such as why include the black tricycle bike extreme team and etc but this is still one very good set to play with too bad i had never seen this before somehow through your review i like it very much the only big scale helicopter which i owned is the 7738 coast guard helicopter and lift raft neverthless i gave this a 4 thanks brickster	positive
the helicopter looks nice and the resq minifigs were nice the diver minifig had once been a personal favorite of mine	positive
a neat set with lots of accessories but i never liked any of the lego helicopters with long streamlined canopies as they are obviously more influenced by military helicopters and space ships than by real civilian transport helicopters id give it a 3 at best very good and thourough pictorial review though	positive
ive always wanted this set and the hovercraft too bad i never did great set	positive
i stopped collecting lego sets in the early 90s because of this kind of sets ive always been a classic town fan and i really didnt liked the futuristic design of tlcs newer sets	negative
i think the set is too unrealistic i like the new resq sets better and im somewhat a lifeboat freak so im always following such a sets with interest i would like to see some rigit inflatable boats some day  but about the chopper i like the accessoiries	negative
what exactly makes you feel this set isnt realistic it has got nothing what wouldnt be on a real helicopter imo and for the futuristic design yes it looks modern but it works and actually most of todays real helicopters also dont look like in the 70s anymore	positive
this is one of my favourite sets i remember getting it in tesco soon after it was released those were the days the resq line was good and this set made it better	positive
wow i loved this set i still have it actually in pieces though i took it apart quite soon after i got it then managed to lose the instruction manual	positive
very nice review this is another set which i had never seen before when i am in my dark age quite an useful set especially with the accessories and the minifigs torsos the speedboat is able to hold the car and the rubber rescue boat how can the driver steer this boat with so many things blocking the way i cant seemed to find its control though thanks for doing this review	neutral
nice review i always wanted this set the speed boat makes the set thanks for sharing	neutral
well i for one really like this set it has to be one of the nicer ribbies that tlg has made tons of playability and nice options for redesign great set overall thanks for the review	positive
nice review i collect castle too and the ghost isnt really rare i have one too but its not really found anymore so it would be a good thing to keep it anyway great review edited by mammymarf 15 august 2008  0848 pm	neutral
about the rarest one up there is that black ninja i only have one ninja and he is dark grey i also have five samurai the witch may be fairly rare but i am not sure i didnt really collect much in the fright knight era	neutral
this is a pretty nice set i really like the torso and its genericness so it can be used for other factions and at least this set has 2 shields althought i prefer the triangular ones instead of just 1 shield you get from crossbow attack from the wrong fraction id have liked a crown knights shield 100x better some improvements for this set would be a normal bow and a sword instead of 2 of the 3 crossbows smaller wheels and triangular shields 45 from me actually 35 but ill round it up	positive
originally shared in the history  adventure forum for its adventure attributes heres my favorite of the outback collection first let me say that this little set is one of my alltime favorites because it can be used to sumplement a number of different themes 1 the set makes a great little adventure airstrip for adventurers and more recent the indiana jones theme see also german headquarters and port adventure ive also used the set as an addition to my wild west town the tan baseplate and windmill works great just subtract the plane modern equipment and figs and lastly as the set was intended as an outbackdesert airstrip set description outback airstrip set  6444 pieces 157 minifigs 3 release date 1997 original price 20 usd starting with the box and the backside notice the alternate models i love the swamp boat the building is my favorite part of the set it is simple has a little detail two great roof pieces and a single green window great piece check out the great windmill piece its my only one and makes a great part for wild west and that farm you always wanted to build i used it for the barnhouse of barnabas higgens and spring valley ranch on the side of the building is a great radio and a clear glass unfortunately no furniture can be found within the building and now the airplane front view i love the twin propellors side view and the rear section the back has a small cargo hold for some boxesfreight or some gear needed in the outback the set includes three figs two with cool shades and some great equipment i love the boom box a shot of the whole set and another summary as i mentioned above this set is very versatile and can suplement a few different themes its my personal favorite of the outback collection and im really glad i was able to find the set in the late 90s i almost didnt buy sets like this are timeless and so much fun to build and display hope you enjoy the review edit additional reviews review by agentrick57 december 24 2007 outback airstrip review in history  adventure forum february 10 2008	positive
great review this set has cool features i just wish that lego would release this as a lego legend and release it to australia too since this is a set about australia i wouldve bought two if this were a lego legend that is how good it is i like the building with latticed window and windmill i also like the cargo airplane windsock and radios plus it looks like its got great minifigs	positive
this was a cool set i thoght of it as i was building the post plane	positive
the building is great and detailed with a few mods it could be added to my castle town i dont really like the plane though seems kind of abstract not really good in my opinion but i bet it would be easy to mod to look better	positive
one of the best in my humble opinion as far as i know it was never released in the uk so the only reason i managed to get my hands on it was on a family holiday to the us i think they’d only recently opened the lego store in disney arguable the best feature is that it seems to fit into a wide selection of themes is it a airstrip in the middle of nowhere is it next to a only mining town that’s not deserted the possibilities are rather open and that’s truly great	positive
legoman132 on aug 18 2008 0936 pm said this was a cool set i thoght of it as i was building the post plane interesting thought i have the post plane but i havent opened it yet i suppose its the yellow the plane in this set is much different than most of the other classic town airplanes in that it has the double tail section heres a shot of the new 7732 air mail set  definately a nice set	positive
i have had this on my bricklink wanted list for ages and yet noone with my criteria has it nice review and brilliant set	positive
set 7103 theme star wars set name jedi duel pieces 74 release 2002 price 10 usd minifigs 2 count dooku and yoda links 7103 brickshelf folder bricklink reference catalog peeroncom introcomment i remember getting this set solely because i collect star wars as i rebuild it and took pics of it i found that i actually like this set for different reasons dookus speeder is pretty cool and the lightsabre rocks the dooku minifig is also great whats not so great is the flythingy and getting another yoda though thats kinda hard not to get in a set focused on their duel you cant see the wires because they digitally removed them be careful or ill digidally remove your head  steven seagal i hope i quoted that one right  so to get the review on the move ill impress you all with a box picture neat huh one of the smaller boxes but still kinda big when consider that you only get 74 pieces and 2 minifigs the instruction isnt that big as i said the dooku minifigs is awesome i love the print on his torso that combines the brown cape with the torso and also the head is neatly designed not a fleshie though this was before the fleshlicensefacelift a sideview of the light blue speeder mmmm that crome light sabre hilt is nice the design of the speeder is also ok and without the usual offcolourscheme bricks no tan or yellow sticking out there yeah id panic too if this came right at mewho wouldnt when noones driving and a rear shot i think the design is a little off the shields makes it all a little too open in my opinion the printed bricks are a kick and thus evens the score here this hideous design is meant to flip yoda around the air put him in this funfair from hell thing and give him a twister he and dooku will never forget my guess is that its there to add some playability but its just odd and quite useless much like the playability soccer thingies in the ultimate light sabre duel the verdict ups and downs this set offers both i rate it as average since the size and price of the set make it acceptable to have odd things confused good so am i making a small set isnt that easy and remeber this set is from 2002 and a lot has happended since then designwise that is what do you think	positive
whats wrong with another yoda and some nice light blue bricks i probably would destroy this set and keep the minifigs intack tough chrome lightsabers on	neutral
you think its not a great thing that we get a yoda fig in an affordable set like this that was the main reason why i got this set and what do you mean by another wasnt this the only one that was ever released except for the one in the dagobahxwing set sure he is not the best fig with the unmovable legs and all but still its yoda besides he doesnt move his legs a lot in real life either nice review though and thanks for telling me what that liftarmthingy was meant to be for i never got that and thought it was supposed to lift up the speeder for some reason i got two of this set and the printing on those blue parts were off in the second one i got edited by oky wan kenobi 18 august 2008  0845 pm	positive
no yoda was released in no less than 34 sets ok so i remembered wrong i just have plenty yodas and one is more than enough for the set list click here thanks for pointing that out	neutral
thanks for the nice review kimt  i like this set especially by the fact that it is the only set containing the dooku minifig and the curved lightsaber  i also think that the minifig is cool but i also own the dagobah xwing and the wookiee catamaran sets so i have enought minifigs a clone wars version would be very cool  and the extrathingy is well just ok the bad part is that i dont buy the set when it is out and now is go for 40 on ebay and bricklink  edited by darkrebellion 18 august 2008  0951 pm	neutral
oky wan kenobi on aug 18 2008 0241 pm said wasnt this the only yoda that was ever released except for the one in the dagobahxwing set sure he is not the best fig with the unmovable legs and all but still its yoda edit im pretty sure we got a yoda in the wookiee catamaran set from revenge of the sith runs to check brickset yep theres a yoda in that set as well but the jedi duel is the only reasonably priced set with the green forceguru nevermind looks like a couple of other members already covered yodas availability in other sets back on topic great review and a real blast from the past i never did get this set just didnt care for the speederbike or the weird piece of equipment thanks for explaining that its supposed to be used to forcejump  spin yoda all over the place i never knew thats what it was for anyway wish i had known yoda and dooku were going to be impossible to get later i mayve picked this set up just for the minifigs edited by bamaker 18 august 2008  1039 pm	neutral
i think this is a pretty lame set it came with dooku who i think only came in this set plus a unique lightsaber still they could have made it much bigger added anikan and obiwan and added structures and made it more like the scene from the movie also the speeder doesnt seem very accurate	negative
i missed out on this set but it looks pretty good imo thanks for clearing up what that thing was i thought it was something they flung at eachother in the movie i like the lightsaber also but why did they stop making chrome ones	neutral
i wonder how expensive this set would be on ebay shop victoriously	neutral
i got this set a long time ago the review pretty much says all there is to say about it never knew what the redbrown thing was anyway i used it as a canon isnt this also the only set up until now that had count dooku in it	neutral
cheers for the review kimt of the initial episode ii lego releases this set was the least inspiring but the minifigs were musthaves you cant go wrong with count dooku and yoda i like the design of dookus speeder in the movie but lego missed the mark a bit with it here and gave him a dodgy flying boat instead the speeder cradleyoda jumping mechanism was just a waste of parts unfortunately id like to see dookus speeder reimagined by lego theyve come a long way in the way they design a lot of the new star wars sets	neutral

very nice review one thing you have to consider when lego sees pics of the star wars universe they have to decide which would be the easiest set to make with the most playibility therefore they chose the hmp quote thanks for the review its always good to have a 2nd opinion on a set ive added the usual poll and ill index it tomorrow must sleep super pics and great to have inbuild pics defaultthumbupgif a fine set which ill surely buy when i find it defaulthmpfbadgif where edited by lt col thok 18 august 2008  1007 pm	positive

it took a long time but now here it is the review of the xtreme team set 6584 extreme team challenge thebrickster asked me a few weeks ago to do this since he unfortunately never owned this great set so here we go first i have to say that i really love this late 90s town theme and i wish there would have been produced more sets this is the only one i own well beside that i also still have 6572 wind runners but the car is missing anyway lets face the facts and let the pictures speak for themselves subtheme xtreme team set nr 6584 name extreme team challenge number of minifigs 4 number of pieces 354 release year 1998 lets start off with a few quick shots of the box  instructions inside of the box we got some ideas for alternative models on the backside the same ones are also on the backside of the instructions instructions heres an overall view of this huge set we get 4 minifigs each with different heads and color patterns which i really like and also a good amount of equipment for them lets move on with the cool vehicles there are 3  completely different ones in this set first is the neat little trike next the not less neat 4wheeled offroadthing dont know whats it called really  and finally the huge monster truck i love the chrome sidepipes and the wench with the hook in the back which adds a lot of playability oh i almost forgot our brave adventurers also have got a raft to ride the wild mountain waters now lets focus on the many details of the mountain base we got a bridge over troubled waters but be aware its very unstable love the wood patterns on the yellow 1x6 tiles on a corner a camera is mounted to document the wild life for the evenings we also got a little campfire down by the river sits a grey falcon and watches the guys on their challenges whats that seems not very safe to be honestbe aware when you pass by these rocks cause it will collapse lets move up again where the tent is placed inside is plenty of space to take a rest for the figs and to store their equipment but i think they should have built the tent on another place cause the ground isnt very good there when you pull the mechanism a trap door opens will the guys all come back home safe and not injured you decide all in all this is a really great set ome may say it is a bit juniorized because of the baseplate but it really isnt its got a lot of playability and some rare parts the biggest beeing the baseplate which is only available in this set i hope you liked my review let me know your opinions edited by metalandi 23 august 2008  1256 pm	positive
i remember getting this for christmas and despite the earthy grey parts i relly enjoyed it and it is nice to see pictures of it again thanks	positive

metalandi thanks for doing up this review this is a chance for me to gain some insight for extreme team theme this is a very interesting set that can be used for so many purposes 3 different vehicles wide range of accessories and nice minifigs what i love the most is the mountain bridge and tent it provided so much playability i am very impressed with it thanks for sharing	positive
cool set i like the tent and monster truck the most	positive
thank you for that very interesting review metalandi a cool set with a lot of features and some nifty vehicles very playable and well designed indeed perhaps a bit too colorful for my likings but pretty impressive in its conception for sure i wish we could see some more landscaping coming along with todays vehicle sets as well	positive

hello all eurobricks members and classic town lovers  editors note to mark the celebration of classic town this set which is released in 1994 and rereleased as a legend in 2002 pizza to go review is dedicated to classic towns opening cermony and members such as hinckley brickster imperialshadows sinner and many others whom have contributed to the final success of classic town thank you so much for inviting me to be part of this wonderful project and i wish all the best to the success of classic town i urge everyone of you to check out classic town and take alook at the cool stuff we have done  today i will be doing up a review on pizza to go set this outlet is one of the most favourite eatery for any lego citizens living in their town when they are driving on the road they are sure to look out pizzeria signage they offer the best pizza in town no one in town can resist the delicious aroma of pizza coming out from the red chimney let us find out why is this shop so popular among so many lego citizens and was one of the famous sets that is rereleased under the legend theme pizza to go is my favourite set of all time i believed there is no other pizza outlet lying around in any lego city apart pizzeria it seemed there are the sole outlet that is selling pizza for many years this set was rereleased in 2002 and it is part of the legend theme this is one of the few sets that are highly demanded to be brought back by many fans of lego around the world i owned the 6350 any members whom had owned both sets before is there any difference between these two because when i searched through peeron it shown 144 pieces instead of 194 pieces for the 1994 set name pizza to go theme lego system  town year 1994 rerelease 2002 pieces 194 minifigs 3 an image of a 6350 pizza to go let the delivery begins pizza to go is the regular pizza outlet that sells nothing but pizza they deliever pizza to every household in town with their trusty delivery van walkin are welcomed too there is a stand for customers to dine in their pizza quickly before making their way to their next destination in my opnon no town can ever survive without the pizza tradition devoted pizzeria staff every outlet comes with 3 dedicated staff making sure that operations will run smoothly on the left we will have the pizza boy whom is wearing the regular blue dungarees and its white cap i wonder who is that boy on the middle we will have the pizza girl she looks like any typical sweet girl in town that the boys will look at she is wearing a suntop strapless on her she reminded me of one person though i think her name is called alice taking a careful look i wonder if imperialshadows is the pizza boy back then without that black patch on its left eye on another note this minifigure was my favourite female minifigures are very uncommon back then i am glad i have this figure adding to my town population on the right we will have the hardworking chef preparing the pizzas in the oven he wears the regular white chef outfit but he wear a grey pants instead of the usual fullwhite outfit in most resturants such as breezeway cafe 6376 lets take a closer look at the pizza boys van this van is very very small looking and very fuel efficient it is able to cut lanes very fast due to its small size the pizza van is made up of 4studs wide design no doors by the side however in this vehicle i think the doors is not a must to be included in this design our pizza boy will need to leave vehicle pretty fast and ensuring that the pizza delivery is on time common mechanism this van has the regular rooftop that can be lifted up to place the pizza boy into the driver seat there is a sun roof on its top which enable him to let him have some sunlight from above the logo on the side of it is actually a transparent sticker which have the pizzeria itallian logo and a tasty looking pizza on both sides of its van i like that sticker very much mine looks quite worn out over time if its a printed piece it will be a terrific bonus nevertheless i can still accept the sticker our pizza van can deliever up to 2 pizza at a go at every trip 2 piping hot pizza will be stored at the back of the van the pizza is fitted in perfectly in each compartment furthermore the white window shutter is terrific in this design you dont see this kind of design anymore i think i have not seen much delivery vans on the street anymore too base of the van from the base you can see that it is using of the regular red car base that is common in most 4studs vehicle design in fact this car base served as a foundation for its vehicle design back of pizzeria alice and the chef will be showing you around at the back of the kitchen there is an oven on the left a water tap and a holder for the oar stick looks pretty empty right look below for a surprise my favourite feature this oven can be used to heat up 2 pizzas at a go now i understand why this set is named pizza to go i have been using their slogan unknowingly this feature is superb nice now we know that the pizza is prepared from the outlet instead of using delivery van to collect it from a factory alice what are you waiting for help the chef quickly pizzeria the signage sure looks big from far and catches their attention easily too with its pleasnt looking design as you have already noticed this is made up of sticker i dont mind for this set it contains sticker sometimes i do hope they can give us spare sticker for us to change after a long period of time distinct red chimney this is the front of the oven and that is where the smoke comes out using only bricks to construct this is simply wonderful i like the use of their white bricks to construct the wall layout and a combination of red parts especially on the top i like the look of this very much another picture on its side printed parts in this set you will get a total of 5 pizzas and i believed no other sets offer so many pizza you can placed up to 4 pizzas in the van and oven alice will be carrying the last pizza around the green and red round dish is a printed part most exclusive part in 635010036 the most unique and important printed parts that is only exclusive in this set its at the front of the pizza van it is none other but the pizzeria logo standing at the front of the delivery van forgotten to take a picture of this piece took it from peeron different views of pizza to go outlet another bright sunday day in pizza to go summary review playability 1010 a lot of playing by doing up the pizza process from preparing to delivery design 9510 outstanding design with great use of bricks i like the structure of it very much price 9510 an inexpensive set based on the 1994 pricing it comes with 3 minifigs shop a van and a exclusive printed piece overall 9710 i am not trying to be bias in fact this set is absoultely filled with minimum flaws look at my review again if you are not satisfied with it or tell me what you dont like i gave it a 5 based on my review score card what about yours hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine comments and critics are strongly welcomed pictures can be found in my brickshelfwhen

easily one of the best town sets ever and pretty expensive for its size too iswas it that rare i hope i still have all the pieces from mine unfortunately my stickers are in pretty bad shape took them off because i needed the bricks stupid stickers covering multiple parts  only downside to this set the design is simple yet so detailed and the pizza van looks great 55	positive

jopiek on aug 24 2008 1048 pm said a very good set indeed we have at least 3 of them but we like them all what do you mean by we you own three sets of the orignal 1994 series or the 2002 legend series	neutral

indexed allright hi everybody again today im gonna review the biggest set of the resq subtheme 6479 emergency response center with this one i think the reviews of all the resq sets are complete now and while im in a reviewing mode right now i thought id bring that up this set hast got many nice aspects and also some very rare pieces and comes with a wonderful amount of vehicles including a speedboat a tow truck a helicopter and a trike which can pull a little boat so sit down get your popcorn and beer were off to stormy weather at the coast subtheme resq set nr 6479 name emergency response center number of minifigs 5 number of pieces 420 release year 1998 unfortunately i dont have many of the boxes of my resq sets anymore so ill start right off with the instructions this time on the backside there is no alternate model as usual this time but only a different shot of the whole set next a general overview sorry about the slightly bad picture quality on some pics this time originally this set has 5 minfigs which all are really nice but the guy who drives the tow truck has been lost in the flood heres a picture of the missing fig lets move on to the vehicles we have something for the water the ground and the air in this set first the great tow truck i love the mechanism with the hooks in the back next on da speedboat at the rear its got a stretcher and a wench which adds a lot of playability if theres a a little accident near the coast the trike comes to appearance for more complicated stuff we have a little helicopter i broke the rotating piece at the top yesterday ouch   no space for a victim you say well not really but the helicopter also got a wench with a hook in the back now it comes to the station itself at the docks a neat life belt sign is mounted remember at this time there werent real ones as today a little more right an equipment holder is placed with various tools on the front and fire fighter equip at the back at the very front a little lighttower secures the shelter i havent quite found out what this thing is supposed to be maybe somebody knows another equipment holder this time with all the stuff you need for diving more equipment and even more we come to the hear piece of the station the control room with lots of buttons and scrrens last but not least a quick shot of all the accesoires and tools that you get which really is an amazing amount this set might have a few junioriced pieces as the big window in the front or the briedge on the roof but that doesnt matter because there is nearly one other set in which you get so much rare pieces and such an overwhelming amount of accesoires so i can recommend that for everybody who is a piecesfanatic not to forget the playability the great figs and the in my opinion very good color scheme once again thanks for taking the time reading and looking at my review i hope you liked it edited by thebrickster 31 december 2009  0919 pm	positive
i own this set and its one of my favourites simply because of the cool colour scheme which you mention plus all the vehicles and accessories the resq theme is one of my faves of all time actually i own nearly all of them missing a small set that was only available in the us or japan i think dr s	positive
do you mean this one httpwwwbricksetaspxset29621  i would also like to get that alone for the fact that its the only resq set with a female fig	neutral
i have this set and its pretty nice i love the resq theme in general i think that tow truck is easily the highlight of this set and is probably the best such vehicle ive seen in any city set the other vehicles are also great the base itself is lacking though as it basically consists of one room that doesnt even have side walls it does include a cool 3x6 computer sticker and a vast array of minifig tools and equipment though i have some plans to modify the building and make it larger but have never gotten around to doing it	positive
thanks for that very elaborate review nice to have several pics from different angels amazingly well done if this is your first ive added a poll and will index this review within this week along with all the other topics i am to index 	neutral

baby i will like to take a moment to said outstanding piece of review for your first attempt you have done well with the pictures and its flow i have to admit that i love this fighter tank very much the downside of it which is overpriced and two clone troopers do not really justify the purchase well if i have the spare cash i will defintely get one of this keep it up	positive
thanks for the really cool review baby  i think this is an awesome first attemp for your first review it flows well really good pics and many pics  in the set i think this is a good purchase i will buy it when it comes out in the us and i think it is cool looking and the fuctions look neat  edited by darkrebellion 26 august 2008  1112 pm	positive
mattzitron on aug 13 2005 1130 pm said the strange thing is for the first time i can remember the minifigs came decapitated and theres no neckwear i recall jake saying something about it being new lego policy to supply the minifig heads and torsos separately what with the expensestrimming and all its apparently one of the many little quirky things theyve discovered in the manufacturing and packaging process that people have done for years without thinking in this case putting the heads on the torsos but that turns out to be a surprisingly significant expense timewise i suppose think it was in one of his blog posts but not sure too tired ie lazy to go hunting for it now sorry 	neutral
thanks for the pics so far will you have highres pics of the other sets in the instructions	positive
mattzitron you have done well to display images of the dung stain hull its a darn shame that it cant be extended however i see no reason why lego couldnt produce a special middle hull piece that is compatible although the way theyve made the hull is a bit stupid the old system was a lot more flexible better still why cant lego design a hull that can be extended in length and width then they could be as made as long or wide as desired and that would be great	negative

right so heres my review finally the whole gallery of box parts minifigs and finished model is here over 2 pages so on with the show minifigs httpwwwbrickshelycgii1340864 in the set you get krakaroff i dunno how to spell it and victor krum the figs are exactly the same bar their heads these are two fantastic figures the expression on krakaroffs face is priceless judging by the design i think we might get a yellow krakaroff cropping up somewhere which would make me a happy bunny hed make a fantastic viking ideally id have liked more than 2 figures for my money three would have done it i think 2 is too few piece count httpwwwbrickshelycgii1344573 httpwwwbrickshelycgii1344571 httpwwwbrickshelycgii1344572 for a 40 set the piece count is quiet good i dont know the exact number but when building it i didnt feel short changed bar the exception of the hull now i dont hate the hull my problem is that is doesnt connect with bricks like the old pirate ships there are pros and cons to this on the plus side its more secure and your whole ship doesnt need to be taken up with support structure the negative side being you cant really make it bigger as theyve only released a megablocking 4 set with the right piece and its the wrong color i also like how its wide meaning you can fit loads of minifigs on the main deck overall though i liked the pieces of note are gold studs httpwwwbrickshelycgii1344510 5 in total you get one spare the return of the black falcon shields httpwwwbrickshelycgii1340835 and the new drumstrang shields the construction a simple fun build nothing too fiddly the finished model httpwwwbrickshelycgii1344474 big picture i really like this set theres no bones about it it seems lego with the latter half of 2005 have given people who loved their original pirate ships hope for the future with this and the fantastic viking longboat even with the two 4 pieces the hull and front of the ship i wasnt put off httpwwwbrickshelycgii1340841 httpwwwbrickshelycgii1344461 the front of the ship is a nice piece and can be used for stuff like castles httpwwwbrickshelycgii1344490 httpwwwbrickshelycgii1344491 httpwwwbrickshelycgii1344492 httpwwwbrickshelycgii1344494 and the hull isnt all bad what i really liked was the little cargo hold at the moment i have a treasure chest in there but there space for about eight of them i reckon playability wise it does make alot of sense and as you can see you can imprision minifigs below deck httpwwwbrickshelycgii1344484 httpwwwbrickshelycgii1344488 httpwwwbrickshelycgii1344506 httpwwwbrickshelycgii1344500 the quarters are great as well you can comfortably fit about six minifigs in the main gally three by the steering wheel and a couple up above the top cabin you could fit more but itd look strange my only gripe is the design of the top cabin when you want to open it up you have to remove the mast i know its simple enough but i think that it wouldnt have taken much for tlc to design it better but saying that its easily done and i like how the cabin can be lifted with ease from the steering deck httpwwwbrickshelycgii1344540 the final play feature is the plank you can while away the hours murdering hapless minifigs whove displeased the cabin a really nice addition for pirate fans the final verdictb playability 9510  lots to do for all the kids piece count 910 a great selection loses one for the hull figures 810  just needs one more construction 910  nice and simple value 8510  let down a bit by lack of minifigs and the cons of the hull boverall 8810 overall this is a set worth getting especially if you miss proper pirates it wouldnt take much to turn this into an amazing pirate ship moc hope you liked my review matt	positive

i received this set with a 25 gift card so it was a great buy it follow with a similar build to the 2007 trucks but has a few improvements of course the name of the set could have been a bit more creative and yes this was an academy review set name truck and forklift number 7733 pieces 343 theme city year released 2008 price 2500 usd 1999 gbp 2400 euro 1box now the box follows a design similar to most other city sets it has the set information and photo of the set on the front sorry for it getting cut off i will remake it now the back of the box shows what each bag builds bag 1 is for the forklift bag 2 is for the cab and bags 3 and 4 are for the containers it also has the sets features 2contents the instructions there are 2 books included with the set one for the forklift and one for the truck minifigure1 the first minifig you build is a simple cargo worker interestingnew parts here we have some interesting and new parts they include a yellow seat a 1x2 plate with clips and a 1x4 slope 3the build cargo1 the first cargo palette has a few crates on it i really like the sticker on the small box forklift the forklift is a very fun extra to build and it is probably the best forklift that we have had so far it is very realistic and is very strong cargo2 the next piece of cargo is some octan barrels on a meter i am not sure what it is supposed to be but it is still a nice addition to the set minifgure2 the second minifigure is a classic driver with sunglasses and a coffee mug very nice new piece this is a very nice new piece that is included in the set a hollow canopy i believe it is also in white with the police mobile command station truck now anyone who has had one of the lego city harbor sets from last year then you will probably find this build to be very similar mostly in the cab part of the truck the trucks build is very solid and very realistic i sense ths will bring the ratings up quite a bit mystery cargo for some time specualtion has been going around what exactly is this it seems like nuero poison i am very happy with those 2x2 cylinders in transyellow in fact you can join in and guess what it may be in this topic containers the first container is built to hold one palette it fits onto the truck it produces a very pleasing result and has a better look to it than the containers from last year had the second container has the ability to hold two palettes and has a design similar to the first then you build on the wheels the back ones have beautiful mudflaps finshed set  parts 1010 lots of useful pieces great colors and some very cool new pieces minifigs 810 i would have liked another but it was 25 so i guess its okay price per part 1010 almost 350 pieces for 25  playability 810 forklifts are always fun and there are lots of things to do with this set overall 3640 90 a this is truley an outstanding set and it will make a great addition to anyones collection mocers would aslo like this due to the fact that it has some really nice parts it has a great build and utilizes some awesome new techniques it also has details something you might look for in a set highly recommended hope everyone enjoyed the review if you have any pic requests questions etc please ask i look forward to hearing your comments and the judges comments as well 7733 peeroncom 7733 bricklink catalog 7733 shop at home	positive

nice review vbbn i stumbled upon your yellow seat as well didn´t you have one already or what made you think it´s new the big letdown on this set is the big canopy i would have preferred single bricks for that and for this truck there is no real need for a hollow canopy  it could as well have been made of solid bricks maybe we get another set with different use of the canopy this is one of the reasons i didn´t buy it so far and i´m especially not interested in another forklift i have plenty of those i agree it´s the best one we have seen so far though	positive

today i shall be reviewing 8290 mini forklift which i recieved when i went to tru to get a technic set so enjoy set name mini forklift number 8290 theme technic parts 89 price 1099 1box the box for this set is suprisingly small its about the size of a 399 set it shows the main forklift and the set information the back of the box features the dragster a very cool model and the suspension works perfectly 2contents we have two instruction booklets one for the forklift and one for the dragster the bags here are a few interesting pieces the long double pin in blue a bionicle connecter joint and a yellow l joint 3build we start off build nice and solid with your average technic build the following steps build up the detail of the bottom part next comes the cab its pretty simple yet effective after that comes the forks they work very well but if you have the palatte on them and you let go it might topple off hint put the edge of the palatte on the small lip on the pieces that connect to the forks this will hold it on better the finished product and palatte extra pieceskeep them as they are used to build the alternate model here is something that i found how to put a minifigure into the cab first remove the side doors then set the fig into the cab with his arm sticking slightly out the gap and finaly seal off the cab a nice way to put system into technic for your towns  parts 910loving them all price per part ratio 810somewhat pleaseing playability 910 works in any system town and has a great dragster alternate model overall 2630 86 b overall i would definatly recommend this set to anyone whether you are a system or technic fan this is perfect it has great parts and is pretty cheap the alternate model is also very good i hope you all enjoyed my review i have made the pictures the requested size on my camera i look forward to hearing your comments edited by vbbn 27 august 2008  0702 pm	positive
nice work vbbn im not really into technic myself but youve definately done a fine review on this set funny that it actually fits a minifig perhaps well see fans design forklifts with technic and having it minifig sized	positive

what that looks like a walker an imperial walker no€ theme space blacktron i set name alienator set number 6876 number of pieces 82 figures1 released 1988 list price £99 it seem no source online has the price peeroncom bricklinkcom as always lets have a look at the box first as i€™m luck to own a boxed version of this set walking across a planet with a grid pattern sky the back shows a great selection of alternative models after opening the box we find a single instruction booklet inside the instruction booklet now we come to the man in the black visor the mark i blacktron and black and industrial he look in my opinion i think he probably has the second best lego space torso before the focus group decided they needed to be brighter now turning to the walker itself it€™s a simple build which i don€™t think even i with my great skills for messing up could get wrong the final unit is built in three key parts the command pod which is attached to the body by two pins at the back the walker legs this is pure design genius simply built easy to replicate and no fancy parts the top section which open to reveal the blacktrons hightech tools time to put the entire set together i think you€™ll agree it looks great for such a simple build looking like you could take on the universe a side view of the finished product a frontal view of the alienator what the hell how did that take down an atat this is one of my all time favourite lego space sets actually i didn€™t have it predark age and only recently bought one what attracted me to it was an old boxed set but since then i€™ve discovered a set that i wished i€™d owned long ago the rating system figures 810 i love the dark industrial space look parts 710 yes it may be nearly all black with some yellow highlights but is have a good range and they fit to make several great models fun fun fun 810 it walks well and it€™s a great set it has a large number of possible mods design 1010 it€™s ingenious the walking mechanism is so simple and yet so good i can€™t fault it price 10 while i could tell you how much i paid i was luck on ebay so this remains a question mark grand total 3340 reduced top level due to lack of price knowledge conclusion a set which in my opinion showcases what lego was about in the 1980€™s the set has an excellent design ethic and looks great with very limited parts it retains great action and functionality twinned with the great main model you€™re shown that there are a number of other great models you can make with the same parts this set is what it€™s all about for me i€™m very glad i bought outside my normal theme when i saw this actually on the strength of this set i recently order 6894 blacktron invader and can€™t wait to get it and see if it lives up to the alienator	neutral
as ive told you before this is a great set and now it has a great review thanks for this	positive
a very original and perhaps even a little weird design indeed but nice and creative for sure thanks for that good review	positive
i loved all of these walker sets it was such a smart technique i made one myself with what i had ahhh good times thanks for the great review	positive
thanks for the review ill add it to the index the ywing is one of my favourite rebel fighters and this set justifies the coolest fighter	positive

ive built the ywing and the imperial landing craft 7659 more or less at the same time and for about the same prices i think the imperial landing craft ilc is much superior to the ywing the ywing doesn’t have much functionality besides an awkward dropping bomb device and a moving cannon the missiles firing system is … your fingers the ilc has an awesome missiles firing system i wish i could get it individually for mocs a clever bomb dropping mechanism 5 minifigures with weapons the wings fold up together and the “cargo” can be detached as a play set i’ve built the ilc first so i got quite disappointed with the ywing	neutral

i like the model it is one of the best rebel sets out there but i dont like it that there is no landing gear when you set this one on the floor your rebel base it looks like it crashed or something and looses its look of superiority actually quite fast it needs to be at least 2 studs high if not more from the ground tlc is in these days afraid of flimsy landing gear as they gave to us in the early sw time now they want something sturdy for playability but i think there should have been some details on the bottom especially a landing gear that unfolds i also dont like the mistake of tlc that they changed this year with the release of indy hopefully to give the pilot a usual smile face the old yellow version of gold leader even had a headgear i hope tlc realised this year that we want more detailed faces well the licenced sets we got proved that but who knows the upsides of this set are the amount of pieces and detail especially the engines were fun to build and perhaps the most interesting construction i have seen in years also it is big bulky and looks sleek at the same time just wonderful and next to the 4502 xwing it looks in the perfect size i gave this the highest rating even if the underside disappoints but whatever it is lego you can add some landing gear on your own thanks for the review your pics were really really good next time make more of them please	positive
stauder on aug 29 2008 1237 pm said dont aregue with him when it comes to ywings he offerd to swoosh one in the nude stauder indeed	positive
the ywing is a truly beautifull ship and lego has done a great job on this one lacking landing gear is a minus point though and nice review by the way	positive
yodalikespie on 03 september 2011  0721 pm said is it worth the money since the new ywing comes out next year please check the date prior to asking questions in old topics three years ago in this case its rude to expect people to answer questions like that especially since its such a generic question besides how is he supposed to answer the question without knowing a lot more about the new ywing	neutral

etav8r on 19 september 2011  0155 am said i think it is a fair to ask questions here with the expectation of a new ywing in the coming year i came here to look at the review even though it is a few years old no images to go with the review bummer id like to see a more friendly tolerance on dated threads being bumped again we know next to nothing about the new ywing it wouldnt be possible to say whether 7658 is worth the money relative to the new one until we know what the new one looks like what its minifigures look like how much it will cost etc also note that yodalikespie has been banned	negative
fallenangel309 on 19 september 2011  0201 am said again we know next to nothing about the new ywing it wouldnt be possible to say whether 7658 is worth the money relative to the new one until we know what the new one looks like what its minifigures look like how much it will cost etc also note that yodalikespie has been banned is that a threat is it fair to ban someone on the forum because they revived an old thread and made inquiries thought this was a forum to discuss lego and that is what he was prompting i dont really care why he was banned but this isnt the only time ive seen this type of behavior and discourse here on eb	negative
fallenangel309 on 19 september 2011  0343 am said not a threat at all  i was simply pointing out that yodalikespie made the mistake of inquiring about the new ywing before we had any information on it to my understanding its not so much the fact that he bumped the thread as the fact that he bumped it for no good reason im not certain where the moderators stand on this issue but i feel that yodalikespies question would have been better received had he posed it after a substantial amount of information had been gathered on 9495  as ive said there simply isnt much one can go off of at this point to determine its value relative to 7658 roger that sad that the original review pics arent available any longer would be nice once the new set is released for comparisons	neutral
maybe the thread should be locked or taken down since the pics consist of broken links kind of a pointless review without the pics and for the record there are other websites with preliminary images of some the new 2012 sets that are not on the eurobrick star wars 2012 rumors thread perhaps that banned fellow was hoping some of the lego insiders had some knowledge about it i guess well never know now edited by sharky 22 september 2011  0922 pm	negative
nice review and i especially enjoyed the ending i personally think it is quite a good set for the price considering it comes with a fully armed minifig along with enough stuff to suit up another i just wish amazon carried this set	positive
another fine review i love the last action picture thanks for sharing btw i am so looking forward to that 384 london bus review	positive

finaly we get a new mech for takeshi and yes its yellow it brings back some flashbacks of supernova good times anyways i recieved this set at christmas last year with 3 other ef sets set name assault tiger number 8113 pieces 163 theme exoforce year released 2008 price 1500 usd 1895 eur 1box the boxes this year are much different than those from previous years it has some gaps in it and has a cardboard backround inside of it the box itself shows assault tiger and the set information the back shows a combiner the cardboard backdrop a very nice jungle look to it it has lots of fog as well creating a pale effect 2contents the instructions the instructions are clear and straightforward also included is a lego blooper the remains of the sticker sheet the stickers arent too bad i didnt apply the saw sticker as i wanted it to be left plain the buzzsaw a very cool piece mocists will love this 3build the figures the figures included are takeshi who features a nice new torso also included is the mini robot his is a very neat little guy but sadly he doesnt really become a weapon more of a block of red and black bricks the torso now the torso design for assault tiger is very different from the past years it now uses a castlelike piece as the main structure also of note is that he has a mini throne no controls sadly and with the orange cockpit piece its impossible to see takeshi when looking at the at close on see the third pic the legs the legs are slightly similar to the mt201 ultra drill walkers but have been modified to fit the at they are quite large and suit their purpose the arms the arms follow a new design but the only problem is they have no elbow or hand articulation nice weapons though the finished product  parts 1010 lots of useful pieces great colors and some very cool new pieces minifigs 810 a robot would have been nice and a better weapon mode for the minirobot would have been good price per part 710 a stretch playability 810 the lack of elbow and wrist articulation isnt the greatest overall 3340 825 b assault tiger is a nice set but some of those small little things can truly take a toll on the final rating i think that i would only recommend this set to anyone who wants the yellow and hardcore exoforce fans sh link peeron link i hope you enjoyed the review and if you have any pic requests or questions please ask edited by sinner 01 september 2008  0152 am	positive
thanks for the review vbbn i have to say ef has never really caught my attention but this set seems alright to be honest when i saw the topic title i was expecting a tiger looking mech the mech itself is cool except for the huge leg pieces i think the minifigs are great in ef sets with the dark colored outfits like dark red or dark green	positive
thanks for that good review vbbn that´s really a fine and pretty solid looking mecha i think that the designers did a good job on this last wave of ef sets and the inclusion of these mini robots was also a pretty smart idea	positive
nice to see a well done review this set is one of the few exoforce sets i havent built myself yet but i will get it on sale guess soon im do not like the use of slizerstyle balljoints in exoforce even though they are modified to 2x2 bricks in this particular set i think the arms look weak and they lack elbow joint like the green 2008 mech set forgot name of this years green mech quite a shame i find it really hurts the functionality of that green set and could imagine the same with the tiger i guess with the new pyramide brick as cockpit the cockpit is still open from the sides and the back i modified my green 2008 mech which use the same cockpit design with a few green bricks and it is now completely closed from all sides i rate the tiger at average but i may change my mind when i get to build it myself front	positive
this was my first exo force set and i was quite skeptical towards the mecha theme so i got it because it seemed to have nice parts it turned out however that the mechas are quite nice  i really like the poseability of it and since then i got another ef set	positive
thanks for the review one of the best sets in the entire line	positive
the assult tiger is pretty cool	positive
since my last post ive had the chance to build the tiger and i was surprised in a good way a much better set than i actually thougth front	positive
i just bought 2 of them since they were 5 each from lego i really wish they did not cancel this series	positive
i think this is almost the best set in the exo force line i really like the orange cockpit peice	positive
what do you mean the troll’s should outnumber the crown knight how are you going to manage that well here’s the answer theme castle set name troll warrior set number 5618 number of pieces 19 figures1 released 2008 list price £250 gbp 350 usd 299 euro 5618 peeroncom 5618 bricklink catalog 5618 shop at home lets us begin with the box the troll warrior and his might cart set sets for children to pester for at christmas now for what’s inside the contents of the box it doesn’t look like much now for the troll himself i’m glad they selected this troll torso rather than the other one for the impulse set i think this one is the superior one also he comes well armed with a spear and sword but no shield sadly someone really needs to look at the rodent problem in the castle sets now the cart nice easy construction as with all impulse sets i’m still not convinced by the flicking missiles a line of those would do some damage what an oncoming army can expect to see all together now and it looks rather good so there we have it a cheap way of bolstering the troll army and outfitting them with some more weapons also for anyone planning a pied piper moc another set with a rat in it the rating system figures 810 preferred troll torso and helmet style  parts 710 two spears and a sword but sadly lacking that all important shield fun fun fun 410 somewhat more to do on it’s own that other impulse at least the troll can fight the rat design 710 well designed even the flicker missile doesn’t look bad price 810 at £250 more than the other castle impulse grand total 3450 lack of a shield and to small to stand alone for my rating system conclusion castle fans got a great army builder with the knight and they’ve been lucky enough to receive another one with this set i’m glad we’ve got a troll impulse as it allow for enlarging the armies of evil some the crown knight don’t totally outnumber all their opponents	positive
good review i got 2 of those wheels are very useful especially if you dont have any  as for shields  i dont imagine trolls use them too much i think that they fight berserk style  all out assault one complaint is the piece that the wheels are attached to  its a single piece with smaller than the standard pin connection so you cant change the width of the cart for your mocs using the wheels i dont know if a piece with such a connection only on one side exists though 	positive
kimt on aug 29 2008 0655 am said best impulse set so far agreed i love this little sets i cant wait for it to hit shops here the rodent problem is funny but i lov always getting more animals so that is a plus the cart is a nicely formidable machine that i will keep together so i can maximise their fire power the troll figure is one of my favourite ever too i love that torso and helmet and i want that sword in grey i only have it in bronze thanks for the review batbrick away	positive
thanks for the interview i nearly forgot this set is out yet maybe ill grab one off my local store tomorrow	neutral
wait a second a troll isnt that an orc i thought that this is a troll	neutral
im not really impressed by this set as much as other impulse sets the knight impulse set 5615 offers more in my opinion since it gives two helmets two weapons a shield and an armor piece along with the weapon rack im not a fan in the slightest of flickfire missles and projectiles like on the cart and the previously mentioned one piece axle limits the wheel usage in other mocs i wouldve liked to see an added chest armor piece at the very least and a shield wouldve made this great those things are so rare and it wouldve bumped the piece count up to 21 to match the knight set since both are showing the same price on shin us dollars at least it wouldve made sense	negative
thank you for the nice review the set is not that bad but a shield would be a nice addition i also dont like the flickfire missile a camp site with a fire and a chickenleg would also be nice about the rat isnt it just foodsupply for the troll the only problem would than be that the food is running away	negative
more firefighter there must be a pyromaniac in legoland somewhere theme city set name firefighter set number 5613 number of pieces 25 figures1 released 2008 list price £200 gbp 350 usd 299 euro 5613 peeroncom 5613 bricklink catalog 5613 shop at home starting as always with the box i didn’t know red cylinders were flammable interestingly an action shot and not other sets you might like to buy the contents of the box looks much like every other impulse set firefighter not sure there’s much else to say apart from i wish they’d included breathing equipment looking pretty pleased with himself if you ask me the equipment rack is fairly standard and easy to build it does however include a fire hydrant inbuild shot will i be able to finish this complex build unsurprisingly i did i nice selection of kit is provided all together i think the fire is a bit odd but it does add playability if you want to increase the number of your firefighter and their equipment this is a great way though there is something missing in my mind the rating system figures 510 fairly standard i already have a fair few parts 610 good selection of tools but lacks the breathing apparatus i’d expect in a set like this fun fun fun 510 there’s clearly something to do even if you just own this set design 510 not going to win any awards but it’s robust price 810 nothing to complain about you get a lot of accessories for the price grand total 2950 reasonable design and good accessories a good set to improve any fire department conclusion this isn’t a set i’d necessarily buy but while i was at bluewater today i decided i should try to review every impulse set myself so that why i bought it still i think it has some good playability and a good set of accessories if you need more firefighting kit i just can’t get passed the lack of breaking apparatus that would have made it a better set in my view	negative
quote if you want to increase the number of your firefighter and their equipment this is a great way though there is something missing in my mind whats missing	neutral
opps well that’ll teach me to do reviews without my glasses thanks for pointing that out stauder	neutral
i wasnt all that impressed with what you get in this set for the price but you have an interesting point that the robot can be considered a reference to the classic space bots makes me think i ought to try modding the robot later	negative
nice review and quite funny now ill never turn my back on a robot again poor set i find this set bad even for an impulse the robot is poorly designed and without any use the space minifig is ok id rather get another impulse set than this except the other life on mars mars mission impulse sets	negative
something i forgot to mention is that great review xenologer on aug 28 2008 0828 pm said makes me think i ought to try modding the robot later mod the robot why you should see the interior stauder	neutral
kimt on aug 28 2008 0952 pm said id rather get another impulse set than this except the other life on mars mars mission impulse sets actually i kinda like the crystal hawk impulse the default model isnt that great but you get a few nice wing plates to work with after rearranging it looks pretty good i guess this one though is good for some nice parts tho its pretty limited in what you can rebuild it into and it seems less value because the astronaut has no vehicle best impulse set has to be the troll warrior feels very complete and space orcs are always nice to have	positive
this here was a set that i new i had to get a beautiful minfig amazing minfigs what more could you want so was this set worth it i guess you will just have to read the review to find out set name the batcycle harley quinns hammer truck number 7886 pieces 267 theme batman year 2008 price 3500 usd 4496 euro 1box the new box art for batman is pretty stunning its clean and really sells the set for this set harley quinns truck is pictured attacking batman with the set information the back of the box shows a nice little comic the other sets as well as the set functions 2contents the instructions the instructions for the set are as always clear and straightforward they display the colors well and have what we expect in an instruction book 3build minifigs the stars of the set batman is back with a new torso much more metalic than before harley had all new printed torso legs a new head and that sweet new hat batcycle the bottom part is very sturdy thanks to a small bit of technic the red throws it off a bit but it isnt seen once the top part is put on it has a nice use of the smoke stacks and looks very nice in the end the top part is simple but suits the purpose well it has handle bars and a nice motor the blue is a little strange though hammer truck the hammer truck begins with a very sturdy base it has lots of detail and really looks cool rims added lego did a very nice job at giving it a checker board appearence the only problem here is that you stick a sticker over two bricks multiple times jewels inside of the crate are these shining jewels look how they illuminate the darkness in gotham more added then we add on a spoiler and the crate looking very nice now the detail is again outstanding and it has a good amount of smoothness to it the infamous hammer okay i havent said this yet but the square pieces need to stop first on those sw backta tanks now on the hammer it creates a sloppy look for the hammer still this is the ultimate wacking weapon added to the truck on the truck it works pretty well but the handle is to short and its near impossible to smash batman the finished truck the finished truck is really nice the big wheels give it the monster truck feel and the way that lego alternated the colors works well the cockpit is a little palin but thats not a major issue the i love joker sticker is one of the best stickers ive seen its simply a classic the finished set  parts 910 lots of good mocing pieces and red and black are always usefull minifigs 1010 awesome playability 910 the hammer is a little short priceperpart 810 its a liscensed theme so meh set 7886 is a very nice set and has some great details in it the minifigs are very cool as well however their are some flaws first the hammer is two short and is kind of square the batcycle has a few awkward colors in it which throws it off a bit this set is definatly worth the money batman fans will love it and also wacking fans will like it for that hammer and if you would like to buy this set here are a few useful links sh link peeron link please let me know your comments and pic requests and questions are welcome	positive

nice review i really want this set but i think the €35 here is too much more like €25 would suit and havent found it cheap enough on ebay yet incl shipping	negative
very good informative review i really want this set but i never got around to buying it i thought all of your photos are great and of good quality keep it up	positive
great job on this review i just that last picture ive got a small remark to add the first picture is not hosted on in your bs account i suggest you download it on your pc and move it to your bs account that way you can make sure it isnt going to disappear in the near future	positive
i discovered this review a month ago and since that point in time i could not get the image of the sparkling golden chest out of my mind i finally just purchased the chest for myself i suppose this is a testament to how well honed your picture taking skills are this set is definitely a nice one im not a lego indy collector but i was tempted to purchase this set several times the vehicles are very nicely detailed and have some cool building techniques such as the wheel guards	positive
very good review	positive
i keep looking at this set to buy since i have 3 10 cards now maybe i will go pick it up at the lego store next month so many things i want	neutral
great review i was debating on whether or not to snag this up before its gone and i think i will great review and thanks again	positive
another great review erdbeeries i have to give it a i have thought about this set long and hard and your review might just force me to pick it up the vehicles look nice and the nazis are great figs bravo	positive
this set is nice it looks like a dhl van	positive
legoman132 on aug 29 2008 0635 am said this set is nice it looks like a dhl van makes you wonder if there was some kind of promo or hookup in the pipeline that never happened i have this set and i really like it it works well with either the new city sets or with my older 1980s1990s sets i actually like the use of the old style car base and mourned the day that these became exitinct the first time round c1990 thanks for the review cheers rog	positive
its an ok set i just dont really like the look of the van much too rounded for my liking what happened to the box like cars	negative
thanks for that very nice review erdbeereis1 it´s great to see some other city sets beside the usual hospital police and firefighter mayhem and this is a really nice little one now give me some car doors and a kevin costnerlike mf and i´m a happy camper indeed tlc	positive
i do like the set also ive bought 2 of them one to build it up and one to keep it misb i dunno for how long  only poor things is that the wheels are too wide car is 5nops wide instead of 4 afterall a good design i wonder if theres a post office coming soon by the way great review	positive
rriggs on aug 31 2008 0255 am said i actually like the use of the old style car base and mourned the day that these became exitinct the first time round c1990 i dont hate the piece but i did object to the way this set fills in the middle recessed area with a 2 x 2 plate that is nearly impossible to get out again without doing some damage to it whats more if you fill in the recessed area youve eliminated the only rationale for using the car base in the first place	negative
what an outstanding review of a great set i esp like your intro i have this set but have not opened it yet it looks like a fun little beach set the new coast guard theme is very nice edit this set could almost pass for classic town except for the use of orange and the lack of opening doors on the car 5 stars	positive
great job i will want to get this set soon its a lovely set with some coast guard saving on the jet ski what i dont like about this set is the lack of doors everything about this is nice but i still have to give it a 4 as for the entire flow of review i agreed with brickster that your introduction is very good with the little amends i had added earlier it turns out to be very good keep it up	positive
i am not a fan of citytowntrainstuff but this is a very good review that almost makes me wish i had the time read money to purchase some of the coastguard sets	positive
a very good review of an especially charming and lovely set thanks the whole cg theme looks very nice to me with a good and detailed set design and this one´s no exception although it would be nice to see more car doors and some new mf faces though	positive
thanks for this review i was thinking of getting this set and having read your review went out today and got it what a great little set what i particularly like very sturdy build feels very solid as you build the pickup compared to the fire pickup  trailer i also have the orange pieces my first pieces in this colour the tyres which give the smoothest ride of any lego towncity vehicle ive ever built the raised suspension and side runners the coast guard dude again a first for me and his megacool flippers and aqualung the jetski controls  the handlebars actually move left to right which is a great detail little details that lego didnt have to do the grey handle by the ball joint moving handlebars the new tyres as you can probably guess i have voted outstanding for this set erdbeereis1 on aug 29 2008 0602 am said color separation is not a problem here and since it is a small set the piece call out is not a necessity you do get a piece call out with this set i did anyway its on the back of the small poster that is included in the set thanks again cheers rog edited by rriggs 02 september 2008  0253 pm	positive
thanls for the review i was looking at this set last time i went to the lego store but in the end decided not to get it now you’ve made me really doubt my decision one question though do you think the jet ski is as good as previous ones	positive
rriggs on sep 2 2008 0850 am said you do get a piece call out with this set i did anyway its on the back of the small poster that is included in the set i meant the piece call outs during the build that show which pieces you need for that step and cardinal brick im not quite sure what you mean but i cetainly think that this jetski is wonderful	positive
nice set nice review i already have one coastguard set that truck but i like the idea very much however the rigid inflatables could be much improved see the real ones at wwwrnlicouk or wwwknrmnl	positive

arrgh me hearties lets join the pirates as they try to steal the sacred treasure from the islanders hands it wont be easy king kahuka and his loyal warriors closely guard the treasure 24 hours a day will the pirates with their trusty pistols and cutlasses be able to defeat the islanders spears pet alligator and powerful leafy skirts we will find out 6262 king kahukas throne set info set name 6262 king kahukas throne theme piratesislanders released 1994 price  i dont know the original price i got it from bricklink with no box for 17 unfortunately i was not able to locate the euro or pounds price pieces 123 minifigs 5 off we go unfortunately i dont have the box because i didnt like the idea of spending over 50 for a set with under 200 pieces so sorry no box pics instructions i think the image on the front is very good it seems less setup somehow than the instructions these days it looks more like someone snuck up on them while they were going about their duties and snapped away rather than something that was planned the parts a nice selection here there is a pretty good amount of printed pieces in this set which is always nice for example the zebra print tile as well as the pirate flag nowadays would almost certainly be stickered the set also comes with a nice dark grey burp and a red boat for the pirates the minifigs the main buying point of this set for me were the minifigs this set comes with 5 of them which is quite good for a small set like this especially when compared to the sets of today the set comes with 1 alligator 2 pirates 2 islander warriors and king kahuka himself i really like the islanders torso and leg prints the leafy skirts are a nice touch and the makeup on the faces is superb some parts i liked these shields have a nice design on them and i always like the treasure chests a picture inside the manual this is a feature that i liked in the manual it shows an overhead view of the baseplate so its much easier to find where to put the piece i certainly could have used this feature in last years aquabase invasion set a closeup of the king the face print is nice i wonder who kahukas makeup artist is the finished set first the pirates boat the boat is really nice the sail is made out of a nice cloth and connects simply to the mast and now the main part of the set the throne this is a really nice model i think the colors and the design make it really feel like a different part of the lego world the rock sculpture looks fantastic as well the throne which is sort of a stretcher thing attaches here it connects on a 1x2 tile with a stud in the middle for easy removal here is the treasure that the pirates seek the treasure rests on tiles inside of the rock the zebra print tribal drum this is simple but nice one thing thats great about this which i mentioned earlier is that this and all of the other pieces with designs on them are printed thats right no stickers to be found here i have used these zebraprint tiles many times for mocs as they make a great exotic detail piece the lovely rock head i think this is wonderful it really adds a lot to the set it is well built with grey slopes curved pieces for the mouth and nose headlight bricks for the eyes and feathers and horns for detail the backside the complete set overall this looks great in my opinion with great landscaping and some fun parts well it looks like the pirates walked all over the islanders and stole their treasure in fact it looks like it was pretty brutal brickshelf folder now for the the ratings price 810 for 17 not a great price per piece value but when you add 5 figs in it makes it a decent price plus this set hasnt been in stores for 14 years so that adds some cost parts 910 the set has some really nice printed parts as well as a baseplate which in my opinion is great design 910 no flaws that i can think of right away the rock face is very well built playability 810 not really anything to play with although you can sail the ship and steal the treasure build 910 rock face uses nice techniques and the rest of the set is simple but looks good minifigs 1010 the minifigs are just fantastic great prints and just overall fun overall 5360 bricklink entry peeron brickset it looks like the pirates have picked up a new recruit from the island summary the older lego sets have a really different look to them than the new sets and i think its nice to have a mix of new and old this is definitely a great set with a nice build and great minifigs add to this the great printed pieces and that old pirate charm and you get a very nice set that i can certainly recommend thanks and happy building edited by erdbeereis 17 august 2009  0239 am	positive
as ive already said somewhere on this forum this is the largest islander set i own and therefore my favourite thankyou for your great review i picked mine up for only 5 pounds along with crocodile cage and king kahuka but i cant help you with the original price i would search the web but im too tired right now	positive
what a great review of an excellent set i love the islanders and that drum outstanding i think these islander sets never got the credit they dserved i really like this set and its a great addition to the pirate collection	positive
i feel the same way about the islanders sets brickster they are a nice change from the regular pirate versus soldiers that is the norm i think it would be interesting to see some new islanders sets released in the new pirate line to see how tlc would make them	neutral
great review well done for sure i love these reviews of old set and this one is especially unique i must agree with you the color scheme is magnificent makes me want to go to ebay and buy it now to bad for spongebob though he got in with a real bad crowd	positive
excellent review i want this set now	positive
thanks for the great review this set is pretty standard as islanders go but it is such a cool subtheme that i dont care a bit i totally agree with your comment about old and new sets i dont think i would enjoy lego as much if i didnt have a decent amount of kits from pre 1999	negative
another very nice review and im glad to see it has some nice pieces as well as characters too looks to me that no one on bl has it in australia for sale so i may pass on this beauty though i did pick up king kahuka recently he makes an appearance in my medium entry	neutral
an outstanding set because who doesnt love islanders outstanding review as well	positive
an outstanding set too bad that i couldnt get this set set when it came out 	positive
very solid set 5 minifigs and plenty of weapons to go around adding up to great playability what more could you want aspecially from a set this size only i would have liked another cutlass a musket instead of 1 of the pistols and for 1 of the pirates to have another head but those things are no big deal it is still a lot better than sets nowadays edited by fluyt 23 december 2008  0950 pm	positive
those indians look useful for indiana jones in the future as long as the have the new skin color i wish i could have picked one of those up when i could	neutral
well this is a not so old set and i bet most of you already have it so here is another review from me as usual let us start off with the box art box art i like the box art they put a nice background for the atap at the side we have the minifigs scale and at the back there is the function shown and advertisement for other set the content the content is consist of 6 packets of bricks and a instruction book yeap no sticker sheet instruction book the instruction books not only show us the steps but also show us all a clear pictures of the january release sets and some sets show with their function well this includes the atap functions as well besides there are bricks checklist as well and the how do you start off before assemble your sets and a little poster where the clones with their atap battling the droids heres a random page new pieces to me i never see both of this piece before so i assume it is a new pieces anyone have any idea is there any other sets that contains this piece the blasters we are given a 2 long blasters which is great which i it is more accurate as most of the clone troopers use a long blaster the minifigs the minifigs is 2 shock trooper but is different with 7655 clone troopers battle packss shock trooper the leg is different in colour we are given white hip while the one in the battle pack are given a black hip furthermore we get a new printed headgear which i think they have improve it check out the mouth printing the colour is brighter so here is the headgear the headgear limit itself from turning to the side this is because the front part it is too low until it block by the torso the shock troopers without helmet on we are given a black stud no face printed how i wish that i have extra with helmet on comparison with shock troopers from battle pack the atap heres the atap it looks ugly at a certain angle and looks great in a certain angle anyway i still like the set i like the walker vehicle below are the pictures taken randomly top view side view without stabilizer leg with stabilizer leg rear view the functions well the functions are not so impressive just something turning around open here and there the only function that is say as special is the retractable stabilizer leg the cockpit the cockpit can fit two clone troopers but too bad we are only given two and is not enough as there is no gunner on top inside it there is a guns holders which can hold two guns but fall off easily when you are trying to remove the guns well the other side have some speedometre thing and a controller to reveal the cockpit you have to open the top hatch look below so you can see whats inside oops the side hatch and back hatch as well open and close i think this pieces is use not to let you open the hatch but to make some design i mean make it able to move inside with clones beneath so this is the pieces that hold the stabilizer leg when is not in use this is how the stabilizer leg move at last and of course the revealing cockpit from below and at the back guess the droids have alternative way to take this things down faster the leg there are pieces blocking the leg to go to the front i mean overhead and lose balance the base in not movable the side armor the side armor has door and this is how it is attach it is very flimsy when you want to adjust it to be a little steep to creat the shape they might just fall off so it is connected to the body with just a technic pin and to hold it properly here is the support the side hatch it open and close easily very loose nothing to hold it tight heres some view when the side hatch is open the cannon the cannon on top is movable and adjustable the big cannon can move up and down while the smaller one can cove sideways but the smaller one tend to lose balance when it is without minifigs means the one on top and below will not b align this is the pieces that only enable it to move up and down to prevent it from moving freely lego put two pieces to block it completion i try to make the sets looks great i think this angle is right spare parts it is so few compare with 7673 magna guard starfighter and it is more expensive overall this set is not really a good set the hatch is quite flimsy top and the side since there is nothing to hold them tight besides it is lack of one clone but to complete your walker collection you must have it pros no sticker needed new improved headgear long balsters cons lack of clone flimsy expensive as few pieces are given hope you guys like it edited by kimt 30 august 2008  1201 pm	neutral
i do not like the fact that the clones have pure white legs it looks weird to me it was also weird that they included shock troopers but it was probably a way to get people to buy it this set also seems like one of those that was kind of thrown in with a mix of other sets like the tie crawler i never picked it up and with the new clone wars sets out i wont	negative
i agree the pure white legs are odd as is the inclusion of shocks instead of pilots or regulars or maybe even kashykk troopers that might have been better	negative
i switched my shock trooper legs as soon as i got this set as for the new pieces im pretty sure that they were also featured in the striking venom set nice in depth review i switched my shock trooper legs as soon as i got this set as for the new pieces im pretty sure that they were also featured in the striking venom set nice in depth review	neutral
stauder on aug 29 2008 0245 pm said has anyone noticed the boxart includes the 3rd leg both in the lowerd position as well as the raised one stauder its not the 3rd leg its the other main leg zoom in and take a closer look	neutral
technic rotation joint disc set list its used in 10 different sets so far not exactly a new piece a nice review with many good comments i really like this set its one of the walkers with really good design and a lot of playability its the usual issue of using too many technic pieces to make a moveable feature versus minifigscaled design the same issue concerns for example the atat the twilight and the atte plus more sets what annoys me in this set is the use of the 2 tan 4x8 plates they stick out and it would have been better if they the designers had used dark grey or light grey plates also ill add this to the inventory  now	positive
i like this set but i dont like the pure white legs for the shock troopers it looked better with the black leg joint piece i also think the set looks like half an atte	negative

alakazam the good wizard is the wisest minifig in all of legoland he is a master of the wand and can see the future with these abilities he helps the knights predict where the trolls will strike next because this set is not in stores in the us i was luckily able to buy this set on my vacation to germany it is interesting that it is a euro exclusive 5614 the good wizard set info set name 5614 the good wizard theme castle released 2008 price eur 295gbp 199 pieces 16 minifigs 1 the review unfortunately i dont have the box because in got smushed in my suitcase on the plane so needless to say it was not in top condition the manual the manual is an extremely small foldout but the image on the front is nice on the back of the manual there is a picture of some of the 2008 impulse sets this is a nice feature the parts for an impulse set this has a pretty good selection a very nice owl and an interesting clear ball piece all built this set took me forever to build i had to take numerous breaks as it was the toughest longest build i have ever faced for an impulse set this actually looks pretty good the owl perch is nice also the crystal ball table the wizard is a very nice fig with great printing on the legs and hat and i love his beard brickshelf gallery the ratings price 810 not bad but i feel that impulse sets are slightly overpriced parts 710 impulse sets are focused around the minifig but the parts in this set are pretty good design 710 the crystal ball is a good idea and the owl perch is simple but nice playability 610 there is not much to play with here build 810 as i said before it took forever really it took all of 1 minute minifig 1010 the wizard is fantastic overall 4660 bricklink lego sh brickset abracadabra blades of four you are now a dinosaur summary for an impulse set this is very nice the wizard is an excellent fig and getting an animal in a cheap set is always great i would definitely recommend this set thanks and happy building	neutral
good review for a simple set while it does come with the basics for an impulse set i just feel that it lacks something though i am not sure what perhaps a printed magic scroll i am still not a fan of the printed cap especially the stars but i do like the printed pants displaying his various goodies hanging from his belt the plain torso is to be expected from a wizard minifig i suppose overall its not a bad set but it certainly feels to be lacking something imo	neutral

the next in my attempt to review every impulse set single handed theme space mission mars set name alien jet set number 5617 number of pieces 21 figures1 released 2008 list price £199 gbp 350 usd 299 euro 5617 peeroncom 5617 bricklink catalog 5617 shop at home as always we begin outside of the box it looks rather exciting at first glance set that cost a lot more than this one now for what€™s inside the contents of the box the impulse sets never look that inspiring now for the alien i have to say i€™m not impressed i€™m not a big space fan and i only bought this due to my impulse review challenge but as the main point of the impulse sets is the alien is a little hard to build a good set round something with one point or articulation it lacks what make lego minfigs so great their articulation now for the space vehicle as always with impulse a short and easy build ensues took maybe 2 mins at the most time to mount the alien in his craft the craft looks a little wide for him slightly better from this angle but still not winning any awards i€™m disappointed of the impulse sets i€™ve reviewed so far this is clearly the weakest of them but what really disappointing is the other seem so good and useful the rating system figures 310 the alien is not a good minfig parts 610 some interesting parts but nothing that special fun fun fun 210 i can€™t think of anything to do with this set to be honest design 410 poorly designed the box makes it look much better price 610 despite the impulse price tag i€™m still unhappy about the price grand total 2150 less than half marks the lowest i€™ve given so far conclusion in many ways i€™m annoyed from the outside of the box this set looks quite interesting and certainly appears to be well designed the idea of a small alien fighterflying craft is in my opinion a good one but sadly when you€™ve got the finished product in your hand it looks nothing like the box art while i think mission mars had some interesting sets and i might still get some of them this one will not be a repeat purchase for me	negative
well set out review with alot of great content gotta ask you though how does the set look nothing like the box art with so few pieces id have thought one could mentally put it together given the box front	neutral
i’m not a great communicator but what i was trying to say was that on the box the sets looks quite exciting and well made and that the alien fits much more snugly than it does so i was a bit disappointed that it seemed wider and less compact and certainly less exciting when i opened it	negative
well now we at least know that we can avoid that set  johan	negative
worst set of the year worst set of all time the pictures say it all no ratings necessary a waste of paper for box and instructions and waste of plastic for bag and jelly alien the little alien ship that comes with the switch fighter beats this one hands down as well as any other lego spaceship i have ever seen and i have seen many thankfully this set isnt available in my country which is something i never thought i would say anyway i hope tlg makes these awful jelly aliens disappear forever after this year	negative

i rated this poor due to the fact the set is unimaginative looks like a bunch of plates where thrown together and it just isnt worth the money lego is asking for it imo ive never been a fan of the nonarticulated jellies so ill leave my disgust for them out of this post however unlike the set the review is a fine work of art that clearly depicts the goods and provides valuable insightopinions about the sets playability usefulness and overall value	positive

7670 hailfire tank and spider droid number of pieces 249 number of minifigs 4 price 1999 usd 2599 eur 1999 gbp brickset hello everyone today i will review the extremely underrated hailfire tank and spider droid set i hope this review does it justice so lets start with the box note this picture is not mine standard box for star wars in that time the background on the box looks like its from geonosis indicating that this set is from episode ii and not iii or the clone wars the back of the box not shown shows the playability functions and some other sets that were released at the same time as this overview here is an overview of the whole set it comes with one construction manual and no sticker sheets   this is a very simple set but with not much to it it is still a very important part of the cis army especially if you are interested in army building i like to call this set a super battle pack and youll find out why soon lets get right to it and look at the feature of the set the hailfire tank front a front view of the very cool tank here you can see two triangular shields on the hull the main body is very simple but altogether very effective and clever and making it really look like a hailfire tank although a little bit sized down from its movie version the transred stud used as the eye makes the tank look more menacing side the side view the wheels are very easy to make but its a real pain to connect all of those chain links together i dont see what you could use the links for except for another tank but maybe someone creative will find something for these the dark tan is nice though the wheels are held on by technic poles and the tank rolls on the wheels fairly well on carpet or a hard surface back this is the back of the tank here you can see eight flickfire missiles four on each side of the new type so they dont easily fall out also note the modified 2x2 with extended hole piece sticking out of the back this may be used to easily push around the tank i just wish you could fit a droid in the body for the cockpit now we move on to the spider droid or what i like to call the dwarf spider the front this one is also simple but very cleverly built the main body is two semispheres connected together for rotation and an antenna a cannon four legs and eyes made out of a useful telephone piece the picture speaks for itself as far as how the gun and eyes are built side a side view you can now see the legs better which are more sturdy then you would think each one is made out of two pearl bronze exoforce robot arms a useful bley handgun piece and a dark bley battle droid body all connected to the under body a big knoblike piece back the back not much to say here i like this spider droid because it is very sturdy and the legs are easy to adjust finally we look at the minifigs there are four minifigs in this set which is quite generous for a set of this size it comes with a yellow battle droid commander i really like this one two battle droids and a super battle droid all three battle droids have the new blaster pistols and one twisted arm thats about it for the review so here is the final verdict build 810 very fun and easy besides the chain links should take the seasoned builder less than 20 minutes playability 710 the flickfire missiles are fun as well as just zooming around the tank could use some clones for a battle swooshability 810 you can roll around the hailfire fairly well minifigs 910 a generous amount of figs and all are pretty good design 9510 a really simple and clever set although a little too small for the movie version price 1010 a very fair price considering the priceperparts ratio and the coolness of the set overall score 8510 a very neat set to have a great army builder and great for display next to all of the other cis sets the price is fair the figs are good and the build is very clever thats all for now folks please feel free to give some feedback edited by jimbutcher 15 september 2008  0308 am	positive
thanks for sharing this review with us i think this one of the sets in europe this thing is waaaay overpriced and thus makes it a crappy set we pay nearly double the us price so i rated it poor also because the figs included does not make it great the hailfire is well designed and looks great but thats just about all there is worthy of a positive mentioning sorry on a side note as a bronzeawarded student wheres the price in eur and gbp and wheres the poll nevermind the poll ive added that one for you 	negative

thanks for the review jimbutcher i really like that set it combines interesting and good design with some awesome cool parts and a neat amount of charm	positive
this is a great set i have 2 of them now and i plan to get more it is much better than the droid battle pack for 10 bucks more you get better battle droid arms and some canon vehicles good enough for me	positive
thanks for the review is a great one this set is not really a good set but i like the spider droid the hailfire droid scale is not right i think it is suppose to be even bigger anyway this is the first set that rerelease the commander droid so i grab it	negative
thanks for the cool review jimbutcher  actually i really like this set it is small but very clever and even if the hailfire droid is undersized what in the whole line is not under or oversized  the new spider droid is the best small build i have ever done in a set and the droid commander is pretty cool  i am happy with the set and i will get another with my comiccon exclusive 	positive
7681 homing spider droid limited edition number of pieces 206 number of minifigs 5 price 3499 usd 2999 eur 1999 gbp theme star wars episode ii year released 2008 brickset folder bricklink catalog welcome to my sixth review on these boards of the mighty homing spider droid at first glance this ball on legs may not seem like much but hopefully this review will change your mind the box this box is the standard for all of the new clone wars sets sleek shiny and a rightoutofthefactory look the blueandwhite color scheme is fantastic and portrays that the sets are based off of a cartoon well this box has a limited edition in spanish too  seal slapped on the front although you wont have trouble finding this in your local toys r us because of the big clone wars display in the front of the store that you cant miss overview in this picture you can see the contents of the whole set minus the instruction booklet built you can spot five minifigures which ill get to later and a very tall cis weapon known as the homing spider droid this weapon of destruction is a musthave for your cis army although the color scheme mostly dark bley and light bley is a change up from the regular colors brown or blue of the cis this may have something to do with the blended armies of the trade federation and corporate alliance but i dont know for sure the instruction manual is very thin only about twenty pages homing spider droid this is the main part of the set four huge legs two mounted guns and a red sensor eye are the highlights of this artillery unit theres not many playability factors to this one but sometimes its just fun to squash the little clones a changeup of the contrary it also looks good next to all of the other cis sets but you might want to clear some room in your display area the legs take up a lot of room this thing is also massively tall about the same height as the republic cruiser main body this is the main body of the spider which has no cockpit and is remote controlled this spherical body not in that sort of way is a very quick build and features a big red eye connected by a red stud and hinge top gun here is the top gun not with tom cruise which is connected to the body using a clever technic system pun not intended as you can see from this picture you can see that it can rotate a full 360 degrees but only if you remove the eye also the gun can be pulled back and if you let go it will snap back like the a gun does when fired due to the force of the shot im not sure this was intended by tlg because it wasnt showed anywhere on the box or in the manual lower gun here is the gun attached to the under body of the main part it is attached using a hinge which allows it to move up and down i also like the cord that presumably transfers power included on both guns hips here is one of the hips attaching the legs to the body there is one on each side with two legs each the are attached to the body and legs with technic pieces legs you can see the tall legs in this pic they are basically just technic poles and connectors feet this is one of the feet the essential to balancing the whole vehicle these and the legs are repetitive so i suggest doing them all at the same time to avoid flipping back in the manual and repeating the process three more times the picture speaks for itself for the design of the feet all are connected to the legs using a doubleholed technic piece one massive son of a gun this thing is so tall it frightens the skin off of even the toughest most experienced soldiers run for your lives look at how much havoc and fear it causes family photo enough of the battle scenes here is a shot of this spider with its smaller cousin the dwarf spider droid minifigs finally here are the minifigs that come with this set there are five in all which include battle droid nothing special but still an addition to your army commander battle droid i love that yellow torso super battle droid again nothing special clone trooper im glad they gave us one in this set i can add it to to my other phase 1 clones commander fox i love it everything from the dark red markings to the accessories are fantastic the head is just the regular anime style clone wars face this set comes with two flashlights two antennae one visor one pauldron and one kama closeup of fox here is a closeup of fox so you can see the detailed insignia of the republic guard that wraps it up for the review here is the final verdict build 810 very easy and straightforward a little repetitive with the legs should take the seosoned builder around 20 minutes playability 610 not many play factors but its fun to just squash puny clones with this giant arachnid swooshability na minifigs 1010 you really cant ask for more in this sort of set design 810 not very sturdy but it is altogether clever price 510 yes it is limited edition but pumping up the price fifteen dollars more than it should be is a little ridiculous overall score 8510 an excellent set for display although not very sturdy minifigs are superb but the price could be better in the end i would highly recommend this to any prequel trilogy fan looking to build up his her army well thats about it for this review please feel free to leave your opinions edited by jimbutcher 15 september 2008  0309 am	positive
i just bought this set the other day and i must admit that it gets a below average from me the price is not corresponding with what you get which would be implied had jim added the eur or gbp price in the infohint hint  the spider droid is flimsy at best making it stand or even move without tumbling over is hard also why the brown cylinders on the legs keep the colourscheme clean please the figs are fine except that i dislike the clone headgear and the fact that the helmets now have holes in the sides allowing the flesh head to show within  goofy looking i am soo replacing the clone heads with black ones great review of an acceptable set	negative

thank you for that good review jimbutcher i think that this is really a pretty interesting and original looking set maybe it´s not very stable but it owns some special war of the worlds charm for sure	positive

thanks for the great review jimbutcher this looks like a pretty decent set i might get this if i find it on discount	positive
i love the look of this set its the closest to getting a walking eye from the venture bros as well as the droids and troopers 	positive
thanks for the review i really do like the first year of ef nowadays they mecha are perhaps more cleverly designed and use ball joints for playability but i really love the blocky bulky look of the first drones machines and somehow the older ones seem a better value of parts im more inclined to buy duplicates of them than the newer models	neutral
thanks for the review this is one of the few first wave sets that i didnt get im not really sure why as it wasnt too expensive	neutral
this is polar1 over its day 5 at arctic research base 76 we are experiencing radio difficulties since discovering a number of strange radioactive arctic life forms which seem to be effecting our signal over we have encountered a large polar bear which by all account appears to be friendly and playful our food supply however has diminished quickly and we have to venture north from the base to a frozen lake in search of fish our cordinates are currently 46Â°45â²4â³n 741Â°21â²7â³w we do plan to take the snowmobile to the lake after we get our provisions in order this is polar1 out polar explorer bonus pack set  6569 theme arctic year released 2000 piece count 76 minifigs 2 list price 10 usd in 2000 lego introduced a new theme called arctic it was something completely new and different for lego as no minifig scale sets andor adventurers had ever ventured to the arctic the set offered new orange pieces and combined elements of blue and white pieces to provide a number of sleds vehicles a mobile outpost 6520 and even a large polar base 6575 the theme was unfortunately short lived and did not see 2001 this particular set is a value pack that combines sets 6578 polar explorer and 6586 polar scout at a reasonable price of 10 usd i may have even paid a few dollars less at a discount toy store back in the early 2000s a picture of the bonus pack with the two sets combined within the box the backside features an advertisement for the lego club and pictures of other arctic sets starting with the smaller set the polar explorer just a tip of the iceberg  instructions front of box back of box both sets include the same minifig an arctic fig with glasses and a thick arctic coat heres a shot of the fig with his hood on i always thought the hood is a nice piece that would work well for hoth rebel snow scenes the set includes a few nice accessories the set actually creates a small icesnow formation that can even be placed on water to represent an iceberg heres a closeup with the blue ice spider the complete set next the polar scout front of box back of box the polar scout instructions picture the same image as the box but i really like the real arctic imagery on the backside the set includes a small sheet of decals included are some great arctic accessories and some interesting arctic creatures like this neon orange scorpion in a ball of ice i love the polar bear a great addition to snow scenes but the best part of this set is the orange and black sled the back sled attachment uhaul has some tools and a removable storage cover the top comes off easy to store tools and equipment heres the arctic fig with a great metal detector or other snow research device and the sled itself lastly a picture of the complete polar scout final thoughts im a little disappointed that arctic was a shortlived theme at the time i wasnt too interested in the arctic but i still regret not buying the large polar research base after seeing it at a discounted price i was able to pick up this set and the mobile outpost that i never opened id be interesting in reading your thoughts in regard to this set and the arctic theme	neutral
i like the theme very much but sadly i dont own any sets of it it brings such a great feeling its fresh and has great parts and sets and it brought the polar bear your review is very good and informative thanks i voted wrong i meant above average but i clicked below average 	positive
thank you for that fine review thebrickster i really like how this two small sets create an intense and adventurous atmosphere against the backdrop of a pretty exotic region the sets´re well designed and very nice with a fine amount of rather unique and well fitting gear the whole theme offers a lot of playability in a setup that´s a little different to tlc´s standard sceneries for sure and it always reminded me of who goes there too	positive
hi great review on one of my favourite themes i never realized how cool it was until just now when you did your review anyways i remember my one set of the arctict expedition the arctic expedition pack	positive
a nice set review as for the theme itself i though it was a very interesting theme sadly i don’t think lego put enough effort into it i was personally upset not to se a second year even if i didn’t buy any of the sets it reminds me of the artic theme playmobil did at one point in the distant past to be honest i think a number of good artic scenes were missed when it came out a really wanted to get a ski plane but it never came i built it myself in the end but i don’t know how lego missed that one on a slightly random note i do know that at least one lego minifig did make it all the way to the real artic with a research team sadly i don’t have any pictures to offer you	negative
a very nice review i really miss the arctic theme i didnt own any of the sets but after looking at the pictures in this review and reading the instructions on brickleys words and brickfactory i want them	positive
i find it amusing that the numbers on the decal for the flag were chosen so that it wouldnt look stupid if you put it on upsidedown by accident	neutral
nice review brickster the arctic theme is very nice the minifigs have a great look to them especially with the hoods the colors for the arctic sets i have always liked and somehow the idea of minifigs exploring the arctic is fun to me	positive
great review i hope tlc does another i rember reading a book once based on the theme which stated the scorpions and thespiders and such were aliens 	positive
great review whitefang and co a thoroughly enjoyable one im glad we have a series of reviews that you can expect to be packed with humour and craziness looking forward to the next peace	positive
imperialshadows on sep 1 2008 0657 pm said its amazing its stupendous its almost like whitefang is a reviewer with previous experience its almost like i wrote all of shadows lines its almost like staudie is being as annoying as ever oh wait thats all true great review of a neat little set i used mine as the air conditioning unit on the roof of my chinese restaurant then some dork told me it didnt look believable or something i liked it um so great review thanks for presenting it i give you a that amazing x factor is supposed to be the magical touch of eb news team glad to see it falling in place oh i want to take a look on how you have make use of a jet turbine engine turning it into an air conditioner unit imperialshadows on sep 1 2008 0657 pm said and lets just take a moment to get sentimental a year ago today staudie had a lame idea interview the members of eb he flailed around with it for a few interviews including the infamous one where hinck attention whored sinner into a corner and sinner were featured reprising their roles from the whacker and the walrus it was quite memorable but then a short time later someone new joined the team bringing it to a new level of polish and bad jokes still this tribute isnt dedicated to that genius of the written word nay its dedicated to the whole staff including the new guy who is still a secret so dont bother asking im not telling ha i salute you eb news its been a damn fine year that is some fine history from the eb news i wonder how staudie can keep up with his sanity asking questions around i am so happy to be part of the team happy eb news 1 year anniversary imperialshadows on sep 1 2008 0657 pm said i hope i can survive another minus away the earlier mishaps i am sure you are able to survive another year iamded on sep 1 2008 0713 pm said great review whitefang and co a thoroughly enjoyable one im glad we have a series of reviews that you can expect to be packed with humour and craziness looking forward to the next be sure to watch out for the next one well i have not planned for the next one though adam on sep 2 2008 0608 am said it can never be a happy ending for stuadie so why did you give him one nice review give staudie a break he deserved to have some good treatment at times you had spelt staudies name wrongly geez i am sure he will be driving the quad bike ramming towards you	neutral

thank you very much for this review skipper 24 i voted for outstanding since this set is a little but very lovely set i really it although i dont own it yet  since its very similar to todays impulse sets a minifig and some nice additional stuff and i like the black cat which gives the set a more gloomy atmosphere hopefully tlg will include a black cat and a chimney like in this set in the new advent calendar too klausdieter	positive
i chose above average it has a great minifigure i wish i had itsomeday i will	positive
this is a very good review no doubt about it about this set this is a cheap way to buy this set with a witch and some nifty accessories such as the black cat in fact i think this is the first time i had ever seen a black cat its simple but not very useful in my collection because other fright knight sets also offer the witches too i dont need many witches overall i feel that this is an average set	neutral

6205 vwing fighter number of pieces 118 number of minifigs 1 price 999 usd 1399 eur 899 gbp theme star wars episode iii year released 2006 brickset folder bricklink catalog welcome to this review of the vwing fighter this will be my eighth review on the boards strangely enough there was another set called the vwing fighter that came out in 1997 for the space theme note that i am missing several small pieces to this set but they are mostly insignificant to the overall look the box this is the standard box type for all 20052006 star wars sets i cant say that i like it as much as the 2007 or 2008 box types but itll do it features a profile view of darth vader and silver text overview this is the whole set this ship is meant to protect the chancellor at all costs they are usually found in groups of three or four front this ship is very sleek and youll notice that its colors are dark red light bley and dark bley with a touch of black it starts at the nose very narrow but as the body progresses to the back it gets wider like a v hence the name back here is a view of the rear note the transneon green discs used to represent the boosters also notice the dark red r4 astro droid and the hinges used as aromor flight all four wings two on each side can open up for flight attack mode they can open even farther then the pic shows but its not an intended function the wings a great but its a real pain to position them correctly and the bottom wings close when you set the ship down tail fins this is what the tail fins look like on each side with two flaps attached to the top and bottom if you look closely the tail fins and wings look a little bit like a mini ship themselves maybe controlled by remote no this is not an intended function either guns side the guns are very simple but very clever using a double technic hole piece two black bars and two technic pins also note the landing gear minifig finally here is the minifig a clone pilot it has light blue arms and legs white hands a helmet with black markings and republic insignia on it and a doublesided torso the front of the torso is great featuring shoulder straps armor plating and a life support system while this minifig is not altogether accurate to the movie it has still been one of my favorite star wars figs back the back of the fig that can double as the front of clone marines this side features shoulder straps and armor plating cockpit lastly here is the pilot seated in the cockpit he fits perfectly although it is not airtight we wouldnt want the poor guy to suffocate now would we that wraps up the review here is the final verdict build 810 a nice easy build and the last of the small sw ships 10 or less playability 610 pretty fun to swoosh around but thats about it could use a vulture droid but that would take away the small factor swooshability 1010 very fun and easy to swoosh around endlessly without fear of it breaking minifigs 910 there really is no need to have more although a palpy fig would be outstanding the pilot is a great figure though design 910 extremely accurate to the movie but the cockpit is not airtight price 1010 you couldnt ask for a better deal overall score 86 an excellent set unfortunately this is the last of the small sw ships currently the fig is great and the sleek design is accurate that just about sums it all up feel free to leave your comments edited by jimbutcher 15 september 2008  0311 am	positive

is your knight army feeling short do your knights get consistently run over by the skeletons if so this is the set for you 852271 knights battle pack set info set name 852271 knights battle pack theme castle released 2008 price usd 1299gbp 649eur 995 minifigs 5 its army building time packaging the figs come in a plastic box with a slide out tray to open you slide out a tab on the bottom and pull the tray out the weapons one plus of this set is the good weapon selection you get a whopping 5 shields a spear a lance acrossbow a pointed lance thing and a lovely chrome sword minifigures now the main focus of this set the figs one thing thats nice here is that you get a good selection of different knights the figs are quite nice with different faces and helmets for almost every one minifig backsides i really like the archers quiver two sided head the archer has a scared head on the other side brickshelf folder and now the ratings price 610 certainly a bit overpriced it should have been 10 the star wars battle packs have only 1 less fig plus some parts for 5 less parts 810 no bricks but a nice selection of weapons minifigs 910 the figs are great overall 2330 lego sh brickset bricklink even with a bigger army the poor knights are no match for modern technology summary even though the pack is a bit overpriced it is still great for increasing your armys size i would get this set if you are a castle fan looking to expand your army otherwise dont worry if you pass on this set thanks and happy building	positive
very good review i enjoyed reading this i want to buy these battlepacks until now my country has not restocked these battlepacks i wonder will they ever arrived again i want to build massive armies with this outstanding battlepack set hope it will arrived soon	positive
nice review which reminds me i must order some more of these battle packs at some point are you going to also review the skelton battlepack also i hope this is a start of a running joke about castle sets being stomped by sw sets	neutral
i love this battlepack i bought two last time i went to legoland california and it certainly gave the knights a good variety of new troops however i have one complaint and that is the guy with the lance i am wondering why he has a lance while fighting on foot if tlg really wanted to give him a lance they should have given him a horse	positive
great set but with two huge cons  availabilty only on sh well surely not in italian stores  why are the figures already built are todays kids so dumb lets go back to those old minifig packs	neutral
imperialshadows on sep 2 2008 0846 am said  with that lovely new barding nobody would complain about the price then even if it was 15 i sure wouldnt especially if it was the silver chainmail barding	neutral
i was going to get this but when i rang up sh apparently theyd sold out already price is a little on the steep side as well and i can only see it going up on sites such as amazon as the number of people wanting them goes up which it will it its anything based on the star wars battle packs	neutral
how were you able to get three small shields i only got two in mine i am going to check the trash just in case	neutral
swman on oct 6 2008 0727 am said how were you able to get three small shields i only got two in mine i am going to check the trash just in case i think it only comes with two the extra one probably slipped in from another set sorry for any confusion	neutral
and another great review from one of our academy teachers i always look forward reading them  i think the battlepacks for castle are a great initiative from tlc i like this one but also the one with the skellies you get some different looking soldiers and a few weapons and shields so thats cool the low prices make it so that most people could build a large armybattle if they want to a big for your review and another for tlc for making these edited by zorro3999 06 october 2008  0540 pm	positive
i think this battle pack is a little expensive but the minifig their heads and weapons and stuff are very very nice but because of the price ill rate it  average 	neutral
i love this set i bought one when i went to the lego store at downtown disney and went home and bought another online i love that it gives you a variety of weapons and figures i like using the bowl helmet guy to man my catapults and crossbows	positive
its an ok set but its extremely overpriced where i live i simply couldnt justify paying 1799 tax for 5 minifigs the fact that these figures are featured prominantly in other sets makes this set a difficult purchase given the price i find it hard to look at this set with much enthusiasm	neutral
its way to expansive for what you get besides you pay more for the package then its containts	negative
i like your review on this battle pack but i think that this battle pack was over priced 12 for this i am not paying that much for 5 knights	negative
dear all i found this to be a very usefull army building set at 2 euro per minifig it is relatively cheap in my book so i bought 4 battle packs recently although it could be difficult to integrate all of them in your army personally i reshuffled some of the weapons as to integrate them better but that is a personal preference ofcourse kind regards teddy	neutral
yeah i have to admit you expect it to be wayyy cheaper since a no packaging to pay forbaggies and such b no liscensing feeslike sw so why isnt this set a better deal than sw battlepack dont look at me look at tlche he it rhymed	negative

i also love the impulse sets but we have already too many policemen although i actually bought this one our bobby isnt looking very nice is he we normally but policemen in a pool or sea with sharks at events like legoworld so maybe thats because of me edited by jopiek 02 september 2008  1100 pm	neutral
i bought this set for 214€ yesterday and i have to admit that for that price im veerryy satisfied  i bought it especially for the dog my first one and for the road sign during the construction short of the set i was wondering something does the speed limit has a signification in every country or some variant exists in my country france the speed limit in town is 50 kmh so i understand the road sign in this set but in other country and especially the country were the speed limit is not in kmh does this set had another road sign	positive
not a bad set altough the radar is a little weird looking	neutral

set name crossbow attack set number 7090 theme castle pieces 54 minifigs 3 released 2007 price 599usd 399 eur 799 cdn legoshopcom description ready aim fireits a battle of brave knights against the evil skeleton rider includes 2 knights skeleton and a skeleton horse rolling wagon has a launcher that really fires bricklink inventory peeron inventory brickshelf gallery now on to the review the box as you can see the front of the box illustrates the set very nicely showing the skeleton warrior attacking and the knights firing their crossbow the back the back of the box shows a small battle happening between a knight and a skeleton as well as the main feature of the set the firing crossbow more on that later the instructions not much to say here its the same as the front of the box the back of the instructions this merely shows pictures of other sets in the castle line random instruction page this set does not use piece callouts to tell you what parts you will need in each step however the set is so small you should never have trouble finding a piece the minifigures this is the main reason i bought this set you get two knights one with a standard helmet and the other one with a new mold you also get a skeleton warrior the horse the set comes with a skeleton horse that looks great however it is a single molded piece that has no articulation closeup of the warrior riding his horse here you see the brave skeleton riding in on hisaherumnoble steed the accessoriesweapons for minifigure accessories you get an axe a skeleton sword and a skeleton shield extra pieces i was left with one skeleton arm and one leg when i was finished the build the crossbow wagon and now to the main part of the set the crossbow wagon it is really just a plate with some whells attached and a lot of those cheese wedge pieces to create the track for the projectile back view this view shows the mechanism that makes the crossbow fire it is powered by a rubber band you pull back on a technic piece which creates tension in the elastic band when you let go the elastic pushes the piece forward which in turn hits the projectile and makes it fire it works fairly well but i would have prefered it fired farther entire set the skeleton charges at his adversaries the knights prepare to counterattack overall build 1010 the build is simple easy and quick set design 710 the crossbow could have worked a bit better playability 810 the crossbow is fun to shoot minifigs 1010 it doent get much better than this i love that domed helmet mold price 810 the set is very affordable and worth the price overall score4350 conclusion overall this is a great set and a solid army builder you get three minifigures for a fair price and the crossbow wagon adds some muchneeded playability i bought two of these to bolster my army and to stock up on those rare domed helmet pieces basically get this set thank you for taking the time to read my review i hope you liked it	positive
i agree that this set is worth the price considering the amount of minifigs and even a skeletal horse it also comes with a lot of blue 1x1 slopes that are always useful and quite rare to obtain another weapon for the soldier operating the catapult or a shield for the other soldier would have been great but that is pushing it the crossbow itself is quite nice and is better than what most 6 sets come with imo overall a good set indeed thank you for the review and the other review concerning the knight of which i hope to buy in the near future as it looks like it comes with a great deal of goodies the weapon rack is useful too	neutral
thanks for the input	positive
i like this set mostly because it has some very usable pieces but also because of the amount of minifigures in the set which is a whopping three and one large animal skeleton horse the one thing however that i dont like about it is that one of the catapult operators isnt armed in my opinion this would have been a good time for tlg to release a suitable dagger piece not the kitchen knife for its castle line great review by the way it captured the key elements of this fantastic small set	neutral
nice review to start off you got all the details someone could possibly need in my opinion at least i do enjoy this set as well and ive bought only one to keep my minifigs as unique as possible despite my personal preference i still find this a nice army builder good amount of minifigs for the price as mentioned earlier with each being different from the other though i would like the catapult manager to be armed with at least something i still feel that he can just flee if hes ever in trouble hes a good guy to use for the castle gimmics if you have it one more small comment i also love those domed helmets even if they arent actually new my favorite of them all being followed up by the racer helmet	neutral
nice review  i still thing sets like this are the reason castle has done so well it allows you to collect a large number of minfig for not very much cash which i certainly indulged in my only complaint is that you end up with the evil skeletons out numbered however heard of the good guys winning with the numbers in their favour	neutral

nice review it seems that you really covered all aspects of this fantastic set my favorite part about it is probably the fact that you can give almost every included minifig a mount except for one poor knight  however another part i like is that the horse includes a plain saddle which is a nice relief after the overabundance of the goldplate barding which is nice but overused in the early sets also the sw jokes are hilarious i particularly the running gag with the walker but i like this one too reason for edit i made a mistake due to a loss of internet and an accidental post edited by francis marion 03 september 2008  0332 am	positive
youre really rolling these reviews out huh i am not sure how i feel about this set while it does include five figs three are skeletons and are generally worth much less than say three trollsorcs i know they didnt exist at this point in time so this is understandable the amount of horses is nice but im not a big lego horse fan what this set does have is a great appearance and brings atmosphere to the table 20 is an affordable amount for those of us who do not wish to splurge too much on a toy while being enough to actually get a large enough set to create something out of personally id rate it in between average and above average like another castle set i cant remember which i just feel this one also lacks something	neutral
i really like this set and its probably my next purchase from a store if i can still find it theres alot of great pieces i especially like the spiked thingy on the front and it makes a great addition for any skeletal army above all i just love the spinechilling feeling of it if i were a minifig in a legoland id be scared out of my pantspiece if i saw a carriage like that rolling towards me in a dark night	neutral
well indeed looks like a very nice set especially the scared knights are very nice 	positive
that’s a nice review though i do feel the price was a little high but as you said you get so much in it last year argos in the uk reduced it to £799 which was a true bargain and sent me all over london looking for a store with more in stock again as with all the lego castle sets i think what makes it work so well is that lego are now providing a much larger number of minfigs and that’s often what makes a set	neutral
this was one of the first sets i bought from the new castle theme and i love it so many figs and awesome skeleton horses in just one set at the same time you get quite a few usefull black bricks for castle mocs another perfect set in the new world of castle review added to the index	positive

thats a super review erdbeereis1 as usual and as we can expect from one of the academy teachers i gave the set a 4 above average because i think there are quite some minifigs included for its price which is i think not that expensive at all i also like the parts that are included like the sceleton horses and weapons wheels imho this set is a great armybuilder  btw in belgium i have seen this set being sold for 1599 euros	positive
what an amazing review i actually have this set and i decided to take it apart it has a brown horse and a lot of useful pieces so taking it apart was a good idea now i have three lego horses hoorah the end of the review was the funniest lego12	positive
other than the minis accessories and animals this set is meh at best	negative
i really do love this set it has 5 figures which is unheard of for a 20 set it comes with plenty of weapons and accessories and has a great design the detail is really well done and for anyone who wants to just buy one set this set allows for hour of fun just by itself i already have one of these and hopefully will be getting a second	positive

7040 dwarves mine defender theme castle released 2008 price 10 usd pieces 73 3 minifigures introduction here i am with one of the newest castle sets realeased in early 2008 its a small battle wagon with blades on the front probably to demolish rocks in mines but in this case our hero dwarf has to use his machine against the evil trolls who want to destroy his happy kingdom there is only one small booklet for instructions no alternate model parts come in two bags one for small pieces and one for bigger ones apart from the lovely figures the brown parts will be quite useful for any castle builder extra parts are not even worth mentioning there are no stickers figures are detailed enough dwarf is lovely with his beard but his legs wont move because he is short figures are the main attraction for adult players we havent seen castle army builder sets for a long while and this is closest weve got in recent years the dwarf is a little taller than it should have been but its not possible to do so without creating a completely new mould for figures and that would be expensive its beard is oversized as well but that gives him a legoish look which i like a lot the trolls  thats what everybody calls them but i say they are orcs  are obviously evil but they are friendly enough not to scare our munchkins but i wish they had different torsos or at least different faces like crownies there are not enough weapons to arm everyone but the flag pole is really nice unlike the star wars army builders this set has very little weaponry only one sword and one pike creates scarcity for 3 figures  star wars sets had 4 figures for same price so i hope our middle age warriors dont come across any stormtroopers  building in progress when you pull the chain the catapult fires a round brick the set has quite good playability moving blades and firing catapult should be fun for little children i wouldnt expect more functions for such a small sized model it hardly covers my hand the blades move with the front wheel on the right there is only one little downside there is too much friction for the wheel and blades wont move synchronized you may come over this problem by adjusting the blade height and lining them with the wheels mow the little buggers you can adjust the blade height there isnt enough room for the dwarf folder when public httpwwwbrickshelrycgif338578 rating figures 810 dwarf is amazing trolls are great too but i wish they had different faces parts 710 brown slopes are new rest is ok too price 710 acceptable but we have seen sets with more figures for less design 610 it looks kind of steampunkish but could be better with a little detail building 610 not repeating itself still nothing exciting total 3450 castle fans will definetely order this one but average lego player may not be interested conclusion overall its a nice set and id recommend it if you like the castle theme youll find some good use for the figures and this is the cheapest figure set of the year  at 333 usd each it could have more armory and weaponry but otherwise its quite alright skip lunch today and order this little set links brickset reviews bricklink entry peeron inventory	positive

ive skipped a few lunches on behalf of this set its a great army builder but so are many of the new castle sets what makes this great in my opinion is the figs  2 orcs and 1 dwarf  what else could one want thanks tlg for making this set and thank you for reviewing it for us review added to the index	positive
indexed going through the boards i was amazed to find out that no one ever attempted to review one of the best lego classics the 6399 airport shuttle while i was studying for exams a few weeks back i decided to take a break built the monorail and take some pictures of it resulting in the present review along with this i made my first ever poll here we go first some data setnumber 6399 setname airport shuttle released in 1990 in holland though bricklink says 1991 number of parts 731 number of figs 9 price unknown prices on bricklink vary from 261 up to 2300  but this was an expensive set even in the nineties the box mine is a bit battered by the owner before me but theres still plenty to see this is one of the largest boxes i have look at the minifig in the downright corner for the comparision and it is a really neat storing facility for many sets the box shows the set and in the background the silhouet of the set that is to accompany this one the airport from 1990 i like the angle of the box showing the two stations track and train in one picture the back of the box shows some really nice ideas for other setups why oh why has lego abandonned this kind of showing whats possible with one set inside flap of the box showing details of the set and the functions detail on the front of the box displaying the dimensions it really is a huge track layout for one set the instructions there is a nice little booklet showing the same picture as the box art with the figures lined up underneath the last page nicely folds out to show the entire setup of the tracks the figures a brilliant selection of minifigs including airport people and a cook all figures that are supposed to go on the shuttle carry a ticket and there are also some suitcases tickets fit inside of course station  1 the set includes two stations here is the first depicting the airport there are lots of details a phonebooth two seats some flowers a map luggagelockers and of course the streetlights a detailed shot of the station showing the luggagelockers and ticketvalidating machine part of the beauty of this set is the fact that it is so extremely detailed just look at the signs to show where to go next stickers and the scenery opposite the street the station has the same shape as the airport shuttle logo how sweet is that the station pictured as part of the layout the stations ends are made with airplane wings to smoothen the arrival of the shuttle station  2 here is the second station my personal favorite an elevated stop with a little snackbar underneath and stairs leading to the platform some chairs and streetlights here as well plus two old fashioned trees the part of the set that can be used in any layout the snackbar with hamburger sign sticker yes those hamburgers look tasty indeed also notice the lights hanging from the platform overhead and the ticketvalidating machine at the bottom of the stairs here we have the platform with information panels and seats also notice the two trafficlights for the train heres how it works the train will travel in the direction the arrow is pointing when turning the knob the two grey blocks will move towards or away from the trackcenter activating a button on the centerpiece of the train the motor which makes the train start its journey around the track there is only one speed and the train can only be put to a stop or change direction at stations the station as part of the layout the shuttle now on with the train there are two carrriages connected to a centered motor the power is provided by means of a batterybox containing a 9v battery the batterybox is in one of the carriages and displays airport shuttle a total of five passengers can be seated inside leaving room for their luggage and two drivers the front carriage with the button for the batterybox showing the underside showing the gearwheel metal that brings the power from the motor onto the geared track the black pointy things alongside the gearwheel react with the direction knobs at stations this is how the shuttle negociates with height differences everything hinges and rotates making the shuttle capable of performing steep climbs the motor is powerful enough to not slow down at such a climb detailed shot showing the first set of covered wheels in hinged position the shuttle on the layout the full layout this layout is quite huge involving lots of track pieces ramps ten large stanchionpoles and the two stations to show the movement of the shuttle i have made a 20 second movie which can be seen in my brickshelf gallery of this set conclusion well to conclude the review some final thoughts this truly is one of the more detailed sets around at least from the nineties and one of the largest in dimensions the monorail system is cleverly thought out and works excellent track extensions are hard to get however and very expensive nowdays especially the switchpoints and long straight track pieces the tracks included with this set will provide you with hours of fun though because there are a lot of them it can be quite hard to incorporate the monorail in your town without having a clearlybasedonthemonorailalone town i tried to incorporate it some years ago link here posing a real challenge the ratings price 810 this is an expensive set if you can get it for under 200 get it this set is rare in any condition parts 1010 lots of rare pieces cool minifigs 9v system roadplates lots of minifigseats en red trainwindows originality 1010 there are very few monorails released this one being the only town set compatibility 810 can be a bit hard to incorporate in a town but hey you got the monorail so no complaining here total 3640 i can only reccommend this set to anyone it is my personal favorite set upto this present time if there are any questions ask them all comments are welcome of course	positive
i got this set last month and i can definitely say that even if you think it is one of the best sets ever you wont fully appreciate it until you build it yourself the elevated city station is much more complex than it looks and the whole set is extremely detailed the good  as stated in the review theres a lot of track roughly twice as much as the last monorail made 6991 5 long straights too  the designers didnt need to put in the hamburger stand or the ticket readers but they did and made it even better  great figure selection airport workers as well as civilians the bad if you can call it that in such a great set  hard to incorporate into an existing town if using the default track layout the center loop would be inaccessible to vehicles and the layout is very large  the monorail needs nearly a full straight section on either side of the city station or it will impact the corner of the station and stall if a curve is too close  as far as i know the only town set with road plates that doesnt have a wheeled vehicle a car would have been nice a bus would have been incredible but these small things in no way diminish from the fact that this is one of the best sets ever edited by section8 05 september 2008  0117 pm	positive
this is an outstanding review which deserved to be featured here after seeing this set it prompts me to own this set and match with my 10159 legend city airport its very nice to see such outstanding set being reviewed and presented to our very screens everything about this set is simply outstanding i cant imagine that such incredible set actually released before why dont they ever continue with this anymore sigh its nice to see so much detailed from its shuttle snack bar stairs waiting platform validating machine and etc this is an instant 5 set if given a chance to own a misb set i will defintely seriously consider about it	positive
an excellent review of one of the jewels in the crown of the lego town range to answer one of your question i think the lack of people owning this set is one of the reasons that its yet to have a review personally i’ve only seen this set in the flesh once in my life when i was a child just before it was withdrawn from sale it is a lovely set well made and well produced though i think there is a flaw and that’s when the passages get of the other end of their train ride what picks them up a bus set for the airport would have been a good addition apart from that i can’t really fault it and that fact it comes with three female minifigs is just stellar as for incorporation keeping it elevated seems the most sensible suggestion i’ve always thought it i have it and wanted to integrate the set to a town to use it in the style of the dlr in london but that’s just a thought	positive
yes this is one of the best town sets ever	positive
thanks for that splendid review simonwillems i clicked on outstanding of course i also like those little details especially the ticket validating machines youre very fortunate to own this wonderful set i hope you have an airport to go with it edit and bricklink is wrong giving 1991 as the release date youre right it was 1990 edited by legotrainfan 05 september 2008  0657 pm	positive

tenorikuma on sep 7 2008 0830 am said it would be cool to see a review comparing this set with the newer orange garbage truck well i might want to do that but then in a different way as the railroad maintenance i will then review the orange one and make comments on it compared to this one	neutral
yeah its very nice along with all the older sets ive got the cement mixer that was released around about the same time as this	positive
thanks for the review like many such town sets i would characterise it as cute contrasting it to the new bin lorry its nice that this set has two minfigs more realistic and two bins those bins are a great addition to lego although wheelie bins would be nice now need some kind of 2x2 container you can clip a plate onto as a hinging lid and clip miniwheels under the back two studs having two minifigs is a superior point for this earlier lego rendition of a bin lorry in fact even though our bins are now emptied by a private company rather than the local council as was the case up till the mid 90s and of course for the last two decades there have been wheeliebins bin lorries have three guys  the driver and two collectors however our bin collectors for sure dont use a broom or shovel indeed on occasion theyve befouled the street themselves if something goes wrong with hoisting the bin on the mechanism the shape of the lorry in the set is still quite accurate pretty good for a fourwide vehicle i must admit to preferring the newer vehicles	positive
thanks so much for the great review i love that truck i hadnt realized there was a real 4wide recycle truck out there i must get it one day to replace this abomination currently doing garbage duty in my town i think that truck has seven pieces total in it i do like the blue color though 	positive

greetings just looking through the review index when i came across this one i recently acquired this set through ebay which came with a practically perfect box and instructions i would almost say that no one played with it much as all of the parts were brand new anyway i just wanted to say that this is a great set that was worth the 1499	positive
i did not see this nice review and beautiful truck i like it	positive
nice set but nicer review looks like the set has quite some nice parts	positive
a nice set my brother used to have this i wish the pilots helmet had a little printing on it looks messed up to me	positive
the interceptor is my favorite tie ship so i wish i picked it up thanks for the review i agree about the helmet needs some silver printing on the mouth piece and the ends	positive
a very robust set the fact that it seats two figs plus has ls makes it a unique set i definitely liked the big airport subtheme tlg created in the early 1990s	neutral
jopiek i enjoyed this review very much your first picture certainly capture the essence of this lovely set in reality i am in the aviation line especially aviation safety therefore you reentact the scene very well to be honest i have never seen this set before this aes airport emergency service fire truck is certainly unbelievable i love it very much its a pity i never owned this this is a set which give me a 5 great job jopiek i enjoyed viewing your classic town reviews very much keep up the good work	positive

perfect perhaps the front sprouses are for foaming the runway youve certainly kept that set in near mint condition havent you now all we can wish for is a new firetruck combining this ls version and the new	neutral

nice review cobra thanks for sharing i esp like the doctors torso i rate this little set a 4 based on the design of the vehicle and the classic doors blogged edit i must have missed this review after it was posted back in sep i went ahead and kept the blog since its always enjoyable to look at these reviews	positive
i have this one the newer 6571 station is better in some ways but i always liked the big airportstyle fire engine in this and the windows covering the garages one mod project i have in mind is to expand the base adding a second room in the area beneath the control center interestingly this set had two different box pictures there was the original 1989 yellow legoland box and a 1991 blue system box and the blue box has the vehicles in different places quote price usd 8500  gbp unknown  eur unknown if this is referring to the original price it wasnt that much 50 is more like it	neutral

big supie on sep 7 2008 0846 pm said i think the 6382 fire station is the better one from the 80ies i have 6382 and agree that it is a great set it doesnt have a chopper like this set and the fire engine is not as flash it does have a downstairs in the building though at least a door and a front wall anyway its nice to see a review of this set as its one that i often looked at in the catalogue and thought of getting but never did its great to see the details that i otherwise would not have seen i dont like the firemen with hair though they should have helmets or caps imho thanks for the review cheers rog	positive
from memory argos sold it originally for about £21 gbp i seem to remember this as i could not afford the airport released the same year as this was about £2999 seems such a small amount of money now now have 2 copies of this set only 1 boxed 	positive
found this set on a flea market in munich yesterday just 25 years after its release the instructions for a total of five models two of them printed the other 3 are just photo instructions in the book it still has the box in good shape despite some wear from the age sadly five little pieces were missing and 5 wrong pieces inside instead 2 complete wheels and a classic 80s90s plane wing dumped into my bricks but i was able to replace the missing minifig torch and the 4 missing plates with identical pieces from my collection the box and contents the set still has the original box inside the pieces plastic insert instructions and a 1987 technic catalogue imagine that set livespan today four years and the 8841 is still in the catalogue classic technic design from early 80s showing a function drawing of the steering and the main model a small set but with a flap shoeing the contents all pieces in the inner box and the papers included 5th model soapbox racer this is more or less a soapbox racer with working steering but no engine its got a rather blocky design but still looks sleek enough and is a simple build little over 100 pcs out of 180 the soapbox at step 2 just included the steering at step 6 completed and ready to race downhill total 710 simple but effective 4th model simple chassis very simple and boring alternate using just 13 of the 180 pieces in the set it even hasnt got a seat construction its just a plain steering mechanism attached on wheels with a spartan chassis of just a few pieces this is the whole model at step 5 just attach the steering mechanism and wheels and youre done total the worst alternate model of the complete set just a boring 410 3rd model balance very original small model its a small model of a working classic balance and it works with small parts laid on the scales altough theyve got just a 4x4 footprint its a fast build just 15 minutes and youve done it the model as it looks at step 3 finished easy build with just 63pcs out of 180 total very original model it actually works with small weights but a very simple build still a 710 alternate model tractor with equipment this is the second model its a simple but boxy design featuring a harrow and a plough the tractor has a similar design to the very first tractor set but much smaller the plough is about 24wide and the harrow is completely snotted even back in 1983 has two functions working steering and the coupler for the equipment uses almost all pieces of the set the tractor at step 8 the steering isnt completely attached now this is the completed tractor the complete harrow finished alternate with the plough attached total nice but quite ugly and boxy design for a tractor with 4 wheels of the same size takes me to a 610 main model desert racer this is the main model with a nice for early 80s but boxy design it has two functions steering and a working 1cylinder rear engine which is of the old 2x2 piston type since the small piston design wasnt invented back then this is the only model of the set which has piece callouts in the instructions the printed alternate model has no callouts they werent invented on both models back in 1983 the three smaller photo instruction alternates have a piece callout at the beginning showing all needed pieces the seat is a nice but blocky design and use a primitive snot technique this is the model at step five the piston is already attached imagine this state on step 5 in modern sets back then lego had challenging instructions not the step madness like today this is the engine just made of plates with a hole in the middle for the piston step 9 the piston engine is completed on step 12 the roll bar and the seat are installed only the steering isnt completed yet front view of the finished model just 15 steps needed back then birds eye view of the whole set displayed on the box model verdict nice design especially the colorful seat in snot technique but quite boxy especially the engine since there were only the huge pistons still a 910 set verdict design and models 710 very boxy designs due to the age the chassis alternate sucks build 910 classic 80s technic building quite challenging but fun sturdyness 710 rear section damaged after the table fall but rather easily fixed fun 910 blast from the past overall 810 mfg widdi edited by widdi 07 september 2008  0411 pm	positive

name electric passenger train set no 7725 theme lego  system  trains  12v  train set year 1981 pieces 485 minifigs 1 price usd 7000 which equals about eur 50€ and gbp 40£ introduction our most favorite theme is 12v trains actually i got my first 77series back in 1981 5th of december i was 25 years old just a week before my brother was born some years later i got the 7740 after our dark ages we my brother cousin and myself got all 12v trains at least once this 7725 was gathering dust in my brothers room the train in all its splendor as you can see it doesnt occur at the back of the 12v era train instructions although its larger brother the 7740 does some investigation learned that all the sets at the back of the instructions date from 1980 so the 7725 wasnt released yet here you can see the front of the 7725 with the driver in the cockpit the driver is in fact the only minifig that was included in the set as you can see our version of the train has a different front than the one in the instructions apparently the former owner used 7861 lighting set 12 v to upgrade the train with working back and frontlights i like the original lights but didnt notice that the train had those double lights until i did the review maybe we will give the train again its original signs and put custom leds in it or so so that the train can drive into two directions with accurately working lights another thing about the lights that puzzle me are the backlights while typing this i realise that the former owner might have added those so lets have a look at the instructions then as it turns out the lights are there also in the instructions i recently learned that only the last car or coach of a train has its red lights on so unless the train drives with only the front car it will never use those red backlights here you can see the cockpit with the engineer the cables dont look very pretty but well the train at least has working light here you can take a look at the inside of the engine car while the 7745 has a nice fake engine there just the weight bricks and the ugly cables apart from the engineer and his cockpit no other nice features here btw lego always used tiles in such a trains to make it easier for kids to take off the roof and have access to the minifig passengers etc here the proof that it is an electric train the pantograph of the front car it has the same kind of panthographs that the 7745 has the middle car has 4 chairs as you can see some vandal must have nocked over this one hope they leave the cables alone this early morning train seems to have one passenger a workman i like the small 2x3 windows from this car very much they give this care a nice look also the door in the middle adds something special to the train as far as i know no other passenger train has the doors in the middle here you see the side of the train just after the train has left brickingham station where the worker probably from set 6647 highway repair that was also released in 1980 a closeup of the last car with steering stand to allow the train to travel back and forth without having to make head in other words putting the engine in front again the train shunted to an end track so it can be cleaned i think it is apparent that it definitely needs cleaning very badly this set can be found on peeron lugnet brickset bricklink entries playability 510 the train is fine but with only one minifig not very playable without other sets also no accessories at all design 710 nice train the inside could have been a lot better but i really like to original front lights price 710 the train came with motor so not a bad price goes now for quite some money at ebay overall 6510 nice set but the 7745 is a better train im sure well that was it for today i hope you have enjoyed this review and got tears in your eyes seeing how nice the 12v era was it never comes back but maybe lego rereleases some of this sets in the 2009 train era very likely that this is just wishful thinking edited by jopiek 12 september 2008  0456 pm	neutral
a very nice review jopiek you know i was wondering how lego could justify having two 12vpowered passenger trains at the same time but after reading the review and seeing the lack of figures and accessories i guess i understand why plus the train is rather compact oh and i cant help but think that the chairs in the middle carriage are somewhat oddly placed because those placed next to the door are unusable because the door takes up room needed for figs arms also it appears that your set also has the newer couplers ie theres no hooks for the decoupling rail to grab hold of with the light assembly it really wont matter playwise or if you dont have any decouplers but its still a bit of a bummer	positive

jopiek on sep 8 2008 1220 am said the chair was just loose so it should be placed on the 2x2 plate that is also visible in the picture of the middle car btw the front magnet is the old type i have some decouplers but we dont use them because they are not really that reliable lego just release a whole line of trains at the same time i just discussed with my parents and they told be lego had those sets longer in store back then i must have gotten the 7745 somewhere in 1983 or even 1984 although it was released in 1981 i started of with the 7710 push along train and then upgraded the tracks with current rails when i got the 7745 the 7745 was realsed in 1985  lego had 2 12v passengers trains between 1981 and 1984 the 7740  7725 during the 80s the avergae life of a train was about 5 years	neutral
jopiek on sep 7 2008 1120 pm said the chair was just loose so it should be placed on the 2x2 plate that is also visible in the picture of the middle car thats not the one i was thinking of it was the other two chairs towards the middle of the wagon that i was thinking of if you try to seat a minifig in either of them youll quickly find that its impossible beacuse the door interferes with the figs required personal space if you move both of them one stud forward so that the back of the seat lines up with the edge of the window itll solve the problem and still leave space for a figs to be seated in the other chairs	neutral

the best 12v legotrain is for me the 7740 the 7725 is still a goodlooking train and the only one with short wagons in a electric version before i started to with bricklink i started to build this train in blue ive build 4 trains of it and sold 2 of them still one for sale  you can also build this in other colors like a yellow one or you can build a black version which i made a death train of it driven by a skeleton  edited by panda9001100 17 may 2009  0801 am	positive

i had never seen these sets before in my retail stores before however i do remember the existence of its video games look like an interesting set for great outdoor enterainment and fun for lego citizens whom is out for real thrill and excitement this theme never really got me excited back then after reading your review its quite useful for some new addition to your town features such as including a skater boy holding the pizza instead of using the pizza van the high fuel cost must have caught up to them to resort using skate board for delivery as for the street surfer vehicle its a cool looking vehicle with unique construction pardon me i have not seen such design before i will actually tear off the wheels cover up the sides and used it for wind surfing thats the whole idea after giving some thoughts and weighs its factors i will have to give it a 3 for this set i will probably get it if its on sales once again brickster this is a lovely review which has showed us a new perspective of island xtreme stunts	neutral
like whitefang i too only remember this line in computer game form i used to love that game i actually have never seen a review for an xtreme stunts set so this was nice to see as for the set i think it looks pretty good i really like the hippie guy the windboard thing is nice as well but looks a bit strange somehow i give this set a solid 3 out of 5 thanks for the nice review edited by erdbeereis1 08 september 2008  0405 am	positive
her name was sky lane its quite sad though to actually play the gamethe xtreme tower is the only set that made it into the game itself and it was a really watered down version of the information center from the first two games but the island was in the game filled with incredible buildings that would have made really cool sets	negative
air chase woosh the bricksters seaplane flies over the beach quickly hippie dude is in close pursuit on his hang glider fuel is running out for the bricksters plane can hippie dude catch him before he either gets away or crash lands in the water you decide with island xtreme stunts air chase set  6735 theme island xtreme stunts year released 2002 piece count 83 minifigs 2 list price 10 usd a nice addition to the island xtreme stunts theme air chase includes two air vehicles a seaplane and hang glider the set has nice island colors inclusing white light blue and orange also includes in the set are some great chrome pieces for the bricksters airplane wings starting with the box you can see hippie dude in close pursuit the back of the box depicts some nice alternate jet skis same front box picture on the instructions and on the backside pictures of the video game air chase includes two nicely detailed figs hippie dude for lack of his official name and the brickster heres a picture of the orange hangglider and the underside unfortunately the hangglider is too heavy to be held up by a minigig while i like the brickbuilt glider for the extra pieces the plastic wing pieces from the ninja theme would have worked effectively and be a lot lighter i think the seaplane is the best part of the set heres a shot of the front end i like the skeletal sharkfish design whats great is none of the pieces use stickers they are all printed including the tail end although the cockpit has no steering wheel or lever piece it does have a very nice printed 1x2 tile the wings of the airplane have hinges to allow them to fold inward slightly also notice the nice chromesilver pieces heres a shot of the underside of the seaplane and lastly the complete set final thoughts air chase is another one of those fun island sets two figs with two vehicles make a perfect combination for creating some dogfights in the air at the same time the bricksters plane can land in the water to explore other adventure play opportunities this set is also a nice addition to the island xtreme stunts truck  stunt trikes 6739 the seaplane can be hauled by the large semitruck included within 6739 hope you enjoy this review	neutral

i love the classic sets of that era and a great review helps show off the simplicity of some older sets	positive
this is one of those sets that make me really want to start building up a city its a great value has a lot of useful pieces and is just plain fun to play with i do miss vehicles having doors though great review i was a bit curious as to how the dumping mechanism worked as well as the sticker count	positive
yeah the name on this set is strange i think all the boxes say garbage truck i guess its up to each builder to decide whether 1x1 round plates are recyclable material or not its a great model in any case i love these highly detailed city trucks weve been getting during the last year or two i used to have a preference for the late 80searly 90s city line but some of these new sets have really surpassed them in detail and functionality	positive
i own this set and i think its a really nice truck but there is two little details that i didnt like  1 a recycle truck really needs 2 minifig one to drive one to put the garbage on the back 2 the big hole behind the driver seat it was easy to fill it like this  with hole pouf  no more little hole but this is really a great set anyway 45 for me  above average 	positive
nice review this is a very nice vehicle one of my favorite of the newer city ones jopiek there are two generations of road plate that are wide enough for sixwide vehicles like this the current plates are dark grey with plain white printing and look not great in my opinion the previous ones are imo the best road plates of all time  green with dark grey road white dotted linezebras drain covers and yellow verge markings just like we really have here in ireland for urban area i would still choose the greenedged plates and just cover up the green  the markings are so much better than the current plates	neutral

this looks like a great set and im happy you were dumping spongebob he deserves that this set looks very nice and if i see it i will probably pick it up	positive
thanks for this review i really love this set its perfect for my town and brings a sense of classic when i see it	positive
thanks for the review this is one of the few city sets that i own despite loving the theme so much most of my town is either custom or classic and its about as beautiful as a big garbage truck can ever be quote nice truck indeed but the yellow one is better i think at least if you put them on a roadplate it seems to me that those road plates are too small for that also it will not empty completely because of that panel well for the rest it is a nice set and a fine review well the truck barely fits onto the old roadplates not on curves though so if you put it in a display it probably wont look bad i think from what i see this and all the other 6 wide vehicles will fit much better on the newer roadplates which are four studs wider than the old ones	positive
hi i bought this set a while ago and have since remodeled it into a larger 8 wide truck now it can hold a driver and passenger its kind of boxy i may redesign it in the future	neutral
