1 cp5670, on jul 8 2008, 05:04 am, said: these are pretty good, but i think they look too much like the standard town roads from that period. i like the black space plates from the early 90s better (6710). oh how i love these plates. afew years ago i found a local retail store with about 6-7 sets of these in their basement warehouse i was given special access to (along with many other old space goodies.. hehe..) i love the things, i have loads, and i've used them for multiple space bases and battles. along with afew grey crater plates and the large grey plates (1.5x the size of a normal baseplate) you can get quite a monorail layout going. *sigh* i should really clean up and get one set up again, so i can take some pictures!

0 lokix, on jul 11 2008, 03:00 pm, said: by looking at the pictures used to display this set i've a sneaky suspicion it did not come with instructions but meant for the pictures to be ideas. the whole set was suppose to teach children to use their imagination, giving them instructions would somewhat defeat this while trying to figure how to build things from looking at pictures would be a much better educational experience. but i don't wanna use my imagination!

1 great review sinner. i own the later version, 709 released in 1977. mine no longer has decals though. the variations were minimal. it looks like your boat is in really good shape considering it's >30 years old. excellent review!

-1 thank you for the nice review, sinner. holodoc, on aug 1 2008, 08:59 am, said: nice review sinner! the old sets... i dont know - every old set, especially equipped with the old non-moveable arms minifigs look very odd nowadays. i agree with you with the hull shape and its possibility to be extended, but every other aspect, the lack of detail, the keel itself (you cant float it in shallow water) keeps me from rating it higher than 3/10. in my opninion the best police boat so far is 4021 *click to enlarge* well, if you're meaning really old sets, than i agree with you, but a lot of the sets from the very late 1970s and onwards are still very nice. this set just isn't a good example, that's all. oh, and i also agree with you about that police boat. however, the newer one in the city line is also great, imo. the only thing that weighs against it is the giant size, which makes it feel awkward in more classic towns. edited by grevious, 03 august 2008 - 06:30 pm.

-1 lol! i can't help but smile everytime i see the quote on this thread..... don't worry these police are armless! lol

0 so, you've been bitten by the classic bug too, sinner. great review; but one would think arms would come in handy (pun intended) when you are a police officer, right? it's a shame that many of the original figs must now be forced to stand looking like they have their hands in their pockets, eh? i have no idea where i was going with that last sentence...

1 great review mariko! this set is way before my time too. i like how lego used to create simple one story houses instead of the really tall house that we see in today's town theme, such as 8403 city house. one story houses such as 345 just look more realistic to my eyes. the simplistic, minimalism vibe that i get with this set is something that is hard to find in today's much more detailed sets (although, trust me, i love love love today's detailed sets). - the brick is epic

1 nice review! i haven't built yellow castle for many years, but i do remember the fun i had building it when i was young... yellow castle just opened up an entire new world for me... also, i liked all the alternate models on the box :od wish i still had that...

1 great review. it is nice to see an in-depth photo review of this set. i especially love the last picture of your old city! it certainly does bring back memories...

0 question for you guys, what's the best way to clean lego? i was noticing that the baseplates and gray plates to this set are very dusty and could use a good cleaning. mild soap water soak? is there a better way?

0 i guess it's easiest to put the entire shield on a transparent sticker and cut the edges. i would also do that with the white stickers, because now you can still see the gray edges of the shield. perhaps you can make a bigger black, or brown in the other case, outline. you also wouldn't be able to see if the sticker is exactly in the middle...

1 as stated in the first post, over 2 years ago, yes, it is. this is a wonderful review, the brickster, and this would truly be a great set to own. *wub* ~peace

1 great review! the set is really nice, i love that the front of the motercycle can turn and the engine is just beautiful, with its half stacked bricks like kieldaman said. the price used or new is quite a bit, but there is a good variety of bricks here like the bricks inside the wheels. did you get this set from your father? great review luxorv!

1 wow, talk about illegal connections, eh? great review. i really like this set, even for its age

1 thanks for the feedback guys! indeed this is a great set, and i'm very attached to it. as far as i remember, i got it for say my 2nd birthday, i think but it is not my first lego set. you'll learn more on this in my next planned review

1 luxorv, this is a well written presentation on this lego vintage review. i never knew the existence of this set and even though the design is not part of the modern lego design concept but the overall appeal back in the 1970s certainly appeal to many. i could not mind to own such vintage lego model and put them on display and potray as if it was a chart of evolution of lego motorbikes. thanks for sharing and i can't wait to find out your next review.

1 thanks 'luxorv' for this review of such a classic old lego set and i do remember seeing these in a catalogue years ago. excellent brick-built police cycle, i think it's time lego did another one eh ? brick on ride on everyone !

1 thanks, luxor, for bringing us this excellent tour round an old classic! for its time, this is truly a remarkably detailed and beautiful set, and i think it's amazing how it's still in such good condition after all this time. do you have any more from this era (excepting the harley, of course )? i've created a whole new index to put them in

1 kieldaman, on 10 july 2011 - 11:43 am, said: rare classic sets are always a priceless part of any lego collection, and it's a good thing you still have this first set of yours luxor (or did you purchase a new one?). excellent review btw, it's always a pleasure getting a closer look at these classic sets which i wouldn't have known to exist had i not seen this review. overall i think it's a really good set at that time, of course judging this one by modern standards won't be fair but at the time i'm pretty sure it was a 'cool' set to have (though less cooler than having the harley davidson set). thanks kiel. i can grant you that's the same old one i got as my first set. i'm very glad to have it lightningtiger, on 10 july 2011 - 12:21 pm, said: thanks for the review 'luxorv', an interesting old set, though i find it hard to imagine a square smoke stack instead of roundish. it truly has that classic lego simplistic build with all studs showing and making do with standard partsm except the few you havepointed out 'luxorv'. a nice flashback 35 years ago....now thats old school anyway brick on everyone ! indeed, this set must be valued in relation to its own time and style. i was considering making an 'updated' version with current parts, but i'm not sure if/when i'll have the time for it. rufus, on 10 july 2011 - 07:09 pm, said: thanks, luxor, for bringing us this excellent tour round an old classic! for its time, this is truly a remarkably detailed and beautiful set, and i think it's amazing how it's still in such good condition after all this time. do you have any more from this era (excepting the harley, of course )? i've created a whole new index to put them in interesting that you had to create a new index for them , but these two are the only ones i have for now. maybe other members will be ble to contribute to it in the future

1 thank you very much for this wonderful review! this is the oldest lego set in my collection. i received this model from my grand parents many years ago - i'm not exactly sure who in my family it used to belong to, but it has a home with me now. it's a very simple but attractive looking vehicle, and functions pretty well too. overall, very nice.

1 thanks for the great nostalgic review! great pictures, i love the shiny glow of 37 year old bricks! sets were simpler back then, but not less exciting in their own way. i wasn't even born in 1973, but one of my first sets was the 1982 update of this, 6630 bucket loader. almost 10 years later, but the very same bucket assembly, only the colours have changed.

0 woah. 25 cents for a mint condition set! that's amazing.

0 well, it's not exactly a large shuttle, but still a nice set: 442 space shuttle year released: 1979 piece count: 79 minifigs: 1 vehicles: 0 list price: unknown this little classic was my smallest classic space set. believe it or not, i still have the box: here's the back: the instructions are pretty tattered and missing a section. i had to download some from the web: but the ship is again intact, missing only one grey 1x3 plate: i've always liked this computer piece: here's the under side. this set included the small classic jet engines: a close-up of the sloped printed space brick: and the complete set with minifig: this set was a great little space ship that made a nice addition to the blue space theme. as small as it was, it could hold two-three figs (one standing up). i don't even think the mars mission recon drop ship holds three figs. in any case, it was a must-have for blue space fans, and probably only a few bucks back in the day. swoosh!

1 it's simply amazing how far lego has come in 30 years.

1 this was my first space set ever!! 1979, 1980... don't know anymore, but i do remember i got this together with 897 for my birthday when we where camping... with a little luck i may even have an old film from my dad, opening the boxes... well what to say... it looked soooooo aggressive with those two engines! but i never knew why you needed two steering wheels on it... they probably just thought a symmetrical model was better .... i can't blame them... what a nice set.... it would even sell today, no doubt... looooots of swooshability...

1 nice!!! 442 is the lowest set number i have seen for any classic space set, so it must been released with the first wave in 1978. its remarkable that a lego spaceship this old and small can seat more figs than the much bigger mx-71 recon dropship of today. anyway, i just want to grab it out of the screen and swoosh it all over the place, lol. tlg, please make these classic space sets again! i promise i'll buy many!

1 very brave to give an impression about one of the oldest sets ever reviewed! a lot members here are younger than the set itself. i think you will have to have grown up with it to like it. nowadays we have seen quite a few better airplanes than that one, for example this years 7643 . but thanks for letting us know. btw., the 1x1 round brick with the solid stud is no. 3062a instead of 3062b (with the hollow stud).

0 great review, it's good to see some of the old sets reviewed. i think i learned something about the history of lego from this one.

1 outstanding review of a very special set! i actually remember seeing this set on the store shelves of local department stores. can you believe it? fantastic review walter. i really enjoy looking at these vintage sets. this one deserves a blog!

0 thebrickster, on jul 4 2008, 04:14 am, said: a close-up of the alpha-1 rocket. the white bricks never stayed together well often times coming apart within your hands: huh, did they not think of putting a technic axle down the center of the rocket? come to think of it, when were technic axles invented.... its a neat little set, makes me think i oughta make some similar kinda layout in ldd, very elegant for playability.

1 ahh, the good old days. thanks for the review.

1 hey eb'ers, i got my market street on monday and finished building it last night. i know it?s not such a nice review like *yoda* did the last times, but i hope you enjoy some of the pics. first a pic of the complete building: the 3 minifigs: and i pic of the stairs (one of my highlights at this set): more pics you can find here my opinion about the set: i like this set very much, it was really fun to build it. i?m happy that that i got some more cherries and a croissant now *sweet* , a funny idea is the salad in the one box at the front. i think normally it?s a hairpiece of an exoforce fig. i also like the colours of the house, the dark blue is sooooo nice. i think i have to take more of this soon. the lighter blue is also nice. this set has really nice details like the stairs, or the owl at the entry of the market, or the balcony. i paid 89,99 eur, a fair price for a really nice set!! greetings sandra

-1 thanks for the great review! *sweet* now that i've seen the set, i'm afraid i'm a bit disappointed 8-| 1) the color combination doesn't really do it for me. blue, dark blue, grey, black, tan, white, they're all mixed together without any over all design... 2) is there any interior? it doesn't look like it, and in any case, you can only reach it if you remove the modules... hm... |-/ now it looks too much of a box... 3) there are most certainly some nice ideas in this model and some great parts. the best part of the model is the staircase 4) i don't think he spent much time in thinking about the design. as apo said, the chimneys on top of a garage is kinda weird, there's also a gate, next to another gate which is weird as well... also, if this is supposed to ba a grocery, then the owner has done a lot to hide it. the croissant is nice, but next to the brown box with vegies, there's nothing that suggests this is a shop... 5) the white lamp and the the yellow cylinder are at the same level of the tiles. imo it should be above the level of the tiles... 6), imo not worth the 90 euro edited by snefroe1, 20 june 2007 - 09:03 am.

1 i'm not much of a city fan but this looks great. i guess this is the closest we can get to legoland (miniland) quality sets. and considering this is a three floro, small structure, and it's over 1,000 parts, just imagine (pun not intended) how many peices are in ll california's empire state building or wtc freedom tower models! both are large and in real scale over 100 floors! that's a lot of bricks. anyways, i've got a friend who loves city. i'm sure this one would make a great addition to his town setup! gotta tell him about this new set! *y*

0 it was the same thing in france in the middle-age... happy that today this taxe is gone! :-d

1 hi all! i just got my first gentle giant sw maquette and i?m in love *wub* *wub*! it looks so coooool ...... *y*! here?s some facts: height: 13.8 cm color: black 8-? helmet: non removable #?s made: 500 pieces sold at: blister event tokyo june 16, 2007 and now some pictures: i will crush you with my left bigtoe x-d! on the catwalk x-d! now i just have to wait for my boba fett, luke skywalker and get the stormtrooper & darth vader ..... >:-)! on my shelf on copmike

1 very nice *wub* how'd you get a hold of it?

1 thats so cool! i would want one. it would look good in the house. -zots

1 wow, if the tru 6212 is to be believed, the luke marque costs $50. but that looks so cool. definitely a keeper.

-1 the lightsabers are strangely skinny. do they light up or something? or was the transparent plastic too expensive to make thick blades? :-/ :-p

1 hi, you are right, this is such a fantastic maquette. i really hope that i will get the chance to own the other 4, too. it is carefully packed in styropor. the painting is nice, looks really evil. i think it is a wonderful addition (with the 4 other) to any collector shelf..(-; mine is number 276. greetings hendrik

1 damn you for making me want these now! seriously, these look amazing and would look great on any bookshelf.

1 wow thats so cool mutley. my favourites are darth vader and luke skywalker because the others seem to have funny looking heads. not so much boba fett but the storm trooper and the blackhole stormtrooper do. it must be their helmets. edited by roncanator, 02 december 2009 - 08:29 am.

1 well, now that i have some money, a trip to toysrus was obviously in my future, especially since my local tru has much of the summer 2007 lineup. when i got there, almost all the smaller castle sets had been sold out, but there was one left: the one i am now reviewing for both eurobricks and bzpower. ;-) the box: well, for starters, the castle theme boxes are beautiful! the blended clear and stormy skies give a great ?clash of the titans? effect, and the action poses help as well. ;-) the back is equally nice, featuring a photo showing kids how to use the crossbow, and the brave axe wielder taking a swipe at the skeleton (foolish soldier, that won?t work on skellies! see later on in the review to find out why). and of course, we have a small box with the link to the official lego website, where tlc can advertise even more lego sets! :p the contents: after opening the box, a single bag of pieces (with a couple loose ones), the instruction manual and necessary catalog ( :-p ), and a new wider rubber band holder spilt out. the instruction manual is clear as a bell. no color trouble here, folks! also, it?s worth mentioning the nice background with the mountain and king?s castle silhouettes. :-) sorry that there's no picture, but i'll take one if someone wants to see it. ;-) the pieces: for being a 5 dollar set (well, seven in my case. darn your above average prices, tru!), crossbow attack features a lot of nice pieces (as does the entire castle lineup). notable elements include two large brown spoked wheels, two brown modified 1x1?s, a pearl gold slope end, and six dark blue modified 1x1x2/3 slopes! the bulk of the pieces, however, are nothing special. i?ll let the picture do the talking for this. the accessories are by far the best parts in this kit. two different helmets in a beautiful shiny silver are my favorite, but i also really like the scythe (looks good for mocing) and the round shield ( *wub* ), which are both brand new parts. and can anyone not love the classic axe and crossbows? oh, and there?s a black lightsaber too, but that?s rather boring compared to the other parts. :-p the minifigures: can you say, four figures (including the horse)?! that has to be a record for a regular 5 dollar set, at least in the present age of limited figures per set. we?ll start out with the two crown militia: a regular soldier and an archer. both have old faces, but they look spiffy with the shiny helmets and the superb torsos. i?ll name the soldier bravo the stout and the archer angler the precise, for future references. now we come to the skellie. although some people dislike the new skeleton design, i personally prefer it to the old ones, since the arms are now poseable and the face much meaner. the only problem is that the arms hang too low, but it?s not too noticeable when they have weapons in their hands. and last, but not least, here?s the elusive skeleton horse. i for one am very happy that tlc took advantage of that awesome prototype piece and made it into an official mass-production mold. however, the horse is unfortunately one piece, but since regular lego horses are as well, i don?t have a problem with it. i do have a problem with the pose, however. the legs are in quite an odd position, and i wonder why tlc didn?t make the front and back leg poses symmetrical. ah well. the finished set: i have only two pictures here, since this set is so small. first, here?s the completed crossbow. i must say: finally! no more ridiculous horse mounted catapults or crazy fire wheel launchers! now we have realistic siege weapons, including the one included with 7090. plus, it actually launches okay, although not the best. here?s the other main attraction: the completed skeleton rider and horse. i think it?s rather dramatic with that pose and the dark background, don?t you think? ;-) playability: okay, so there?s not much in this set, but a bit of imagination brings plenty of possibilities. to show you what you can do, here?s a little story made only with this set. ;-) overall rating: presentation: 9/10 pieces: 8/10 minifigures: 9/10 finished model: 8/10 playability: 8/10 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ final score: 8.4/10 crossbow attack is a fine introduction into castle, so i recommend it to any lego fan, whether they are a castle nut or just want a cheap change of pace. tlc has a knack with making great small kits these days, and i more than ever support them in their amazing rebound from their dark ages (between 1997 and 2004). ;-) edited by kimt, 10 august 2008 - 01:33 pm.

-1 thanks for this review, and that great little comic! about the skellies though (x-d), you have to admit that besides their long arms making the skellie legs look out of proportion, that they're just made poorly. they're sticking straight out, as opposed to every other fig, which have a slight bend to make them look more natural. also, as i'm sure you've noticed, the pegs are on angles! that makes it impossible for them to hold their weapons straight, and they can't even put their arms over their heads without stressing the plastic some... i mean they're dead. well, at least undead, they're not supposed to be stiff, and personally i like the ragdoll look more, it makes them seem more dead :-p

1 a very nice review with good pictures, thanks grevious. *y* and undead ragdolls on! :-p

1 nice review, and great little story. :-d *y* look at the normal horses, their legs are positioned like that too. only the skellie horse's legs are touching, so as to strengthen the middle, otherwise it could easily snap in half. also, i think the new skeletons are nice, their head is awesome, i just don't see why tlc couldn't make the bent droid arms with the hand facing vertically, instead of making a new arm design completely straight.

0 thanks for all the comments, guys, and thank you, joem16 and iamded for pointing out the reason for the skeleton horse leg positioning. ;-) well, i'll be gone on vacation until the 16, but i may pick up a set or two while down in tenessee, so if i do, expect a review and another story when i get back! ;-)

1 thanks very much for that review. i downloaded the instructions last week and i was largely impressed with what was in it. however, like holodoc, i am waiting for the bulldozer. i might have to settle with the dino though if lego charge australian some absurd price... edit: i just watched the videos. thanks! they are great. the dino is better than i thought... edited by sinner, 10 july 2007 - 02:29 am.

1 ickelpete, on jul 9 2007, 11:19 pm, said: first lets start with the box which is much larger than it needs to be!! pete no lego box is too big my friend x-d ;-) nice review *y* as for the set... i don't like the colors myself (surprised? x-d ), and it seems a little blocky. otherwise, the set is cool. i really like the head.

0 ugly. as. hell. but an awesome parts pack, worthy of purchase.

-1 the box is has really strange dimensions - it's very flat but has a large front - the 1:1 scale. regarding the spines, because they're made of the softer non-abs plastic (the stuff the 1994 cutlasses and brown muskets were made of), they lose their shape a bit and so are hard to grip; they simply fall off. i suppose tlc use loads of different colours because a single or two-colour dino isn't very nice to look at, especially when the surface isn't very smooth - it takes your eyes away from the surface and puts it on the colours. someone should make an all terrain dino that can walk everywhere from this set - i don't have the skill with technic - i always end up layering and never finish any models. :-(

1 thanks for the nice review. it's butt ugly to me but the motors + ir control seem pretty neat ! even at that high price, it looks like a good parts pack ! *sweet*

1 i didn't spot this great review earlier. thanks for the effort of posting all those pics and videos, they helped me decide that this set is worth getting.

1 great review, i must admit i didn't like mm at first site, but seeing this review and looking at the mm boxes at stores appeal to me rather greatly, i may get a couple of these sets, great job! *y* :-)

0 i've got it also, but i think i'll replace the ball joint pieces with the kind of pieces that give the wings their angle.

1 i like the dropship kit and got this. now that i built it i see so many things i can do to tweak it to make it a moc. i think this is a set everyone mm fan should get.

-1 of course, right before i post this i see that ickelpete reviewed this set earlier in the week. sorry for being redundant but it is already written so here ya go: monster dino reviewed by dunamis set 4958 792 pieces $89.95 from lego online store build time 3.5 hours here we go with another offering from the creator line. i?m kind of fond of these sets as they are pretty imaginative and usually have instructions for multiple models. i like the reusability of all the pieces and the varied things you can build. the box: the box that lego shipped this thing in was absolutely huge! when i first got this in the mail, i thought i had won the lottery and they had shipped the ucs falcon early. once i opened the shipping box, i was surprised to see an unusually large creator set box. the box itself is pretty standard creator type box but this one shows off the power functions prominently on the right side of the box. the back of the box shows some of the motorized features as well. opening the box is a matter of breaking two seals. we?re back to the reusable cereal box type tab system for those of you who stay up a night wondering about lego?s next box design. inside the box we have a bunch of sealed bags. immediately the power brick, remote and motors stand out as they are each in individual bags. also, there are three manuals. the manuals: the three manuals are 76, 76 and 56 pages in length. they are laid out well and are pretty standard with all the usual trimmings: - piece call outs for each step - parts inventory at the end of the primary model build - page numbers color separation in these manuals were fine for me. interestingly, the instructions for the primary build took a full manual plus about a quarter of another manual. random manual photos: parts list i?ll explain a bit more below, but it would have been nice to have some written documentation on all the functions of the motors, remote and receiver. such as motor load guidelines and specific explanations of all the remote control functions. it is severely lacking in this area. the pieces: obviously, the pieces we?re most interested in are these new motors and wireless remote control. note that before you fire this bad boy up, you had better byob. since this is prominently a european community, i had better clarify my acronyms. over here across the pond, byob usually means ?bring your own beer?. in this case, it still means bring your own beer (i?m on my second heineken right now) but in addition to numerous bottles of beer you will need a total of nine batteries to get through this set. i kid you not: anyway, there are two motors (a small and a large) each with its own very unique name according to the manual; the smaller one is called ?motor? and the larger one is called ?xl motor?. very creative indeed! the battery box takes six aa batteries and there are two compartments to hold them. here is the first: that seems pretty normal. however, the back side of it holds the other three batteries and it seems to be very poorly designed: note in the photo above where the bottom battery is placed. compare it to the previous photo and you will see the difference. i played around with trying to get that bottom battery out and you better pack a lunch (or byob) because it is no small task! why couldn?t they make this compartment just like the other side? there is a single power cord connector and a three position switch. the middle position turns the power off and the other two positions seem to provide the same functionality in either position as far as i can tell. perhaps a little blurb in the manual would have been nice to clear things up a bit. the remote takes three aaa batteries. it is fairly small and lightweight even with the batteries installed. it has two thumb controls which could be levers if you insert technic bars or even pins. the two controls are color coded and match the plugs on the receiver to control two separate motors. in addition, there is a four position switch which i assume changes the channel. finally, there are two tiny levers that seem to have no function. i?m not sure if they are a trim control or variable speed control. i messed with them and didn?t notice any difference in the motor speed. again, some documentation from the incredibly verbose lego manual would have helped. as far as the rest of the parts, it?s really a mixed bag. there are a lot of varied parts in this set to the point that there is almost one of everything. lots of technic gears, pins, studded beams, studless beams, axles, wheels, etc. also, lots of little 1x1 slopes in various colors, teeth, horns, etc. you can?t really say it is a parts pack because there is not enough of one thing to make it a parts pack. a couple of notes: it seems the quality control issue on the axles has been fixed. i initially reported this back when i reviewed the 8285 about a year ago. all the axles worked fine for me. the color quality control issue is still alive. check out the different shade of red in these two parts: also included is the sound brick. this looks just like the other sound or light-up bricks we have been seeing lately. it does have a load dinosaur ?roar!? sound embedded in it though so hide the younglings if they are a bit on the skittish side. finally, i?ve never seen one of these before (although someone will no doubt rattle off a dozen sets where you can find this part in about 5 seconds): no, i am not referring to the studded beam, i put that in the photo for scale. the build: the build was fun and was fairly straightforward. as i mentioned, there is a lot of technic parts, so if you are not a fan of the technic line you should run, not walk away from this one. there were no gotchas to speak of, but you need to pay careful attention to the placement of the wires that go from the motors to the receiver. they kind of sneak them around a bit so watch closely. otherwise, it was fine. here is what is left over: so far, i have only built the primary model. as seen on the box, there are instructions for two more models. both of the other models seem less complex than the primary model and are likely quicker builds. the dino took me about 3.5 hours which included some time to screw around with the motors. i?m an old school technic fan from way back in the 80?s so i had some familiarity with the old technic motors. obviously, 25+ years has improved some things and these seem much more powerful. the design: if you have built the 4507 prehistoric creatures then some of the design will feel familiar, especially the head and tail. it is almost like they took the dinosaur from that set and figured out how to motorize it. this is not necessarily a bad thing, just a comment. the set does a good job of showing off the features of the new motors and remote. it is nice to see how one motor can perform multiple functions. in this case, the small motor makes both arms move and opens and closes the mouth of the dinosaur. when the mouth is completely open, it pushes the activation switch on the sound brick which emits the ?roar!? sound. pretty cool. the ?xl motor? handles the walking feature of the dinosaur. there is both forward and reverse. forward works really well while the reverse just makes the dinosaur look like he is doing a michael jackson moon walk. (wow, i never thought i would use michael jackson?s name in a lego dinosaur set review!) it is almost like the dinosaur can?t get traction going in reverse. however, as noted previously forward works really well. this guy actually gets going at a pretty good clip. as you might expect, he kind of waddles like a duck since there is no articulation in the knees. it is a bit awkward but it works. the ?xl motor? seems to kick out plenty of power. overall, the design seems to be a mixed bag. the way the tail is attached seems to be an afterthought. the arms look to be too small. however, the walking mechanism and legs/feet are pretty cool as well as the head and mouth. i guess it is a reasonable effort to get people introduced to the parts and we?ll see designs improve as time goes on. here are a few views of our new friend: but what about the at-at??? of course, the real reason you are reading this is that you hope i will have some epiphany on how all this relates to the new walking at-at. judging from the box on the at-at, it looks like we get one motor. i don?t see the remote which is a disappointment as i hope it is not controlled by a switch on the body and you either turn the at-at on or off. if that is the case, the first thing i am doing is scavenging the receiver and remote from this set to add to the at-at. granted, it could be that it comes with a remote but is just not seen on the box. also, the at-at box looks like one of the images shows that the head turns. i sure hope this is controlled separately as it would be really lame to not be able to control this independently from the walking feature. i?m kind of skeptical on the walking feature of the at-at. i suspect it will be rather cumbersome but hopefully i will be pleasantly surprised. needless to say, this is all speculation but those are my initial thoughts based on this set. overall thoughts: it?s an ok set. kind of pricy but i suspect a large part of that is due to the motors and remote. i haven?t built the other two models (they seem less interesting to me) but at least it has some variability. also, you get a ton of different parts which can either be a good thing or bad thing depending on what you are looking for. the dinosaur is average. the color selection is marginal (black and lime green?) and the tail section is just lame. i appreciate it more for the mechanical functions and how the motorized parts work. it does do a good job of waking up my dog who seems pretty irritated by it. it is a nice set to show off to the neighbors or the endless caravan of my wife?s friends that seem to materialize out of nowhere. people are quickly impressed by it and then promptly move along once you start trying to explain how it all works. i?m a bit disappointed that the manual did not explain more about the remote and motor functions. i suspect that there is more than meets the eye and i?ll just have to play around with it to find out. it would be nice if lego had a website that showed all the cool functions of the motors and remotes so we fully understand the capabilities. final rating: 72% build 9/10 (pretty quick and fun. the mechanical part is cool) functionality 6/10 (it is a creator set so you have multiple builds. as far as it being a dinosaur, it?s just ok. motorized parts are cool though.) design 6/10 (partly cloudy. some things are cool, others are lame.) parts 8/10 (new motors and remote are cool. lots of varied parts included but nothing to write home about.) price 7/10 (it is kind of expensive) edited by whitefang, 23 may 2009 - 06:23 pm. indexed

1 impressive review! really clear photos too! thanks. dr. s.

1 ickelpete, on jul 13 2007, 11:06 pm, said: great review dunamis i hope you have as much fun with this as i have. one point yes they are new axles they have appeared in a few sets this year. yes, the kids seem to love it (as you pointed out) and the wife still thinks i am crazy so it's all good. i read your review after i posted mine. seems like we shared the same thoughts on a majority of it. i always think it is good to have multiple opinions on sets as it gives the community more data points to evaluate a given set.

1 tks once again dunamis for a great in-depth review ;-) i really look forward to your supped up and moded at-at :-p i am really not found of the design but i think its still a nice parts pack, especially with all these nice "power function" elements ;-) *yoda*

1 wow...that set is really something. but i prefer pehistoric power, and triceratops. or are they the same? i can never tell.

1 awesome reveiw, thanks! i gotta get this one!!! *y* *wub*

1 i kind of like the design of this, but more importantly i really want to get my hands on the power functions motors and ir control system. i'd prefer the 8275 technic bulldozer, but there's no way i can stretch to the ?100 price tag, so i was thinking i would have to see if i could get a 4958 monster dino cheap in the january sales. then two things happened today. firstly i saw the dino in tescos reduced from ?70 to ?55. then my wife said she'd buy it for me for christmas. wow! that's never happened to me before. i love my wife! *wub* can't wait till christmas now!

0 ickelpete, on nov 4 2007, 06:41 pm, said: if you really want the power functions the bulldozer is better value as you get two large motors, two small motors and two receivers compared to the one in the dino set alos watch toysrus and argos both have had the bulldozer for ?70-75 in there pre christmas sales usually for a week only i am hopeing they will be on sale soon as i want a second bulldozer to get some more motors. thanks for the tip, but even ?70-75 is too much right now. ?55 was just about affordable, but now my wife's buying for me it's going to cost me zero zilch zip nada nothing which is even sweeter! x-d

1 i ended up buying a misb set recently from a lego collector who is clearing up his collection. excellent set to get the ir remote and ir receiver and other motors without paying insane amounts for the bulldozer now. there is a quite a number of parts in power miner lime green and 1x1 white teeth plate for the mouth and claws. the dino alone has 20 teeth in its mouth the glow in the dark "antennas" on the backbone of the dino is a nice touch as you can let him walk in the dark somewhat. i do agree with the reviewer, the box is insanely huge!!! i don't think lego wanted to show a 1:1 scale dino, they just wanted to promote the power function stuff as large as possible. also, the remote is smaller than shown in the picture as the hand holding it i think is smaller.

1 this is both my first set review and post about a star wars set- (even though i have been collecting them since '99). i got this one early this year so i thought i would post a review on it. please bare with me- i am not a great photographer. so with that in mind, here goes! front of the box: 75083 at-dp box-front by whitesidewjw, on flickr back of the box: 75083 at-dp box- back by whitesidewjw, on flickr shot of the bags: 75083 at-dp bags by whitesidewjw, on flickr the sticker sheet (i normally don't apply them, but for this i am going ahead and putting them on): 75083 at-dp sticker sheet by whitesidewjw, on flickr minifigs- i really like the two at-dp pilots, but the best agent kallus really does shine. of course we get an extra stormtrooper: 75083 at-dp minifigs by whitesidewjw, on flickr no new molds in this as far as i can tell, however these printed 4x4 domes are really great. i can see lots of uses for these in space mocs. 75083 at-dp new printed elements by whitesidewjw, on flickr bag#1 complete- nothing earth shattering here- an easy build: 75083 at-dp bag #1 complete by whitesidewjw, on flickr bag #2 complete: 75083 at-dp bag #2 complete cockpit seats by whitesidewjw, on flickr cockpit assembly: 75083 at-dp cockpit assembly by whitesidewjw, on flickr bag #2 complete 75083 at-dp bag#3 complete by whitesidewjw, on flickr "foot" assembly"- i like how they positioned the slopes 75083 at-dp "foot" assembly by whitesidewjw, on flickr complete at-dp 75083 at-dp complete by whitesidewjw, on flickr complete at-dp-side view 75083 at-dp side view (complete) by whitesidewjw, on flickr complete at-dp- over view 75083 at-dp complete- overview by whitesidewjw, on flickr complete at-dp rear view 75083 at-dp rear view by whitesidewjw, on flickr extra pieces 75083 at-dp extra pieces by whitesidewjw, on flickr the verdict: minifigs- 5/5- we get a total of four figs. i like the two at-dp pilots and agent kallus is a well done minifig. i can complain about another storm trooper either parts- 3/5- other than the dome pieces i commented on before, there is really not any new parts in this. if you build space, star wars, or machinery, this will still be a welcome assortment. experience of build 4/5- this really was a fun build. it came together fast but was challenging enough for its target age group. playability 5/5- this thing is much more sturdy than it looks. the legs take a little bit of effort due to the double locking hinges but hold together very well.this is a very minor complaint. value 4/5- typical- $49.99 for 500 pieces- i must admit i paid a little more than msrp due to shipping but i can't complain about the value. overall: 21/25- i really believe this is one of the best walkers that lego has designed. the only changes i would make would be adding real control panels in the cockpit and it would be nice if lego made a real widow to fit in with these types of builds rather than a transparent tile over another plate. all in all, i would recommend this set and i hope the rest of the 2015 star wars sets are on par with this.

1 thanks for the early review! i don't know much about the rebals show at all, but i can say that the over all design of the walker really appeals to me and the minifigs look top notch. i also like how the spring shooters are pretty much hidden in the frame, nice job!

1 thanks for the review. cannot wait for the 2015 sets.

0 thanks for the review! i have two questions: - what is the driver standing on, when the hatch is open and he is looking out? - could you show the face of kallus without helmet, please? my only complaint is that the colours of both, kallus's and the drivers's uniforms are wrong. kallus's uniform is way too dark and should be more dark olive than black, and the drivers's uniforms are too bright and should be more greyish compared to what we saw in the series.

0 i built this set and i think the two rubber pieces holding the both sides of the face is a bit stretched out therefore making the set somewhat tight for entire top hatch to open and close. does anyone have the same situation? is this right? -------------- never mind i got it! i built the back a stud too long! edited by namioik, 29 december 2014 - 03:04 am.

0 the legs are about 2" shorter than the at-at; its cockpit is a little larger than the at-at's "head;" it doesn't look out of place as an escort-type walker or heavy walker, especially as both are built in the same style, although if scale differences really bother you the most recent at-st is probably a better bet for you. edited by hjmediastudios, 29 december 2014 - 04:32 pm.

0 thanks for the review and pics. this is a really nice looking walker. one question - how snug are the at-dp drivers sitting in their seats? the cockpit looks good. actually i'm not crazy about the at-dp helmets on the show but i dig the minifigs! good stuff. awesome facial hair for kallus!

1 a great review of an obviously fantastic set. a must-have for 2015! thanks!

1 firstly, great review ++++++ i was really on the fence on this one. this review has greatly changed my view on this modular. a definite buy for me. love the interiors and the whole concept. the more i see it the more i see the little features which put this set apart or at least slightly different from the others. of course great playability for the younger lot and i think a nice building to give any lego city more character and colour...

1 wow, that is the best start to a review i have ever seen. great job oky, amazing set, i'll be picking it up this weekend!

0 can you please take some pictures/explain how the water tower is built? i understand that there are some tank treads bot how exactly? and it is "there can be only one"! edited by yooha, 01 january 2015 - 07:14 pm.

1 looking forward to picking up this set on saturday :-) nice review, love the tiny details and the printed parts.

-1 thelazychicken, on 01 january 2015 - 06:14 pm, said: great review! the intro was great, but i'm still not convinced on this one. the height seems too small for comparison with the rest of the modulars. the play features are ok but i wish it would have been taller. totally agree with you, the height does seem rather small. also 2x buildings on a 32x32 base-plate with a lots of spare studs behind the buildings are these buildings 12 studs in width?. it still looks great style wise, however this might be a set i buy and look at it after i have built it & regret the amount of $$$ i have spent on it. $239 for us aussie's . edited by snaplock, 01 january 2015 - 07:42 pm.

1 this modular building will be my next set! thanks for the review!

0 thank you for the review, it was very interesting and changed my opinion of the set, i'm now considering a future purchase ^^. just one question: the mirror is on cardboard? i was hoping for it to be a window piece with a mirror on one side.. i hope it's not the same cardboard we had on some of the early harry potter sets or the element won't last long

0 snaplock, on 01 january 2015 - 07:40 pm, said: totally agree with you, the height does seem rather small. also 2x buildings on a 32x32 base-plate with a lots of spare studs behind the buildings are these buildings 12 studs in width?. it still looks great style wise, however this might be a set i buy and look at it after i have built it & regret the amount of $$$ i have spent on it. $239 for us aussie's . both are are 14 deep on the upper floors. do is 3 studs deeper on the ground floor, buit that's pretty much it. can't believe how cramped the upper floors of the barber shop look. we've come a long way from the wide and empty halls of cc and gg.

1 thanks for the review! i'm a fan of the set but will be modding quite a bit. have to get a small bar into the highlander and then turn the second/third story above the barber shop into a proper apartment. the detective's office is great and will stay as is!

1 awesome review, and an awesome set. what are the different shades of blue? i know there's dark and medium blue, but what's the other blue? locutis

0 natelite, on jul 15 2007, 12:20 pm, said: seems like they infuse system sets with more technic bars. must be that technic isn't selling too well and they want to educate ppl how cool technic can be. :-p it's quite apparent when even the small bike needed technic frame. my guess it's less expensive and complicated to produce. they're also using these parts in other themes, so in the end, they're producing a smaller catalog of bricks but every part gets produced in larger quantities.

0 this set is truely incredible, a must have. but this set is also incredibly overpriced *n* ! com' on it's only a big vehicle , nothing really special to justify the near 100? price tag. this set is clearly worth something like 65? at max. look at the incredible dropship for 34?, that's a good value for money! *y* edited by mutex, 15 july 2007 - 04:57 pm.

1 awesome review, if i pick up any mm sets, it will definately be this one!

0 i echo the consensus of this thread - too much technic, looks great, too expensive, looks great.

0 say, i was looking at your pics and then at the instructions and i just realised : haven't you put the stikers on the shield thingies in the middle upside down? i think you did :-d i don't know if i like those new sets, though... i mean they have great shapes and potential, but at the same time, they seem so holey... they're really huge and big but full of empty air and space as well... well, this one not as much, and indeed it is the best looking set of the lot, though... but i don't think i'll go into that line...

1 great review, wonderfully detailed. don't care for the ship at all. it's that 'technic under a hollow shell' thing like the ctt. if it wasn't for the figures, i would have hated it, and nothing about these figures excites me. i'll end up finding the least number of sets possible to provide at least one of each figure for the general population collection and skip the rest (unless they do as i expect and flop here, thus leading to huge discounts). i like this set ... at half off. ;-)

1 the life on mars theme was so much better, with the aliens dominating mars instead of the humans. and the aliens were so much better, with their own names etc. good times. anyway, i think this is the best set in the series. it looks so neat and reminds me of the pelican form halo. x-d edited by iamded, 31 august 2007 - 05:11 am.

0 lego 41062 elsa's sparkling ice castle lego managed to get a frozen licensed set in the new wave of disney princess sets. however, i'm very surprised by the size. it's a $40 set and comes in a small friends-style box (roughly 12"x12" size) - i almost didn't see it on the shelf when i was looking for it because it's so small. i mean, i know it's only $40 but it's a friggin' castle. and why did lego only make this a smaller set? if they'd made a $200 frozen castle they still would have sold every one they could produce. they made big harry potter hogwarts sets and those sure sold. and have you seen the toys in the frozen section of stores? huge playsets for barbie-sized dolls. but i suppose i'm getting the cart before the horse here, reviewing before i've even opened the box. so..... name: elsa's sparkling ice castle set number: 41062 pieces: 292 price: $39.99 minifigs: 3 theme: disney princess year of release: 2015 links: bricklink peeron brickset the box the front of the box is standard lego fare, other than the large anna and elsa in the bottom right corner. oh, and surprisingly, nowhere on the box is the normal minifig lineup. the only way to know what characters are included is to look at the set pictures. the 1:1 this set uses one of the minidolls as the actual size sample. that's probably not a bad choice since the minidolls are not nearly as well known as a minifig. the back on the back, the play features are shown in insets around a rear view of the castle. like friends sets, you also have an array of play accessories. the seals is this standard on 2015 sets or is this specific to this set? i've never seen 3 tape seals on a set. even huge modulars or technic sets only have 2, so 3 on a set this small seems excessive. perhaps lego expects people to try to steal the dolls? if so, why bother with extra tape? a tiny pocketknife makes quick work of the tape so the third strip doesn't even slow you down. the contents in the box are 2 instruction booklets (bent), a white plate, a sticker sheet, and 3 numbered bags of parts. the stickers these are very hard to photograph since they're shiny. i mean polished chrome shiny. those dark lines across the corners are not really there, they're reflections of my ceiling. the manual backs the back of one booklet has a friends "win!" girl. the other has an ad for the lego disney princess website. that site is so girly there's even sparkles following your mouse cursor around. so i didn't stay too long or look too deeply. the sample page the interior pages of the manuals are on lavender backgrounds. it's standard lego instructions with part callouts and insets when needed. the build, 1 the first thing you build is anna, but i'm not showing that yet. then you build this little picnic scene. it's tiny but effective, and nice to have something not icy in the set since the movie has the "in summer" song for olaf. i'm curious what's in that sandwich though - green and pink? after the picnic is the olaf build, but i'll save him for later too. the build, 2 next is this small sleigh. it has an amazing amount of style for something so small. the curved front and decorative whips on the back make it look sleigh-like instead of blocky. but come on, it already had pink accents, are the pink flowers really necessary? technically, yes, so the whips can mount to them, but still, it's just over-girly for my taste. the build, 3 the sleigh needs a ramp to help it rocket along (for a couple inches, at least). the ramp starts like this, with a hidden lime green jumper plate that gets a cookie on it. i couldn't remember anything in the movie like that, so i asked my wife and she couldn't either. a hidden cookie under a hill? the build, 4 after putting the tilting 2x8 onto the base and adding decorations, this is the result. a lime green bucket holding a pair of ice skates, a flower (in the snow, really?), green and white round studs that i assume are supposed to be grass and snow? the build, 5 the sleigh looks huge sitting on top of the tiny hill, but it actually works pretty well. assuming you're on a smooth surface like a table, you can give the sleigh a little nudge and it'll shoot down the ramp and a few inches across the table. the unevenness of the slopes vs the blue tiles holds the sleigh in line well, and the bumps in the slopes don't seem to hamper anything. the build, 6 moving on to bag 2.... man that's a lot of colors in this base already. and i'm already starting to feel like there's trans-blue cheese thrown around randomly. the build, 7 continuing (and rotating), some steps and even more colors thrown in. magenta? in elsa's ice palace? i sure don't remember any of that... the build, 8 wait, seriously? an ice cream stand in the castle? that is what the magenta is for? i kinda actually like the looks of it, but it doesn't fit the set. the build, 9 spinning back around, now there's a light aqua spiral staircase added along with a roof. this is where i'm really starting to wonder about lego's thinking. those light aqua stairs, and the light aqua 1x4 tiles, are exclusive to this set (as far as i know... it's possible some other 2015 sets use them, but nothing in bricklink yet). seems expensive (to produce) to me, when there's no huge reason to need them. another blue for the tiles would have been fine. and the spiral stairs? really? elsa's castle is known for staircases, but not spiral ones! there should be a huge straight ice stairway out front or sweeping curved stairs inside, but not a spiral. the build, 10 and now we finish the tree. again, why? where is there a tree next to elsa's castle? and so weird... with ice hanging from green branches that have both snow and flowers on them. huh? did lego watch a different movie? the trans-light blue bits before looking at the upper level, a brief pause to look at some other parts. here's the 1x2x5 brick in trans-light blue and the 2x4x6 rock panel in glitter trans-light blue. do those look like the same blue to you? and again, another unique part for this set. why do those rock panels need to be glitter, when lego made the same panel in trans light blue in 2013 and 2014 for superheroes, friends, and chima sets? apparently disney really wanted glitter, because there are a bunch of trans-glitter parts in the new princess sets. there's trans-neon green cones for jasmine; ariel, jasmine, and sleeping beauty all get glitter trans purple cones. so there's a bunch of new glitter parts for 2015. the build, 11 back to building - time to add the upper level. we get a bedroom with a decent bed, although stickered. the build, 12 the other side of the bedroom has some little accessories. perfume and a crown i assume? the build, 13 time for walls and a roof. i like the small white macaroni bricks for a wall, but what's with the lavender fence piece in the center? i'll grant that it looks nice (a common white fence would have been a little boring), but it's another unique piece to this set. the build, 14 the very top of the castle is built separately. not a whole lot to say here other than why is there a torch in an ice castle? the finished castle once the roof is put on, the castle is done. and that big purple star on top says everything to me about the styling. it just doesn't look like modern lego to me; it looks like this should be an old belville fairy tale set from around 1999. if i saw a photo of just the castle with no figs (or picnic blanket), i'd assume that's what it was. the oops, not actually done yet accessories at the end, there's a few bits left to add. there are these dark purple skis (yup, another unique part) in the lower level. let me tell you, they're a pain to get into that location, at least with my big man hands. more accessories the top level gets a stickered book. the sticker has a nice castle image on it that is, while not quite exactly the castle from disney world, very disney-looking. i actually had to google and see if that's the castle they use in their logo. nope, but it's the same style. the leftovers there are a lot of extra parts in this. that's almost 10% of the part count in the set right there! they are pretty useful overall though. it's great to have an extra "carrot" and brown "branch" for olaf, since you know those will get lost as he's played with. the figs finally, the reason for the set. let's face it, the castle set is just an excuse to make these figures. and they're great. i mean just fantastic. the print on them is just such a good match to the real characters. compare to the cartoon version from the front of the box. elsa's hair is a little darker than the cartoon, but overall these are just dead on. if i had to pick out a flaw, it's the "spell" elsa is holding. it's too bad she can only shoot it forward with her arm down like that. it'd be nice to have the end of the splash part bent 90 degrees so she can have her arm forward and the spell shooting forward too. oh, one other thing. the minidoll heads don't press down tight to the body like minifig heads do. there's still exposed neck. it looks nice, but it means elsa's cape can swing around. the fig backs elsa's cape is glittery on the back and you can see the removable bow in her hair. the full set one final issue. when you put anna on the sleigh, her cape doesn't have enough flexibility (since it's a wraparound kind) and so it folds out funny. that's why on the back of the box it shows her standing on the back of the sleigh with elsa in the seat. edit: how on earth did i forget to comment on those orange flowers to each side of the castle? i'm pretty sure elsa did not have any flowers blooming outside her castle! the conclusion hm. i really wanted to like this set, but i just can't quite bring myself to. it feels like lego pulled a random castle design from the files then redid it into white and trans blue to look icy and allow a frozen tie in set. the figs are great, but the castle isn't. i guess the real castle in the movie would be a boring set and this one has play features, but it just is too different for my taste. the ratings value: 7/10 - $40 for less than 300 parts is high (especially when so many of the parts are tiny, but on the other hand there's a lot of rock panels and 1x2x5 trans blue panels), but the figs help save it. design: 4/10 - not one of lego's best. not as bad as the lows in the 90s, but not a great set. minifigs: 10/10 - possibly even a 12/10. they are the reason to buy the set . playability: 8/10 - there are a bunch of play features, but they actually detract from the design, so i had to knock off a couple points. parts: 7/10 - a bunch of impractical unique parts (how often do you need dark purple skis or a lavender fence piece?) but also a bunch of nice parts if you wanted to make your own icy scene. overall: 7/10 - a great bunch of figs, but i'd recommend not bothering with the manuals. just use the parts to build your own castle that's better.

-1 isn't getting parts in new colors a good thing? it is a shame there is only this one set, i think tlg could make a whole subtheme out of frozen. i do agree that they overuse lavender and magenta, i don't see why every girl set has to have these sort of colors instead of what would be accurate to the source material .

1 thanks for the review mostlytechnic. i too wish they had done a real castle for this set, it certainly deserved it. my sons and i figure they could have used the old rock monster mold from rock raiders in white for the missing snow beast. i will pick it up though for the figs and unique pieces.

-1 thanks for the review! i have the same opinion about the design, looks like belville. i bought it on legostore orlando december 30th. it was impressive. my wife saw them putting on shelf, 8 or 10 boxes. she ran and grabbed the last one! the girls faces around it was indescribable, mix of ecstasy and afraid to loose it. it happened in less than 2 minutes. my 7 yo girl didn't want it. she likes the dresses but hates the movie. prefers lego movie. but my 2 yo girl who never saw the movie grabbed it for good, and we bought it. lego will sell it like water, but i do not understand why a set so small. it is the worst set design since the introduction of lego friends. my 7 yo has more than 50 lego friends minifigures, all the lego fiends stores and concluded that the castle had a terrible design. she is 7!! let's be honest, lego should have released this sets months before this christmas and is loosing a perfect opportunity to sell a decent set, with much more pieces. i am wondering if they are going to make another set with the same characters. at the end,. it is just for the minifigures.

-1 yep, my family all thinks they should have made a bigger set, added figs, and just been printing money. this feels massively rushed into production. which is weird, the other princess sets that just came out look worlds better.

1 i wish elsa had more of a white hairpiece rather than blonde. but it could be worse. not a bad set overall, although olaf doesn't look right without the twigs on his head. anna is a really nice and accurate fig.

1 well, the good news for you is you're in luck whenever you find sets, since the figs sell for a good bit of money :) right now the bricklink value of the 3 figs is about $30!

0 i see the cookie smugglers from the detective's office have already infiltrated other lego themes.......

-1 bennemans, on 13 january 2015 - 06:08 pm, said: there is a very simple reason for the flowers and green-leaved trees; you should remember from the movie it was actually summer when elsa set of the eternal winter true, but all around her ice castle it is all winter. so why are there non-winter bits in this set? doesn't make sense. the picnic is because they wanted a mini-vignette for olaf to fit into, but the rest of the green and flowers don't make sense. tenorikuma, on 13 january 2015 - 09:58 am, said: i'm pretty sure i've gotten other sets recently with three pieces of tape on them. cool, good to know. was wondering but haven't remembered to look when i'm at a store recently. whitefang, on 13 january 2015 - 09:12 am, said: very nice review indeed and i also can't wait for the release of this set. it will be a superb wonderful addition to the lego disney princess theme. thanks for the fp, but "a lovely sweet review?" i thought i bashed this set pretty hard

0 i'm trusting there is something else going on behind the scenes because this should have been a huge set and released in november of 2014 at the latest. maybe we will see more and better frozen sets when the post-christmas consumer spending wave hits. edited by m0dulo, 13 january 2015 - 10:03 pm.

-1 hello everyone, i am back to share with all of you, another of my legends of chima polybags review. it will be pretty comprehensive since the finished built will be quick and will be focusing more of what kind of fun that you can derive from there. this polybag was bought in september 2013, when i visited legoland malaysia and i did not hesitate to put this in my shopping basket. name: 30253 leonidas jungle dragster theme: lego system / legends of chima year: 2013 pieces: 30 minifigs: 1 minifigure price: usd n.a, gbp n.a, euro n.a, sgd n.a resources: brickset, bricklink an original polybag image of the 30253 leonidas jungle dragster back view of the original polybag image of the 30253 leonidas jungle dragster the road scout of the lions tribe this polybag design is definitely plan to be the quickest and fastest dragster to recce enemy front by making a swift scout for the lions tribe. i believe by the sound of the name, jungle dragster, it might just be suitable to use in jungle terrain. well, i don't quite agree that this is a 'dragster' even though it has the kind of open view concept of rolling in fast but it does not have the length of a typical dragster, similar to this town polybag design, for example. still, it is nice to have smaller variants of their vehicular supremacy. instruction manual (front) instruction manual (back) the lego building content with just 30 lego elements, you can be pretty quick to be able to display these laid out content. after the built is completed, these are the remaining spare parts. i am fond of the wheels which are some useful parts, other than that, there are nothing spectacular about it. my name is leonidas and i belonged to the lions tribe do not be mistaken of his name, leonidas to be the king of sparta who led the brave men of 300 spartans warriors to fight to the death against the persians. instead this character is based on the bio resided in lego.com, you will realise that he is aligned with the lions tribe and is a proud lion foot-soldier. he may have that goofy idiotic look but he can be very serious in his commitment to discharging his duties. you are able to observe his nice back view printing which reveal his black and blue sash. leonidas has a dual facial feature to reveal his much serious appearance. leonidas is one of the common characters available in the legends of chima universe. it can be found in a total of five sets. it is a great pity that there is no weapon being made for him in this polybag design which will certainly make a fine addition. the completed built of the jungle dragster this is the main design of the jungle dragster which is very simple looking. there is no distinct fighting capability from the vehicular design and it look just like a regular patrol vehicle. one thing i like about this, is the close distinct colour schema of the lions tribe. other than that, there is nothing special about it. moving off with my jungle dragster to conclude, this polybag is really meant for lego fans or collectors who appreciate legends of chima or wanting to sample the legends of chima theme. it is a very simple built, but yet could form a decent force size for recce purposes before sending in the big arsenals to whack their enemies. either way, i will only suggest you to buy it if you really love this theme at an inexpensive price. otherwise, it is perfectly alright to give this a miss. summary review playability: 4/10 (you need to have more lions tribe vehicles in order to bring the best and fun out of it since this is more of a supporting vehicle.) design: 4/10 (simplistic built of the dragster and main focus is just acquiring the minifigure.) price: 4/10 (bought at about usd$7, which is not an awesome price, so get it if you can get it more than half of this price.) overall: 4/10 (if only you are a huge mega fan of the legends of chima, then you need to get this.) i gave it a "2" based on my review score card. what about yours? i hope every one of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine. comments and criticisms are strongly welcomed. pictures can be found in my flickr.

-1 good and helpful review again, whitefang. i probably have no use for a lionish creature with goofy looks...

1 thanks for this review, i love this set *wub* that batman is great, and i've always loved that awesome scarecrow fig. that new pumpkin is fantastic, i can't wait to get it in the set...how many come with the set? i hope more than two :'-( i love both of those vehicles, this set is a definite buy for me!

1 sinner, on jul 18 2007, 05:19 am, said: that was a great review with loads of excellent pictures. the set is better than i thought. i want to buy one of the new sets as i would love a blue batman, but they are so expensive for australians. i love the new pumpkin heads. the story involved more mini-fig cruelty; excellent! i also liked the scarecrow/crow joke. :-d (one request; please don't say lines like "to the batcopter" next time. that is the old tv series and i hated that. >:-) feel free to tell me to stick my request up my m#g@bl*cks.) sinner, thanks brother! and yes please take your request and stick it...back in your heart where it came from! :-x i know you mean well, but i love the camp!! i purposely put "to the batcopter" and my favorite "the jig is up!" in there because it's so ridiculous. and don't you know requesting me not to do it will only encourage me to do it more? i annoy because i love... *wub* the crow is my favorite part. :-$ i'm happy to be swaying you over to the side of mini-fig suffering >:-) it sucks that your pricing is so different over there. perhaps if you're a good sinner (?) santa will bring you some evil pumpkin heads for christmas. or whoever brings you presents over there...a magical wallabee flying a didjeridoo, i presume... :-p piranha! always my biggest fan. thanks brother. i'm glad i can amuse you. book of the ancients is serious but fabuland housewives will overlap for those who prefer the comedy. i hope book of the ancients is good. i'm re-tooling it right now because i was identifying a lot of cliches, so i threw a lot of plots out the window and re-visited my whole concept. anyway, there will always be quick wacky reviews that will hopefully amuse you. norrington-thanks as always, my buddy. *sweet*

0 nice review. the batcopter is pretty neat, but i prefer scarecrow's bi-plane. quote batsy: we needed to wrap this review up so i used my baterang. bianca: is that really what it's called? batsy: beats me... nooo... it's batarang.

1 tks mate for this brilliant review :-d i loved your batfabuland story !! always fantastic to read like always *sweet* i really love this set and i shall buy 2 copies: one to build as is, and another one for my town loool: regular biplane for the tarmac, and my swat copter ;-) btw, i would have a request: could you post pic(s) of the parts inventory please ;-) many tks in advance !! *yoda*

1 thanks for the review. i'm definitely getting this, mainly becasue it's batman. i love the blue bats, the scarecrow is good as ever, and those new pumpkins are just *wub* . there's a few things i'll mod, but nothing really major. i'll have to wait till i get this to decide properly though.

0 what a fine review and what a funny story, thanks! *y* dark tan and new technic hub.... very interesting. scare the crow on! :-d

1 excellent hinckley *y* *y* *y* ! looks like a nice set - i like the mix of dark batman-pieces and a bit lighter badmans-pieces. batmans new blue headpiece looks a bit off though. i love your stories *wub* - especially now-a-days when i?m a afofl x-d! keep up the work mister! dark tan on copmike

1 7665 review part 2 the second half of the build goes quicker than the first. once you start to add the engines, the ship really begins to take shape. the main body of the ship has a few surprises hidden away under a removable cover. inside you get some retracting guns, a storage box, a little shuttle and space for a droid and figure. here is everything you can fit inside. the guns are concealed behind the side vents. pushing them forward causes the vents to open. closed: and open: the final feature is the passenger area/escape pod. inside is plenty of space for two figures. the pod cleverly attaches by pushing the front section of the ship forward, sliding the pod in, then returning the front. everything locks together and is held securely in place by an elastic band. :-) here's a couple of pictures of the final model. it's not the most beautiful creation ever, but it is an excellent representation of the ship from the film. the angular shape actually suits a lego build well. there's one more useful feature. the whole ship can be safely and comfortably picked up by two ball ended technic pins towards the back end. it balances well at this point and does allow you to swoosh the ship around much more easily. this was the most enjoyable star wars build i've had in a long time. everything progresses nicely with almost no repetitive bits. the ship looks good and is also huge! *sweet* compare it to the 6211 isd and you'll see it's only fractionally smaller. when i first saw pictures of this on the internet i thought it looked ok. once you see it for real it is much more impressive. for ?69.99 in the uk i'm not complaining. it's the best value star wars set of the year so far. to conclude: pieces: 9/10 minifigures: 7/10 (would be a 9 apart from the stupid qui-gon/obi-wan head error) playability: 8/10 originality: 9/10 set design: 8/10 overall: 8.2/10 the box says this is a limited edition set (whatever that means). so if you're planning to get it i'd suggest you grab it at the first opportunity. i'm glad i did! x-d edited by kernow, 22 july 2007 - 10:56 pm.

1 thanks for the review! i'm glad to see lego including details of everyday life, like the food (though a plate would have been nice). steve

0 brick miner, on jul 31 2007, 07:46 pm, said: as for the set, the thing that jumps out at me most is the use of dark blue for water... im so used to seeing the classic blue for water, that the dark blue seems weird. i don't like it. - bm indeed, i only noticed this when i saw the s@h images. i guees that they're on dark waters. you can always put some trans blue and trans clear 1x1 round plates, no? i tried that technique to make the lava (using trans red and trans orange plates), it looks neat. regarding the human soldier thing yoda mentioned, it's quite weird. like him, i'm going to swap the legs, so they're coherent with the soldiers from the other sets. third note: is it just me or did you attach the two black gate pieces too high? shakar

1 nice review, i like the building/port the most mmm,dark blue plates *wub* pity it is a toys'r'us exclusive, in the netherlands there are only toys'r'usses in the greater cities.

0 shakar, on aug 1 2007, 01:34 pm, said: third note: is it just me or did you attach the two black gate pieces too high? shakar no, i think this is correct. the upper plate with clip for the door is a little high, on top of a dark gray 1x1 brick. so if you want the door to operate well you have to place it like that. i just put the clip under that brick, a very easy fix, so my door now is lower which looks better imho, and no sneaky skelly can crawl along under it.... x-d

1 thanks for the review brickster! it's great to be able to see more views of this set.

1 ok here is the set alot of us star wars fans have been waiting for! the 7666 hoth rebel base! *wub* first the box now the great minifigs! that stunning k-3po fig! now the snowspeeder! aaaaggghhhhh these parts are all stickers! now for the turret! the 2 cones on the side press in to fire out 2 blue lights saber blades :-d now for the small crane thingy. yes the part under the engine on the snowspeeder is another sticker 8-| echo base!! (well the front door anyway :-d ) the main control room? :-d again these are stickers on a tinted clear panel and on the slope |-/ i have no idea what this is meant to be! :-d finally 2 shots of the full set! *wub* well over all i really like this set and think it is great value for money. the minifigs alone would set you back more than the cost of this set. the build time was a good 2 hours or so and was good fun! the snowspeeder is not as good as the second snowspeeder and no where near as good as the first in my opinion, but i did love that first one. the k-3po fig is perfect and it is good to be getting more droids that aren't r2-d2 and c-3po. it is a shame about the stickers but that is the price of keeping the cost down i suppose (the only printed part in the whole set is the snowspeeder/x-wing windscreen). i will definately be getting atleast another 3 of this great set. 9/10

1 i love it.... depending on the australian price! (if it comes down here that is.) incidently, i have no idea what that other yellow thing is either! thanks for the review.

0 mutley , did you bought it @ tru? - are there any other sets? exept of hoth base , and is there the republic cruiser?

1 wow!! why didnt you bought 3 of them :-d?

1 the snowspeeder is love.

1 mutley777, on aug 2 2007, 05:00 pm, said: yep! very reasonable *y* not too bad ... might have to pick that up soon then, i will be in tru in southampton over the weekend ;) i think i'll buy the bigger sets here and get the smaller ones in the usa later in the year. the smaller the boxes, the more chance i will have getting them in my suitcase ;) i have to say, i am very glad we are now not getting a 1:1 ratio between the numbers used prices in usa vs uk (e.g. it is not longer ?49.99 = $49.99) :)

1 excellent set. the snowtroopers are just amazing (most lego imperial troops are really good). however, it's sad that except from luke, all the rebels have the same face which is what is more the most unexpressive that you can find. for the rest, the quality looks excellent. the snowspeeder is far better than the first they realized (but only one thing: it looks a bit too white to me. i think i remember they were grey and orange rather than white in the film) and the echo base door is really cool. really nice set. edited by lord beckett, 02 august 2007 - 04:14 pm.

1 nice review mutley *y*! i agree with all your observations, especially stickers versus printed parts |-/! i get some of this and replace the snowspeeders with my v.2?s. hoth on copmike

1 great review,i am still undecided whether to get this set or not.

1 fantastic review jim, from the quality of the review alone it is easy to see how much hard work you have put into it. i'm with you on the instruction manual, i much prefer one quality bound book over umpteen stapled booklets. already have 2 of these sitting in the build queue, one for display model as i'm a fan of this one and one to build the b model then dissemble for parts, so i'm already sold on his set but still very much enjoyed taking the time it deserves to read through the review and ogle at your pro photography.

1 i was very skeptical of this set because i really thought the redesign degraded the looks of the a-model a lot, but after building it i must say this is an excellent set. good job tlg!

1 a great review jim. just finished building this set. a couple of steps required abit of lego stressing to get together when there was an easier way. just made it into rc ( almost finished it in ldd) which was easy to do as it has so much room for nearly any configuration of motors and not have them showing. a great set. edited by jono.rocky, 13 march 2015 - 10:53 am.

1 true, but i must say i like the new colour, very 'fresh' looking compared to the rather dullish regular green. can't wait to build mocs with it.

0 grand moff viceroy, on aug 3 2007, 01:32 am, said: excellent review, thanks! what is the cost in us? not released in my area. the shovel is obviously my favorite area, it looks detailed and strong. i love the treads, because i need them to move the 4 x 4 barrels on my super-scaled turbolaser turret. very good pics too. what color are the treads? i never had them. they are plastic or rubber? the treads are dark grey i not too good with naming colours. the treads are the same as in the snowmobile set released earlier in the year they are a hard plastic.

0 ah man...i wanted to review it with mine. oh well. here in the u.s. it cost $150 and has 1355 pieces total. the pins and axles did seem a bit difficult in putting them into place. a problem i have been having is the batterys are done after about 4 hours of play, which i really wish they would last longer :-( . overall it is a stupendous set and it is really nice to see our old friend the studs make a return!

0 thanks for the review, it really looks cool. too bad it's soo expensive. :-/ i must admit that i prefer the 8421 mobile crane for more or less the same price, the design is more "sexy". *wub*

1 thanks for the review! this looks like a great set, and with four motors, two receivers and a remote control i wouldn't say it is overpriced. it is still a lot of money though..... if my scholarship permits it i will seriously consider buying this set.

1 thank you very much for that neat review, ickelpete! *y* your pictures?re very interesting and your video?s really good. that set looks very beautiful to me, a formidable new technic set that quickly?ll turn into an everlasting classic for sure. :'-) i?m just a little sorry for those quality problems.... well, i hope that tlc?ll work on that matter and fix it soon. 8-|

1 hi, many thanks for this review, photos and videos. i can't wait to put the hands on mine, since it is already ordered and should arrive before the end of the month. :'-) could you post a scan or photos, from those last pages in the building instructions where the parts included are listed? thanks edited by conchas, 04 august 2007 - 07:19 pm.

0 could you please please post the instruction boolets' number codes (located on the back in tiny print)? so that we can download them from lego.com and have a look for ourselves. i think a personalised flag would be a good finishing touch to this set! thanks.

0 eyesonly, on aug 6 2007, 09:11 pm, said: what i really want is for philo or someone to test it's power and such. *sweet* edit the power of the motors that is. its getting late. *sing* i just noticed that he has done that in brick journal 8. check out page 56-61 for great info and a comparison to the gear motors. to bad it didn't include the nxt-motors since they are very similar.

1 the new small technic sets have incredible functionality for their size, and this one is no exception. with only 106 parts this crane can roll, extend, rotate, lift (and hold in any position) and has working stabilisers! the boom extends the same as the other sets with this boom; simply pull it. it works surprisingly well and due to circular ridges inside the boom the extension (which is just a standard beam) will hold in place. the gear at the back controls the height of the boom. as you can see the boom is only half extended. boom fully extended, half down. the cable is kept in place via two gears and a blue pin, same as the 7905 crane. even under decent weights this works well. the stabilisers however cannot handle much weight once the load is moved off axis. the stablilsers are a very simple but effective design. another shot of the stablilsers. this also shows how far the boom will decend. the boom height mechanism works well also. i love the cab design. overall this is a remarkable achievement for the low price. i bought it for the boom piece as i want to improve the crane that came with 7998 7898 ( :-$ ). i highly recommend it.

-1 very nice review sinner! *y* *wub* so we are getting more and more reviews with figs in it, that?s great! :'-) i actually wanted to skip this technic set, but your review made me think again. i haven?t seen you posting a price, so i will do that for you :-p : it?s (just) 9,99? in germany.

1 a very nice review of a very good little set, thanks sinner! *y*

1 excellent set, excellent review. a good job as always, sinner.

-1 thanks for all the feedback you guys! robert8, on 12 april 2015 - 11:25 pm, said: i can't help but think the minifigures are the weak part of the set. snake and apu are great but the rest.... i don't know. they kinda redundant now. they could at least give us new torso printing, like homer wearing his jacket or bart wearing his blue t-shirt or marge wearing her coat. or, as i said in the discussion thread, i'd have included jasper in cmf series 2 and a frozen version here. overall, the set looks kinda smaller than what i thought. i agree, but so many people were complaining about how the simpsons house should have included the most common versions (mostly because the eyes or whatever), so i think lego played it safe and just included the normal versions. it makes sense, since series 1 is gone forever, and the common versions were in there, and this set is bound to be in stock for a very long time like the death star. i never really agreed when people were complaining about the alternate eye prints personally, but i guess this is a good business choice based on previous feedback. edited by just2good, 13 april 2015 - 12:06 am.

1 hello everyone. excellent review! english is not my native language, but i want to express my opinion. simpsons house was the first of its kind, and i can say without exaggeration that this is the most impressive set that i'm going (my collection http://brickset.com/sets/ownedby-celeb ). i look at the video from the kwik-e-mart, and is difficult to say how good it is compared with the house. the main disadvantages that i said to myself, is this: build the walls of the large panels, next is access to the roof (gray parts in front of the back door (i think they represent the stairs)) is not on the level with doors on the roof and when you open them, you can see the white block is openly trash, my points of view. boxes on the left of go to the store and powersauce box, i want see make real and not just a cube, f.e. such as in the unreleased star wars set. about minifigures, i fully agree with robert8. two more of the same homer, marge and bart?! personally, i put my set as a scene and all the replays minifigure are inside the house that was not identical characters next and also absolutely terrible bart`s accessory this set is made parking for bikes and it looks very cool. but damn, it is hoped to see the bart or lisa's bike, instead of useless balloons with paint. the walls are made with convex inside panels, why so? can anyone know? have not seen any pictures with such walls in tv show. why did not they turn? i personally really like how realized roof, but my brother says that it is terrible :) garden could do more in the series there were almost jungle i do not know how to be considered here, maybe anyone can express any opinion or idea? i look at the simpsons house, and then look at the photo of this e-mart. i can not understand, in the house we have a garage, two floors, cool floor, a lot of furniture, all the rooms and walls, collected from cubes, many additional accessories. and where is all this detail here? it looks much smaller (maybe even poorer). if they still will release next year comic book store, it will be even less? of course it is difficult to estimate without seeing it live, we have it will be sold only in may. at first sight it does not look so impressive as the house. can certainly the case in the limit on the amount of detail, but why it was impossible to add $ 50 to the cost and make jasper, the more detailed the roof, the walls of the smaller elements, that it was not convex. sad. thanks all for attention. edited by celeb, 13 april 2015 - 05:10 am.

1 can you post a pic of it next to the simpsons house? just curious about size comparisons...

1 nice review of a surprisingly interesting set. *y* those windows are great, and no doubt difficult to get. classic coffee maker, simple yet exactly right. that baseplate was in a few other sets, but never with that pattern. would have made a great base for some of the classic 80s houses lego used to treat us to. in tan was part of the adventurers egypt sets. as recently as 2001 it was a base for ogel. versatile plate that hopefully hasn't disappeared completely. parapink is apparently "light pink" on brickshelf, so i guess it's just lighter than normal pink (and stopped appearing in 1995. just so you know, that monkey is drinking too much and likely to fall in the pool ... ;-)

1 tks sinner for that cool review ;-) this set is not one of my favs (never was really a big fan of those raised baseplates) but had fantastic parts and mfs !! it has great playability with really cool "80's miami" feel *wub* that pink was actually pretty cool and went well with that lime green (i think its lime but i'm not 100% positive). once again this pisses me off so much that i was in my dark ages when this theme was out !! i loved it, especially all the beach/water themes *wub* i really wish tlc decided to bring that water paradisia back !! who knows !! after all they need to make some girlie sets !! girls are a part of their market totally neglected !! how many women we have on the boards ?? really a tiny few unfortunatly !! so tlc, please bring paradisia back in may 08 :-p , please !! *yoda*

1 nice review sinner! *y* my favorite part of this set is the parrot in the front window! *wub*

1 that?s really a great and overall nice playset with a very cool mrs. puff and a fine new spongebob! *sweet* the boating school?s indeed very nice with a beautiful color scheme, and so is the lighthouse.... i?m really tempted to buy a second set just to "complete" these buildings.... although it?s a little too expensive for doing so, and it wouldn?t even fit with the style of the other sb sets. x-d wet highway to the poor puffer fish? privat hell on! :-d

1 i like this one better than the other one for parts and such, plus i'm generally a sucker for any different minifig, but yeah, that price is steep. great review though!

0 yoda, i don't thank you for this review, and after the chump bucket review too! because i'm so exited to have them that since i ordered them from s@h, i come back home aftre the work the faster i can, with the hope to see a big box on my bed... and this, even if i know that it tooks more than 6-7 days to have my order... this mrs. puff figs is really really nice *wub* and this 3rd sb head too!

1 nice review mate, the set look's great and a real must for all those sb fan's out there. the whole set scream playability that's for sure, which is great because let's be honest their's gonna be alot of kid's and *yoda* out their playing with it :-p x-d ;-) . geezzzzz what is it with all those bloody stikers? this set would be soooooo much better with printed piece's instead of those, still once your over that at least the rest is ok. am i the only one who thinks mrs puff kinda look's like a kinder egg toy? their's nothing wrong with that mind you (yes i have a kinder problem x-d ) just seem's strange to me.

1 very nice review *yoda* !! though, i think you should review the "course" because it looks very interesting.

0 it looks like a good set but i would rather get the neighborhood one.

0 thank you for the nice review, sinner! i also bought this set but in combination with 4883 when it was on sale (50% - hurray!) at s@h. i made a short review of 4883 but wasn?t really sure what to tell about 4884. so i?m glad you did that for me. :-d i have different feelings about this set. on the one hand i love the lion. he is really impressive (even my wife -not known for being lego enthusiastic- asked me, if there were more animals of this kind). the lion is - restricted - poseable and the colors used are fantastic. *wub* 3 models can be built simultaneously - that?s great! on the other hand i still don?t know what to do with these rotation joints. *wacko* and the other models are somehow disappointing compared to the lion. i seem to have missed the little lizard. :-$ i put it on my "to do-list". like all the creator sets: great parts pack - but wait until they get on sale! x-d for me - i had a lot more fun with 4883. indeed: roarrrr on! ;-)

1 great review sinner i regret not buying this set when i saw it cheap in a local sale :-(

1 lego 75915 pteranodon capture i'm glad to review this nice set; 75915 pteranodon capture name: pteranodon capture set number: 75915 pieces: 174 price: $19.99 minifigs: 2 theme: jurassic world year of release: 2015 links: box the front of the box has the jurassic world logo along with the set number, piece count, etc. its a decent box size for a $20 set. here it is compared to a minifigure. here's the back of the box. it shows all of the features from the set an ad for the video game. the back also shows a small picture with a silhouette of the dinosaurs from the line, along with their set numbers. instruction booklet the booklet shows the same thing as the front of the box, nothing more, nothing less. near the back of the booklet, there is a picture with all of the characters from the sets. the other page shows all the dinosaurs with a mini box that shows the size comparisons. the minifigures the minifigures in this set are simon masrani and an acu. both of them have excellent printing on the front and the back. the gun is the same one from tlm that the ssp used. simon masrani is the only one with a double sided face. his second face shows a scared/worried exp<b></b>ression. he has a zipped up jacket or jumpsuit with a shirt underneath. the acu trooper only has one face which is a scared/worried exp<b></b>ression. i would have a scared exp<b></b>ression too if i was about to get eaten by a dinosaur. he has great detail on his torso and legs. let's take a look at the vest. the vest is the same mold from the ssp in tlm i think. it has the letters acu on the front too. the back is nothing interesting. pteranodon the pteranodon has great printing too. the colors match the ones that the pteranodons from the movie have. the wings, mouth, and head are a rubbery type of plastic and are easily bendable. it uses the same mold from the pteranodon in the 2012 dino line. here's a comparison between the two. spare parts the spare parts aren't many, just a few extras. the helicopter at first the helicopter was 'meh' when i first saw it on the box. now that i've built it, i've got to say that i really like it. its my favorite helicopter of all of the ones i've built. its sturdy and sleek. it's not too bulky either. the first play feature in this set is the net launcher. it works pretty well, not one of my favorite features but it does what it's meant to do. the other play feature is on the other side. its a stud shooter which can be used by a minifigure. you can put it on their hand or you can leave it there and let someone operate it. the shooter can fold up inside the helicopter as well. there are stickers on both sides of the helicopter and they also have the jurassic world logo with dino marks. final verdict value: 9/10 - for $20 this set isn't that bad. the parts count is a little low for a $20 set but the price is probably because of licensing. other than that, it's a great deal, i would've hoped for maybe some bait for the pteranodon but that can easily be fixed. design: 9/10 - i really love the way this helicopter looks, it's sleekness and design is great. the only flaw this has is the huge net launcher, it's too big in my opinion. minifigs: 10/10[/b] - the minifigures are extremely detailed and it even includes an exclusive minifigure. playability: 9/10 - there are many things you can do with this set. the swoosh factor is great and so are the play features. parts: 10/10[/b] - they're useful parts and there isn't many huge specialized pieces in here either. overall: 9/10 - this set is great for fans of jurassic world, it's also a nice parts pack. there's one exclusive minifigure in here too which makes it even better. having a little fun with the set hope you liked my first review here on eurobricks! please leave any suggestions on what to improve, thanks! edited by thelazychicken, 02 may 2015 - 10:19 pm.

0 nice review! although, that picture of the ad reminded me of how some of the things surrounding jurassic world (lego, that is) seems hastily put together. just look at that the minifig. he is star lord's head and hair, indiana jones' torso with different arms, and city legs. to me, that seems a bit weak, especially for a video game.

1 lego 31036 creator toy and grocery shop thanks to eurobricks for making this review possible! for years, lego has offered a house of some sort in the creator line each year - with the standard creator 3-in-1 instructions, that's given us a very wide variety of housing. in 2014, they added a business option with their 31026 bike shop and cafe set. this continues into this year's toy and grocery shop set. these shops are smaller than the very detailed modular buildings, but that should help them fit in better with the other city sets, and this also lets them get into more kids' cities with their lower pricetag. name: toy and grocery shop set number: 31036 pieces: 466 price: $39.99 minifigs: 2 theme: creator year of release: 2015 links: bricklink peeron brickset the box the front of the box shows the "a" version model out of the three, plus insets of the b and c versions. i like the sorta-european looking backdrop; it goes well with the styling of the buildings. interestingly, the main model is shown opened up for play, while the two insets show those versions folded. the box top on the top of the box, lego helpfully shows that with 3 of these sets, you can make a whole street. the box back on the back, you get to again see all three versions together, but this time, folded. it's a little creepy though with those clones running around :) the manuals yep, three actual, printed manuals. there's nothing indicating them as being a, b, and c models, but it's pretty obvious looking at the designs which is the "main" model and which are the alternates. the contents bags of parts and two plates. nothing terribly exciting to see here.... the minifigs nothing new here, but two nice figs none-the-less. well, bricklink does say that both figs are unique to this set, but there's not any new parts to them. the closest thing to rare is the female head - it's only in this set, 2013's dragon mountain castle set, a uk store grand opening set, and one of the 2014 holiday freebie sets. the faces aren't that unique, but i guess this exact combo of two faces on the head is. i love the kid torso with the spaceman on it. the minifig backs no back printing on anything here except for an alternate female face. sorry. i do like that her two faces are so different though. that's much better than when a head has a "scared" and a "more scared" face. the "c" build enough with the basics; let's build. i'm going to review them in the same order i built them, backwards. since you can tell immediately looking at the 3 designs that they're going to use different numbers of pieces and so forth, i figured i'd build the smallest first lest it seem like a letdown. all three have some basic similarities - the two plates are hinged to give a building that opens for play. they also do have interiors, which you can see starting to form here. the "c" build, front it's a pretty quick build, so it's done already. here's the front of the building with it opened up. like this, it appears to be two separate stores, a newsstand and some sort of shop you can enter. all the printed tiles help give the newsstand a detailed appearance, but i'm not sure why they've got a $100 bill lying on the ledge... the "c" build, rear from the back side, the interiors are pretty plain. the shop half has a plant in a jar and a weird chair, and the newsstand just has a register. the "c" build, sides here's the two sides of the folded building. on the hinge side, there's a bunch of windows in a disjointed wall with random colors. on the other, why did they put in a huge window when the set does include a trans-clear door that could have gone there? and you get a small patch of plants, like so many sets seem to have these days. the "c" build, extras that's a lot of leftovers there. and not just little stuff - multiple doors, stairs, etc. and unused sand green is always a little sad.... the "b" build, 1 a pretty similar start, with the hinge and little garden and some tiles along the ground. the "b" build, 2 now we see a big windowed wall, some details like lights, and how it has the usual alternate model "weird part usage" - like a 1x4 brick with side studs being used over the doorway, even though those side studs will not get used. the "b" build, front the finished building gives us a nice little post office, with a letter-carrying bird on the roof. hope that's not their normal method of delivery! something about the colors just doesn't work for me though. the combo of white / light grey / dark grey / black / sand green plus tan is just too much. the tan window and door frames i don't like. the "b" build, inside on the inside, things are weird. the counter on the left is ok, but the light above the door (with a yellow clip? ugly!) is too big, and everything else over there by the door doesn't make much sense either. the "b" build, sides i like the front side here, except the colors are still too much. the bench, greenery, mailbox on the corner, and streetlight are all nice. the boy is a little creepy though - binoculars in hand plus a telescope on the roof of the post office? why? the hinge side shows more of the weird colors you get in the wall, but that's going to be hidden when the set is open. plus we even see that on big modulars at times, so it's not so terrible. the "b" build, leftovers again, a lot of leftover parts. it's obvious this was another alternate, but it'd be nice to see more of them used to make a bigger building. but let's move on to the model that does use them all... the "a" build, 1 the first half starts like this. maybe it's just my bias, but it already feels like a more detailed build. bottles on the wall, the yellow and red awning over the window, etc. the "a" build, 2 the other half starts off with detailed work too. i think that's a red vending machine. the stairs are also very solidly built. i also appreciate the effort to get that diagonal base where a door will be - it's such a nice touch to have sections of a building that aren't right angles. the "a" build, 3 not too much has been added, but i wanted to showcase the tiny toys before they get hidden by a wall. that robot and train are just fantastic little micro builds. the "a" build, 4 things are coming together quickly. the walls, windows, and doors get the first floor nearly done. i'm still not big on the sand green and tan combo, but i do really like the red and yellow awnings. the "a" build, 5 it appears the shop owner lives upstairs, since we've got a bedroom forming here. the bed is a little plain, but the table and lamp on the other half are great. and my big fingers did not like putting all those railings on the balcony, with the telescope posts and tile tops. knocked quite a few off before i got them all done. the "a" build, front and it's done. all the details make this set really feel like a mini-modular. the roofline has great greebling, and the shop contents, and on and on. it's not perfect though. the tiny car above the toy store door isn't nearly as good as the toys inside. and the kid's yellow scooter? the wheels aren't even on the ground, much less able to roll. the scooter looks decent though, so that counts for something. well, at least as long as you are at this angle, since the boy's only got 1 foot on the 1 stud wide scooter. the "a" build, inside most of the interior has been seen already. the roof though does a nice job of being interesting for a roof. a skylight, the edge rails, etc. and you can see there's not much "wrong color" in the walls. the "a" model, sides an interesting building when folded up. very tall and skinny. you can tell it's not really meant to be displayed this way - it's meant to be open. the good - lots! i like the awning, the diagonal door, the flowerbox under the upper window, the folding gate on the balcony that lets it be used in open or closed mode, and the green / white / blue colors. the bad - well, the stairs end short of the upper door, i still don't really like the tan doorframes (i think black would have been better), and why don't the upper floors match up in size? the "a" model, leftovers ah, that's more like it. just a few small pieces left as spares. the errors you might have to click through to the full-size versions, but i did catch a few weird errors in the manuals. first, in the photo of the newsstand, the map in the front corner is on there sideways. the map does have a clear north arrow printed on it. on the second image, the boy's feet are hanging off the edge. just unusual to see an alignment error in the manual like that. the comparison here are this set and the modular detective office side by side. there's a huge difference - as you'd expect. but is the difference more than you'd expect? this set is 466 parts, $40. the do is 2262 pieces and $160. 5 times the parts, 4 times the price. looking at them side by side, i'd expect a bigger difference in both. the conclusion so, what's my conclusion on this model? i love the main model, but the alternates are meh. it's a nice set for someone looking for a town building other than police and fire stations, but who isn't ready to move to the modular line. compared to the modulars though, it seems overpriced. part of that is because the huge modulars are actually a great deal compared to other lego sets. i'm also a little surprised that it's so small, when you compare it to the city sets like a police station. those are generally designed with much more open space, letting them be more of a playset. this one is small and cramped, so it'd be tougher to play in. it's not really a city set though. the ratings value: 7/10 - it's under the 10 cents a part mark, but that's largely due to having a ton of tiny parts. all those flowers and decorative 1x1 round studs add up quickly! design: 7/10 - good and bad on the colors, and there's a big difference between the quality of the main vs alternate models. having so many leftover pieces is one thing when the creator set makes 3 very different models (ie a boat, plane, and truck). when it's 3 buildings, it seems wasteful to have so many parts leftover. minifigs: 6/10 - i'm not sure they both fit the set. i suppose the boy is going to the toy store and the woman is going to the grocery? but there's no storekeeper in either. the woman doesn't look like a storekeeper to me, so that's why i assume she's another shopper. i love the boy, but the woman is just so-so - except that i do appreciate the head having two very different expressions. but again, that doesn't fit the set. i can't see her scared face being used. playability: 6/10 - the shops are detailed with registers and so forth, but it's all so tiny it'd be hard to play with the figs in it. parts: 9/10 - tons of windows and doors, plus nice sand green bricks. but some things (the large blue curves used on the roof for example) are weirdly specialized and would be hard to use in another building design. overall: 7/10 - i'd recommend doing what i did - build the alternates first, then the main since that's how you'll want to leave it. i'd really like to see the price a little lower compared to other sets (again, the part count is inflated due to so many tiny parts) and the finished building is tiny, but it's loaded with neat details.

0 great review! very thorough. it's not a set which makes me run to tye store, but it definitely has some fun elements. i do like your new grey background. your pictures look great!

0 any chance you have a picture of the news stand next to the detectives office building as i would love to see the scaling for that?

1 reviews for this set really should picture them next to the bike shop & cafe, which it's intended to be compatible with right down to the size of the baseplates and grey tiles around the edge. it doesn't look that great on its own, but if you add the two sets together you get something that begins to look like a street scene.

1 as a fan of creator houses, i really want to like this set. however, i think that creator houses have long filled a niche that's neglected elsewhere: residential houses. we haven't had a larger residential house since 2013; i'm not sure if these sets have anything to do with that, but it seems like they may be the replacement for larger houses. and i'd much rather have a larger house set than a set like this. i also agree with many others here; something about it just feels incomplete. i think that the various city business buildings we've gotten in recent years (including those in this year's city square--which is much more expensive than this, but also contains much more) make for better buildings at this scale.

1 thanks andy_0306uk, your very clever strategic decision to serve us with blurry pictures allowed me to glance at this review without ruinating that whole wonderful advent surprise too much.... :-p *y* but although i loved the last year?s one, i think they could do another theme (or perhaps even two calendars), because right now castle?s pretty hot imo.

1 informative review, thanks! *y* as usual, it makes a fairly good parts pack. wish i could pick up a few on deep discount, but at full price one is fine. i do like the 'stewards' and some of the workmen. overall, i think i'm looking more forward to the belville calendar, just for it's assortment of unusual parts. ugh. belville. still, parts are parts, and it's got some. phoinix summed up one of the most common complaints i hear about all of the lines in 3 simple words ... "no girls....again!" good job, now get lego to listen. ;-)

0 i've never been fond of these sets, but still buy them every year because my daughters like them. i am, however, looking forward to the belville advent calendar, which likely will have some parts that usually are quite hard to get in it. my girls will love it, and i love all the belville parts. http://shop.lego.com/product/?p=7600 if anyone has pics of what is contained in this set i would love to see them.

0 i'm a big fan of anime and have watched some mechas like full metal panic, neon evangelion: genesis (it is a mecha!) and chobits (well... she is a robot...), so i was curious to see what this new exo force line was all about. the colorful sets and manga-like characters didn't persuade me right away, but the urgent need for a couple of white 3x3 wing plates made me purchase this little thing. it cost me 70 dkr as you can see on the box. this is 9.30 euro, or about the same an american has to pay for the new republic cruiser. pretty expensive for so few pieces (90 + a spare technic pin) the box an action-packed box with one of the sides being oddly empty except from the lego-logo. what's inside there is a small building instruction, two polybags (no bag building here) and a sticker sheet with alarmingly many stickers. the build it takes so little time to build this set that i didn't get to take any pictures of the process. every step was accompanied by an element description although i doubt most of you will need that with so few pieces to keep track on. most of the dark green bricks have a sticker - even the slopes where the rough surface makes stickers fall off easily! there should also have been a sticker on the windshield, but i wanted to keep that piece clean for better usage later. (i'm one of those who keeps stickers on the bricks) the model you want to see this model from the front, as the back is pretty much neglected there isn't much for the pilot to grab a hold on either. he is pretty much a sitting duck up there with the screen giving him only partial cover. there is a huge wrench next to him which kind of symbolizes the crudeness of the mech. the set isn't called "cyclone defender" for nothing. the right arm might hold an ordinary light assault riffle, but the other has a spinning disc with samurai swords which you can turn with the yellow knob on the backside. those of you who have seen robot wars might remember the incredible power of this melee weapon from a robot named hypnodisc. it would have been nice had there been a pull-back motor to power the disc (i'm sure lego has a lot of these in stock), but the simple mechanism still works reasonably well. the riffle comes off and a pin makes it easy to hold with the hand, but the disc is fixed to the arm. it is also a problem that the swords get misaligned quickly during play. the minifig i really like this minifig because of the neat idea with an expression on each side that lego has made a standard for exo force. posability most mech-moc'ers show off their creations using gundam-like poses. with two joints per leg (one being the ankles) and one for an arm i thought of some less serious poses: crawling (silent like a ninja!): belly gliding: kick off!; upside down: final rating i have to disappoint you here. this is my first set in this line and i have absolutely no idea of how good it is. the last robot i bought was the awesome 6889 spyrius recon robot for the same price, but it is in a completely different genre. the set had what i expected (two white wings) and is as such a no-nonsense set. i guess it would be of more use if you have some more exo force, which i don't. 6/10 ups: has great minifig, weapons and is easy to build. downs: crude design and a bit too expensive for what you get.

0 nice review :) but... you paid how much? this set is priced around 7 euros here in germany, which is a very fair price for what you get in my oppinion. it?s a little disappointing though, that i couldn?t think of any alternate builds for this set, and there are no inspirations on the box or the ef website.

0 i guess that?s what some people refer to as "sarcasm" ;)

1 i couldn't find a review of this wonderful set in here, so here it goes! i got the set for msrp (180kr = 24 euro) which is a fair price here in denmark. as all other creator sets there are instructions for several models (3 in this case). the box the box is a little larger than city sets in the same price range. the primary model is shown on the front while you see the secondary ones on the back. what you get 312 pieces in 5 polybags and two building instructions: one for the primary model and the other for the rest. the built it was impossible for me to speed build this model because of the nifty functional details from the retractable landing gear to the wings that can turn by means of the handle in the back of the model. it took me a full hour to build it because i had to "test" how it all works together. the finished model the landing gear isn't fully enclosed when retracted and the models are sub-minifig scale, but i still love the design of the models. the doors for the rear wheels open as you pull the wheels down and the final piece of functionality comes from the wings that can either tilt (the horizontal stabilizers) or have elevators. wing in, wings out, wings in, wings out... ratings as a whole i actually like this set even more than the big rig. the models are just as diverse but the added functionality makes the plane more fun to play with than the rig. price: 7/10 - a good price, but not a bargain as the big rig design: 9/10 - there could have been a sligtly higher level of details in the main model, but all models are really good looking and i especially like the design of the hovercraft. functionality: 10/10 - i guess you could ask for working rudders, opening cockpit and so on, but the plane is really filled with movable parts and the turning of the wings works really well. secondary models: 7/10 - a hovercraft! how awesome is that!? if only the last model was just as inventive instead of a standard helicopter... modifiability: 8/10 - the bricks are in ordinary colours and there is a good variety of them giving you plenty of possibilities for moc'ing. you can easily make the main model into something that looks more like an f-14. 9/10 probably as good as it gets for a creator set in this price range. it is entertaining to both build and play with, looks good and the secondary models are worth building as well! (brickshelf gallery)

1 nice review and a nice set. thanks for taking the time. i'll want to pick this guy up.

1 great review lasse d. a definite two *y* up. i bought this set for the swing-wing concept. i was very curious what tlc's design was like. i have been working on modifying it just a little to look more like the f-14. so far i have completed the back section, but i need to finish the cockpit. overall this is a great set. i *wub* tlc's swing-wing concept. model on!!

1 a fine set, a great review and good additional pictures. thanks lasse d and sinner. teamwork on! *y*

1 ?34.99 is not too shabby. the big guy itself is nice, but the gem of the set is the mech. really nice mech i must say! great for posing. the mini figs suprisingly nice little build/vehicle. never seen this element before....its probably nothing new though, lol. no articulation of the legs? nooooooo! phew! the front two legs do articulate. would of been bad if they didnt. overall, i give the set 7.8/10. not the best, but its actually quite nice, and the yellow mech is awesome. if it was him on his own, then 9.4/10! cheers

-1 thanks for the review! i really dislike this set but i thought much worse of it when we saw the first pic. i think it was a good idea (mech transporter) pursued in a horribly wrong way! :-x thanks again! :-) batbrick away! >:-)

1 it is no secret that marvel is one of the most successful companies right now. from the avengers to the x-men and down to even the most obscure characters like ant-man, every one of their movies has been a big hit until now. the latest marvel movie, fant4stic, was released last month and while i have not seen it yet, i'm sure it's just as great as their other movies. i mean, it has the word "fantastic" in the title after all! and being the smart business that they are, the lego company decided to get in on the hype early and capitalize on this movie's undoubtful success two years in advance by making a set featuring fant4stic's main villain, dr. doom. now that's what i call forward thinking! but did they do a good job with it or were they being overhasty? let's find out! set number: 76005 name: spider-man: daily bugle showdown theme: marvel super heroes subtheme: ultimate spider-man year of release: 2013 pieces: 476 minifigs: 5 price: $49.99 usd s@h description: quote swing into the daily bugle and stop dr. doom! dr. doom and his henchman beetle are attacking the daily bugle in their speedy jet to steal spider-man's secret identity. it's up to spider-man and nova to swing in and stop them! trigger the daily bugle's explosion functions to cause destruction as the jet fires missiles! stop dr. doom from hitching the jet's anchor hook to the safe with spider-man's secret inside! knock beetle off the building with the swinging web attack and drop dr. doom inside with the rooftop trapdoor! then fly nova in through the broken window with the dumpster catapult function and send those villains back to where they came from. includes spider-man, nova, dr. doom, beetle and j. jonah jameson with accessories and weapons. the first thing that comes to mind after reading this description is: wow, that's a lot of tms! anyway, here are some resource links for this set: brickset bricklink rebrickable the box since this set is based on the ultimate spider-man cartoon, the box has the usual usm design with the red marvel super heroes background, an illustration of spidey in the upper right corner, and the usm logo in the lower right. as usual, there is a minifig line up in the lower left, and since this was before the terrible redesign, you can see the full body of the minifigs. i really miss this type of line up. there is quite a lot going on here: doctor doom attacking the daily bugle in his jet while simultaneously reaching for j. jonah jameson below with his jet's claw, spider-man (reluctantly) swings in to save him, while nova fights off the beetle. it's a pretty cool scene, even though it's not very accurate to the show. in "beetle mania", the episode that this set is based on, the beetle was indeed out to kill jjj, but it was in order to stop him from exposing his identity, not spider-man's (although spidey was next on jjj's list). and while he is a recurring villain on the show, doctor doom had nothing to do with this plot and didn't even appear in the episode aside from a brief cameo. it's awesome that they included him anyway, though, so i'm not gonna complain. note that the tower is so tall that it wraps around the top of the box. there, you can also see a scale reference with the spider-man minifig. on the back of the box, you can see the interior of the bugle and all of its play features which there are quite a few of since this is a playset. it's all illustrated pretty well, although lego's choice of sound effects is still a mystery to me. i don't get why they don't go for spider-man's signature "fwip!" instead of "fazzing!" and i didn't know that a breaking window made the sound "btoom!" but i digress. contents inside the box you will find three instruction booklets (one smaller than the others), a comic book, a fairly large sticker sheet, five numbered bags, and two loose pieces: a white string piece and a gray 16x8 plate. there aren't really any notable pieces and nobody cares about the comic bock (no offense to the artist), so lets get right to the instructions. they are pretty straight forward and easy to follow. some of the pages have a ghostly image of spidey, nova, and dr. doom in the top right corner which is fitting since these are all minifigs that appear in this set (which is strangely not something that can be said for many other super heroes instructions with this type of artwork). minifigures as with most super heroes sets, most people will get this set mainly for the minifigs, so without further ado, let's talk about them. spider-man is the same old bootless one you get in almost every usm set. not much to say about him. some might complain that we don't get spidey's alter ego peter parker in this set, but in the usm cartoon, mj is actually the one who works at the daily bugle, not peter. curse the creators of this cartoon for ruining our chances of getting a new peter parker minifig by trying to mix things up. next we get j. jonah jameson. he appeared in a spider-man 2 set before, but this is a complete redesign. he now has a blue suit with a red tie, a unique face print, and that combed-back hair in dark gray. this new hairpiece doesn't suit him at all and the old flat top hair was perfect for him in my opinion, so i don't know why they changed it. the good thing about this change, however, is the fact that this piece is exclusive to this set in that color. nova on the other hand is spot-on. he comes with a new helmet mold and some nice torso printing. however, he, too, is missing his boots. tlc should have started making dual-colored legs a long time ago. here are some reference images to compare them to. okay, so jjj's hair may not be completely black in the show, but i still think they should have given his minifig a black hairpiece. his suit is also not quite the right color. he rarely appears in person in the show (including the episode this set is based on) and is usually seen on screens around new york, so this is the best picture of him i could find. i guess i should be happy they included a minifig of him at all. in the episode, it was actually mary jane who was at the bugle during beetle's attack, so it would have made more sense to include her, but we got her in the spider-copter set one year later, so that's ok. all three of them have back printing. in jjj's case i'm using that term loosely since it is only comprised of two lines, but it's nice that they went through the trouble of adding them. both jjj and nova come with angry alternate faces. it almost looks like they're trying to out-angry each other. who do you think looks angrier? let me know in the comments section below. now let's talk about the bad guys. even though he would be better off in a fantastic four set, it's great to finally get victor van doom, one of the greatest marvel villains ever and in comics in general. he comes with a dark green hood which was new and exclusive in that color at the time, and he is the only minifig in this set that has leg printing. beetle is a regular minifig with wings. the metallic printing on his face and torso is pretty nice, but i wish it would have continued onto his legs as well. the beetle looks quite accurate to his on-screen counterpart. the only thing that could have improved him is a new helmet mold with pointy eyebrows/antennae. doctor doom, however, looks nothing like he does in the movie. i just don't understand how lego could have messed him up so badly. maybe they were working off of early concept art or something. here is a back view of doom and beetle. beetle would be a pretty boring minifig if it wasn't for his wings which are awesome with their holographic texture. they are so mesmerizing, i could look at those things all day. this piece also appeared in trans. light green in the galaxy squad sets which came out at the same time. here they are without their gear. as you can see, they both have back printing as well. and no, doctor doom does not come with an alternate facial expression, which is fine since you can't see much of his expressions due to his mask anyway. here's a look at dr. doom and nova without their headgear. some say that doom's face looks too cartoony, but i think it looks fine. nova is wearing stylish goggles as a way of explaining his white eyes. it's a far better explanation than the bat-sweatband. they did the same thing with the masked wolverine later. here are all the figs with their accessories. jjj comes with a camera so that he can take "more pictures of spider-man!" beetle comes with one of those overused adu guns which is a very poor representation of his wrist-mounted blasters. i hate to say it, but even those bulky new stud shooters would have been a better representation of his weapons. spidey comes with his usual string of webbing and nova comes with some iron man style translucent studs. the weird thing is that they are red while his powers have a blue glow in the show. doctor doom sadly doesn't get any accessories, but who needs weapons when you have a jet with a claw and flick-fire missiles. the build the first bag contains spider-man, a brick separator, and the parts to build the ground floor of the dbc building. after a quick and straight-forward build, you get this. the dumpster and street lamp are separate from the building and since the lamp post is not built onto any baseplate and is quite top-heavy, it gets knocked over pretty easily. maybe it's meant to be that way, but i would have preferred it if you could stick it onto the baseplate of the building on which there is unfortunately not enough space to do so. as you would expect, the second bag has the parts for the first floor of the building. this is also the bag that contains beetle. after another fairly simple build, you'll find yourself with a two story building with a spiderweb one side and a fire escape on the other. however, you have to apply three stickers during this section of the build which is never fun. can you guess what's in bag number 3? yup, the second floor of the building. you don't need superpowers to predict that one. also, this bag contains nova and jameson. the build of this section is a bit repetitive since the second floor is mostly the same as the first and it takes slightly longer to build since you have to build the rooftop as well. also, in addition to the two window stickers you have to apply ten 2x2 tile stickers! trying to do this without having any of them being crooked is a real pain in the megablocks. the next bag contains doctor doom and the cockpit of his jet. doom's cape is in the usual square white box and the string for the claw is folded up in a piece of tape. here's what you get at the end of this section. looks more like an escape pod than a jet at this point. the final bag is the smallest as it only includes the few parts needed to finish the doom jet. once you build the wings and tail, you stick them onto the cockpit via technic pins and you're done. spare parts these are the parts that are left over after the build. there is the brick separator of course, an extra antenna, and the usual little bits and bops. what's really awesome, though, is that they give you an extra pair of beetle's wings! considering what a neat piece this is and that this is the only set in which it comes in trans-black make this a very welcome spare that you can use in your customs. the finished set here is the complete set. the dbc building looks quite tall, especially when you count the antenna. comparing it to a screenshot from the episode, the general look of the building is there, although there are some inaccuracies. aside from the fact that it is obviously way down-scaled, the screens that show jjj ranting about spider-man should have been hexagonal, not square, and should have wrapped around the building. however, considering how many stickers you would have had to apply if they would have made it accurate, i'm actually glad they kept the screen mercifully small. much like doctor doom himself, the doom jet didn't actually appear in the beetle mania episode. however, it did appear in a later episode titled "not a toy" in which spider-man plays around with captain america's shield, accidentally drops it in doctor doom's latvarian embassy and has to try to retrieve it. and yes, that episode was as godawful as it sounds. here's a screenshot of the jet from that episode. like with the dbc, they managed to capture the general shape of the vehicle, although it doesn't look quite as good as in the show. the color scheme is too dark and it looks kind of blockier. let's take a closer look at the jet. there is no real way to reel the claw in unfortunately. however, there is a stud on the back of the jet that you can stick it onto. needless to say, this is not the ideal way of storing it. i would have much preferred it if they would have attached it onto winch instead. the engines on the wings can be turned, even though they don't turn in the show, and there is a flick-fire missile on each side. even if it's not much to look at, at least it's a very swooshable vehicle. on top of each wing there is a tile with the emblem of latvaria. there was no such emplems on the jet in the cartoon, but they are useful pieces that make it clear whose jet it is, so i'm glad they included them. there is nothing inside the cockpit except for a seat and unless you want to ruin dr. doom's nice dark green cape, i wouldn't put him inside of it. they could have at least printed a control panel onto that empty 2x2 tile. play features since this is a playset, let's look at all the play features it has to offer. like all playsets, the building is open in the back so you can play inside. on the ground floor, there is a potted plant and... nothing else. seriously? is this all they could come up with for this floor? they could have included a security desk, a lounge, a second plant, or anything else! as it is, it's just a boring empty lobby. the first floor is a bit more interesting. there is a safe, a swiveling chair, and a pin board with various pictures of spider-man. there is one tile that reads: "the true identity of spider-man" which is supposedly what the villains are after. i wonder how jameson got this information in the first place. speaking of jameson, the second floor is devoted to his office where he can sit and yell at his non-present employees, demanding "more pictures of spider-man!" it also has a swiveling chair as well as a desk with a lamp and a computer. there is a technic beam connecting his desk with the ceiling of the first floor which you can remove in order to take off the upper half of the building, but it's difficult to do, so i don't recommend it. as you may have noticed in the picture above, there are a few red pegs sticking out of the building. these are for triggering the play features. most of them are on the roof. there is one on what looks like an air conditioning unit. if you place spider-man holding is web-string on the jumper plate in front of it and push the peg, spidey goes bungee-jumping off the building. wee! there is also one that sticks out of the side of the building which when pulled triggers a trap door. the third red peg on the roof can be used to pop off the dbc sign. why is it called the dbc, you ask? it stands for daily bugle communications since in this version of spider-man, the daily bugle is not only a newspaper, but a news tv station as well, one that promotes its own highly biased views. so basically the fox news of the marvel universe. i guess if you're an old school spider-man fan, you could just leave off the "c" and have it just stand for daily bugle. the sign above the main entrance wont be so easily modified however. there is also a peg between the first and second floor which when pushed pops out one of the windows on the first floor. the safe is only attached to a couple of jumper plates and has some jumper plates on top of it as well, so you can easily attach the doom jet's claw to it and rip it out of the building as seen on the back of the box. there are also some snot bricks on the corners of the building that you can attach spiderwebs or spidey himself onto for some wall-crawling and webslinging action. this is not so much a play feature as it is just a feature, but as i mentioned earlier, there is a fire escape on the left side of the building. this was a neat idea as it helps it feel like a building in new york city, but it is executed very poorly. there is no hole big enough for the minifigs to climb down through, so they would have to climb down the ladders from the outside which makes no sense. no wonder spider-man always needs to rescue people from burning buildings. there is one more play feature in the form of the dumpster. you can open the lid, put a minifig inside, and make them jump by hitting a tab in the back. remember, this is before the introduction of super jumpers, but nevertheless it's a pretty strange place to launch minifigs out of. i guess even super heroes like to do some dumpster diving. you don't think this was funny? no? well, me neither, but that's the type of humor that this show loves to use. sigh. anyway, let's get on to the ratings. ratings design: 2/5 - the set looks ok. despite many inaccuracies, the dbc building and the jet somewhat resemble their on-screen counterparts and don't look too bad, but they definitely could be better. build: 1/5 - a mostly unchallenging and repetitive build with an attrocious amount of stickers. minifigs: 4/5 - definitely the strongest point of the set. some of the figs could be better, but four out of five of them are exclusive to this set. doctor doom is easily the best and probably the most desirable one - unless the fant4stic movie portraits him so badly that nobody will be interested in him, but that's impossible. playability: 4/5 - as you would expect from a playset, the playability is quite high, although i still feel like there could have been more. parts: 3/5 - not many rare parts. if you're looking for parts for building your own skyscraper with tan walls and lots of doors and windows though, this set is for you. price: 3/5 - at 476 parts for $50, this set is a bit pricey, but it is somewhat justified by all the large window and wall pieces. overall: 3/5 - this set is mediocre at best. playsets are always a good choice for spider-man sets since they give spidey something to swing from, but unfortunately they are rarely pulled off well. the jet is blocky, the building is bare-bones, and the price feels too high. the only reason to get this set are the four exclusive minifigs. this set was discontinued early this year, but if you still see it on clearance somewhere, go ahead and get one for the minifigs and parts, or buy multiples and use the parts to build a better dbc building. i hope you enjoyed this review. it is part of the reviewers academy's 7th anniversary. we're not doing a big celebration this year due to other commitments, but look out for more reviews with the 7th anniversary banner soon. now, if you'll excuse me, i am off to see fant4stic. i hope it's as fantastic as it promises to be! (2 hours later) i was wrong! i was horribly, horribly wrong!

0 thanks for the review, i've had that set for quite a while, and it's among my favorite marvel superheroes sets actually. compared to the other stuff we usually get to accompany the minifigs... all those "laboratorys", the most recent construction site, and the "hydra fortress" .. yeah... you're being a little harsh here maybe you're still suffering from ptsd after watching fant-four-stic!

0 aegis2000, on 13 september 2015 - 02:32 am, said: this set is from 2013, doctor doom is completely based off the comic version/ tv show version, not the movie in any way. anyways, nice review. i personally own this set, and it's a nice set, but could have been better. he's just joking about doom.

0 i actually am surprised at the poor points this set has gotten, as this is one of my favorite sets that marvel has put out. i actually would like to hear what your thoughts are on the usm - lego dr. doom comparison, oky. thanks for the review. http://marvelanimate...or_doom_usm.png edited by zorglorfian, 14 september 2015 - 06:44 am.

0 i'm glad you were joking about doom. i'm not that big of a fanboy, but i had the need to correct you for some reason. with that said, i bought this set for the minifigures a few years ago. looking back, i don't really care about the figures today like i did in 2013. the building is decent for the size of the set though. thanks for the review.

0 overall, i wish marvel in particular would have more playsets in its theme (batman has several great ones in the dc theme). but then again, if this is the best playset to date for marvel, maybe it's better just to leave well enough alone. i would definitely like to see them attempt something in the $100+ (us) price range because i think it could be good; marvel needs an equivalent to the arkham asylum set. regarding this set, i saved myself some money and bought the 4 minifigs i needed (all but spidey) on bricklink for less than half the set price. edited by dmarvin, 17 september 2015 - 06:25 pm.

0 wow that box is big but i somehow thought it would be even bigger, still it looks like for once lego are actully using all the space inside and not just a fraction like with other sets. cant wait to see more dunamis.....you lucky megablok ;-)

-1 tks for that comparison pic dunamis ;-) ok the box is big !! i pictured it a tad smaller though !! i know what i don't like, its the fact that it has the regular lego star wars logo on top with vader. ucs sets should have a different iconography like they did in the past. sure its a trivial detail but it adds to the fact of owning something special !! after all its the most expensive set ever as of now ;-) happy building !! and we'll wait patiently for some cool pics later on :-p *yoda*

1 good review. *y* me, i can't build it before saturday. :'-(

1 the build: the build is going quicker than i thought. i am sorting as i open the bags that i need. some bags are in multiples so it is easy to pick them out. the build is a tad repetitive as the framework of the ship is somewhat symmetrical. here are some progress shots: note that two plates (1x4 and 1x8) are stacked in between technic beams. then the part below is assembled to hold the structure together. this took about an hour of sorting and building: i'll post another update tomorrow.

0 xwingyoda, on sep 30 2007, 11:57 am, said: are these yellow parts new ? i am not a technic fan and never saw these before. you don?t have the building crane 7905 either? same color, same shape there: piece no. 32555 (four of them included) i assume you?re not a town fan? :-p ;-)

1 excellent review with great pics and cameo appearances by some of our eb favs *y* definitely a set that was on my 'to get' list already, and this only confirms that. might make me want two, just because i love tan so much and i'd like to see if something could be done to bulk up that car. great job as always! :-)

1 thank you very much for the review sinner. i definitly *wub* this set. this will make a great addition for us "townies". i thought the size was too small. i plan to make my house fit practically the whole baseplate. plus i will definitly add floors, that looked :-d . i can't believe tlc skimped on the floors.

1 thanks for this review sinner! i love this house, with the nicely made tiled corners, the colorscheme and the garage. the only thing i dislike about this set is the way the windows are attached in train windows (so they turn inwards a little) instead of the usual frames with shutter-attachment-ability. but that is something that can be fixed in the blink of an eye. i will certainly buy this house some day when i find it at reasonable price.

1 thanks for the review sinner! i definitely want this set now. the mixed rough and smooth roof bricks would annoy me on a model like the mtt, but here it looks as is if the roof is quite old with some parts being worn and pitted and some parts being replaced with new roof tiles. i quite like the effect. i agree on which is the best vehicle, and if it doesn't fit minifigs, just mod the heck out of it! x-d

1 sweet! looks like an awesome set. i might get it, i have to see. looks like it has a lot of good parts. -zots

0 hi, you've done well on the pictures! but i agree with freekysch; a little more text would be great. ever thought about joining the reviewer's academy?

0 writing a decent review will indeed take some time. but you don't need to do it in a single session. if "each time" is 4/5 hours, you can write a review in 2 x "each time"

1 i actually bought this set last monday as it was reduced to 14.99.....it actually not a bad little set considering the size and part count, has a decent array of functions. its a nice little set....the b model looks just as good so i might buy a second set, as you get the bucket left over and i need that bucket for another set. edited by richard dower, 19 october 2015 - 04:42 pm.

1 remember when i said in my review of 7090 to expect a review after i went to toysrus? well, somehow things didn?t work out, but fortunately i?m finally reviewing my latest purchases, starting with 7091 catapault defense, which happens to be one of the best sets in the castle line. the box and instructions: lego box art is at it?s highest point ever these days, with lots of special effects and great action poses. the castle theme is no exception, and 7091 isn?t either. i?ll let the box speak for itself: i love the back of the castle boxes as well, since they give another action scene and other neat info like a layout of all the accessories. the contents: only the bare essentials as usual: piece bags and instructions. i seriously wish they still put mini catalogs inside sets like they did when i was young, but i guess they are too expensive to make or something. ah well, can?t have everything. no picture of the instructions this time, but since that isn?t necessary i?ll just say that they are fine, and do not have a problem with distinguishing dark gray from black. the pieces: here?s your basic shot of every piece included, minus a few extra pieces like an extra viking horn and black skeleton leg. not too shabby for a 10 usd set. there?s a lot of nice pieces in 7091, as you can see (and this doesn?t include the accessories or minifig parts!). the brown plates, wheels, and spoked things are always useful, and the dark blue and gold slopes are really cool. however, there?s also a fair amount of technic in here, so be warry. as usual for the castle line, 7091 has a heaping helping of accessories. most of them are old pieces recolored, but the ball on chain (what?s the actual name, could someone tell me?) and the shields are brand new. i actually like the new skeleton weapon, since it?s fairly detailed and was really the only way tlc could make a part like that. and yes, the shields are printed (quite nicely too, if i do say so myself). plus, you get viking horns (always useful to have), a grey boulder, a basket, and 3 helmets. not a half bad deal, eh? oh, who am i kidding ? it?s awesome! minifigures: ah yes, one of the highlights of any castle set. you get 2 soldiers and 2 skellies this time, all with different weapons. the two soldiers are just regular crown troops with different faces ? nothing special, except that they are awesome anyway. the skeletons on the other hand are much more interesting: an archer and a black skellie! archers cool, of course, but i know many don?t like the printing on the black skeletons. well, let me say that i don?t mind it so much. the only real problem is that the eyes are dark red instead of just red, which makes the printing a bit less noticeable. and i?ve been through it before that the new skeleton molds in general don?t bother me at all ? go skeletons! the finished set: alright, there?s two builds in this set, and i?ll start with the smaller: the skeleton barricade. okay, so it?s nothing special, but it?s cool all the less. the shield on the front and the slanted spears are nice touches. here?s just how the skeletons can tower over their own barricade: with a little step. ah, the catapault. the lovely catapault. seriously, i love tlc?s design. very effective, and also very realistic, especially compared to kk. love the side details and the swiveling base, and you gotta love the clever use of that basket. playability: yes, i?ve made it a tradition now to write stories for any castle set i buy (and this isn?t the last one, you can be sure of that!). here?s one featuring everything in 7901: oh, and here?s a small ship i made out of all the pieces in this set plus a couple extra figures and weapons from my copy of 7901. not half bad, imo, considering what i had to work with. overall rating: presentation: 9/10 pieces: 8/10 minifigures: 9/10 finished model: 9/10 playability: 8/10 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ final score: 8.6/10 once again, i highly recommend the reviewed set. castle is possibly the best theme this year, and this set is one of many that prove it. as with all castle sets, it?s best if you buy several if you want to truly enjoy it, but this set alone is also impressive in both design and pieces and minifigures. get at least one if you have even a slight liking for castle. edited by kimt, 10 august 2008 - 01:31 pm.

1 very nice review! i like the amount of pics and that alternate model. i wouldn't have thought of making a ship from those parts, i once made a larger, crownie-ized skellie barrier instead.

1 thanks for the review grevious! i already have this set, but i loved your comic and that nice alternate model! *y* ttfn! >:-)

1 that was a fun review, i picked up a couple of these on holiday in france and it was one of the main reasons i went all-out and bought the rest of the castle range! dr. s.

1 that's a superb review if i ever saw one, and another great story! *y* it's a good review even though i got the set 4 months ago. :-p this just reinforces my like for it. :-p

1 nice review, i like this set alot. *y* :-)

1 great review! *sweet* i wasn't aware that the catapult rotated either... this set isn't on my buy list though as it is all more of the same for me. thanks for the cool moc! :-d i always plan to add a moc to my reviews but i always run out of time.... :'-(

1 it's that time of year again when the days get shorter, the nights get colder, and children all around the world stare longingly into warmly lit toy shops and prepare their wishlist to send to santa. this is also the time when the lego group releases their latest winter village set which has been an annual tradition for the past seven years. these sets have been very popular, especially among afols, and are always highly anticipated. however, while some entries in this series have been more popular than others, none has been as controversial as this year's set, the winter toy shop, which is a re-release of the first winter village set, 10199 winter toy shop from 2009. it seems that many think that this set didn't need to be remade and would have preferred a new set instead, or that it is not different enough from the original and will be redundant in a completionist's collection. does it deserve all the hate? let's find out. disclaimer: i don't own the 2009 version, so i can't compare them visually, but i will do my best to let you know what is different in this version. if you do need a visual reference, you can refer to svelte's excellent review of the original. set number: 10249 name: winter toy shop theme: creator year of release: 2015 pieces: 898 minifigs: 8 price: 59.99 / $79.99 / 69.99 s@h description: quote welcome to the winter toy shop! the holiday season has arrived and the toymaker is busy finishing off his latest creations! outside, children ski and snowboard, and a freshly built snowman sparkles in the light that shines from the toyshop tower. help decorate the huge tree that stands at the center of the square, play with the curious kitten on the cozy wooden bench or join in with the carolers beneath the ornate streetlamp. this charming set also features a ladder, trees in various sizes, jack-in-the-box, a toy biplane, helicopter, rocket, train, race car, truck, robot, tugboat, teddy bear and a wrapped gift. have fun building this enchanting winter wonderland! includes a snowman and 8 minifigures with assorted accessories: a male caroler, female caroler, a woman, 2 men, 2 boys and a girl. s@h bricklink brickset the box the box art of this set is similar to that of the original, but there are some notable differences. the christmas tree is on the right side of the image this time while the park bench is on the left and of course it features this year's design for creator boxes with the dark blue stripe along the right side and the "expert" logo in the top right corner. there's also a small picture of the back of the toy shop and the background looks less cartoony than on the original. the back is also very similar, showing a different angle of the toy shop along with some close-ups, although this time there is no minifig lineup. instead, the minifig lineup is on the right side of the box. it also includes the accessories that each minifig comes with and some of the toys. on the left side of the box there is a thumbnail of the box art and the set name in six different languages. they also want to make sure that you know that there are batteries included by saying it in dozens of languages. the top of the box features the inventory and a 1:1 scale reference with the female caroler. on the bottom there is a picture that reminds you that there is a light brick included in this set, in case that wasn't clear from the front of the box, and it confirms that yes, it is a bad idea to put it in water, in case you were planning to go swimming with your winter toy shop. the contents inside the box there are two instruction booklets and two groups of bags, one for each instruction booklet. while two groups of bags is not as many as there usually are in other sets of this size, it's still better than the first version of this set where the bags weren't numbered at all, so this makes the build a bit easier. the large bag in group 1 and the two large bags in group 2 have a white stripe going down the middle of the bag and only have one group number printed on it along with some other number and some kind of scan code. i have no idea why they made this distinction for these bags or what that code is for, so if any of you know the purpose of this, please let me know in the comments below. here is a random instructions page. as you can see, the building steps can get quite challenging as they sometimes include many different pieces in one step, especially when it uses a lot of brown pieces which are very dark and hard to see in the instructions, living up to the set's status as an expert-level set. most of the time, though, the instructions are pretty clear and easy enough to follow. there are some parts in new colors in this set that weren't in the first version or any other set until now, such as that large, flat technic arch in dark green, the jester hat in orange and blue, one of those new 2z2 round jumper tiles in brown, a golden frog(!), and a snowboard in dark blue. there are also some rare friends parts that make their creator debut here such as the skis in azure and that new clear 1x1 round tile with a tiny tube coming out of it which is usually used as a stand for friends accessories and is a very useful piece, especially for snot techniques (and no, i'm not talking about the type of snot that many people usually have stuck in their nose around this time of year). there are some printed parts as well, such as the clock tile, the letter tile, and the register slope like in the first version of the set. we also get a new face print for the white cat which is more in line with other modern cat designs. but the best part is the shop sign which is printed this time around. it features a lovely wood pattern, the words "toy shop", and a toy soldier on both sides of the sign. which is ironic since the shop doesn't seem to sell any toy soldiers like this, but it looks so good on the sign that i won't sue them for false advertising. the minifigs let's start with the most unique figures in this set, the carolers. these two were also the highlight in the first version of the set, but in the original they both had the same head (this one -> ) which featured a very questionable facial expression that could easily be taken out of context. in this version, they have unique faces which look much better and help distinguish their gender. the male caroler uses lord vampyre's torso which looks quite snazzy on him. maybe this is lord vampyre before he became a vampire? the female caroler is easily the best minifig in the set, though, because in addition to her exclusive head, she also gets an exclusive torso and skirt print! a huge improvement over the generic unprinted one in the original. she also gets the queen hair in dark brown and aragorn's lined cape instead of two combined regular capes. this set truly is the return of the queen! the snowman is technically not a minifig, but as you can see here, he is exactly as tall as one and he is the first thing you build after the minifigs, so i included him here. he has mostly the same design as before, except this time he has robot claws for arms instead of levers. which is good since they allow him to hold accessories such as his broom. his carrot nose is included separately again. the carolers both have back printing while the snowman looks no different from the back than he does from the front. here you can see the black side of the female's cape. this lined cape is so much nicer than the solution they used in the original. next up we have what i assume is a married couple who are likely the parents of at least one of the kids, as well as the toymaker who i will call geppetto. the man in the pinstripe suit was not included in the first version of the set, so he's a bonus minifig! these guys are fairly generic, but they have some detailed torso prints, so they look pretty nice. geppetto seems to have gotten younger since the release of the original set since his gray hair has now turned dark tan and he doesn't seem to need glasses anymore. the men both have back printing, but the woman is the only one in this set who doesn't get a back print. why you gotta be so discriminating against women, lego?! last but not least, there are the kids. one of the boys wears dark blue pants, a green jacket, and a wool cap. he looks a bit like a lumberjack, so let's call him lumberjack boy, or jack for short. the little girl wears an outfit that wouldn't look out of place in the friends theme with a lavender scarf and pants. i'll call her lavender. the second boy is wearing an octan jacket and a sports helmet which makes it ironic that he is the one not doing any winter sports on the box art. i'll call him president business junior, or pbj for short. all of the kids have fairly detailed back printing which makes up for the fact that much like the adults, they are made out of mostly common parts. pbj's helmet and scarf cover up the back of his head nicely which is important as you will see in the next picture. what's also great about these figs is that half of them have a double-sided head. here you can see pbj doing his best macaulay culkin impression. i also removed his scarf so you can see the printing on his torso better. but he's not the only one who seems to be easily scared. the mother also has a very alarmed expression. maybe she got surprised by the jack-in-the-box or maybe she just realized how expensive toys are nowadays. you can see the female caroler's back printing here. her alternate expression is a non-singing face which is very nice to have and i wish the male caroler could have one too. she looks quite cute with those rosy cheeks. but the most adorable out of all of them has to be the little girl. she comes with a pouting sad face that will melt your heart. please, don't cry! i'll buy you any toy you want, just stop looking at me like that! the build the first half of the build is dedicated to the surroundings of the toy shop. it includes the christmas tree, the park bench, the snowman, the toys, the carolers, jack and lavender. the large bag contains two smaller bags with small pieces, a white box that contains the caroler's cape, and the jester hat in its own little bag. the first thing you build after the minifigs and the snowman is the toys. this version of the set has a lot more toys than the original which is good because i always felt that the first toy shop was a bit light on toys. also, the ones that were in the original have been updated. for example, instead of the two pairs of skis, you now get one pair of skis that use the new ski mold and a snowboard. the jack-in-the-box is mostly the same, except it now has an orange and blue color scheme instead of the red and blue from the original. this change was probably not necessary, but hey, at least we get a new jester hat out of it. and instead of the brick-built teddy bear you get the new teddy bear mold. i have mixed feelings about this change because i actually kinda liked the brick-built teddy design and using a specialized mold seems to be going against the spirit of creator sets, but on the other hand i can't deny that the molded teddy looks better than the blocky old one. meh. the new toys include a tugboat which has some rounded technic pieces as its hull, a biplane, a rocket, a helicopter, and a truck that cleverly uses roller skates for its wheels. these are all quite brilliant designs that feel like micro versions of lego city sets and make a great addition to the set. here is a back view of some of the more complex models. as you can see, the friends accessory stand has been cleverly used to hold the biplane's fin in place and to provide a stand for the helicopter. the jack-in-the-box has a hinged lid. the only thing that bugs me a bit is the t-piece on top of the helicopter that holds the rotor in place, but i can't think of any better way they could have done it. next is the ladder that is used to decorate the tree which is exactly the same as the first version. the supports are on a click-hinge, so they can be adjusted or folded away. then, you build the tree itself. you begins, of course, with the stand which is mostly the same design as before, but this time the plates at the bottom are brown instead of white and have golden studs as feet. next, you build the first layer of branches. the main difference in this version of the tree is that this one actually has a brown stem rather than just a technic axle on which you stack the layers of branches one by one. you wont be able to see the stem in the final result, but i like this change as it makes the tree more realistic. then you add the second layer of branches. this one doesn't have lights/candles and attaches to the lower layer at an angle using the four trans-yellow studs close to the stem. the third layer is added. this one has lights again. each layer is similar in that they are all made out of green plates that are built around a 4x4 ring plate, but they get smaller each time and are constructed differently enough for the build not to feel repetitive. with the addition of the fourth layer, we get close to finishing the tree. lastly, you add one more layer and the tip of the tree. now it's time to decorate the tree! however, it's not as fun as it sounds since that requires you to add lights to the two chains/ropes first which can get a bit repetitive. the clips holding the lights to the chain were white, but this time they're pearl gold which looks much nicer in my opinion. the next part of the build is the park bench with the streetlamp and the little tree. this is a fairly quick build with not much to it. the fishbowl helmet parts are a useful piece that you don't see too often, so it's nice to get them again in this remake. the design is pretty much the same as in the original set except for the wreaths on the streetlamp which use a green life preserver instead of a round 2x2 plate. this is another instance where they use a specialized piece instead of a brick-built solution, but i'm okay with that because unlike with the teddy bear, this part was not originally intended to be a wreath, so it's still nice part usage. the second half of the build is dedicated to the toy shop itself and includes the couple, geppetto, and pbj. please note that there is a fourth 6x10 plate burried under the parts. you begin by tiling the floor, setting up the walls, and adding the interior items such as the fireplace, the cash register, and the toy displays. next, you add the walls, windows, and the door and the ground floor of the shop is finished. so far, the build is the same as the old toy shop, except this time they decided to have the white stripes on the marquees be the longer ones instead of the dark red ones for some reason. i don't know why they did this and kinda would have preverred to get dark red 1x1 plates instead of white, but it doesn't detract from the look of the shop, so i don't really care. now we begin with the upper floor. this is where things start to look a little different. can you tell the difference? the difference is that this time they attach the roof using clip-hinges instead of bulky technic constructions which gives you more space on this floor and allows it to look more like an actual attic. they even tile the floor next to the frog clock. aftter adding the roof, the build is finished. the main roof feels a bit loose since it's only attached to the building by one side. i'm not sure if this was an issue in the old toy shop, but it's not a big deal. i just wouldn't pick the set up by the roof. what i do like is that they used double cheese slopes on the awning on the outer wall of the tower instead of singles which makes it a bit easier to build. i like how the supports under the tower roof now match those of the main roof. the wreaths have also been updated like the ones on the streetlamp. and those technic arches under the roof look a lot more like garlands now. on the original, they were dark gray, so i didn't even know they were supposed to be garlands and assumed they were part of the architecture. the shop sign looks a lot better now that it is printed. the old one just looked like a white flag. i also like how the small plates under the marquee give it a wavy look and they included two trees in different sizes on the right side of the shop. the back is nice and open and allows you to see the rest of the toys, the robot, train, and race car, all of which have just as much of a simple and clever design as the other toys. the clock looks much nicer with the new golden frog. because golden frogs make everything better. spare parts there are quite a few small parts left over, including a roller skate and one of those friends accessory stands which will come in handy. the complete set here you can see the full set together. it looks quite nice and festive with all the little details and there are many scenes that you can play out with it: you can have the minifigs decorate the tree, have the kids play in the snow, have the carolers sing by the bench, have the toymaker build some toys in his workshop, or have the parents buy presents for their kids. it's a festive, toy-filled winter wonderland! the fireplace looks cozy and i like the brick pattern going up the chimney. the entrance of the shop looks a bit empty aside from the cash register. i feel like they could have displayed some more toys here, but oh well. being a set targeted at teens and adults, there aren't really any play features aside from the light brick which is attached to a hinge, so you can either activate it by pressing the button with your finger or tilting the brick upward so that the button is pressed against the roof. however, since the roof is not connected in the middle and only attached on the sides, it tends to split open a bit when you do that, so i'm not sure if attaching the roof this way here was such a good idea. nevertheless, it looks quite nice when the light is lit. ratings design: 5/5 - this set is as gorgeous as it was back in 2009! the small updates that they made are mostly good ones, although the absence of a brick-built teddy is a bit disappointing and the new way the roof is attached, while not as bulky as before, makes the roof slightly unstable, but those are just nitpicks. build: 5/5 - there are some interesting building techniques here, such as those on the tree, the roof, and the toys. the fact that the parts are only split into two groups and the part callouts can get fairly complex makes it a challenging, enjoyable build. minifigs: 5/5 - they did a great job updating the figs in this set. while only 3 of the torsos in the original had any printing, all of the torsos have printing front and back in this set, even the skirt and cape of the female caroler. you get two exclusive heads and half of the heads are double-sided, plus you get 8 instead of 7 minifigs. you really can't ask for more in a creator set. playability: 4/5 - this set is more meant to be displayed than to be played with, but there are plenty of things to play with if you want. all the different minifigs, accessories, and set pieces make for endless possibilities for play. it's especially fun to swoosh the micro vehicles around. parts: 3/5 - there are lots of good parts here. most of them are fairly common, but there are some rare parts and some even in exclusive colors. price: 4/5 - this set costs $20 more than the original, but considering that this set has nearly 900 pieces, including some rare and exclusive ones, as well as more minifigs with much better printing, i think $80 is still a fair price. overall: 5/5 - so what's my opinion of this set? for a remake, i think it's great. they managed to make a good set even better. are the changes minor? yes. are they an improvement? mostly, yes. were they necessary? perhaps not, but it's good that they made them instead of just re-releasing the exact same set. so if you didn't get the first winter toy shop, i can highly recommend getting this one. if you do already have the old version, this one might still be worth picking up for the hugely improved minifigs and rare parts alone. as for the controversy over re-releasing the winter toy shop, i can see where the haters are coming from, but i find their complaints to be quite petty. i can understand if you're disappointed because you already have the first winter toy shop and were looking forward to a new set this year, but there's always next year. if you're a completist and feel like tlg is forcing you to buy a set you don't need, you're wrong. nobody is forcing you to buy anything but yourself. if you decide to buy every set in a theme no matter what it is, that's your problem, not lego's. so put down your torches and pitchforks and just be glad that they improved the set design and gave us another chance to buy this classic set. there are far worse things that can happen in this world than lego re-releasing one of their most popular sets. sorry for that little rant. so what is your opinion on re-releases like this? please cast your vote in the poll above. i hope you enjoyed this special eurobricks reviewers academy review and would like to thank the lego group for the opportunity to review this set. happy holidays everyone!

0 hobbythom, on 29 november 2015 - 04:07 pm, said: great review. you almost make me want to buy one. i don't know what it is with these sets. on the one hand they are so nicely designed and cute on the other side i never seriously consider buying one. i can't explain what it is that holds me back. a lack of money, maybe? that's the thing that usually holds me back. anyway, i have the older version, so i am not interested in this set.

1 regarding the reason for the different designs on the inner bags, i think that the white stripe is the new version, with the non-stripe version being old. i suspect the reason some sets have both versions is simply that they're still using up some of their supply of older bags. good review. i didn't realise there were quite as many changes as you highlighted (tree, roof etc).

0 cheers for putting up the review. some nice improvements, but not enough for me to pick it up. the original set is good enough for me. pity the poll has no option "yes, but only in addition to new sets, not in stead of new sets". edited by withacee, 01 december 2015 - 09:38 am.

0 thanks for the review. they definitely improved upon the original, but since i already own the original, i can't justify this set also, unfortunately. it seems to be the trend. but i'm sure there are a lot of first timers out there too that will snatch this up since it is a really lovely building. and the updates make it better for sure.

0 thanks for the kind comments everyone! i like hearing your opinions on this set. withacee, on 01 december 2015 - 09:37 am, said: pity the poll has no option "yes, but only in addition to new sets, not in stead of new sets". i don't think that would be a realistic option as that would mean that they would have to spend twice the resources on this theme which i don't think they are ready to do, but if more people would like this option, i can add it to the poll. joebot, on 01 december 2015 - 08:33 pm, said: after mocking people for holding a particular opinion, you then turn around and ask people to express their opinion?? no thanks. i guess i'll keep my opinions to myself. i certainly don't want to be labeled a "hater." i'm not mocking anyone. i just think that some people need to calm down a bit and that tlg is getting more hate than they deserve for this set, but that's just my opinion and you're welcome to disagree with it. everyone is entitled to their own opinion, including you and me. and yes, i would love to hear your thoughts on this matter because i would like to have a friendly discussion on this subject.

1 i didn't own the original toy shop so i bought it this time around. i just finished building it saturday and i love it! however, i wish they had both re-released this one and came out with a new addition to the village. :)

1 review - 42044 - display team jet introduction the smallest of the 2016 sets, is the display team jet. it doesn't seem to have lots of functionality, but maybe the landing gear is retractable. this set kind of reminds me to the 9394 - jet plane, although it's obviously a lot smaller. as you can read in my review of the 42052 - heavy lift helicopter basically anything flying is +1 for me, so let's find out if this set also fits the bill. note: all images can be clicked for hi-res versions. set information number: 42044 title: display team jet theme: technic released: 2016 part count: 113 box weight: 193 gr box dimensions: 15,4 cm x 13,8 cm x 5,9 cm set price (msrp):  9,99 price per part:  0,088 links: brickset, bricklink the box being a small set, it obviously comes in a small box. the display team jet is an aerobatics jet, used in air shows. on the box it's flying rather high, but at least it's at a safe distance from the crowd. front side shows the main model, together with a small section indicating you can use digital building instructions to build this model. back side the back side shows the b-model, a stunt plane. and again a reference to the apps for digital building instructions. more on the stunt plane later. content of the box the box contains: 2 instructions booklets (a- and b-model) 1 sticker sheet 3 technic liftarms 2 bags instruction booklets both the instructions for the a- and b-model are included in the box. sticker sheet a lot of stickers for such a small set. apparently no panel is left untouched. liftarms three liftarms unsealed, nothing out of the ordinary for a small set. bags two bags containing the rest of the parts. highlighted parts this section describes the new and/or otherwise interesting parts. yellow 5l axles the 5l axle in yellow has never been released before, so it's one of the new parts for this year. black 7l flex axles for the layman this seems a common part, but the 7l soft axle actually has never been released in black before. combined with the re-release of the 19l soft axle in black, this will open up lots of possibilities. for those of you thinking you've read this text before; you are right, the new drag racer contains these new 7l flex axles too. white panels this small set comes with a whopping 10 panels. great for the ones who like panels. not so great if you think tlg is using too much panels lately. rudder this part, the small bionicle wing, is the same as the one used in last year's 42033 - record breaker. part list this set contains 113 parts, all listed below. the build this is the collection of parts, used to build the jet. it sure looks like we are getting a landing gear. the build is fun, but pretty straightforward. there aren't any special or cool techniques used in this set. it almost took me more time to apply all the stickers than to build the actual model. finished model the finished jet does look cool though. the white and yellow color scheme, combined with the stickers, work really well. i have seen people refer to the plane as being orange, but it's definitely yellow. technic (or lego in general) tends to have some color variation when it comes to yellow. i do concur this is the warmer variant of yellow, but it's not orange. the back of the plane looks nice too, although i am not a big fan of the rudder part. it looks too detailed, compared to the other panels. it's not a big deal though, and maybe it's just me. parts left only three common parts left. features and functions this set has a single feature and that is a retractable landing gear. it's operated by the black 12t double bevel gear near the cockpit. in the following picture you can see the landing gear retracted. this image shows the landing gear when the plane is ready for landing. hopefully the pilot will roll the plane before landing, but you probably know what i mean video here's s short video demonstrating the display team jet. b-model this set also includes the building instructions for the b-model, a stunt plane. the building experience for the stunt plane is more or less the same as for the jet. well, what do you expect when both models are planes with a limited number of parts. for an alternative model the stunt plane looks fine. there's not a lot of functionality in this plane, but it's worth mentioning that the tail wheel allows the plane to roll on a flat surface. the plane also has working propellors. both functions are demonstrated in the video. unfortunately, the landing gear of the stunt plane is not retractable. parts left a couple of extra leftover parts, but it's nice to see that most of the parts have been used in the b-model as well. actually, there's probably an extra yellow technic smooth 1/2 bush left. i just found it on my desk, but it could belong to one of the other sets. video here's a video demonstrating the stunt plane. summary two nice planes for 13 bucks, that's basically what you get. both models look good and the set has some interesting new parts. especially the 7l flex axle will be very popular. it comes with a decent collection of white panel, although they are very common nowadays. both models have limited functionality, but each of them has at least one function to give the model some playability for kids, other than the swooshability that is. okay, it might lack some proper functions, but i still think kids will love this set. i can see kids running around with one of the planes in their hands. all in all i think this set delivers what you'd expect. score let's see how this set flies! remember that the grades are based on it being a small set. obviously a set like this, cannot be compared with a mercedes flagship. 8 design for a small set, the model looks very authentic. 7 building experience no surprises. 7 features just the retractable landing gear. 8 playability it has swooshability, so i see kids running around with this model. 7 parts lots of panels, if you are into that. 8 value for money can't go wrong with these small sets. 7,5 fun for kids more image can be found on my flickr page. thank you for reading. i hope you enjoyed it.

-1 while i can see kids enjoying this, i'm not sure i would buy. the flex axles are nice, and it is a decent number of white panels but i think i would get better return out of a larger parts set. fantastic review though, and your pictures show off this tiny model better than the box art does.

1 thanks for the nice review! the landing mechanism looks quite cute. aren't the yellow axles 5l, not 4l? (very strange that they would release such a part).

1 hi there, nice model, great review! i almost reverse engineered this model, but used wrong parts for landing wheels, didn't know how to fix the nose proper, and so on. so i was very interested in this model and i like playing with it. i love the reviews, but i think i have to mention, that the yellow axle must be a 5l! the picture shows a 5l, and a 5l would fit the size of the model. the cart has also a 5l in yellow. what sitze is the yellow axle in this seit. really 4l as written in the text? greetings, robert

0 i seem to have been messing up axle lengths in various reviews it's indeed 5l. my bad. thanks for pointing it out.

1 very nice review for a nice little set! i especially like the smoothness of operation for the retractable landing gear. i don't like the lack of symmetry for the propeller of the b model though, but understand the alternative would be to add one extra small panel to the set, or skip two of them in the b model.

1 good review, as always jim when i first saw this set i thought that it would make a great parts pack for me, as that i have about 20 white pieces in my technic collection (all from 42043) and this set has some really useful ones, all for a cheap price. those 7l flex axles will be extremely useful in my current build i'm doing

1 nice review, even with the missing demonstration video of the a-model! looks like this is an excellent panel pack for the price, and those soft axles will go down a treat. will this set be the dark horse of 1h 2016...?

0 jay psi, on 02 december 2015 - 12:10 am, said: nice review, even with the missing demonstration video of the a-model! hmmm strange. let me fix that.

0 set is only interesting for the panels, that's all it is to me

1 so this set showed up in stores yesterday, and i immediately picked two up. all in all it is a nice set, but it is slightly different from what i was expecting, the plane feels a bit "flat", pointy nose, wide bottom etc.. and while the panels work very well as wings, it feels a bit simplistic to just have single-part wings. the stickers really work for it though. its a cracking set though, nice parts pack, and a nice model as well

1 got this at the weekend, mainly for the parts, but built it first. agreed with other comments - awesome swooshability.

1 review - 42046 - getaway racer introduction starting with the 42010 - off-road racer and 42011 - race car in 2013, tlg released two sets in the first half of each year, using a pullback motor. the pullback motor allows the model to be pulled back, followed by forward motion. usually there's no apparent relation between the two set, other than the ability to combine them into an alternate build. this year there seems to some sort of cops and robbers scene going on. a getaway racer and a police interceptor. that can't be a coincidence. makes you wonder who will be victorious, the good guys or the bad guys. let's find out! note: all images can be clicked for hi-res versions. set information number: 42046 title: getaway racer theme: technic released: 2016 part count: 170 box weight: 302 gr box dimensions: 26,0 cm x 13,8 cm x 5,9 cm set price (msrp):  19,99 price per part:  0,118 links: brickset, bricklink the box the box has the same dimensions as previous year's pullback motor sets. in the lower right corner there's a visual explanation of the pullback mechanism. the dark model with it's decals sure looks like a cool hot rod. content of the box the box contains: 1 instructions booklet 1 sticker sheet 2 technic liftarms 1 pullback motor 3 bags instruction booklet just a single booklet. unfortunately no booklet for the alternate model. sticker sheet the sticker sheet contains a lot of cool stickers with flames and skulls etc. pullback motor and liftarms the pullback motor and two liftarms are found unbagged. bags a total of three bags containing the majority of the parts. highlighted parts this section describes the new and/or otherwise interesting parts. actually, this set is the only set of 1h 2016 which doesn't use any new parts, not even parts in a new color. tires the getaway racer uses four low profile tires (tire 37 x 22 zr). rims the rims are wheel 30.4mm d. x 20mm in pearl gold, found in 12 other sets. panels this set contains three #3 panelsand three #4 panels in black. part list this set contains 171 parts, all listed below. the build this being a small model, i won't show any building steps. let's skip right to the finished model. below you can see the end result. in my opinion the model looks great. it's got that hot rod vibe going on and the stickers add darkness to the vibe. slight problem with this set is that it really needs the stickers to finish the look. otherwise it's quite dull, with black and dark grey liftarms and panels. the rear view shows the pullback motor connected directly to the rear axle. in this image you can also clearly see the exhaust pipes on the side, which are very well executed. the 3x3 technic discs with stickers, used in the rim, result in only seeing a part of the rim. this works very well with the golden rims. the bottom view shows the chassis of the car. nothing really noteworthy, as you would expect from a pullback set. video the following video gives you an overview of the finished model. parts left these six parts are left after building the model. seems about right. features and functions this being a pullback motor set, it only has a single feature. the video below demonstrates the acceleration of the vehicle. my girlfriend was kind enough to catch the model before it fell to the ground. or did it hit something before it fell to the ground?! video this video shows the pullback functionality. b-model the alternate model is a combined build with the police interceptor, which you can see on the back of the box. unfortunately the instructions for the combined b-model are not included, so i didn't get a chance to build it. this would make for a fun challenge, building the b-model without the instructions. summary pullback sets are not the most technically advanced models, so you can't expect any other functionality than hitting the walls in your house. however, i think they are very appealing to kids. the fact that this year's pullback sets form a duo adds to the fun. in my opinion tlg hit the nail on the head with the getaway racer and police interceptor. the getaway racer looks very badass, which is something you don't see every day in a technic set. score how do i grade the bad guy in this year's duo. 8 design it looks so cool, but it does need the stickers. 7 building experience nothing out of the ordinary. 7 features limited to the pullback-and-drive functionality. 7 playability combined with the police interceptor, kids will love it. it does need it's nemesys though. 7 parts collection of common parts. gold rims could be interesting. 8 value for money pullback sets always deliver a certain value. 7,3 hit it! more image can be found on my flickr page. thank you for reading. i hope you enjoyed it.

0 one hero will now have just enough of that pullback motor to create one ultimate machine, thanks to this.

0 theitalianbrick, on 01 december 2015 - 09:32 am, said: jim great reviews but can i suggest you one thing? take some pics before you apply the stickers....and some with the stickers on! it helps to have a comparison! you are right. i came to the same conclusion when writing the review. i tell you it doesn't look that good without stickers, but i don't have a picture to prove it. to be honest; i compared it to the model posted in the 2016 topic a few days ago. i applied the stickers before building the model, so i wasn't able to make a proper comparison. i will keep it in mind for future reviews. thanks for the suggestion.

0 are parts #62462 in flat or metallic silver?

1 great review with high quality pictures, well done!! i'm glad you took the time to do it properly. cool that you have built both models. i agree with the mudguards. they sure look good on this model.

1 excellent review! worth waiting for. the set itself is very interesting. looks like it may have one interesting build techniques. thanks for the review, andy ad

1 think this is the only 1h set i'll be getting. guess i'm waiting for 2h for the rest of the construction stuff! this set looks okay to me; it includes the instructions for both models, which is cool, and includes some great parts. i like that it's not just another bucket loader and that it actually tries something different, too.

-1 great review and great pictures ! many thanks for talking the time to review this set . i am a fan of lego technic construction stuff, but this set is not so appealing to me. but, then again i am sure some people will love it.

-1 great review! one thing reaaaaaally bothers me about this set, both models have the engine connected to one wheel, the other wheel on the "powered" axle is just left to rotate freely, and that really bothers me, as it did in 42022 (on 42022 even more tbh, since its main feature is being a frigging car). looking at the pics it isnt even a space issue (as it was in the hot rod, where they "needed" to route the steering through), so they just cheaped out and didnt bother fitting a diff in there (or even a live axle link) im not very interested in this set (not into construction stuff), but i think this is a worrying trend :(

1 thanks for review, mostlytechnic. not a must have for me, but this set have nice assortment of parts... new turntable, new panels (i like yellow). and if i'll buy two of this sets - i'll get enough wheels for proper 18-wheeler. and rubber connectors, that i almost don't using at all, but want to have more and more) edited by victor imaginator, 06 december 2015 - 02:19 pm.

0 definately a quirky set, i think i'd have prefered a bucket on the front with a complex lift and tip mechanism, but a grab is different. as for the b model, i may prefer it's functions to the a model, certainly something different we have not seen before.

1 nice mod there, effe, might inspire me when i get one and start modding it

-1 cool mod by effe. but the original model out of the box is one of the poorest models tlg ever released. looks from front to rear as a cheaped out set with really lazy design effort. a shame for the responsible lego designer parts assortment seems to be ok but this should not be the most important criteria sry jim, i really appreciate your always very well done reviews and offen i agree with the overall judgements/verdicts and of course tastes are different but especially that review sounds like gushing praise in my ears.... just my 2 ct edit: ooops just saw the review isn't done by jim...<blush>... so sry jim... now my final comment belongs to mostlytechnic edited by kumbbl, 27 december 2015 - 07:33 am.

0 a forum member on doktor brick has said he will make an instruction

1 again, great review with superb pictures. the white and blue certainly works very well with your dark backdrop. thorough review for such a small model. small in size but great as a set. tell me, why did i let you review this one?!

0 quote and the dumbing-down continues. now they have to show people to compare axle lengths to the 1:1 prints on the page that have always been there. but how does the 1:1 work on the app? might have to look into that... (for the record... i pulled out my phone and tried to find the app in the google store. couldn't find it. so then i went to the lego website shown on the page and it had a link to it. turns out it wasn't showing up because it's tablet only, so google wasn't showing it to me on my phone. i'll try again later with a tablet...) funny thing is that they changed colour of 7l axle to yellow, and on that picture it still is in lbg.

-1 thank you for the review. i have this one in my pile to build. i wish there was more of the curved blue panels though.

1 very timely review jim. my wife has just surprised me by giving me this set a few days ago and i have just built the a model two days ago and b model yesterday. i agree with all that you wrote above. i don't have tumbler tires but i have 9398 tires. driving is smooth but steering + suspension will be bad as you said due to negative caster and tires hitting the chassis. anyway, tonight i will destroy the b model and rebuilt this http://www.busterhau...8-c-model.html.

0 i think this model is more or less supposed to be a version of this thing. a pretty obscure topic, but also very interesting.

0 how about this one: ps i somehow didn't find this picture when i wrote my review.

0 i could be wrong but i am 100% sure that i've seen this review before.

0 you switched the sides for the panel with the unsymmetrical sticker. otherwise you would see that the cut off part is where there's a beam in front of the panel. that's probably done because the beam could possibly damage the sticker, either while building or while placed against it for a long time. or it's simply omitted because it wouldn't be (completely) visible

-1 jim/anyone....i built this set a few days ago, i dont like the way the crane arm section has no knob to turn the mini turntable. you see the 20 tooth gear?....there is a pinhole located next to this....i would like to add something here to make it easier to turn the winch section.

-1 i don't like appearance of this off-roader at all but i've got it as gift so it's in my technic collection now. when i built it i was very surprised how cool suspension it has and how much playability it features. i've also tried to build some alternative model out of it but without success. anyway thank you jim for great review! edited by tomik, 14 december 2015 - 05:45 pm.

0 the poll doesn't allow you to select 2 from 1-5. it instead says 1, 3, 3, 4, 5. but besides that, your review i give it a 5 because 1) shows the set in all angles 2) shows the characters 3) comment on the little creature comforts of the set 4) added a comic (playability) 5) showed true enthusiasm *y* *wub*

1 it's not too expansive and you get some nice pieces like that jail, the damaged yellow corner and a shako of course *wub* for this i''l give it a 4! very nive review imperial scouts, keep it up! *y* edited by captain green hair, 20 october 2007 - 12:39 pm.

1 for the price it really looks like a nice set. because of the lack of a cannon, i give it a 4. cool comic is! *y* captain roger, on oct 20 2007, 10:59 am, said: i'd give a 2, but you put 3 two times. thanks for the pointer! changed, and i added your vote.

1 nice review, funny little story, and a 4 from me. a useful little set indeed. *sweet*

1 great review, cool comic. *wub* i give the set a four, and i will go and buy it now as i am missing many of those parts.... oh it's not for sale? off to bricklink then! :-d

-1 well i only know the european price: 89.99 euros i think that's quiet expensive against the 2005 police station (7237): 74.99 euros - rupeeclock

1 hello, well as this is my first review i hope you like it. the 7744 police station is simply fanstastic. the many minifigs and the vehicles makes it really nice. the great playabillaty and and great space makes it great for children i think. but latest but not least the pics! general overview: the front of the box: the back of the box: inside the box: top of the box: instructions: the minifigs: the cars: patrol car: dog car: the dog: the motor: well now the police station : the mailbox: the crime report room: the handcuffs holder: handcuff: suspect who wears handcuffs: jails: satelite: little things: water machiene: and if you don?t like water, we have coffee to!: well and as last: the interrogation room: well this was the review. i hope you liked it! bye

1 hooray assuming from the picture on the box we will also be getting the old police car and bike in blue aswell! i really like this set it seems the best police station we've had in a long time and what a great amount of figures! thanks for this great insight the-force! ;-)

0 excellent review copmike! i feel as if i've actually seen the maquette up close in real life. x-d i swear i've even touched it. tack for sharing min kompis! *sweet*

1 awesome! these maquettes are really cool, thanks for the review! *y* ~peace

1 beautiful...i'm really trying to resist these. any word on who's next after boba fett? a c-3po/r2-d2 pair would probably push me over the edge.

-1 copmike, on nov 22 2007, 04:09 pm, said: it's $69.99 + tax :'-(! boba on copmike golly gee, batman! that's too expensive for that, in my view.

1 finally, the highly anticipated luke skywalker maquette! i'm still looking forward to that boba!

1 thanks to this information. it's interesting for me. :-)

-1 not my thing, but a very nice review, thanks for sharing it! i was seriously considering this one when it was originally announced as a 6212 copack item at a particularly good price and then everything changed. i do, however, seriously ache to get my hands on one of the more traditionally lego looking 2ft+ vaders they use in the official stores (at least they had one here in orlando). *wub*

1 during the annual thanksgiving road trip to the relatives, i stopped by the tru in portland, or. lo and behold, the new mars mission sets! obviously, i bought them. ;-) the box: not much to say. standard box art for mm sets, nothing new. the parts: some good parts here. even if you don't like the set (which i highly doubt after i've had my say :-p ), it's a decent parts pack. i noticed that some old parts have been renewed. i know the wheel has been used in the '07 sets, but the cockpit and hitch i haven't seen in a while. the vldss (very large dss). grr. new part. at least, i think it is. someone slap me if it isn't. *wacko* the figs. i know i've seen that head before, but i have no idea where. does anyone know? i was hoping that the aliens would have new arms, at least. i was sadly mistaken... on the upside, i finally discovered that they glow in the dark. :-$ the alien has a jetpack. if that's not the silliest thing i've ever seen, i don't know what is. the build. simple build. a block. so easy a caveman cou- oh, never mind. geico's used that one enough. then, we have this jobber right here. not sure what it is, but it looks like some crystal scanning device. it's starting to look pretty nice. it almost looks practical. the cockpit is suffering from a bad dose of over-stickering. on the upside, we have a new piece there to hold the cockpit on. part 1 complete. it has a nice little radio antenna, which is ruined by the use of a random missile that looks like it's going to shoot the antenna before it shoots the alien. still, i never say no to a good missile i can use for something else. the trailer: fairly simple, but it works. it features stabilizing arms, a handheld saw, and an extremely random mini-bot who's purpose escapes me. the whole meal deal- erm, general pics. overall, i thought this was a good set. in fact, it reminds me of this:

1 i got most of the sets from '07, they're pretty cool.

1 that head might have been from rock raiders. lovely set, and a good review. jifel

0 hmm, not actually a bad set. not high on my 'to buy' list, there're other things up there first, but definitely a possibility somewhere down the line. thanks for the review.

-1 tks for the great review mm ;-) its always appreciated to have reviews of new set. having said that i really don't see the point of that set and its such money and time wasted imo. i don't like that theme apart the dropship and 6wheeler and that tiny vehicle doesn't do the trick for me. i see it as a really cheap excuse to try and please classic space fan with that horrendous mm graphics and what amazes me is that you guys loke that :-d money saved on !! *yoda*

1 during the annual thanksgiving road trip to the relatives, i stopped by the tru in portland, or. lo and behold, the new mars mission sets! predictably, i bought them. i present to you: the mx-41 switch fighter! man, what a long name. the box: standard mm. on the front, it shows the fighter in flight mode, and a yellow note telling you that it transforms. the back shows three pictures showing it happen. the parts: once i open the box, the first thing that comes out is a bent and rolled up instruction booklet, and i was forced to put it under a stack of beer books for an hour. then, there's the dss. yes, two of the stickers do feature a cobra. i wonder why, because this set's decal should be a beatle. x-d decent parts, nothing too special. then, i noticed this little part. it's used for the flick-missiles, but i have no idea what else it would be used for. :-/ the build: the alien ship: when i looked at the box art for this set, i was releived to see that the aliens don't have another curved-forward wing ship. instead, they have this little beauty, which appears to be the alien mini cooper- small and hot. *wub* anyway, partially completed. even if you don't like the set, it has some nice green flame peices, which work nicely for space laser swords. fully completed. the only annoying bit about it is that the crystal-holding thing in front wobbles all over the place. the alien fits into it by way of impalement. it must hurt getting in and out. switch fighter (cockpit): the set makes good use of the alpha team cockpit. for controls, it has a meagre handlebar that the astronaught can't even reach. the rear "shell" of the fighter starts out around the alien containment chamber. it's a bit odd that the containment chamber has an alien sticker, because the instruction booklet lists it as holding crystals. the crystal canister is held back by a technic pin. this is, without a doubt, the ugliest color arrangment ever. warning: mass stickers. :-x the cockpit fits into grooves in the "shell". then it clicks into place in a 1x1 brick with a horizontal clip. the wing "mechanism": the wing. for some reason, the body of the "mechanism" has a blue brick. *wacko* the wing and "mechanism" connect to prevent the fighter doing a nosedive while in tank mode. the wing "mechanism" completed: the underside: the body and wing connect by way of a miscolored red brick. i have no idea why it's red- black would bave been much, much better. completed. tank mode: all in all, this looks pretty neat. the wheel base is pretty short, but it's not bad. transform! the set transforms neatly, if ungainly. without "anti-grav" support, it would fall forward on it's nose each time it transformed. jet mode. it's all right, but it could be a bit better. the "shell" keeps slipping back forward to the "tank mode" because there's nothing to stop it sliding. spare parts: overall: i thought this set was great. it could do with some fixing, such as the mismatched colors, but it should be a definate buy for mm fans. brickshelf gallery (when available)

1 john cleese, on nov 25 2007, 10:56 pm, said: cool review. i'm actually liking that new missile part as it seems to combine a bar with a pin. but it's a real eyesore if you ask me. a needed solution to those blasted flick missles from falling out while swooshing. *sweet* wonder if the range might have an issue seeing it's held in there but who knows, maybe they now "pop" out with a greater velocity than a mere finger flick? i had resorted to technic 1/2 bushings (smooth) to lock in the missile's technic axle (with stud).

1 great review, mr. m! *y* i *wub* those green flames, and the design of the ship is pretty good. thanks for the review, and great pictures! they are clear. big, and describe the set just the way they should.

1 konas2002, on nov 26 2007, 05:21 pm, said: i really like the transforming aspect of this! the one thing i wish mm sets would include would be baseplates. i liked that about the classic space stuff because it really helped create the environment. some "red rock orange" mars baseplates would be great! that?s a really fine idea and would for sure be very cool.... *y*

1 awesome. i can't wait to get my hands on this one.

1 great review hinckley! i know you've been busy, so thank you so much for getting this up! :-d the spine construction is clever, the minirobot's cool, this is a fantastic set! ~peace

1 thanks for that very neat review, hinckley! *y* this set looks indeed very interesting, with a very cool antlike look and a simple but essential overall design. the cockpit seems better protected than many other ef ones, that spine?s lovely and the way these iron drones?re attached is simple but effective. :-) and hey, did i miss something or?re there really no crappy shooting devices...? :-p thanks to the minirobots and their inventor i guess.... :'-)

1 another fantastic review, hinckley. i really like this set, i wasn't to keen on it when i first saw the pictures bit having seen the review, i am starting to like it. it seems quite sturdy, and it makes a change from the usual 2 legged mechs. as well as that purple is welcome anywhere, i have such a shortage of that colour! i like the rusty orange colour of the robots, and their back/jet packs are quite cool, and the mini robot looks sweet.

0 hinckley, on nov 27 2007, 07:47 pm, said: thanks everyone! i'm glad you are enjoying the review. i'm working on the 8118 right now and will have comics up for both starting tonight. the instructions do not have a comic, but i always write one for my reviews featuring my sig-fig or other fabuland creatures interacting with the new set... translation: interacting=whacking! fabuland creatures: sinner, copmike and yoda usually! x-d ;-)

0 don't forget bianca and gavin, o' lordship of pies! :-d truly another excellent review! the pictures are absolutely splendid, as usual! i'm really glad those air-vent pieces were done so well. while i remain skeptical about the new giant spikes, you've sold me on this set! i can't wait to see the fabuland comic and your final verdict, hink!

0 8118 hybrid rescue tank review enjoy guys! i am working on more. maybe we'll have the 8112 battle arachnoid next. the comics will be around eventually. sorry for all the delays and the teasing. i appreciate your patience!!

0 from the lego store in chicago, if i recall his post properly! my goodness hink, you're going to pull an all-nighter for reviews at this rate! oh well, it's kinda worth it, right? :-p

1 thank you for the glimps at the new set hinckley *y* . i saw this set today at my local tru store. the new slope 1x2 pieces look very *sweet* . i definitly see great potential for these pieces on locomotives. i hope these are going to be bountiful in the 2008 lines. model on!!

1 thanks for this great review hinckley! :'-) i know you're loving this attention! x-d :-p i actually like this set, and like it a lot more now that i've seen this review. i'll most likely get, mostly for the figs and parts. i reckon it would look a lot better alongside the rest of the 2008 ef mechs. anyway, thanks for the review! to the brickmobile! >:-)

1 thanks for that good review, hinckley. *y* a really interesting set and a turning point for lego. minirobots instead of shooting crap, pretty cool. i hope the kids?ll like it too. for the design, i love that asymmetrical look of the front part and the sleek guns of the flyer. it?s smart that the gatling gun moves along with the tank, too. the set idea with two vehicles in one?s not new, but very play- able and the treads/big wheel design?s cool. i don?t like the use of studless technic beams, but well, they do their job i guess. and keiken?s cockpit should be easy to improve....

0 can't wait for the extended review!! ;-)

0 jifel, on dec 2 2007, 08:37 am, said: crap! >:-( now i have to spend all my money on this! *wub* *wub* and whats the code? oh well, awesome set, and judt curios, didnt the reviewers used to be bianca and gavin? jifel yes they did! *sweet* i like using me and sinner better, though. i have put fabuland housewives on the back burner for a while, but plan to revive it for the first season conclusion in january. it's nice to see that there are people who really follow it out there. thanks! :-$

1 thanks for this new review, hinckley *wub* for me, it was love at fistr sight with this little set :-p it's simple but nice, and way better than shadow crawler for a spider-like mech *y* you sure will be very busy these days, and your characters will get breakdown before they finish filming all the comics x-d luxorv

1 i would agree. the spider looks really cool. too bad we can't see how the combo mech looks like. instructions are not online yet. :-/ there should be another combo mech but you'll need the storm lasher set. :-p

1 hinkley, you are the man! your reviews just keep on getting better and better! although all of the sets this year are great and i love them all to bits, i can't say there was one that i absolutely felt like something i'd buy except for the storm lasher. but with this review, i think this will be the first purchase of 2008 for me! i totally agree with you on how the spider looks better without mini-robot. but from looking at where the cockpit is placed and how the skull on the cockpit is lodged underneath the walker, maybe the mini-robot would look better mounted underneath the head? that way it looks more even and even gives the thing a nasty set of teeth! i gotta try it out once i get it. can't wait for the fabuland comics! keep it up, hink!

1 oh, i just *wub* theat mini-bot. creepy, but strangely cute... nice piece selection, and the idea of something with rotors that double up as cutters storming (no pun intended) through the jungle ripping it apart is just fantastic (to me, anyway). i'm liking the new swords as rotors blades, that's pretty innovative, and the exhaust pipe pieces are intriguing.

1 thanks for the review, hinckley! i like the set it looks good, and all those ork swords..... *wub*

0 zero1312, on dec 6 2007, 09:48 am, said: yes, when in 2008 do these sets come to germany? :-/ um i do not know, i live in the u.s.a. *sweet*

1 here is my review of the set 6265 sabre island! overview: sabre island was release in 1990 an it contained 92 pieces and its retail price was $15.50. it comes with 3 imperial blue coats, and a nice outpost for them. the pictures + full review: anyway, you can see here a picture of the box, the model shown on the box differs from the actual model slightly. ...and the back of the box, which shows some nice alternative models from the pieces provided. a close up of two or three of the alternative models. and now for the minifigs. i prefer the red coats over the blue coats but these minifigs are nice, and for the number of pieces one gets a fair amount of them. the set itself makes a nice small outpost, it comes complete with a palm tree, a cannon (with ammo) on a turntable, a small tower a nice large imperial flag and a little red row boat! here is a shot from ground level showing the cannon and blue coat (patrolling the out post!) the rowing boat was a nice touch, and it comes with a small flag too. "no pirates will avoid the wrath of myself and my mighty island!" the top of the tower is rather plain and simple which in some ways is good, as it keeps the whole set detailed yet not crowded, but i feel a little something should of been added to the top though. the back is lacking any type of walls, so one can play with the minifigs inside, yet their are also no stairs or any other ways for the blue coats to climb up their tower either! the rag tag pirates attack sabre island! but never fear, the lord of pies is here! me throwing a pie at captain ironhook from another angle. overall i think this is a very good, if somewhat simple set, and makes a great cheap imperial set! comments, thoughts and opinions are welcome! (and sorry about the darkness in some photos, i have not had time to take photographs when it is till light recently, for when i return home it is dark |-/ ) edit: fixed, thank you! edited by phred, 12 april 2015 - 05:14 am.

1 fantastic review! i'll post my views on the set later when i have more time. but i've already fixed the poll.

1 nice review! hmm...i gave it a 4...why? very good bits: -3 epaulettes for 3 gurads! -patterned wall parts -cannon bad bits: -no pirates to fight -title is rather grand for an outpost -top needs battlements, not very low lattices -needs a more substantial base - the wall goes right into the sea! - surely the whole thing would sink... -palm tree is too short ...and the rest is good! :-p you might want to fix the vote option for 5 - it appears to be the title; you can't vote for it... pirate king skelly killer edit: ok, boney, but i gave it a 4! edited by slyowl, 06 december 2007 - 07:32 pm.

1 i remember buying this set and thinking what an amazing job lego had done. it was my first pirate set and i still have it built. *sweet*

1 thank you for the comments! *sweet* i wonder who voted "1", surely such a nice set doesn't deserve such a low score!? *wacko*

1 it's not a bad thing to vote sabre island 1 if someone feels that it's genuinely worth 1 but t'would be interesting to know why.

1 i give it a 4, only because there are no pirates. i aways loved this set, nice little fortifaction. lots of details. i only wish i could have worked it in aberbrick.

0 did i hear right? a catapult in the 16th/17th/18th and 19th centuries? *wacko* perhaps it's an appeal for lord of pies to have his own personal catapult to pelt the pirates with whipped cream pastries should they try to sail past. but this begs the question... why waste perfectly good pie on those scurvy, mangy, mutt-faced villians!

1 lol! those star wars heiroglyphics are awesome! were those in the movie? or is this just a joke by the lego designers? that would be the first time tlc showed any kind of reference humor! the rest of the set is great too, even the skeleton and the stickers. yes, that's right, i actually like those things. i like the new skellies because of their posability (i'm a big supporter & user of stop-motion) and i think there's nothing wrong with stickers. i mean seriously, why does everybody hate stickers so much??? :-| sure, they are a pain in the megablocks to put on and, sure, they come off after a while and are never usable again, but hey, you don't have to put them on, even better, you can save them (like i do) and use them for your mocs! could somebody tell me, please? i'm just curious. however, as i said, nice set! i might even get one. gotta love that marion with the carot torch x-d and that arc is neat too! by the way, are all parts on it golden? some more pics on it would be nice as soon as your camera is recharged! ;-) thanks. peace out!

1 my 2nd review (what a veteran) ... again, found this set via a shop assistant, in my local tru (portsmouth, uk) this evening. comes in at ?44.99, which, is pretty steep, but, you get quite a bit for your money. front of the box : back of the box : back of the box closeup : contents : it was a nice surprise to get numbered bags ... not had a large set with numbered bags for quite a while, at least in none of the sets i've bought recently! didn't take a close up of the stickers, but i was quite disappointed that the curved pieces had stickers ... if they could print the att curved pieces, why not these? minifigs : oh ... and there's a nice backprint on the pilot figure : now, the build was pretty good ... you build the plane first (after the minifigures). quite an interesting build in a way, becayse for a while you think the back is the front ... and then you realise, heh! now ... i've not seen the film in a while, but i don't recall a guy flying a plane with a fishing rod ... don't flame me if this is what happens, see earlier point regards not seeing the film in ages!! :-p after that, you build the temple in stages, starting with the entrance first, and then the holey floor section with the spears. these spears are just loosely placed into technic holed bricks. quite easy to make em flick out but they can go anywhere! hehe entrance : holey floor & spears : these two parts are hinged and on an angle to each other and the gap makes for a handy bottomless pit, complete with pole for indy to swing over with his whip. after that, you create the door and the ratchet mechanism to keep it raised. after that, you add the runners for the ball and the swinging knives trap. swords trap - before : after : finally, you build the statue that holds the efigy. nice bit of construction here, especially the way that everything falls over once the efigy is removed. do be careful when putting the curved bits on though ... it appears one of the edges on mine has slightly bent when putting it on ... nowt noticable though. temple : preparing to steal : run!! you can see that the temple has toppled and debris has fallen all around ... and then, as he goes through the door, the door falls (he gets his hat) and then the rock ball starts a rolling! ruuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuun!! the stickers were a pain though ... there's no room for a border around the sticker here! beware!! after all that is done, you join all the pieces together and it makes more a really good playset. plenty of opportunity for recreating scenes here! idol closeup : total set : spares : yet more spare stickers??! (sorry, i've already put the spares in my box of bits!) overall, 8 out of 10 ... lots of play value and a pretty nice build. too many stickers though ... and defo poor arms for the skeletons! edited by imperialshadows, 01 june 2008 - 12:18 pm.

1 awesome!!! i want it soo bad!! :'-) how much was it? edited by indy565, 16 december 2007 - 12:55 am.

1 thanks for the review! this is certainly bigger than i expected! can't wait to see your other pics! *y*

0 can you get a close up of the golden idol thingy? looks cool! jifel

0 thanks for the pics cant wait to see more, oh btw when the camera charges could you pleese take a photo of everything falling apart when indy takes the idol? cheers! reveiw on *y*

-1 cool. found it bit disappointed though |-/ ... (not disappointed about the review but the set)

1 wow! i took a peak at the pics in your photobucket, thanks very much! this is a wonderful set, full of details! awesome! :-d *y* *y* ~peace

0 tinypiesrus, on dec 16 2007, 04:41 am, said: oh, i watched this scene a few weeks ago, and the pilot is fishing while waiting for indy to escape. the enigma that is badger, on dec 16 2007, 05:57 am, said: this is correct, and in pure serial film fashion, the pilot is has just hooked a big one just as jones starts yelling for him to get ready to leave ;-) ahhh ... thanks ... now i want to go out and buy the trilogy on dvd! it's cheap too ... under ?20 for all three at the moment.

0 this set is pretty nice i love the idol id probably buy the set just for that :-d lol is it just me or in the earlier concepts of this set we saw a native on the box? i wonder why they removed it :-( *wacko*

0 i just noticed another inconsistency between box art and the actual set ... on the box, the biplan has white wing supports (they're just plane windows without glass in them) and yet the set they are dark grey (or is it bley ... can never tell the difference without careful study). add to that ... the outer of the engine at the front is white on the box and black in the set. we don't normally have this many inconsistencies do we ?

1 because of exams and other obligations, i haven't posted this sooner. seeing that no-one else has reviewed this set, i thought i might as well do it myself. the set in its entire glory (minus the slammer, instructions and the (obviously) massive sticker sheet) the four cars included in this set; a muscle car, a sports car, a roadster and the police off-roader(!): because the police obviously have no clue that an off-roader is useless for catching street-racers, no less a batmobile-ish sports car, it will always trail behind: but the police have a trick up their sleeve - the drawbridge: gotcha! and the mechanism that makes it all tick: the motor is nothing more than a (slow) pull-back motor. push down the bridge, the latch will hook on to the gear and keep it in place until the latch is released. and there's the new gas station. staying within theme, this gas-station is, like the tanker in 8147, from the company fuel 4 speed: there's a notable presence of detail here, such as the soda-dispenser, water (coolant?) bottles and other accesories, two fuel pumps and bumper-level railings to prevent cars from crashing into them. there's no interior however. and as demonstrated here by a loyal octan-employee and a pursuing officer, the gas station is built to minifig-scale: my impressions of this set: as a collector of tiny turbos, and yet to miss a set, i got this one regardless of what it included. the gas station is indeed very nice, and the minifig-scale accesories were unexpected. the lack of interior is no big issue, and the both the station and bridge can with ease be implemented into a mini-fig town. the bridge also solidly built, and includes the ramps in its design, so it can be lifted, with ramps attached, without breaking apart. the slammer included in the set is identical, apart from the white color, with those in 8147. the cars are also very nice, altough i am yet to get used to the yellow batmobile, as i've grown accustomed to calling it. i also love the off-roader's chunky tires, they make perfect wheels for the newer minifig-scale cars. i never consider price/parts ratio, and here it would, for me, be irrelevant, because it will never be demolished for parts. the play value is what i would consider pretty good, and while the bridge won't rise with a car on it, it's still strong enough to stay open with a car tipping over the edge. hmm. every nerve in my body is saying that this sets is worth roughly 8/10, so: verdict: 8/10 edited by whitefang, 23 may 2009 - 07:01 pm. indexed

1 it looks like a nice set but i'm not interested in the minis, it's got a nice drawbridge though! thanks! *sweet*

0 picked up from the lego shop in bluewater yesterday front of box back of box price ?2.50 gbp contents, a very small instruction manual instructions (front) intsructions (back) 25 pieces (23 used in the model) regular construction mini fig start of the assembly roll in the drum just attach the drum a little tap with the hammer! (hammer not included!) wheel it into position time to start mixing, also time for a well earned tea break, the cement is all ready now. and the 2 left over bits. extra cement is always useful and not really wasted. overall, a nice little set and i am pleased to see little sets appearing again at long last. the only negative is with the drum of the mixer, although the angle can be adjusted you cannot tip the contents out of the mixer. all in all i would say 8/10 for a good little set? comments...? ? ? edit by hobbes: replaced pictures with clickable thumbs and corrected set number.

1 great review and nice touch putting the minifig in the mixer *y* and i think you are the first to review this set so all in all good work. steel...

0 thanks for the review. does anyone know if these mini sets are sold at tru?

1 thanks for this review. lots of minifigs is a plus, although half of them are junk jellies, but dang the base just doesn't seem impressive. it looks so cheap, like a skeleton. the tubes are just ridiculous. but hey, at least it comes with two cool spacecraft, that's nice.

1 i quite like it, but i feel that my lego city is getting over-run with helicopters and planes. also i have got the helicopter from the 7237 police station set, but it is not as good as this plus i'am sooooo dissapointed that the :-x stickers :-x are blue instead of black and green as they will not fit with the sets i have already got :-d nice review thanks edited by caseyref, 26 december 2007 - 02:04 am.

1 great review! the helicopter is very nice and a cheap way to get a cop and those new handcuffs i wish the police impulse had those new cuffs *sad* thanks for doing this *y* x-o a printed part :-d mail carrier review on p edited by piranha, 26 december 2007 - 04:07 am.

0 thanks for the review psp guy. i just have one question for you, in bottom right picture on the back of the box what is the policeman putting in the container. thanks in advance!

0 the binoculers. :-) you must have a small moniter.

0 a nice simple helicopter! i always had thoughts of this, but after the review i'm gonna go get it! (well, not at the moment... x-o )

1 pspguy, on dec 27 2007, 03:08 am, said: what? if your asking how they are but together you snap the window piece into the ho\lder. errr.... no. as brikbitz said on his site in the 7732 postal plane review... quote you can see the traditional airplane window piece, but the bad news is they've changed the window pane. it's the new flat piece used in 4996 beach house, it just doesn't work as well. without the original bevelled edge it doesn't seal the window and there is small noticable gap around the edge. not a major problem but it might get a bit draughty inside and certainly no high altitude flying. i was wondering if it is the old or new type. darth_legois_619, on dec 27 2007, 08:20 am, said: nice review *y* i will get 2 of these at the least especialy since they're going to be $15 aud *wub* :'-) how did you find out the price? if you are right then this is a must buy! *wub*

1 sinner, on dec 26 2007, 02:09 pm, said: are the side windows flush like the old ones or recessed like the new ones are supposed to me? (the look recessed to me. :-/ ) they're definitely recessed new windows in this set i'm afraid, just in case no-one has answered your question yet. i got this set in woolworths the other day. tescos have it too now. i have to say it's my all time favourite police helicopter. nice review psp guy!

1 thank you for the great review sandra *y* . i *wub* the detail that tlc added to this set. i would like to add that i think all the buildings look *sweet* . i really like how you compared the look to "back to the future". when i saw the first pics, i thought the same thing. the look of the set is definitly the 1950's. i am :-( to see the price though. i am sure this set will be $149.99 us too. great review, model on!!

1 thank you very much for the wonderful review, legocastlegirl! plenty of pics, thanks again! *wub* *y* ~peace

1 axle, on dec 28 2007, 02:07 pm, said: can you take a picture(s) of all the film posters? there?s no necessity to take pics of all the film posters. there are only 3 different film posters at the set. always one poster twice.. and you can see every different poster at the brickshelf gallery. if you need more details, then you should maybe buy it :-) regards sandra

1 thanks for the review legocastlegirl - excellent work *y*! i agree with you, the best part seems to be the movietheater!! that?s perfect because i just love to watch movies in the theater, so far this year i?ve seen 46 pictures (and had some pop-corn to ;-)). this is a must-get-set!! town on copmike

1 sorry for answering so late but i was very busy... thanks guys for your comments *y* tedbeard, on dec 28 2007, 08:08 pm, said: sorry to disagree with anyone however, but this was not a great review. i appreciate the effort sandra made but a great review would include more details such as what are stickers and what are printed pieces. a great review points out flaws or limitations as well as what works or is really neat. a great review would have analyzed the price per piece and compared that to other sets/themes. one might look at the recent reviews of the indy sets or the new spongebob sets as examples of really good reviews. the pictures are good but a great review, above all, should provide the reader with some new information, perhaps even answer questions posed in the pre-release discussion thread. i learned nothing new about the set from this review. that said, it was a good review for someone who had not seen the pre-release discussion and she did a good job of showing said person what they could expect in the set. it?s good that you told me your opinion about my review. it was my third review i made and i have to say that i made this review not for analyses, just only to show the eb members some nice pics and to tell them my opinion. lego is fun for me!! i don?t like to analyse the pieces, bricks, prices, colours. i just want to build something. that?s why i?m at eurobricks and not at an other big legocommunity in germany. lego is fun, fun, fun!! and everybody knows that lego is a expensive hobbie.. so why should i write it again and again? julencin2000, on dec 29 2007, 10:07 pm, said: very good review, thanks!!!!!!!! sticker sheet pic with 1 megapixel film posters thanks for the link julencin! ;-) xwingyoda, on dec 29 2007, 10:25 pm, said: ps: @ tedbeard - do tone it down youg man !! if you're not happy with sandra's work, do provide one yourself instead of bitching on how you view a review and on how sandra's post is veryt far from one (according to you !!) *yoda* thanks *yoda* *sweet* copmike, on dec 30 2007, 01:30 pm, said: thanks for the review legocastlegirl - excellent work *y*! i agree with you, the best part seems to be the movietheater!! that?s perfect because i just love to watch movies in the theater, so far this year i?ve seen 46 pictures (and had some pop-corn to ;-)). this is a must-get-set!! town on copmike thanks copmike :-$ so it will be a good year 2008 for you. there?ll be a lot of good movies at cinema next year. i can?t wait for national treasure: book of secrets, the second movie after national treasure with nicolas cage.

1 kimt, on jan 4 2008, 10:25 am, said: btw: which set would you recommend: market streeet, town plan or cafe corner? just curious. they're pretty expensive and i might only afford one of them. definitely the coffee corner. it?s a hard desicion between coffee corner and town plan, because they are both really great sets. the market street is no "must have" in my opinion. but the other two. maybe you should start with the coffee corner, it?s the older set. the town plan is newer and will be available longer then the coffee corner. i hope it helped you a litte bit :-$ regards sandra edited by legocastlegirl, 04 january 2008 - 10:43 am.

1 tks will for your great review !! g after reading *vader* 's reviews (of that set and the rs) and yours i really can't wait to get that set and all of the sw sets :-p really nice photography there which is sweet !! *yoda*

1 thanks will! this really is a nice set! your new camera and the backround looks great, the pic quality is very good! thanks!! *y*

1 thanks for the review, mr. mandalorian! this set looks very nice, and it's good to know the nose cone stickers are 2 separate ones, so they don't cross bricks. :-d that camera is working out great for ya'! thanks again! ~peace

1 great review!! i still don't like that cartoon anakin though :-/ excuse me for a sec *runs to local wal-mart to check" :-d buying 08 sets on! p

1 this is a brilliant review of a brilliant set! *sweet* thanks a lot! i know this may be a bit much to ask but could take some pics of the whole instruction booklet? please!!! if you can thanks a bunch. but if not do know of a place where i could find the instructions?

1 thanks, guys! i have the rogue shadow in the review pipes, should be up soon. legolover100, on jan 1 2008, 07:36 pm, said: this is a brilliant review of a brilliant set! *sweet* thanks a lot! i know this may be a bit much to ask but could take some pics of the whole instruction booklet? please!!! if you can thanks a bunch. but if not do know of a place where i could find the instructions? take pics of each page? that is a lot. i don't know of anywhere that might have it. :-/ if you check *vader* 's review, he has a lot of pics of the build, that might work just as well. will

0 these jokes are killing me x-d

0 blah. i wanted one of these at half off but i forgot and missed out. thanks for the review though :-$

1 okie guys and gals, here s time for some droid exploration with my review of set 7670. as a general statement i have to say its really a neat set that is not that expensive for what it holds. 1) box art like always i will start with pics of the box art. btw, notice anything guys ? no bloody crappy dss. yes, finally a set without stickers and that feels great :-d 2) the mfs nothing really spectacular there. the only novelty lies within the inclusion of the new commander (yellow torso) bd. apart from that, there are 2 bds and unfortunately yet another sbd (i like those but i have a huge amount of them, and i would rather had something different). you have 3 short blasters and a couple of extra parts. 3) the spider droid i think it?s a pretty cool little buggar. it?s a rather simple yet classic construction i think. it has sweet parts such as the bd body in dark bley. it really has a spider feel unlike the previous ep3 one. 4) the hailfire droid this baby represents the ?pi?ce de resistance? of this set. i truly love it !! sure it?s a bit under scale but i don?t really mind that. its conception is superb even if i totally dislike assembling those technic treads (especially 80 of those small things). the ellipse of the treads is well balanced and that trans disc is a brilliant idea. the great thing is those new flick fire missiles: they don?t fall unlike the other ones and they do look good on this baby. also you can put the wheels together and the missiles to gain some shelf space (easy storage on :-d ) in conclusion those druids re really sweet and are perfect target practice for the upcoming rgs hehe !! i hope you enjoyed that review and do not hesitate to comment and ask pic requests if any ;-) *yoda*

1 hey, thanks for the review! i think i will definately get this set! dp8 edited by darthperson8, 05 january 2008 - 03:30 pm.

1 xwingyoda, on jan 5 2008, 04:24 pm, said: i totally dislike assembling those technic treads (especially 80 of those small things). so you haven't build the bat tank, right? it comes with 2x 79 thread pieces... *wacko* ;-) thanks for the review, i'll definitively get this set (maybe monday :'-) ), love those droids *wub*

1 yeah finally *yoda* got his sw :-d i got 2 of them after x mas - they are really cool - especially the spider droid! 2 of them on! & happy *yoda* on :-p edited by aayla-secura, 05 january 2008 - 10:38 pm.

0 nice review! and you finally got an 08 set! i haven't gotten any, i blame wal-mart for putting products out late |-/ :-d instead of a sbd, tlc should have included a droideka(new version) *y* the scale is a bit off, so this is a dwarf hailfire droid :-p p

0 thanks for the reveiw, i've got one of these and an at-ap in the mail hopefully arriveing tomorrow :-) edited by legoman, 06 january 2008 - 12:15 am.

0 great review mate as usual, for me the highlight of this set has to be the new spider droid. even though it's made up of some strange parts it really appeals to me, i would love a few of those babys. the hellfire droid is also well put together even if it is a little small, but hey it looks fun. i really like the look of this set but the price tag really puts me off, why oh why did lego price it so high.... :'-(

0 great review very precise. as for the spider droid construction, i have already worked it into a moc: http://www.brickshel...ry.cgi?f=290980 stryker-single gun hydra-seven guns hammer-missile pods. steel...

1 i got this set for a few months [1 or 2].. and i agree that it is small.. but still.. it looks great on plates, clone troopers [just for fun..] >:-)

0 my hailfire droid is gonna be coming in the mail soon, as well as the battlepacks.

1 i haven't spotted these in the us yet. i'm looking forward to finding them. overall, the 2008 line-up is a excellent and it's going to be difficult for me to decide which themes/sets to pursue. there's a lot to choose from.

1 nice review yoda i dont think i have ever read one with as much cursing of stickers! :-d i love these two little sets, the colour scheme the little different wheels on the post van and of course the new postmen uniforms! would have been nice if they had included little satchels like in the new indiana jones sets, oh well! ;-) postman yoda on! *yoda*

1 thank you for the nice review pity of the stickers but the design is nice 80ies on!

1 thanks for the review :-) i was actually considering getting these, but i saw they were overpriced for my tastes - too bad, theyre nifty lil things *wub*

0 while the plane does look nice, i don't particularly care for the van. but the van does have some good parts, which is the only reason i would by one: yellow mud guards, the new windshield, and the small door on the rear.

-1 well first off, thanks yoda for the great review. :-) hmmm... well, i have to say, i'm not at all impressed with any of these sets. i mean, there nice and all, but the van just seems way to small. it would have been nice if you could fit more than one package in it. i guessi'm one of those that are more of the fan of the 6 wide trucks. and the plane.... hm. this has a "cute" factor and all, but i mean com'on... you have to open a hatch on the roof to get your packages in?? and what about getting them out? you have to flip the plane upside down? :-| weak. they should have had a hinged rear end or a hatch on the side.

0 i'm glad to see the mail van has the doors that used to be on the older cargo containers. i had given up on those older ones, but now that they're still out there, i may invest in the older cargo system instead of the new 6-wide ones. both sets are good enough, i'll get both. i'm hoping for a postal building too, even though i have the smaller of the old post offices. a nice big modern one would be great. i'm not too hung up about the design of the plane; i've got the neat old cargo plane with the tail that swings open (one of the best plane sets) for big packages. the truck is goofy looking, but if i get sick of looking at it i can rebuild it into a classic looking one. great review by the way, the pictures are some of the better one i've seen in a review recently.

1 hey everyone, my first 2008 set is this one, 5613. i thought i'd share a review of it. *sweet* i'd like to say sorry about my photos, they were taken quickly. first, we have the box: it is the smallest lego box i've ever seen, and actually looks cute *wub* it will be heavy competition with playmobil's specials... back of the box, showing an action pose: the contents of the little box, with a very tiny instruction manual *wub* the manual unfolded. notice that every part has its part number beside it :-) the back of the manual, showing some fire sets and the other impulse sets the parts, 30 in total: the small set built. the firefighter has a small fire to extinquish, armed with an axe, chainsaw, other saw and foam... psssh thing x-d . five extra parts in a 30 part set! we get an extra black hatchet, yellow bar tap, light bley 1*1 plate, red 1*1 plate modified with fingers and 2*2 dark bley radar dish. besides the plate, i've never seen these as reserve parts... but i'm not complaining x-d here is a small "alternate" model i created with it: a small bbq... what? he's hungry and he needs to put something on the bbq >:-) x-d overall, you can't go wrong with these impulse sets. i paid 2.89 euros for this little set, so thats a great value! sadly the only impulse avaible were these 3 city sets (no police) and the alien mars mission... looking forward to the knight and magician as well as those indy sets! tt

1 thanks for the review, tanotrooper! this is a nice little set, with 2 axes (*wub* >:-)) and some nice parts. cool alternate model too! x-d tanotrooper, on jan 6 2008, 09:07 am, said: 9.3 cm by 9.3 cm by 4.5 cm x-d tt x-o cute! i can't wait to see these impulse sets in stores. *wub* ~peace

1 thanks for the review! i definitely plan on getting this one. thanks again! *sweet*

1 thank you for the nice review with many pictures. *y* :-d i already wanted this set, but the pictures make it i want even much/more.

1 another great review from dunamis thanks! i will get it if i can find it on sale!!

1 thanks for this great review! i love this awesome set, the creator line never disappoints. this is definitely a must-buy for me, just like the other creator houses. batbrick something! *wacko*

1 very nice! i have been debating on whether or not to buy it-it would appear you made up my mind for me! *y*

-1 ah great review kanal-k1 (and welcome to eb! :-d ), i was waiting for one of this set. not that i was expecting anything good, i won't buy it. i agree with thr playability, it does seem weak. what can you do with it. swoosh it? :-/ big step backwards lego... :-( dr. brick

-1 a big thumbs down for me. this doesn't look like lego at all :-| *n* *n* *n* *n* *n* out of *n* *n* *n* *n* *n*

-1 i have the big passenger plane so i'll be passing on this one. one big juniorised plane is enough for me! if i didn't have the passenger plane though i'd rather get the cargo plane. there's enough police in my city as it is!

-1 thanks for the review! *sweet* i am stunned at the lack of an interior... not that it makes much difference as i wasn't likely to want this set anyway as i own the passenger plane from last year. sorry to steal your image, but i just had to post this! :-p

0 thks for this caustic review :-d i'll wait for the parts on bricklink. i think you're a bit unfair with this small oversized submarine - oups sorry, i mean plane. here are some advantages i tried to imagine : 1. that's the first submarine with a plane nose, 2. that's the first unprinted nose, 3. that's the first shark that make me laugh, and which has a plain white fin 4. and at last, you should have notice that that the first submarine with a wing made of several plates it is said that this set has more than 200 parts... hide and seek ! x-d you may have lost several bags i'm eager that people buy this set a lot : i'd like to buy a lot of these new white 4x4x2 curved slope for my mocs. can you take a picture of the plane crashing in the sink ? is it fire proof ? i think that will be too easy this year to decide what is the crap of year ...

-1 i'll probably get the nice green cargo plane. but not this. how can the same hull pieces be used for full size jets and what's supposed to be a small seaplane.

1 legoman132, on sep 11 2008, 06:26 pm, said: this still looks like a cool set but the price not so much. the price is now 20 in ireland on s@h, which is reasonable considering the large fuselage pieces. has anyone modded this set to make a reasonable looking plane? i am thinking of buy it to do so, but i don't want to take a risk and end up with lots of useless pieces. aswell as -20.

0 very good reviews, i think that redman is really ok, a very little cute curious fig... sadly he is not in the impulse set... ;-) i wish to see redman still around about your creepy avatar, yes, it look a bit creepy *skull* nausicaakro (this impulse set is storage in 8 copies, with 8 wizard set, 16 city set (2x), 16 mission to mars set... so if you want buy 10 of this (like me) you must find 2 different toy center)

1 thanks everyone for your positive feedback, it's really appreciated! :-d you'd be surprised how long that 'redman presents' thing up the top took me to make! x-d so, it appears people do like redman, expect him to be reviewing the good wizard and battle arachnoid in near future! (i know those have already been reviewed, but new zealand never gets sets first, so i'll just be reviewing the sets i get. x-d) thefrisian, on jan 19 2008, 04:44 am, said: nice review, very detailed. *y* as for the spare parts, mine didn't come with any. both dark grey 1x1 round plates are used on the weapons rack (one for the armour, one for the helmet) and i only got one robot hand for holding weapons. that's strange, maybe i'm just lucky. x-d i also got 2 spare orange viking horn pieces in my battle arachnoid. :-d ~peace

-1 i would have purchased a few of these except for the fact that i do not like the new torso that they use.

0 seems like a good set should i get it? btw how did you get you hands on this?

1 thanks for the review *vader*! the first picture of the troll is great, the gold armour really shines! x-d a fantastic set, i'll definitely get a couple of these! *wub* as for the ogres/'giant trolls', the dark tan one fits in the mine setting well, but for above ground, settings, i prefer the sand green one. *y* ~peace edited by iamded, 19 january 2008 - 10:21 am.

1 this is fantastic, i love the new helmets for the goblins *sweet* i've always loved the chicken leg thing, really screams lego to me! at least how lego used to be :'-( great little bit the goblins are awesome too, and the sand green one should look good next to the tan ones...gives a nice feeling of a real species. in reality not all members of a species are identical, it's great seeing them in different colors. great review x-d

-1 great review, vader :-) as i've said before, this is a nice set, but doesn't really come with anything that doesn't come with the other sets of the line. for this reason, it will be somewhere at the bottom of my list for 2008. also, i like torso and helmet of the dwarf mining orcs much better. the colours make the torso look rather dull and boring, while the other, more brown one, looks much clearer and more exciting. i think i like the *knight* helmet better too, looks more covering and threatening than this one, although i'll save my judgement until i have one in my hands. thanks again vader ;-) edit: forgot to mention, hilarious pic in your sig, vader :-d edited by tinypiesrus, 19 january 2008 - 08:28 am.

0 xwingyoda, on jan 22 2008, 04:26 pm, said: tks for the review mate ;-) now i have to bloody wait long because lego france has this line available in freaking march >:-( pissed *yoda* on !! :-d i love the "new" goblin :-p that helmet is really cool. why on earth tlc didn't include that one in the dwarf mine ? such another idiotic move |-/ anyone keeping track of tlc's stupidity lately ? that would be interesting !! i clearly want a huge goblin army now hehe !! and i totally agree with you mate, the troll lokks better in sand green. the cart itself is pretty lame imo - just a sordid excuse to include yet another annoying shooting crappy device. but for a 21? set its okie i say ;-) need my bad guys on !! *yoda* i believe there is a topic around here somewhere based on bad lego ideas. after getting this new helmet i really wish lego had included it with the mining set, it's bloody annoying having to buy yet more of them from bl :'-( the shooting bit is better than some sets that have had one, at least this one is smartly done and of course it can also be hidden.

0 adik_sa_lego, on jan 18 2008, 11:57 pm, said: question: what's different with this "special edition"? btw, nice shots! im guessing the main difference is the fact that the box says special edition.

1 thanks for the review! that forklift is wonderful! *wub* i may have to pick this one up convince dragonator to pick this one up! :-d too bad it can only hold 1 crate. :-/ ~peace

0 agentrick57, on jan 18 2008, 09:48 pm, said: can th doors be opened on either side? no, just one side. i'm not sure why the "special edition". it appears to be the same set as lego sah?

1 wow, 8-? great review. *y* i usually don't buy city sets but i think i might get this one just for that awsome forklift! *wub* general tarful

0 some guy, on jan 19 2008, 11:17 pm, said: i think the special edition is just for making people intrested and make them want to buy that set or something. hmm, that's a thought, but why would they pick this particular set? i would expect they'd do that with a slightly bigger set, like the heavy hauler perhaps. why do you think they'de pick this one?

1 this set looks pretty good to me, it is six wide isn't it? that is nice for a truck like this

-1 highlandcattle, on jan 20 2008, 09:15 am, said: this set looks pretty good to me, it is six wide isn't it? that is nice for a truck like this yes, 6-wide. the only problem with these big trucks is how they look on the city roadplates (i've always thought too big), compared to classic city trucks. getting off topic, i'd like to see lego make a car transport truck. i don't think i've ever seen one in lego. it would definately have to be 6-wide, or even larger.

1 greetings, and welcome to another redman review! i'm your host, redman, and today i adorn my medieval outfit to tell you about the impulse set simply titled "the knight". no wait, that's the old script. x-d i mean, "the good wizard". *sweet* the other castle impulse set (the first being 'the knight'), this is a wonderful, and in my case unexpected addition to the castle line! i did not expect to get a nice good wizard, but rather another plain white skellie for the impulse, and was pleasantly surprised when i saw the first picture of this set. the impulse sets give you pieces you wouldn't expect to see in such small sets, for example, the knight came with the armour, and this comes with an owl, a gem, and a crystal ball piece. it comes with 11 pieces, including the wand, owl, and gem, and no spares, which doesn't really matter as it doesn't need any. the box sports the set number, age range (which i blissfully ignore x-d), awesome castle logo, and the assembled set, with the usual 1:1 scale picture of a minifig. the back of the box shows pictures of the boxed skeleton tower and king's castle siege sets. note the price is in new zealand dollars, and is really the same prica as any other impulse set. next are the instructions, which are separated into 3 parts, 1 for the minifigure, 1 for the table, and one for the bird stand. very simple, also worth mentioning is the parts numbers are next to their respective parts, for replacement parts etc. on the back we see (on the top half) pictures of skeleton prison carriage, skeleton tower, and king's castle siege, this time not of the boxed sets, but the sets themselves. on the lower half we have 8 pictures, each of the different impulse sets. the wizard's torso is plain sand blue, with no patterns or anything, but it doesn't really matter is his beard's in the way. ;-) the head is that same old 'white fade to grey beard' head, but the white beard covers up most of the grey. my favourite part is the pants, i love that we're getting printed belts and legs again. his belt has 4 gold crosses (as seen in, if you look closely, the new crownie's torso and the crownie archer's torso) and a belt buckle, and the legs have a bottle, a coin, and a small bag. nice little wizard-ey items. the, er, items, no, accessories, no, models? the stuff in the set include a little stand for the owl, and a table utilising the new 4x4 round piece in light bley, with the crystal ball in the middle, encasing the yellow gem held on by a 2x2 circle piece in blue. why blue, i'm not sure. maybe it's because the crystal is yellow, and the crownie's colours are blue and gold, so the blue piece with the yellow crystal symbolise the crownie's colours. or maybe tlc just felt the need to include an odd colour. :-p in conclusion, this is a wonderful set, with some neat accessories, and it doesn't really need to be bought in the masses, after all, you needs an army of owls and wizards? :-| :-p so it works fine as a single set, and adds a more fantasy feel to your crownie army. that's all for today folks! *sweet* [/redman] thanks for reading another of my redman interviews, any suggestions on how to/what to do to improve it is greatly appreciated, as are all comments and criticisms (except those blatant thoughtless criticisms that don't help at all :-p)! ~peace edited by kimt, 10 august 2008 - 01:31 pm.

1 good reveiw, i quite like this set and ill buy it as soon as it actually gets in my country |-/ :-| (600th post) edit: $7!!!!! geez i thought $6 was bad :-x edit: who typed megablocks in my post..i didnt,??? edited by hollisbrick, 20 january 2008 - 05:41 am.

1 yay! another redman review! you are an excellent reviewer iamded redman, your pictures show all the details included in the set and your thoughts bring new light to features and bits i hadn't noticed or thought about before *y* i love this little set, i will get two i reckon, because i want all the wizard bits in a minifig box as well. nice little humorous pic at the end too. one improvement i think could be to include the pics of the back of the box and other side of the instructions anyway. honestly, there isn't much to improve, you are an excellent reviewer :-) redman on! batbrick is back! >:-)

1 nice review, your camera is much better now. i look forward to more of your reviews :-) i just went to toyworld today and got a wizard and 4 knights :-) and on top of that, they were having a 20% off sale *sweet* i might go back and get some more tommorrow. the wizard is pretty good, and comes with some good parts (owl, beard, legs, hat, round table, crystal ball..). it would be nicer if he had a torso with printing on it, but i can understand why they didn't.

-1 tinypiesrus, on jan 20 2008, 06:05 am, said: the wizard is pretty good, and comes with some good parts... it would be nicer if he had a torso with printing on it... i agree. in fact, it's a point i've already made on this board. simonwillems, on jan 20 2008, 02:59 pm, said: the only thing that could have been better in my opinion is the wand, i always liked this one... again, a point i agree with and already made on this board. i'm not blaming you guys. ;-) the op in this thread should, at the very least, have linked to the existing thread about this set on this board. |-/ edited by amperzand, 20 january 2008 - 05:01 pm.

0 simonwillems, on jan 20 2008, 02:59 pm, said: thanks for the review of this nice little set. for it's price (3 euros here in holland) it contains quite a lot of useful parts. the only thing that could have been better in my opinion is the wand, i always liked this one: i miss those wands! they could've used it, but i think the wood wand kindda adds "realis" to the set, and since many fans don't like their castle theme to be too fantasized, i guess lego decided to use a mold that was still being used for various sets. when i get this set i'm going to put it on the tower in the king's castle, you know, the one that is right above the throne room? ;-) that'll be a great spot, and then i'll finally have all the necessary characters, the king in his throne, the knights on the walls, the wizard on his tower top, and the princess in her tower room that floats in mid air and is connected to the throne room by a 2-stud wide bridge! :-d i love the king;s castle siege set *wub*

1 yay! more redman! probably going to get one of these and turn it into a carnival attraction.

0 hollisbrick, on jan 20 2008, 04:38 pm, said: $7!!!!! geez i thought $6 was bad :-x nz$7 is worth au$6... so it's the same price...

1 sweet plane looks much better than in the catalogs *sweet*

1 thanks dr.s for this great review, this is your what, second one? anyway, this aint half bad, i actually kind of like the bigger planes despite the annoying big pieces, and this one looks to be the best yet. batbrick away! >:-)

0 lt. veers, on feb 4 2008, 11:42 pm, said: i do admit the amount of cargo is rediculously small, but it still looks good. say, how much can the plane hold? thanks for the review! *sweet* that's all the space you get. now, it might be possible to rip out that rear bulkhead at the back of the wing and fill the middle area with tiles so cargo pallets could slide up the fuselage. but that would definitely prevent the undercarriage folding internally if that's what you wanted to do as well. dr. s.

1 wow, that's a great review of a great set dr s! *y* as you yourself have already noted, this has the potential to be a fantastic military moc! with a bit of modification you can get the engines to be rounder, or perhaps do away with them completely and replace them with jet engines. *sweet* though i can't think of a system to retract the undercarriage at the top of my head it seems like there's indeeed more than enough potential to do so. it reminds me rather of an ilyushin il-76, one of my favourite cargo planes. :'-)

-1 thanks for the review that seems to be a nice set but as far i'm concerned, i don't think it's worth eur 49.99. there aren't so many parts though those new curved slope will add some more building possibilities. *y* what lacks : - a 2 x 4 cut out in the lower part of the nose to retract the landing gear. - a 4 x 6 cut out in the lower part of the tail to allow passagers to get off through the back like in a dc-10 - some real plates and tiles instead of these crappy wings. this part is the useless one that tlc ever produced *n*

0 if i do end up geting this set it will be for my slowly growing army. btw nice review *y*

1 thank you for this review! it is a brilliant set! i am definitely getting this set once indy is released in new zealand hurry up tlc! >:-( ps:could i have pic of what indy looks like with an old classic whip?

0 that is the one of the oddest mistakes i have ever heard of! :-d even so, you have to admit that it is good news for you; lego will hapily give you the right head if you ask. thanks for the review. i have this set too. *wub*

1 nice review, all the important stuff is there. weird cock-up by tlc to put an ani face on indy... i didn't encounter any mistakes in my four indy sets. great selfmade temple of doom indy fig, piranha! so uhm... has anyone found out yet what the extra hieroglyphic stickers are for?

0 i have noticed that at my local tlc store (orlando) they have this set in a glass case on display...with the cw anakin head on indy. i did not realize this was such i widespread problem.

1 welcome to: my sigfig sgt. joey sh. will lead trough this review of the new city 7743 police surveilance truck. first of all the box: front back the minifigs: 3 police officers and a bad guy now the vehicles: the cute little atv *wub* the main part of the set: the surveilance truck a shot of the interior the trailer back of the trailer the truck back side the little building: front the interior and last but not least: spare parts and not needed stickers that?s it! hope to see you again at the next episode of sgt. joey?s reviews.

0 great review stealth hunter, a bit blurry in places but overall nice shots of the truck. it is much, much better than i expected, but i still won't get it, i have no need for more police. thanks for the great review! batbrick away! >:-)

0 thanks for the review, that truck is actually better than i first thought! i am still tossing up getting it, as i am getting the police station, and where would it park?! :-p i quite like the little building though, but still... i am so confused *wacko*

0 i like the new station but the truck is a good question. i still like the classic 1994 one and the 1980's can that was one of the first units i got

0 it looks to me that the little building is supposed to be like some sort of customs checkpoint between one nation and another or like a toll facility on a highway. i like the little checkpoint but i think that should be part of a separate set and 7743 just having the police mobile command center truck.

1 hello and welcome to another, oh wait, first batbrick and iamded review! today us two sworn enemies will be reviewing the creator cargo chopper, here is the front of the box: and while pushing iamded to his doom, here is the back: haha! ouch! oh dear...here are the parts anyway... here is the instruction of the first model, the cargo chopper. i love creator sets for the different models, they always excite me. just ignore me finishing off my nemesis in the background. something very interesting that i liked in the instructions was this step where you must add those three 2x2 yellow rounded pieces under the chopper. this is for support while you build, which is handy, and later you take it off: and even later use it as the cargo. i found that to be rather innovative and clever, as well as - hey! what are you hitting me for? both instruction booklets have the same back: now heres the chopper itself. i love the design of it, it isn't quite minifig scale but its great all the same. this is my first non-xpod or house creator set, and it sure is fun. here me and iamded go for a dizzy ride. i love the nose of the copter, and the landing gear is fantastic. a shot from the other side. oh dear, it seems we've been a bit sick from that ride, and were vomiting transgreen 1x1s. the cargo itself is nicely made, though i forgot to put on two tiles here :-$ . it fits in real well with the chopper to, and the line is great for giving iamded the wedgie he deserves: this is my first power function set, so i was pretty excited. the motor is intergrated really well into this set, and is activated by pushing that little 3x2 plate with the 1x1 slopes on it forward, until it hits the motor button, that orange knob. another point of interest is the use of bley barrels on each side. i like this as i don't have those pieces in that colour. a shot of the motor. its really simple, all you do is pull the hook out to any length that allows, then press the orange button and it will wind it back up. this makes the chopper pull the cargo up into its bay, and iamded pull me here reluctantly to a whacking: a top view, is that my head? a view of the chopper without the cargo in it. i love the lowered cockpit: the leftover pieces from building: (note: iamded's head does not count as set piece) and a final shot of the set with me and iamded. oh, it appear we're dead, oh dear... hope you enjoyed this review, soon i will post the two alternate models. i loved this chopper, its great to play with and has nice construction. it also has some handy pieces too. the motor function sounds like a gimmick but is well intergrated into this model. well worth the price, so far this is another win for creator i say! so far i recommend this model, but later we'll see if the alt models are up to scratch. also, since this is my first review, comments and criticism welcome on everything. batbrick away! >:-) edited by whitefang, 23 may 2009 - 06:37 pm. indexed

1 great review, batbrick! iamded got what he deserved. x-d

1 thank you very much for a fine review, batbrick. *y* what the.... i never realized these cool grey barrels till now.... that?s pretty interesting. :-) the whole chopper looks very good, with a well fitting power function. it?s for sure a rewardable work to change that baby into a real mf version with accessible cockpit. :'-)

1 i am definitely getting this set. thanks for the nice review!

-1 i wish i could just get those grey barrels alone, the rest of the set doesnt really intreigue me much :-$ thanks for the review.

1 haha your review are so funny and so lego cool

1 thanks guys, heres the final part: the instructions for the boat begin on page 46: the overall set, its actually much nicer than i thought it would be, the pictures on the box make it look ugly. top view, tommy guns do not actually come with set ;-) side view, the designers have done an excellent job with the hull, considering the lack of many slopes pieces. you can see it is pretty much minifig scale too: here you can see that by pushing in the red technic axle, the "anchor" on the front will be hauled back into the boat: back view, these outboard motors are pretty cool, though i wish they could go own into the water more: overall, though the weakest model, its still a lot of fun, and has a clever way around the lack of a shapely hull. i was impressed with it after the building it, it even has two rounded snotty bottom pieces on the nose of the boat to give the impression it is speeding through the water with the front lifting up. lots of leftover pieces for this one: the pieces: sorry about the poor photograph there, it was getting late :-$ overall the cargo chopper is another great set in the fantastic creator line. loads of fun, great play, and some clever designs, it challenges you to make your own things, and even includes some nifty pieces (bley barrels! *wub* ) i won't give it a rating, but i'll just say i certainly recommend it to fans of the theme and lego fans in general. now, finally, iamded and i teamup in the face of a larger foe. get that lord of pies! batbrick away! >:-)

1 congrats to that nice review.... i like the batcave set, you should also been able to find it at discount....

1 thank you for your wonderful review! ) i was done very well.... ) i suggest that you will find "two-face's escape" set a very interesting one to build.... it also provides great playability and is not very expensive for what you will get. ) good day to you. )

1 6258 smuggler's shanty overview smuggler's shanty was released in 1992, it consisted of 69 pieces, 3 minifigs (two pirates, one imperial) and it cost $9.25 (usd). the set itself is a small but rather sturdy den for the pirates! review: the minifigs consist of two pirates and one imperial. the minifigs are not all that rare, which is disappointing, i would of liked a rarer fig! but still it is a good cheap source of pirate and imperial figures. here is an overall shot of the set, which includes the three figs, the shanty which is made using palm leaves pieces, and a nice grey shark nibbling at the soldier's oar. a close up of the soldier rowing hard in his boat. i would have preferred to have a normal soldier with shako hat, as i have more officers than normal soldiers now!: and a close up snap of the main structure. note the wine glass, which was a nice touch! funnily enough, only 4 pieces of treasure were included in this set, compared to the usual 8 gold coins in other sets. a view from the back, which also gives a good view of the pieces used to construct the shanty mainly simple black 1 by 1 bricks: the shanty looks good from most angles but their are a few where the roof construction looks rather odd, but that is just a minor nitpick! yet another view from the front,, this time at a slightly different angle. the yellow base plate looks rather nice too, i prefer it over the tan pieces we trend to get nowadays: "attack!!" the stupid drunk pirate in the background does not even notice! overall i think this is a rather good set, despite some shortcomings, such as the lack of treasure and odd roof from some angles. the shark, imperial soldier and useful parts make up for it, and of course the price is cheap on most auction sites, i got mine for a mere ?5 ($10), with the cheapest price on bricklink being $8. rate the set then leave your comments, thoughts and opinions!!!

0 first i'll comment on the review and at a later date i'll comment on the set. you've done a top job lord of pies *y* you've captured the set from a variety of angles and posed the mini-figures interestingly.

1 simonwillems, on feb 19 2008, 07:47 pm, said: nice poll as well, but you made sure nobody can give this set a 1 which is very nice (but probably a little mistake :-d ). i gave it the top-rating. *y* so i have, oops! i never was very good at maths. :-p

1 i bought one of these new from bricklink a few months ago as part of my pirate splurge i went on. i really enjoyed this set because of the amount of figs in such a small set, though pirates were always pretty good about their fig count. also the neat little hut is nicely done for its purpose. great review, btw!

1 a very nice review of a pretty and neat little set, thanks lord of pies, guess its a 3 for me, with strong tendencies to 4....

0 woow :d this was my first lego set ever!

0 i'd give the set a 3 1/2 out of 5. it needed 1 more imperial to get a 4. a bigger basplate would have been nice as it appears to hard to fit all the minifigs on the island. thanks for this great review

0 laurinator- i don't mind an occassional old review coming back to life for discussion, but it seems you've replied to many old reviews that have been stagnant for years. please try to refrain from "bumping" a lot of old topics as it pushes down new content that should really be the focus of discussion now.

0 well since this topic has resurfaced, i would add my 2 cents about my appreciation of this set. it was the first and (unfortunately) the largest pirate set i owned as a kid, but i played the wazoo out of it. some of the minifigs have lost almost all their face printing after so many play sessions! theres just something about the hut that appealed to me more than the cheesy skull-face islands we keep getting.probably that it wa kind of neutral, good for my pirates, settlers or islanders. though the palm leaves were rather fragile and used to break off the studded parts. it would be nice to get more of these "beach village army builder" sets. edited by ardelon, 21 september 2014 - 03:40 pm.

1 hi guys. i picked these up the other day, but it's taken me this long to get round to posting the reviews. so, here we go: tub comparison with a minfig (thanks brainbox): the lighting changes a bit throughout the photographs, as it was going dark outside, so i only really had my desk light, and i kept getting in the way. 4837 mini trains now the box i really like. it's no different to those of last year's sets, but the colour here is simply fantastic, and really seems appropriate for the theme. so this is what you get inside. all the pieces are still inside the bag, the optical illusion was accidental :-d . no pieces of particular outstanding interest, but the dark green cheese slopes are rather nice. look out for those later. 1 2 3 this is the main model, and uses all the pieces in the set (bar these two, which according to the inventory are spares, but as with all my other creator sets, i'm cheating and leaving them in). this is far and away the best model of the three, and evokes the iconic version of a steam train. the green looks superb, but i'm not sure whether that's due to the model itself or the actual colour. moving on, we get to the second model: 1 leftovers (yes, i admit, i was using a piece of paper) this isn't actually a bad model. i don't think it's quite as nice as the previous one, but it's not bad. it's different from the first model as well, which is good. too muich of the same can be a bad thing. finally, we come to the third model: leftovers now... i'll be honest. i don't really know what this is. it's not that good a model compared to the other two. that's all i can say, really. and of course, all the pieces fit into the tub. overall: i have to say, i do like this set, despite the weak third model. the strength of the primary and secondary models make up for any weaknesses in the third, and i can imagine the pieces being fully usuable in building other trains. while the basic idea of these tubs isn't quite as good as the x-pods with regards portability and general 'niceness' they aren't bad. and for a fairly cheap price (?3-4) as well. 4838 mini vehicles this is one of those set boxes that you see because of the ridiculously loud colours. sound marketing scheme if you ask me. i've managed it again. there are pieces outside the bag. or are there? now these i like *y* . 1 2 (i don't know what the clip is for, there isn't one on the other side) 3 4 5 this is the main model of the set, and again all the pieces are used bar these three, the spares. it's quite a nice model, although the car's a bit odd. still, i like the ramps, and the colour scheme reminds me just a little of g1 ultra magnus. hmm, i think that boom arm could do with refixing... 1 2 leftovers this is actually quite nice as well. it's that classic breakdown truck, and the boom arm itself is quite nice, with quite a bit of movement. another solid model. 1 leftovers i'm surprised by the amount of detail here actually. not only have tlc included a spare wheel at the back, but also what looks like a trailer hitch, which all adds to the 'realism.' another nice model to round out a nice set. and in the tub. overall: i'm not sure which of the two i like better. when i bought them, and on the way home, i much preferred the train set. but after building this set, i'm not sure. this is another good set from the year when tlc seems to be giving us so many. there are some good pieces in here too, and while there's nothing unique, they're still good. so, thanks for reading, hope it helped someone, and if there are any requests, i'll see what i can do. that's requests for pics, not songs ;-) . edited by whitefang, 23 may 2009 - 06:56 pm. indexed

0 why not? they are all very nice (i have all six of them), especially the helicopter, my least anticipated, but one of the most detailed!! thanks for the review brainbox!!

1 so here it is finally, my first ever review of a lego set..oh wait, it's actually 2 sets. so i don't really know how to do it right, but i'll try the best. (sorry if some pictures are a litte bit dark, but i'm not really into photography and i got bad light here) let's start with the dwarf's mine defender: theme: castle 2008 set name: dwarf's mine defender number: 7040 pieces: 86 price: ?9,99 (eur) first, as always, the box: the back, a few instructions on how the defender works, for those how don't know ;-) : and the instructions: we continue with the minifigs, sorry i forgot to make a closeup of the dwarf: and finally the mine defender itself, i personally think it isn't as bad as maybe some people think. the chain for the catapult is great i think: i kinda love those controls, the mechanism with the rubbe rband actually works pretty well, but only on a not-glossy underground. that's pretty much all of it, it's small but i like it a lot. so let's go on to the tower raid now, which would be my absolute favorite of those new sets. -------------------------------------- theme: castle 2008 set name: tower raid number: 7037 pieces: 364 price: ?29,99 (eur) again, first the box & instructions: we got 2 sets of instructios here, one for the tower and one for the siege tower: the minifigs, we got one archer and one soldier here, both with the torsos of the 2007 sets: now thw orc side, starting with the great leader, with the new armor and the golden helmet (i love those pieces!): closeup of the armor & helmet: then we got another orc-knight: and the prisoner, with handcuffs! the crownie tower looks great overall, though there is something i don't really like about it, but later on that. now the back, and that is what really bothers me, there areno walls on the first floor except the one with the wall-piece and the door, and theprison also is open at the back. the orc easily could jump out there: not sure what these are all about, they really don't add much to the set: enough rant now, let's go on with a pretty sweet detail, the golden crystal on the little table: the wall piece on the first floor you can ram in: and finally the very best thing of this set, the amazing orc siege tower! from the front: the great working ram, you can pull it back very far and it got pretty much power: here we got another sweet detail, the siege "platform" that moves out by pulling a cord in the back of the tower: finally a picture of a bit siege action: if you ram in the lower wallpiece, the brown shelfs of the prison-floor collapse and the prisoned orc is finally free! summary: likes: as i mentioned before, i really think that's the best ever produced siege tower, it's got so mich details and works extremely well, also the overall look of it is magnificant. the destroy-mechanism of the tower is pretty cool too, the brown door is a fine detail too. nothing much to say about the mine defender, i like this little set, and there's nothing really to bother about it. dislikes: the back of the tower. that's really the only thing that's a bit bad imo, they could have put there 2 more walls on the first floor and something to lock the prison easily. final thought: the tower raid for me personally is the best of the 2008 sets so far, it's got great playability and looks simply good. my opinion: buy it!

0 thanks for these fantastic review. it's the first time i take a good look at these sets. there is a good chance i'll buy the dwarf's mine defender, especially for that price.

1 thank you for these fine reviews, metalandi. *y* there?re really some nice playable features in the tower raid set, and all these great orc torsos, just sweet! and it even looks like that black orc-armor?s a new piece, lovely.... :'-)

1 thanks for the double review, i like the dwarf catapult but the real deal is the tower raid set. i love that siege tower and love that new armour, can't wait to get it. thanks for the review! batbrick away! >:-)

1 thanks metalandi! these are 2 great sets, i'm definately looking forward to seeing these in new zealand stores! the collapsing floor/prisoner freeing mechanism on the tower is wonderful, a great touch. some slight modifications, like, some walls, will make this perfect. and the dwarf's mine defender is a sweet little set, with some neat minifigs. thanks for the reviews! *y* ~peace

1 thanks for the review, i personally think the siege tower is probably the best one which lego has ever produced.

1 thanks for the great review. *y* the siege tower does look great. i'll have to look out for these sets. edited by zouave, 14 march 2008 - 07:24 pm.

1 damn you to hell dunamis >:-( now tks to you i really want the 3 sets put together x-d wow that is what i call a sweet review 8-? tks for taking the time to make once again such a fantastic one ;-) the overall look of the building is brilliant and i love the nice additions they did: the cheese and mouse (jerry :-d ) is hilarious !! i didn't know green grocer had a rodent infestation !! and the use of the new built furniture and detils like the radiator is freaking awsome !! also that set has a definite plus for me: its the back details !! i love the stairs, the deck with table !! wowx that is what i call sweet backdoor details !! now its clear that i will need to buy the 3 sets asap !! tks once again dunamis ;-) *yoda*

1 very nice. very nice, indeed. lots of lovely, little details, even at the back. this review hasn't changed my opinion one bit, i'm still looking forward to when i can finally pick up mine at the post office. i'm crossing my fingers that there will be more buildings following after this one. i'm guessing that lego's just testing the waters to see how far afol's are willing to go regarding price vs. details. green grocer is still epic, though.

1 man, these sets are so awesome. incredible work done by the designers there, must have took a long time to get all this ogether. if they weren't too expensive i would go and buy them all 3 right away *wub*

1 like the set, this review also deserves a 10/10. i've ordered this set yesterday on s@h. seeing and reading this review, i'm convinced it will be worth the money. so, bonaparte is finally entering the city theme !!!

1 wow,, thanks for the nice review! i have the other 2 sets and waiting for this to come to our shores. stupendous design and details! i really like the "hammer-rails" on the roof. cant wait!!! *wub*

1 a very fine review with great and informative pictures, thanks dunamis! *y* and what a wonderful set, a masterpiece and far beyond everything i would?ve expected just one year ago.... the amount of details is exceptional, from the different railings to the mousehole and the radiator.... sheer brilliant. :'-) and two female mfs (or hippies, you never know....) and a child.... only one adult male character who nearly looks like.... well, anyways. it?s simply a milestone, and a very creative and inspiring beauty. *wub* easter parade on! and, sweet gg.... will you marry me? :-$

1 o. m. g. i must have that set!! :'-) *y* *wub* i remember you telling me that you were going to do a review of this set, and i was so anxious! i love these reviews! thanks so much! great pictures. *wub* *y* *y* this will dent my wallet. 8-| i am so envious!

1 a very informative review, indeed. thank you so much for doing so. now i know that the price is worth every penny leaving my pocket. ;-) what do you guys think is tlc putting up as the next modular set? is it asking too much of tlc to produce 1 modular set each quarter (4 times a year)?

1 a million thanks for this review. this is greater than i thought. i especially like that clock. i'm going to get this set as soon as possible.

1 :-) amazing!!! great review!!! :-d u have totalyl convinced me to get this set! its so wonderful, filled with great details. what a waste, i can't order it in s@h because i am from singapore :'-( i hope it will come to my country, so i am able to buy it!!! :-)

1 great review. thanks for taking the time to do this. this has been a great line. at the risk of abandoning my castle/adventurer loyalties. i've got to say this is rapidly becoming my favorite line and this set looks to be the best of the lot. while it still hurts to shell out $150, i think i'll still be happy to do so. steve

1 i?ve got something, i want to share with you. a beautiful dream came true: #1: the box: top: back: the alternate model is also very well done. the pneumatics dump the bucket and open the flap (?). open: you can see a diagram how the pneumatics work. just a happy kid playing. the plastic inlays (?): all: #2: the parts: as you can see, 8854 offers a very large variety of different parts. loads of technic bricks, gears and even plates. also note the threaded axle 10, 5 large pulleys, a big turntable and the 1x20 rack. #3: building: the mechanism for the outriggers and the rotation of the turntable: the turntable: the pneumatics are finished: the mechanism for the telescope: the finished model: #4 random shots: you can see how the turntable will be rotated. thanks for reading- erm? viewing the pictures! please comment if you want to!

0 cp5670, on mar 10 2008, 05:53 am, said: the old tubes also grip the nozzles much more firmly and if you aren't careful when removing them, it's actually possible to rip off the nozzles completely. x-o i actually noticed that while taking it apart but didn't really pay any attention. i just thought that's because it's an old part. well, thanks for the information!

0 this was my first pneumatic set

1 thanks for reviewing all these old sets! will you be doing any more?

1 this set is really cool. i might actually get it!

1 natelite, on mar 10 2008, 05:57 pm, said: hmm, seems like the wheels are recycled into the harley truck in the 2008 batman set! nope. the harley-truck-wheels are thinner and somewhat more modern. i do believe they're the same like in 8274. aaaaaaaand: for a long time in my life these wheels have been the best and coolest looking i've ever had! so where's your deference? :-d recycled... |-/ x-d

1 bernddasbrot, on mar 10 2008, 05:56 pm, said: you've just motivated me to go on a "senseless-preliminary-design-errors-hunt"...! man..., this set is a disaster what were they thinking! :-d :-p i just remembered one other fun aspect of this set: the crane hook can be attached to the underside of the rear bumper, to hold it in position while driving along, but when things are like this and you try and wind up the cable the winch is strong enough to break the (original provided lego) rope.... it 'worked' with my copy. :-d so this set is capable of demolishing itself.... but still, one of the best technicsets i have, with all stickers intact. i'm not so sure about that flag though, must check on that.

1 wow, that first picture is great! you must have a very wide angle lens with the capability to focus very close (macro). the perspective makes the model look huge. nice work. i think the suspension on this set is my favorite of all technic. it has such large travel and is so.... what word should i use..... "bouncy". hey, why do you only review sets which are red? :-d eric

1 i read blackbirds technopedia page on this truck the other week, went onto ebay and picked up a misb copy for 25 gbp bargin, great to get old sets unopened, peeling the plastic off of the specialist parts was always cool! love the front suspension

1 somehow i also managed to get this set in very good condition (including box, instructions and all stickers) for a mere 22 a few months ago. this is indeed a very special set, and was a pleasure to build. the only flaw i noticed was weak support of the rear drivetrain, which was easily corrected with a few extra plates.

0 junkstylegio, on mar 23 2010, 11:17 pm, said: huh? like where? don't have that much problems with that rear train. (at least if i you don't trow the model down the stairs or something like that...) maybe it's unusual, but this section of the drive train didn't hold that well on my model: this is how it looks now: the parts made redundant were left in the built model, that's why there's that useless 8-tooth gear there :p

1 thanks for the great review vbbn! *y* i already own 2 of these x-d on your camera there should be a little flower sign, switch to that to go to micro mode ;-) it's a really good first review *y* *sweet*

1 sweet first pic review! *y* i got this set for a birthday present last year, and it is pretty fun overall. the alien ship in this set is actually one of my favorites. it just looks cool, and the way you can fold it out is really clever. the only negative for me is the cockpit of the mining unit. not really because it isn't detailed, but because mine is top heavy, and keeps falling forward. it's kinda funny if you think about him driving along and then falling forward...but not funny at all when you're playing. |-/

0 thank you for your nice review, vbbn! *y* but it only confirms: this theme is not my cup of tea. weird aliens, strange colors, parts stuck together with no idea. :-| i always hated this big wheels - it?s even worse in orange. :-x saving money for different sets on! (and that doesn?t mean it was a bad review ;-) )

1 holodoc: i agree with you. and the buety of being a custom parts maker is that i can recolor these... :-) *y* athos: sure, buddy. they have moving arms, legs, (a real mf!) the arms and legs are the same just flipped. :-) edited by ~vbbn~, 14 march 2008 - 01:12 am.

1 hi! this is my forth (old-school) technic set review! since blakbird pointed out that all my technic reviews are red, i chose a yellow dune blaster for today! just kidding. this set is red as it should be! (don't worry my next reviews will be yellow and black... uhhh forshadowing... ;-) ) i will start with some facts! 277 elements and released in 1994 that's enough. #1: the box: #2: the parts: #3: building instructions and catalogues: wow! no folds, no wear marks - simply: *wub* "was lesen coole kids?" - "klick! das super magazin fuer coole kids!" (how obvious...) #4: building: no differential. i really love the way the 1x8 technic bricks on the sides will be positioned later. fun fact: the engine contains no 2l-technic axle. ...and finished. a real quick build. #5: spare parts: ...for the alternate model. the yellow technic handle should be from 8412. maybe a bonus feature from the seller! #6: random shots: #7: final thoughts: this is my second 8829 and i also noticed that the engine turns very hard. the alternate model is really (sorry to all those of you who like it) crappy. i mean- a nice idea, but not with this wheels! :-| anyway: a really beautiful technic-set! *reminiscing* (this word exists, does it?) thanks for viewing the pictures, i hope you enjoyed it! please comment if you want to! edited by bernddasbrot, 21 march 2008 - 02:09 pm.

1 that looks like a very nice set! :-) in your opinion, how does it compare to the current dune buggy? -toa of justice

1 great set, great review, although the set looks better in yellow. :-d

1 hello all apologize for digging out a such old post. recently i got a bag of lego technic parts where there have been mixed three sets: 8858, 8829 and 8235 the resurrection of 8858 has been described by me in a separate post. going back to the dune buggy  when i saw it for the first time back in 1994 i did not like it, as i was always big fan of 8840 (which i consider to the day the best looking buggy) and set 8829 looked to me ugly. so there were those all parts in the bag then i though why not build it ? and i started to do it. when i finished i was very surprised how the final look of this set is! really taking my words back. unfortunately in the bag there were missing some parts and i could not rebuild the back spoiler. so i made some changes to it and make it from spare parts that i have and it came out acceptable. i also added some additional parts such as fake steering wheel, rally logo, antennas. i have also reverse mounting of the rear tires  why lego did them like that i never know  as i think they look better this way. set: well the review has been already made by owner of this post so i will only add few things into it. engine  v2 (aired cooled?) is driven by 4 gears -> from the single wheel (no differential as in 8840) using two old school z14 tooth bevel , then by z24 tooth crown and z8 tooth type 1. actually the (as in most old sets) the pistons are moving very fast (not as in current sets) and smooths  i needed to extra clean all engine parts as there was a lot friction. suspension  set has engine bay working using two old gray shock absorbers 6,5l  the movement is not big but works very nice, better then in 8840 in my opinion. steering  this is a bit odd as there is no direct connection to hog as in most old sets, but first the gear rack is moved by z8 then two z14 tooth where reverse movement is taking place. later connection of two old school z14 tooth bevel goes to hog details  this is the most that i like in this set, specially how the use of axle pin connector perpendicular and 1x10 bricks with 3x3 cut corners and plate 1x5 toothed ends 2 studs with center axle hole are making the body shape  is just wonder. tires  the balloon rear are pretty nice the front is a new version of those that were in 8840. what i do not like: 1. missing of technic figure (8840 had it.) 2. no steering wheel in the original set 3. no differential  but having in mind that lego has introduce 24-12 teeth would be difficult to build the transmission in such small space where the engine is. i will shortly upload new pictures and post them here later on . over all  i think it is worth buying it as it is very payable ! actually very payable and runs smoothly , the steering, suspension  perfect thank you and regards

1 finally, after a very frustrating incident with the internet explorer 7's 'back' button, i present to you my very first review. this is a review of set 8158 speed racer vs snake oiler, it's also the first review of a speed racer set on eurobricks. also you should know that i didn't put the stickers on as they can be quite valuable later on down the road, so i'm sorry for the lack of stickers. :-$ so without further ado i present to you my first review. he he, that rhymes. :-d edit: i just finished resizing the pics and uploading them to brickshelf after having a heated argument about when my bedtime is with my mother. so, i will be doing a complete redo of the picture portion of my review of set 8158. i'm going to work on that as soon as i finish typing this message... edit 2: review fully redone now, *sighs*, that took forever. edit 3: almost forgot to put in a new link to its brickshelf folder. this is v.2 of my review of set 8158, enjoy... theme: speed racer set:8158 speed racer vs snake oiler price: $19.99us pieces: 242 minifigs: 2 first off pics of the box, instructions, dss, minifigs, and new parts: there are so many stickers they had to number them! x-o so's sunglasses are chrome gold. 8-? close-up of the hemets. new parts include, first system lego hubcap, new more curvy fenders, curved windshield, and a s-shaped connector piece. now onto the build, first speed racer's mach 5: back part of the car. the cockpit of the car. they connect with the new s-shaped piece. front part of the car. front and cockpit also connected using the new s-shaped piece. side view of the car, so far. underside of the car, so far. adding more detail. ground level front view of the car. side view with added detail. underside with newly added axles. demonstrating how the new hubcaps are put on. now on to building snake oilers orange-ilicious racer: back part of the car. the cockpit of the car. they are connected using the s-shaped piece. front part of the car with seemingly random color choices. *wacko* the front and cockpit are also connected using the new s-shaped piece. adding orange-irific fenders. side view of the car so far. adding more detail. smoothing things over. ground level view with lime green "eyes" and white "fangs". side view with more detail. rearword view of the car with newly added cuve-acious windshield. no hubcaps!?! :-| now onto finished views of both cars, first the mach 5: side view with sweet hubcaps. up close and personal with the mach 5. a rearend shot. "i got hubcaps, i got hubcaps!", speed racer. now so's snake racer, yes thats what i'm calling it. :-p :-d beautiful! blurry, :-$ rearend pic. "watchout it bites!", snake oiler he's ready to take on sr, hubcaps or no hubcaps! >:-) racin'! now for some comparison shots: hope you all like v.2 better then v.1, i know i liked it better. x-d seriously though i even learned a thing or two doin' this last version. ;-) now it's time for my summary: overall a very well designed and executed set. it's only downfalls are that there are way too many stickers, 32 to be exact, :-| and there are no cool contraptions on the cars to take out the other racer. a great buy for $19.99, i reccomend this set to everybody because of the reasons i staed above and because even i, who is not a big fan of speed racer, x-o was drawn to this spectacular little set. price: 10/10 pieces: 8/10 too many stickers. minifigs: 9/10 needed some accessories. playability: 8/10 needs some cool contraptions on the cars to take out the other racer. overall: 35/40 general tarful edited by imperialshadows, 01 june 2008 - 12:07 pm.

1 what store did you find this at? x-o great review.

-1 i'm sorry, but your review has only served to further enlighten me that these sets are a pile of cack! absolutely lazy design and the only reason i'd get one is for the windscreen so i can build a proper landspeeder from star wars... m.

0 hmm.... very interesting. thanks for the review, generaltarful. *y* both cars, although pretty wide, look still very sleek and fast. especially from the side. and solid, too.... but the front of the mach 5 without the stickers.... i dont know. from some angles it looks good, and a little bad from some other.... 8-| sticker mayhem, again, but very useful parts nevertheless. btw, what was the price..? and, hinckley, do you have a brother or is this just the start of a new career? :-p

1 thanks for the review. *sweet* i love these sets... but buying them will depend on the australian price. just to be a nag, you really need to reduce the picture size. remember that whie the pictures are resized by the forum software, this is done browser side so it isn't as useful as it would seem. the full picture is still loaded, just the same as brickshelf. legofranks, on mar 23 2008, 10:49 am, said: i'm sorry, but your review has only served to further enlighten me that these sets are a pile of cack! absolutely lazy design and the only reason i'd get one is for the windscreen so i can build a proper landspeeder from star wars... m. i'm surprised you feel that way. i think these sets are great and i love how they are no where near as juniorised as i feared.

1 thanks for the review, i think i'll certainly get these sets. they look very nice and have nice minfigs (i love racing, as long as minifigs could sit in them). the fact that there are so much stickers make me think this is an model building theme, like when you build plastic cars (with all those tiny pieces and a load of stickers). but that 's'-shaped thingy does already exist, doesn't it? edited by matn, 23 march 2008 - 11:40 am.

1 sinner, on mar 23 2008, 11:55 am, said: yes, i have a few of them. great pieces too! i don't think i've seen them in a set for years though. it's good to see them back. but... 32 stickers? that's more than any of the first wave of ef ever had! still, the set itself is very nice, with some nifty new pieces, and the minifigs are pretty cool too. i may not be familiar with speed racer, but i still may get this. i'll go and see the film as well, to fill in the background (of the set).

1 yay, finally! thanks for the great review. it confirmed that i am most definately getting these *wub* the orange racer is absolutley beautiful! once again, awesome review! *sweet*

1 as i said elsewhere i couldn't see this reviewed anywhere so here you are! to start with, a couple of box shots: the contents and the parts laid out: the instructions: this is what was left over from the build: and here's the kit complete. build time, about ten seconds if you pick your nose whilst you are doing it. :-d i love the little robot, it reminds me of that weird machine in the first wallace and gromit adventure, in fact, give it some skis and you are away. oh, and it has a metal detector thingy which i might have to borrow for a future episode of grunts (i'm not sure if i have any already...who knows...) cost - 2.49. value for money? erm, no, knock a quid off and i'd say yes. dr. s.

1 i want that set so badly. i went to a lego store last weekend and they only had the fire and police ones. :'-( i want it for the metal detector. serious whackin' instrument >:-) .

1 nice review, short but good. x-d exobuilder, on mar 23 2008, 02:59 am, said: except it comes with one of those hideous faces! ( that's right, i'm talking to you micvash and phred! ) *sweet* now this just calls for a smackdown, doesn't it? :-d

1 ah, what a very fine classic set.... and all these lovely technic beams with studs! *wub* thank you very much for that excellent review, bernd, and you did a fantastic job with all these great pictures! :'-) *y*

1 another nice review. the slow shutter speed pictures are great. i think that was the only set with 8 distinct functions for a very long time and was only displaced by the 8455 backhoe in that respect. the turntable on the back doesn't turn very well though, as the weight is all distributed on one side. the screw axle prevents it from popping off but there is still a lot of friction in it. i don't have mine built anymore but it might be worth trying to put a weight brick or something on it. quote do you have 8455 as well? i'd love to see how they compare side by side... it looks bigger than 8455 but i don't own any of the big old chuncky tires so i find it so hard to tell. yeah, it's quite a bit bigger. when everything is fully extended, it becomes something like 26" long. although the 8455 actually has more/better functionality. edited by cp5670, 24 march 2008 - 08:15 am.

1 by the way, don't forget to build the alternate model of 8862. it is a combine (farm equipment) which is just as good as 8274. i liked it so much that i bought two copies of this set so i could display both. my favorite alternate model (not counting universal sets) is the 8480 submarine. maybe it is time for a white set review? *skull* white is pretty rare. for your blue set, i recommend you review 8462. there are only a couple of green sets, and 8479 is the best. and then of course, 8458 is silver!! i think we all know what the best black set is. and according to your photography, you have lots of them! but don't forget 8868. eric

0 bernddasbrot, on mar 24 2008, 05:39 pm, said: could you explain your thoughts please? you know: my english skills ;-) i was thinking you could somehow attach a 16-tooth dark gray gear (the one that spins freely around axles) to the nut, which would make the axle move in and out when the gear turned and convert the gear's rotary motion to linear motion in a fairly compact package. although there are other ways of doing the same thing that don't use such rare parts, and the 2008 technic sets will come with pre-built linear actuators anyway.

0 blakbird, on mar 25 2008, 06:42 pm, said: wow, that's a long exposure. i would think you would get way too much light and overexpose the image. the aperture must have been tiny. for the aperture i don't know what i've used, but my room was already very darkend as i tool the photos. it was actually serendipity. ;-) blakbird said: cool. i am also planning to write about the combine on technicopedia. i will but i'll need some time. i really shoud do a few things for university (that's also the reason why i succeded in so many other things... :-| ) blakbird said: you don't own 8480? that is unacceptable. it is imperative that you put a mortgage on your house immediately to get it! not again!!! *sing* (just kidding. my parents will. x-d ) blakbird said: while the assembly you have drawn would work as a linear actuator, i would not recommend it. the torsional stiffness and strength of an axle are proportional to the polar moment of inertia, a section property. most of the stiffness comes from the outside of the cross shaped axle. but in the threaded axle, you lose all the stiffness of the outer area because it is not continuous. this means you only get stiffness and strength from the small core. i think the threaded axle would bend and break very easily if subjected to much torque. the toothed 10l axle doesn't look very robust, you're right. on brickshelf i once saw another version using a worm gear and a halfbush being moved along another axle. edited by bernddasbrot, 28 march 2008 - 05:12 pm.

0 i'm very sorry for that doublepost... i made a picture for you, sinner, but forgot to upload it: your dad, patrick parrot, driving a giant backhoe. sadly his second job as photojournalist and the fact that bianca lamb was strolling by, distracted him. as a consequence he spoiled the whole construction site bringing death and doom with a technic backhoe to fabuland. and a little walrus baby. *y* :-p

1 some time ago i sort of complained about the fact that there was not much technic represented in the eurobricks community (this was the topic, if someone is interested). i am glad to see someone took that complaint serious and started reviewing technic sets on large scale to show us how fascinating the theme really is! this review is once again an excellent one, i really enjoyed reading it. i must buy this set sometime soon because i always liked the three-way pneumatic system it came with and the overall look of the machine. for many years it seemed out of reach, much to expensive and hard to come by as a kid. now as an adult there are many ways to acquire this wonderful set. keep on reviewing! *y*

1 29 times! great review, these are some sweet lookin' rides. :-d very similar to the other set, but still great. *y* thanks! ~peace

1 a very good review, thanks generaltarful. *y* thats an interesting set for sure, and especially the red car looks really fine. air intakes, very nice.... :'-)

1 speaking of pocket knives, i just got speed racer and snake oiler at k-mart and might mod the helmet so it actually looks like the cartoon. the problem is - i don't want to shell out two bucks for a clear visor! >:-( by the way, i know trans-clear visors are non-production, but where did they come from? a pick-a-brick? if so, what store? well at least if i do go through getting the elusive clear visor, it's not as bad as the insane $25+ red vader helmet! this set is great. i would have gotten this along with the one i purchased, but i didn't have enough dough with me to get both.

1 crap, now i want these sets!! great review!

1 thanks for this review, it's a nice set with some cool pieces and nice techniques, i like the way the roof pieces are used to make the spiders back, for instance lasse d, on mar 26 2008, 09:48 pm, said: alternate models: 3 it is hard to come up with alternate models with so many small pieces and plates that are only 1 stud wide. the colors might make you want to build a spyrius space ship. ouch! that's not a good thing, let's refrain from that.... ;-)

1 a fine review of a fine set, thanks lasse d! *y*

1 thank you for your detailed review, lasse d! *y* the only problem about this set is, that most of the people here will regard this as a pure parts pack. x-d oooh - i just found out about the red "teeth" - cool. i want that! *wub*

1 a mighty fine review you've created slyowl! *y* after some sleep i shall immerse myself more fully within it.

1 nice review ( although i'm pretty sure eldorado fortress has 8 minifigs, making this set no 4 in the minifig count.) i gave it a 5. the number of islanders and vegetation pieces comes in very handy for land based scenarios. i've got 3 copies of this set, 1 of them costing me less than 2euro's from an ebay auction in scotland. along with forbidden island it's easily one of the most common and affordable pirate sets to be found on he second hand market.

1 good review, mr. slyowl! and good pics too! i know it probably deserves better but i only give him a 3. i'll be surely the only saying that i don't like this set but i remember i had it for christmas when i was a child and it disappointed me very much because i expected it much larger after seeing it in the lego catalogs. well it's just a little trauma i had :-p lol anyway i must admit it's an interesant set, specially because of the large number of mini-figures and accesories it brings with and the two little "ships" edited by bluebard, 31 march 2008 - 01:13 am.

1 it's a great set and one i have yet to add to my collection despite my large number of islander extras. enchanted island, aside from having so alluring a name was good value for money in that you only needed this one set and you had a good representation of the islanders both in the size of the set and the number of minifigs. the flipping rope bridge and the river give it a great rainforest retreat sort of feeling and one is inclined to think of this set as more inland than directly coastal for me. whilst the islanders were never seen in the same light or popularity as pirates and imperials they were an obvious and colourful addition that to me added a whole new depth to the pirate system and one was now able to play a 3 or 4 way war adding a greater political element to the sets. enchanted island is probably the 3rd most appealing of the large land bases for me after port royal and eldorado fortress. good review and glad to see the set recognised!

1 wow, that is one great review you made sly! i gave it a four, only thing i don't like is the raised baseplate. it does get you a lot of figs, two ships and some nice assecories, great set!

1 i was just going into my dark ages when lego began the islander themes, so i've never really cared for them. but this review actually made me want this set real bad. i guess this is what reviews are for then - good job on the review

-1 i realized that building the chess set from the new pirates theme, they are two grey heads that reminded me of the king kahuna throne, which goes to say that i am hoping they bring back new sets, i just wish they were bigger. i would love to build the old ones, but i would side more towards the newer model if they ever released them.

0 here is a preview of my review of speed racer: grand prix race i will try to get a full review up later today pics (when public) sorry about the blur, i am not a great photographer. also if, there are any pictures you would like (that i haven't included), just ask

0 sorry to bump such an old thread, but ive just discovered this set is on sale at amazon.de - for a mere 25 euros. i am tempted. not because i like the set or the models, but because of the parts. as most of you might know, im especially into exo-force. so would you recommend to get this set just for the parts? are they a good choice to combine with ef-sets? would anyone of you be interested in obtaining the fleshie-parts of the minifigs from me, as i totally dont need those?

1 hi! i've promised a lot lately. i'll review 8868, 8880, space police ii, blacktron ii... and i will. it's just the time that is blocking me. and my university. and the fact that i just picked up 8460 in original box for only eur 36,50...! *sweet* the other reviews will follow - please bear with me. and this set review is also a gift to this nice fellow who gave me the title! that's what i'm talking about: #1 useless information with high numbers: this set contains 841 parts and was released in 1995 in the technic / tech build / advanced (sub-) theme. the bricklink price guide displays for used a qty avg price of $125.85 and for new a qty avg price of $212.82. i got it for $56,98. still cant believe it. :'-) this set was rereleased two times (8431 in 2002 and 8438 in 2003). #2 the box: front: back: open: the box is higher than other technic boxes. why? i dont know. 8460 doesnt have any real large parts. whatever. inlay: i wonder why tlg doesnt make inlays anymore theyre noisy and brake easily but are great for (pre-) sorting. #3 building instructions: i will quote myself from the 8862 review: quote wow these instructions are used! i'm not used to this after all this sets with unread instruction booklets... triple-wow! nuff said. this is the first page. (fortunately peeron offers scans!) the last step for the alternate model and a few nice photos showing how the pneumatic pump will be erm- pumped. yeah. random page: i forgot the overall thoughts to the instructions: these are technic instructions as were used to them: part count, easy to understand (okay, the string part at the end was too much for me) and the color distinction is okay too. 100 pages long and if i can trust my eyes the pneumatics page can be fold out. (i dont have this page but i assume it.) #4 the parts: #5 building: an easy and fun build. okay, this could take some time. my longest building review up to date. the front steering: the rear steering. the axle pin between the rear steering is for the axle which rotates the crane. the two worm screws in the front are for the outriggers (theyre not linked. one for each side.) the small wheel in the back is for the rotation. adjusting front and rear steering. outriggers are finished. you can notice a 8 tooth gear that will rotate the technic turntable. a steering wheel has been added. could be the same stickers like the alternate 8880 used to have. the steering can be operated with both actinic lights (?) no. were far from finished. ive got a lot of parts left at this point. wow. a 4x4 corner plate! pneumatics and a winch: if you cant recognize it on the photo: the technic beams are the erm- wrong/other side up. the 1x6 technic beams on the left side are normal. the axle that will extend the crane: 7 gear racks 1x4 the 1x6 technic plate will keep the two pneumatic cylinders straight. *sad* 8-| huh? did you blink? you missed a special part: the whole rotatable thing will be attached to the technic turntable using two long technic pins. the pin on the right side should be in the middle of the three turntable holes. on the right side, its the first hole. asymmetric! why? because well add a cute cab! #6 functionality: you can find the features in comparison to other technic cranes here. technopedia, of course. i made one "sentence" out of it: (please dont find any mistakes.) :-p two axle rack and pinion steering, pneumatic luffing and gear driven telescoping via crank for the boom which can slew 360 on turntable driven via gear, crank driven hoist and gear driven outriggers at four corners which snap over center. #7 random shots: comparison to 8854: uuuh once again a depth of field. i tried to make it look authoritarian like 8858 but i failed. somehow 8460 looks cute. #8 comparison to 8421 mobile crane / crane truck: i feel that a question concerning this will be asked, so i deal with it right now. first of all: i dont own 8421 yet. i know. a technic freak really should own it. anyway: 8421 has more than twice as much parts as 8460, is motorized, features a v6-engine and a very neat mechanism to extend the crane/boom twice using a braided string with end studs. try to find out how! of course 8421 features (far) more than 8460. imho 8421 should have been a copy of 8460, a set so successful that it has been rereleased two times, but the designers overshoot the mark. 8421 is a (breathtaking) monster. compared to it, 8460 looks cute - not pale! #9 final thoughts: i got it on ebay in kind of good condition, for about 50 dollars. i know that it has been worth the money in any point of view. *wub* i didnt use the word old-school for now. ill change that: 8460 belongs to the favored few of old-school technic sets! thanks for reading and viewing the pictures, i hope you enjoyed it! please comment if you want to!

1 simonwillems, on apr 7 2008, 12:01 am, said: somehow i competely missed your review when you first made it, i saw your pics on brickshelf and wondered about the review... you have managed to review my all time favourite technic set! yeah, somehow i wonderd why only vbbn (thanks!) responded... but i learned from *yoda*s sig: "patience !! for a jedi it is time to eat as well !! eat, eat !! hot !! good food !!" :-d simonwillems said: it was the first large technic set i was given by my parents, when it first came out in 1995. i played for hours with this set, making minifig seats in it (it was so huge there was room for four minifigs to sit next to eachother in front....) i made various applications for it, a bungee-jump system with a large rubber band, and lots of containers to be lifted. the first changes i made included the inverting of the wheels and the disabling of one of the flashlight-steering wheels because they obstructed eachother. by the way, the nob for your winch is yellow instead of black (i know this set by heart, so watch out :-p ). i always liked those nobs. and people think you can't play / moc with technic (at all)...! x-d about the nob: erm yeah. i only found 3 black ones in the box and so i took the yellow one that i got as an extra with 8829. simonwillems said: the alternate model was great fun too, the pump is cleverly hidden and the crane folds up great between the cab and the loading platform. you could easily mod it with a pneumatic claw on the crane, a motor to turn it and a compressor. the only flaw was the loading platform which had no floor (only some axles). another reason for the 8460 as favorite set? it's got a "real" alternate model, not just a different erm- crane. simonwillems said: thanks so much for reviving my memorie concerning this great set! you're welcome, i consider this as my job! ;-) cp5670 said: ...but i keep all of them. there was actually a time when the boxes used to be even stronger. i have an old 8859 set and the outer box is made of a hard, styrofoam material, although they probably stopped using that for environmental reasons. that's the spirit! i got more than hundred boxes... and my 8848 box came with styrofoam too!

1 erdbeereis1, on apr 15 2008, 11:25 pm, said: actually they are ants. spiders have 8 legs while ants have only 6 like these. the two thing that look like legs in the front are the antennae. back on topic, i think this set looks great and i can't wait until i can get my hands on it and the other new ij sets. they must be ants, but i'm pretty convinced that what you think are the antennae, are the ants mandibles. a neat little set. front

1 thanks for this review alex54, this looks like a great set. i love the new hair molds and faces, plus al those extra pieces are fantastic! batbrick away!

1 can't wait to get this one (ants!!!) i don't have a tent either, so that'll be a great pickup. i'm surprised, though, that it includes the gold exo-force sword. i didn't expect this to come in any other sets besides the tower. <faramir-<

1 i'd buy a bunch of these just for the ants to make an ant farm! i also like the bowl cut.

1 ok! i think, it''s a no-brainer that this is a must-have for pretty much anyone who likes lego! it's cheap and a great minifigs & parts pack! i'll be getting at least 1 of these! here is what i like about it: 1. great minifigs with nice torsos, sweet faces, and awesome hair! (gotta ask 'em where they get it done! ) 2. golden katana! 3. chicken leg! yum! 4. nice campfire! and this is what i don't like about it: 1. dark bley knife! seriously, they could have at least made it silver like the sword, if not chrome! 2. rehashed tent. 3. spiders with 6 legs!!! i actually don't really care about the tent and the multi-legged creatures. those go straight into the sorting boxes. perhaps i might use the tent someday for a steampunk moc of some kind, or a stop-motion film, or maybe some kind of contest... anyway, what's up with that thing that holds the katana, the sword, and the saber? it's in the airplane set too! is it perhaps one of the treasures of the new movie or is it something indy takes with him everywhere in this film? 44however, nice pics, nice review! thanks, dude! edited by oky wan kenobi, 16 april 2008 - 09:38 am.

1 mhm...i really need this set! there are various things im interested in: the minifigs (hey, i still have no indiana jones figs!), the new hairpieces, a gold katana, a dark bley pirate cutlass (is this the first one?), a dark bley knife (could be useful..), those giant ants, yet another silver broad sword (you never have enough of those).....great parts pack indeed. shakar

1 great review; i will definitely get this, if not only for the hair but the ants, melee weapons, and new faces and torsos!

1 i simply that tent! i guess ill have to buy three of these just to make a proper expedition moc somewhen.... a great little set indeed, with marvelous new mf torsos and that new black feminine hairpieces also great and very useable for creating some characters related to the sixties and seventies. and finally a pan thats not black and a knife in grey. thats very handy indeed, the chrome one always looked a bit too shiny to me.... thanks for that sweet review, alex!

1 thanks for that great review! this is a very interesting set filled with nice parts for customisation. somemore, the price is not that steep. i will need to get ready for the second wave!

1 is that a laptop it's on? does it come with the set? seriously though, it looks liek it has some good pieces, particularily the soldier's clothing and the crocodile hehe. hooray for new indy sets, lets hope the film is as good (it will be).

0 joey lock, on apr 15 2008, 09:50 pm, said: i swear it is supposed to have stickers on the side of the car, boat, oil canister and windscreen? i expect it does, but alex54 has left them off it, like i do.

1 batbrick, on apr 15 2008, 05:39 pm, said: ...commies look great as well. haha! commies this set really looks great. i really see what you were saying about the whole retro thing. reminds me a bit of a dino island set, myself. except without the dinosaurs. always without the dinosaurs... this is a must get, does anyone know when these will be released in the us? <faramir-< edited by faramir, 15 april 2008 - 10:50 pm.

1 what are those bricks with the guns attached supposed to be? great review and set btw...

1 my favorite part of this is prob the amphibious vehicle! looks really neat! nice to see another (different) torso for marion...

1 thanks for the review! i really like this little-ish set, quite alot of detail, it reminds me of sets from the late 90's more soviets are always welcome too, and the new torso for marion is nice, as is the new dark green alligator all of the neat little accesories are great too, a cup, shovel, binoculars and of course the cans of gasoline again, thanks for the review, alex

0 shoc, on apr 15 2008, 10:31 pm, said: is that a laptop it's on? does it come with the set? yes it's a laptop, and it was in the set! when i opened it, i understood why this little box was so heavy! asus is my official sponsor, so i have to show the logo! i have to add that i don't have put on the stickers...

1 just like 7626 this is a must buy in my opinion. i just the amphibious vehicle,very nice for army building.

1 i like the creatures in this very much, and it is good to see the vehicle from different angles. thank you i think i shall buy this.

1 wow in the protype pics i kept thinking this thing looked lame; a boat on treads with saw blades? but this is definetly something i want now. lots of great plant and animal parts. and looks like plenty of wheels with those treads; its just begging to be made into a propor tank.

0 wow those trees look so weak compared to those enormous blades. anyway, a high-possibility-and-appeal-to-us-compulsive-lego-shoppers set, so, i'll try to get it, which means i'll obsesively look until i find. deforestation of puny trees, on!

1 thanks for the review alex i agree that this is the best set of kotcs sets (although the airplane comes quite close..). although i'm not too fond of the trees, the cave is good, and the jungle cutter is brilliant. plenty of great features, and very detailed, with much of the engine showing and a decent cockpit (if that's the right word..). the general and the two soviets are great too (could we have a close-up pic of them please? ), good to see that neither torso has exposed fleshy skin like the nazis. as said though, it is quite a pricy set, i was expecting it to be just over the price of race for the stolen treasure. great set, thanks again, alex!

0 here some close-up pics of the russian soldiers and the general : and i know that you have seen that i don't have put the stickers on...

0 xwingyoda, on apr 16 2008, 05:37 am, said: great review again alex !! same question (in case you didn't se it in my reply to the other set): where did you get those new sets ?? i really love that set !! its called jungle cutter the trees are really cool and make a great adition to it imo. that temple entrance or monument is really cool !! those bionicle parts do make fantastic vegetation !! you mean the spiny dk. green things that hang from the holes around the secret entrance? they were in the indy: temple escape. i totally forgot about that green frog !! thats cool , those are so cute !! 5 more ants is great !! the vehicle look really sharp (ah ah ah). 2 more commies yeay !! that officer is really freaky actually !! could have been a high rank under pol pot's regime in the s21... yeay looks more asian than russian imo yeah, tlc's really cranking out the new molds for both food and wildlife! so let's see... if i get all five sets... i get... 11 russians! and six are basic soldiers, although two are duplicates and triplicates. yes, that officer definitely has an italian look to him; those cheekbones are a little too high. now its time for my gripes: * same bloody rant about indy !! * i haven't read the instructions before but once again there are so many parts in crap colours that need to be changed look at all the crap red and yellow in there !! i will need to look for those parts before buying the set like i always do !! mod while building on !! same rant! any chance we could see the rpg? i am really soimpressed with that indy line !! i sincerely hope it will have a long and healthy life !! agreed! responses to the yodameister's review of alex54's review of the jungle cutter are in red. now to my opinion: great review! more reviews on!

1 looks great

1 what a lovely set! i think i have to put this on my wishlist,just for that beautiful woodcutting tank thingie. 2008 is gonna get expensive for me

0 the thing and the set is called jungle cutter and the reason the front pops off is because indy blows it up with a bazooka incase you wanted to know. thanks for the nice review

1 here's a review of the second largest set in the dragon masters subtheme for castle month, dark dragon's den! figs: the set comes with 3 dragon knights, two of which have the dragon wings on their helmets(sad thing is, one of my knights was missing the left wing on the helmet). there are also the definitive dragon, wiz the wizard (or majisto if you prefer)two horses, and a hawk( try to find him in each picture!) the set: there's a large spot under the mountain for the dragon to guard the treasure chest. the chest has 2 red and green 1x1 circles in it. another gate in the back, along with a door for knights. the right side of the mountain has a ladder and a removable rock face. the left side has some stairs leading up to the top. i love this tree design. simple yet effective. a shot of the top- hey, what are you doing?!? no!! throw him in the dungeon! overall: this set when first released in 1993 was priced at $43usd, although that might just be because of the juniorised pieces (6 burps!). it's a fun set that provides excellent playability. if you can find it at a $20-$30 price point, pick it up. overall grade: 8/10 edited by kimt, 10 august 2008 - 01:33 pm.

1 this is probably one of my favourite sets and/or one of the sets which i wish i owned..the 90's was probably my favourite castle era! tobad i was to young to buy this set when it came out man i wish i had one of those dragons, they were one of the best type i reckon although all the dragon's are good thanks for the reveiw edited by hollisbrick, 16 april 2008 - 07:41 am.

1 agent rick: you're definately the dragon master around these parts. what a great little set. i really like the classic dragon which reminds me of a similar style used for the lego crocodiles. and the dungeon is pretty slick too. i like the use of the large gates plus the doors. plus the set contains the blue wizard. awesome! great review.

0 great review! i never have been interested in this set. i am saving my money for a grey technic set or thatt technic ferrari set...

0 thanks for the review! i think i am going to get this set for it's many technic pieces. i could really use those for a rig i'm going to build.

0 looks like an interesting set. i didn't realize the motor controlled two functions through a transmission switch. that's always good to see. i'll probably pass it up though until the price falls a bit. the overall design is a bit too studless for my liking (i think the 8275 bulldozer has a much better balance of studded and studless pieces), and the wheels somehow look too small to me. i also have something of a backlog at the moment; i still need to pick up that bulldozer along with the 8421 mobile crane (on ebay).

0 wow, it's a smarty set with drive shafts (we are everybody!) and technical junk. the specs and stuff kind of lose me but the walrus looks really cute in the cherry picker! i imagine he's saving a kitten. but really, this is a great review and has a wealth of detail and knowlege for techni-philes! thanks for providing such a cool resource for eb! i really did enjoy delving in to the world of technic for a few moments. the walrus rides it ... oh, he's so smart.

1 thanks svelte_corps for the great review, if it's out in aussie then it should hopefully be reaching nz soon. i can't wait! this looks like a great set, for me at least. i too am a great fan of spooky old temples, they are such fun. i love the look of the base plate, but the stickers don't look all that great. i wish they printed it like they always used too. i have to get this set. and the other ones too. thanks again, you have brightened this sad day.

1 outstanding review! your efforts have totally convinced me to get this set no matter what! it really looks very great and funz reading that review. i will be looking forward to the new addition of those mini-figs. just love the layout of this temple. a great addition indeed

0 thanks for the reveiw it was a enjoyable and good one! i really like this set!!! too bad it's beyond my price range, i guess i'll just get the smaler set. what suprised me is that there is no giant ants i'm guessing you live in aus.? where did you get this set from???

0 great in-depth review!!! svelte, i love your cat! :) :)

1 i was going to review this on monday but my camera ran out of batteries! anyways, great review! as i have the set built, it's a really fantastic set. the waterfall is a reall cool sticker, and the flick fire missiles are quite interesting. another point of interest: there are seven of the new flick fire missiles overall, if anyone cares.

0 thank you for the nice review. off-topic: i heard something on lowlug that tlc cancelled 2624 (little set with indy, mutt, irina and tent). have anybody heard something about that? that would be not so nice.

1 svelte_corps, on may 1 2008, 02:44 am, said: (e) central turret thing this thing is kind of annoying and doesn't really sit or work well. it's kind of like a laser beam sending messages to space, i guess. as the central dome rises, the two plates peel away. i find it is a little bit tight to work smoothly and the two plates doesn't really sit well together at the top. maybe i just need to rebuild it. i'm sure this will also be explained in the movie. great review! now i'm really truly convinced that i'm gonna buy this set. my faith was a little wobbly, but its benn restored anyway, i just wanted to point out that the temple's entrance might actually be the turret thing. if you watch the teaser, there are some very similair stone pillars surrounded by sand (there are 4 not 2 though ) and when they close up it looks like all our characters are sucked into the sand and magically appear underground going through some stone plates(which act like steps to go down) that dissapear. so, in theory those steps beneath the turret are actualy the entrance, and i'm asumming from this picture that the steps with 1x8 bricks with the dragon heads at the end lead us of somewhere else. all in all this temple looks like a mixed up version of the real temple, which is fine by me (sidenote: i'm not sure but based on minifig inclusion, either lego was cheap or colonel dovchenko is dead by the time irina and her goons reach the temple, i'll wait till i see the movie. ) edited by belloq, 02 may 2008 - 02:14 am.

1 nice review! got this set yesterday and u have to say, that amphibious vehicle rocks!!!

0 great review, thanks! as i thought, amazon did send out my pre-ordered sets not until yesterday evening, so i should receive them (hopefully) on monday or tuesday. can't wait for them! btw., i wonder what's up with all these sticker leftovers in the indy sets..this hasn't been the case in any other set with stickers, right? edited by metalandi, 03 may 2008 - 01:56 pm.

1 thank you for the nice, in-depth review! i have to say, lego did a good job on the amphibious vehicle. p.s.- if you need photo taking help, pm me and i can give you some handy tips.

0 nice review wilhelm screamer! very thorough. the pictures are a little dark and blurry, though. i made a tutorial here for amateur photography tips. i also edited your first post to include a link to alex's review. great job!

0 what a fantastic set. i'm overwelmed with feelings of nostalgia by seeing this review. the playability factor of this set is as high as it can be. thanks for making and sharing this awesome review !

0 metalandi thanks for this wonderful lovely review. i enjoyed myself very much when i am looking through at the lovely pictures. i must admit, this is what i called a "real classic" race prix i miss those cute sweet little race cars which is able to contain a mini-fig. furthermore, this set offers 4 race cars and 13 mini-figures in addition, if town collectors remember, the car number tiles are printed instead of using stickers. this is the other set i owned, which holds the similarity above. 6381: motor speedway overall, great review! simonwillems, on may 9 2008, 02:20 am, said: i recently made an entire racetrack together with this set and to promote myself i will place a link here i saw your entire racetrack. it looks real exciting and i love your layout, real nice! edited by whitefang, 15 may 2008 - 09:56 am.

1 i can remember when i saw this set in lego catalogues, looking at it, dreamin to have it.... like so many other sets... and this one is still a dream... i really like the design of this set, it looks really complete, with some nice details. there are no lost place. the strairs withe the foot bridge add a lot to it imo. looking at the pics, i've got a question : is the "rescue rig" trailer one piece or is it brick build?

0 thanks for that fine review, batbrick. the most interesting part of the set, for me, are the neat mfs.... the trailer looks really pretty skeletal. however.... its a nice little play set andll fit its purpose i guess.

-1 batbrick thanks for the sweet review. you give me great insights into this set. hehe, i agreed that racer x is nice, but i believe we can get it in the other set for a much lower price. for me, the trailer which does not have a cover is bugging me alot. that's why, i holding my reservations against this set. at most, i will consider the other 2 smaller sets for collection purpose. nevertheless, batbrick great job

0 thank you for the nice review

0 i enjoyed the review. some cool fleshie heads and parts, but it does seem a bit lamer even than i imagined from the box (the "airy" truck is rather slyly disguised on the box art). i would like to get it if it is ever on sale, 50% off would be nice :) speed racer lego doesn't seem to be selling too well in local shops here.

0 nice review--i'm surprised these are out already. i'll probably end up passing on this one. even with the surprise. :)

1 good review.i think the sets amazing!

0 that is a very nice and quick review! thanks for giving us a quick summary. not much comments on this set, as i do not really go into batman theme yet. however, the ice cream truck in the set interest me. apart from that, nothing much yet. who knows, maybe i will change my mind in the future.

1 it's on the way! and also the buggy!

1 the tumbler is massive! i'll struggle to fit it into the cave, but never mind. the figs are nice, the tumbler is pretty accurate (or at least, it will be after i've moded it), and joker's tainted ice cream van is so very joker. thanks for the review, btw.

-1 thanks so much dunamis for your awesome review . yeah i think tlc miss the cape, it would be cool to own one but when we were talking of the 2008 sets around july of last year i can remember someone said it would come with cape. finally is a little dissapoint tlc miss it . edited by darkrebellion, 16 may 2008 - 07:20 pm.

1 excellent review, dunamis. this set looks great. the designers really though the kit out, it seems. the internal organs have got to be my favorite part, but everything is good. now all we need is a ucs obi-wan with a laser pistol to finish off grievous in a totally anti-climatic way!

1 cool! i like the idea of using the hood as an organ! dunamis reviews on!

0 an excellent review with superb presentation dunamis . when the time comes i hope your able to get your hands on the other new sw sets and review them just as good.

-1 snice review! (super nice) though i think i'll pass on this one, i really dislike the head. what's with the frame around the neck and the clip under the head? that, and i don't really care for ucs or technic stuff. the base looks nice though!

1 this is a very nice, i never gotten to chance to own or buy one of the sw big sets. i'm definitely getting these one.

0 nice review i hope to get this set for my birthday!

1 the walker reminds me of the old kenner cap-2 captivator which is good.

1 thanks for the sweet review, brickbitz! that really is a neat little set, that walker is fantastic, most likely the best part of the set. though the alien craft does also look neat, and it's cool how it can fold down into aa walker. or rather, a sentry turret, seeing as it can't really move while in that mode. still, it's nice. my favourite part is the mini mining robot though. so cute! ~peace

1 hi y'all! guess what happened today? when walked into my toys 'r' us in fullerton, ca, just to buy a simple tiny turbo racer, what do i see? all the agents sets sitting on the shelf, ready for the taking! i didn't have too much money with me, so i just got 2 of 8631 mission 1: jetpack pursuit! it's a really cool little set, so i thought i'd review this puppy for you! i shall proceed in the order of the instructions. so, let's get started! the minifigs let's begin with the minifigs, saw fist and agent chase! they are really cool, some of the coolest minifigs i have seen in a while! i took off saw fist's wig & chainsaw so you can see his head and cybernetic arm better! here is a back view of saw fist, and - surprise! agent chase has a double sided head! one side with his cool "mission face" with sunglasses and headset, and one with his casual bruce wayne type face (note, though, that it is not really the bruce wayne face). his wig, btw, is mutt's hairpiece in black! very neat! poor saw fist seems to be forced to always drag his chainsaw around for it is way too long to just hang down from his shoulder like a normal arm. the snowmobile next up, we have the snowmobile, a sleek little vehicle with only minor design flaws! the container with the jewel is attached to the vehicle by a single stud, so it doesn't fall off, but is easy to pick up! in the pic below you can see the only two tiny design flaws: thanks to the exhaust pipes, the laser cannon (or whatever it's supposed to be) can't be lowered any further than this. also, the corners of that slope-ish piece that the handle bar rests on are sticking out a little at the sides. other than that, it's pretty well done! the jetpack finally, there is the jetpack! imo, a name like autogyro-pack or something would make more sense, but whatever. although a little bulky, the jetpack is very well designed! the rotor can be tilted back, and at the lower back of the jetpack, there is hook with which you can grab the container with the jewel from the snowmobile. what i like best about the jetpack is that although it is attached to the minifig in kinda the same way as that of the riddler, this one doesn't rotate around. so, the agent is being held in place steadily! "see ya later, chainsaw-cyborg-dude!" stickers this set comes with a surprisingly large sticker sheet. the reason is that half of it are extra stickers! there are two large agents logos and one inferno logo - perfect for agents mocs! there are also a star and a small, round sticker portraying the number of the mission. the star seems to be part of some kind of game where you collect the stars from all sets on an agents id that you get from the mission 5 set. i don't know, though, if you get any gain from this except for becoming a full-status lego agent! below, you can find the list of parts from this set! click here for a better quality pic! that's pretty much it! i hope you liked this review and will run straight to your next toy store to get one or more of this set! this was my very first set review! so any questions, comments, or requests? any more pics you want me to take? would you like me to exchange the chainsaw with something else, or do you want me to try the agent's new hairpiece out on another fig? if so, just tell me! see ya! edited by oky wan kenobi, 25 june 2009 - 08:21 pm.

0 that's a great review for your first one. i think the jet pack if far to bulky it could do with some minimising but thats life. i assume that you cant fit a standard hand in the chainsaw arms are the hole would be to large but would you be so good as to confirm this for me? overall i quite like the jet ski and the ability to lower the arms to much doesnt both me. how much was it just so i can get an idea of the price? finally thanks for posting this review so quickly.

0 thanks for the review. i'm looking forward to some of the new parts and ideas in this line. the figures look great. the actual sets themselves don't really appeal though.

0 huhm .. i like the idea of the agent-id .. but offcourse all they want with that is that you buy all six sets .. but it can be a good idea for children, they wouldn't think of "hey they get all money only because i have a little card with stars" or something. well, not to rant, i think it's good. also, can you make that name yourself? maybe set 5 comes with a extra stickersheed with all letters, that would be nice "agent rupee" a very nice review oky wan kenobi. =rupee

0 thanks, guys! i really tried to make it a good first review! now to answer your questions: the robot arm can fit ef robot claws and anything that a minifig can hold in his hand or that would fit into a 1x1x1 cylinder, so normal minifig hands are too small to fit. tlg is using the robot claw idea for the main villain of the agents line! do you still want me to try it out and take pics? the price was 10.99 usd at the tru i bought it at. i bet it'ss be a dollar less on s@h! and i'm sorry, but i probably won't get any more sets any time soon. i have to save my money for all the other good set that are to come. but if i would get another set, it would just be the one with the helicopter and the all-silver car! if anyone gets this set, can he/she please review it? thanks! any other questions i can answer for you guys? edited by oky wan kenobi, 18 may 2008 - 08:59 am.

0 they are already on the shelfs? that's kinda weird, since there aren't even the instructions online yet

0 great review!thank youvery much! i think this line is much more promising than most orginally thought it would be. i'm onmy way to see ifican find the big rig right now!

1 looks good, and i'll bet that jaw and wire could be used for lots of mocs... is this the only agents set that contains the wire? while i'm here: i got the third mission, would anyone like a review of that? faramir

1 great little set, nice to have a small building instead of all vehicles. plant pieces and dark green crocs always welcome. good parts selection for the price. thanks for the review! can't wait till we can get our hands on these!

1 nice set... im definately gonna pick it up when i see it. i like the design of the base and it comes with lots of usefull an neat pieces.

1 wow, thanks for the great review, sirnadroj! the overall set is what attracted me in the first place, that elevated hut and swampy setting just sucked me right in! it all looks really nice to me, a definite buy. that agents head would make a great indy, for those opposed to fleshies. and that monobrow, i mean, villain guy looks very... er... well, the monobrow is unique, thought i noticed the suit looks a bit skin tight in the crotchal area. don't look at me like that, you saw it too! anyway, the helmet's the best part about the villain, great for warhammer 40,000 orks. ~peace

-1 agentrick57, on may 23 2008, 09:17 am, said: why do all of the reviews that we have for agents sets have the agents getting hurt? is this a new trend? no, it's an old trend. and it's because villains are cooler. actually, it could be long-simmering resentment towards the not-highly-regarded alpha team/ dino attack sets bubbling forth. see dr lucky's hilarious post here for an example of what i mean... i'm sure the new agents will learn to fight back soon

1 i've copied another thing because i don't know how i must do a review. and i can't do long reviews! set ref: 7884 name: the buggy: the escape of mr freeze number of minifigs: 2 number of pieces: 76 price: 13,95 front of the box: back of the box: the comic: very close: what's in the box: without: the set: the set with the box: the time: wow, this is a funny set, but it's a little expensive, and a little to small, but i like some pieces like the fire, and the mr freeze gun. and the best of all, here it comes, no stickers! that's one of the greatest things. but i understand why lego has made this set, some people want batman lego, and they are most of the time expensive, and the mr freeze set is also expensive, but this set not. if you want more pics, you msut ask! for exaple for the minifigs, or the mr freeze and the blaster. ask it, and this is my first review and sorry for the great and blurry pics! the final verdict: 7.5/10 figures: 8/10 playability: 6/10 build: 7/10 pieces: 7.5/10

0 thanks for an interesting review, ???theriddler???. the sets cheap and very useful to get two fantastic mfs, a great mr. freeze and a very cool new batman. but i have to say that these two small vehicles just look plain ugly imho, without any inspiration nor orginality.... sorry, tlc, but you can for sure do better than that, and even with less pieces....

1 nice review, thanks! i really like those little go-kart thingies, they've got a fantastic mario kart look to them

0 thanks for the review... ill probably get one copy of this set. mr. freeze and his cart look neat. i dont like the huge wing on the back of batman's buggy so ill probably mod that out.

-1 like many others, i'll buy this just for mr f, quickly recycle the parts, and pretend this set never existed. the flame detail is indeed terrible. the bat is back - and he's flatulent! this third bat-wave isn't really doing anything for me. i'll get the penguin set as well for pretty much the same reason - although the sub on that is pretty cool - but skip the others. maybe batbrick can make us all nice alt-mocs to improve these sets... thanks for the review though!

1 neat little set. i do like the parts a number of hard to find bits all in one pack, depending on how much it costs in usd i'll have to consider it. and while the buggy designs kinda suck, i'm a little happy to see them, its been years since tlc made any small go kart style vehicles. i guess tiny turbos have been overshadowing that market?

0 thanks for the reveiw the figs are bloody great! but those cars are a bit... well i'll put it blantly, retarded!!! although they shall be good after some modding! and whats with that grapple hook? does it even have a rope, so i guess batman will hokk it to mr freeze so his ride looks more ugle anyway, can you pleese take some pics of the figs

-1 thanks for the review. this set was poorly design, when i first heard of it i think it was like a car with a much better design than this one. i think i will get it for the minifigs.

1 thanks for the extra pics, i don't think you could have gone into much more detail than that! nice pics of the joker van too, will you do a review of that one? batbrick away!

1 in actuality, i think that this may be my favorite batman set of all time. i know, i know - it's a small set with crappy tiny vehicles; so it probably sucks for the fan who likes to display sets; but look at the mocing side and you see this set has a ton of potential: -new batman fig. well, mainly the torso; but it looks nice, sleek, and armored! a definite plus whether you're a mocist or batfan. -mr. freeze. because nobody bought the batcave when they should have...and by nobody i mean me. plus, i love that head! -cheapest way to amass the lightning piece. the other sets that have it are lolhueg (well, not really, but i don't have $50 to toss around on a little skeleton tower...), and it's a great piece. -two little blue gems. i may be alone on this, but those are my favorite parts (the gems), and that's my favorite color for them! <3 <3 <3 -several other useful parts, including a +o piece in black, some light/medium blue bits from mr. freeze's kart, the oddly placed grappling hook, and some cheap wheels. now, i don't know about you guys, but this is as close to a batman battlepack as we're going to get, lol - i'm buying at least three, maybe more once i get my summer job ^.^ (oh, and the fact that the us price is only $10 helps a little, but this year you guys can't complain - you got practically every set first, especially the new castle! t.t) ~trexxen

1 coming in at around $50 us, turbo car chase is one of the bigger of the new agents sets. a big box with a helicopter, car, and gate in it. seems like a winner, but how good is it really, and is it worth the cash? let's start with the minifigs. this set comes with a standard inferno henchman, spy clops, and agent chase. the henchman is you basic lego criminal type with a gun and a jumpsuit, nothing real groundbreaking here. spy clops, on the other hand, is very cool for, technically, half of a minifig. his head has a neat electronic goggle print and the rest of him is a torso mounted onto a set of six legs made from exo-force robot arms. the whole thing is really well done and neat as hell. agent chase (turbo car chase! ) seems to have a standard agent body and a double-printed face with one side a sunglasses and headset print. the other face is a determined agent look. the set also includes a laptop with doctor inferno wallpaper. the laptop is a new piece and works like the lego books that are in a lot of harry potter sets. molding on the keyboard is really well done and the thing can be held by a minifig along either corner, but not in the middle and not while closed. the gate in the set is nothing revolutionary by itself, and i sort of get the feeling that it was included to drive up the piece count and the set price point. that being said, there are some things to like here. for instance, the gate has four wheels of barbed wire attached to it. the barbed wire is new and makes me want to start building some world war i trench mocs. the rest of the gate is fairly big and it has a handy ramp attached so that vehicles can roll through it easily. the main feature of the gate is a sound brick. it's much better then lego sound and light units of the past, when the gate is opened it depresses a button and an alert klaxon blares that sounds every bit like a prison-beak in progress. the triggering action works surprisingly well and it's pretty much for this feature alone that i'm not going to immediately break the gate back down and add it to my parts bin. the designers did make an effort to create more then just a fence though. a nice control panel connected to a big spotlight crowns the piece, and a pair of cameras watch the opening. it's really hard to mess up a lego helicopter, and this set is no exception. the inferno chopper is a nicely proportioned and well built machine. it looks properly menacing and has the uniform orange and black of other inferno property. it's armed with a set of four technic pegs cleverly used as guns on outriding mounts, as well as a pair of the newer-style flick-fire missiles. i personally don't care for flick-firing missiles, but these look decent enough and seem to stay put so i really can't complain about them. along the fuselage are a pair of intake pieces that i've never seen before and i'm guessing are new. they're pretty well designed and will come in handy for mocing down the road. the action feature of the aircraft is the wench system. this is very different then other lego wenches in that you build the entire mechanism and housing. you can then use it to raise spy clops up and down from the bottom of the chopper using the rotor. now, this also keeps you from sitting there and just giving the rotor repeated spins to simulate flight. i'm not too thrilled with that, but there are a hundred other lego helicopters out there with fully rotating rotors, so i guess i can let it by just this once. as you'd suspect, the bottom of the cockpit is completely open, which makes this a vehicle pretty much solely for spy clops (sorry henchman). but there is plenty of room beneath the body to attach a plate with some seats on it to accommodate another pilot without drastically altering the design, or even removing existing pieces. the turbo car is a slick little honey of a lego car, and the silver pieces that make up the body work contribute a lot to that fact. the front license plate appears to be an exo-fore code brick. but it also hides the activation lever for the passenger ejector seat. the seat works about as well as the spruce goose, which is to say not well at all, but here it's the thought that counts. the interior of the car is really well done. there's even a radar screen for keeping track of pesky helicopters. but the bond-like features don't end there. a lever in the compartment raises pair of guns in the hood and a knob on the rear deploys a quad rocket system with more flick-fire missiles. this is a car that won't be stopped easily! the rear has two cones sticking out. i'd like to think they're smoke nozzles or oil-slick sprayers. all-in-all, this is a really good set. the car is pure lego vehicle love and looks fantastic. the silver pieces are very nice and it's a shame lego doesn't use metallic colors in system sets more often. there are, however, a lot of sticker for this set and i know how much that bugs a lot of people. i personally like how much detail the stickers add to these sets and don't mind them so much. the set also comes with an agents id card for chase which you can put little star stickers on from other sets as you get them. it's printed on a real nice piece of sturdy plastiboard and would be cooler if you could put your own picture and name on it instead of pretending to be chase. sold by themselves, the car and chopper would be must-haves. all tossed together with the gate sort of makes the set a little less then the sum of it's parts. and with 498 parts (most of them small) that's not so hot. it's only slightly over-priced in my opinion, but if you do shell out the money you won't regret it. i'm very comfortable recommending this set to anyone. close to perfect, but the price and some minor flaws bring it back just a little. i'd say 4.33, but out of 5 is close enough!

1 chrome..... can't wait for the review, deino!

1 can't wait for the review the car is ly!!!

1 thanks for the awesome review, deinonychus! this really is a sweet set, a bit expensive a set for me, as i only get the cheaper non-castle sets, which is a shame because i love that head! it would be great for some more cyborg troops. the car is awesome, i didn't expect it to have that many silver parts, that's fantastic! heaps of play features too, that ejector seat mechanism sounds interesting. thanks again for the sweet review! ~peace

0 deinonychus, on may 23 2008, 09:12 pm, said: the rear has two cones sticking out. i'd like to think they're smoke nozzles or oil-slick sprayers. according to page 14 of my brickmaster magazine, the left cone is for smoke screen and the right cone is for oil slick.

1 thanks deinonychus for another great review. i must say i do look forward to people uploading reviews of new sets, it really helps me decide if i want it or not. if it's a good set (imo) then it adds to the excitement of picking up one myself! this, i must say, is one of those sets! the only concern for me, like alot of others, is the price. i will just have to wait and see and continue to look at these photo's deinonychus has provided for us!! so much for thinking the agent line was going to be weak! i wonder if the exoforce style code brick number plate is a hint from tlc as to what will replace exoforce at the end of this year? jb

1 thanks for your great review! it looks very nice indeed! the gate have very interesting mechanism. the car looks very slick and cool. it looks like those typical kind of james bond car. this review gives me very good insights.

1 great review deinonychus i really like it! can someone record the sound os the sound brick(maybe on youtube?) i really want to hear it. this sets are really cool deino can you post a picture of the agent card it comes with?

1 thanks for the review!!! it wasn't "really" a request but more of an imply to do it anyway great review! can't wait til these come to aus. probably when the rest of the castle comes out in september though

1 thanks for the review i wanted to see what was in this set looks good! is it sold in stores? edited by mammymarf, 25 may 2008 - 03:38 pm.

0 whitefang, although i realize that the battle packs are great specifically for building armies, and castle accessories (which is why its such a shame that i won't be able to buy these things ), while sdpirate's sets are more for a catapult, calvary whatever. the fact to the matter is with the battle pack you get: 5 minifigs with lots of accessories. while with the sets that sdpirate showed us you get: 5 minifigs with an okay amount of accessories 3 horses (including two skeleton ones) a ballista a weapons rack, and a jousting barricade. you cannot say that the battle pack contains the same amount of stuff that the other two sets have and therefore should be priced the same. it just seems that lego is ripping off canadian army builders, to me if the battle pack contained a small catapult, or wall so that it contained about the same amount of stuff that the other sets had it would be fair. it seems stupid that you will only get minifigs from one set, while you can get about the same amount of minifigs plus a bunch of other stuff from two other equally priced sets. thats why to me these battle packs are a rip off, because of what they contain, imho the battle packs seem to be only worth about 10 dollars.

0 thanks for sharing these close-up images of this battlepack whitefang. i actually had this set in my hand at legoland cal. and could not decide if i wanted it. i'm currently out of "castle-mode" with my large indy jungle set up on the table, and creating ghost train mocs that are starting to line up on the bookshelves. once i buy the troll ship, i'll want to start collecting these great fig sets. thanks again for sharing.

0 thanks for the nice review whitefang! i got the knights bp just for the scared face.

0 sorry to be going a little off topic here but personally i have just bought 40 crowny battle packs for the only reason that i am running out of space to store the left over blocks. about 500 of my crownies came from sets (mentioned above) on sale which would have been cheaper than the battle packs. thanks for the review whitefang but i dont think i will be buy any skeleton battle packs, that army is large enough.

0 for those of you who buy so many of this and the other battle pack with crownies, what do you do with all of them? is this simply to create a large-scale army, or do you plan to build large castle scenes with all the figs. i'd love to see some pictures (on the "share your castle army" thread).

1 great review! i just barly missed the jungle series, growing up with half a year of jungle and mainly orient expedition and dino island. i like egypt more, but this set (despite the 4x4 palm tree) is practically perfect. i love the detail and vibrant colours. gotta say, i've got a thing for pippin reed myself. by the way, what does "vhtf" mean? edited by sdpirate, 28 may 2008 - 01:06 am.

1 vhtf= very hard to find. to answer some earlier replies... no, there are no stickers in this set. while some adventurers sets of the era had stickers (the 5956 zeppelin had tons), all of the interesting mesoamerican designs from this set are printed. also, simonwillems was correct; my mechanic is missing his hat, which should be a black kepi. they're extremely expensive on bl, though (proving once again that this set has some awesome parts), so i ordered a replacement from lego. it's in the mail and should come soon.

1 i absolutly love this set. this is in my opinion the best adventurers set. it has it all; the falling bridge, the falling skeleton, the spear trap, and the classic trapdoor. it is a must-have set. thanks for providing such a nice review.

1 thanks for the awesome review voltio. el conde is the man!

1 i had one of these! it was awesome, it went well with the zeppelin. i can't remember if the box was one of those fold up the lid ones though. can't tell from the picture. anyone want to jog my memory, i always thought the sets with the flap lids were the best, i kept those! edited by giantdinosaur, 26 september 2011 - 08:38 pm.

0 the images are obsolete, please fix it.

1 welcome to cardinal brick's review of 7736 it's a small set but as i bought it the other day i felt that it probably did merit a short review. the box is ofcourse far larger than necessary! there's plenty of air inside. the contence is one bag and the instruction booklet, you could proably build it inside the bag if the desire took you. we have one new coastguard with the slightly stubly head found in the castle range and a trans-clear visor. the build was challanging and arduious the final product is quite nice at one ?3.00 it's a good set only 50p more than an impulse set and with enough extra parts to justify the increase in the price. a good set for a little gift or so on, the buggy moves well. there's not that much to say really for i can't really think of additional models to build with the parts but then what do you expect for the price. edited by cardinal brick, 26 may 2008 - 06:47 pm.

1 thank you very much for the review, cardinal brick! that's indeed a very nice little set! klaus-dieter

0 i might buy a second one of that set, and build it in the bag. i just wanna prove that it is possible.

1 wow. i was skeptical of this coast guard line. though getting to see some detailed pictures of this set i really want to get get it. alas, i have not the money to get it and it isn't available in my town. oh well. maybe i can catch it on a sale at some point. good review!

0 thank you very much for the nice review, 5150 lego! the helicopter is - apart from that it is very, very big and that it does not include any interior - a very nice set . the most i like the life raft becuase it is simply . nevertheless i don't know if i buy it (probably not) - but it's very nice! two questions : -where can you fasten the stretcher on to haul it up and down? -is the motor working with batteries? klaus-dieter edited by klaus-dieter, 28 may 2008 - 09:19 pm.

1 great review! i will get this, but i will wait for a sale. edited by ~vbbn~, 28 may 2008 - 10:54 pm.

1 thank you for that fine review of a really excellent set, 5150 lego. i never saw a little 'juniorization' done that good before!

1 nice review! the helicopter reminds a sikorsky chopper,isn't it?

1 this is a very good review, thank you! but i have some questions about the grey new parts in the life raft. are they 1x1 like their counterparts with the clips or 1x2? and can they be held by a minifig by the handle? if so, these could be very useful for brick-build weapons & tools! also, i'm looking forward to some orange eta 2 jedi interceptor mocs now! who wants to be the first to make one? btw, which jedi has an orange eta 2?

1 i will certainly add this one to my collection, i already own every other rescue helicopter and i have a feeling this will be the best. just love how its completely enclosed, thanks for the review.

0 thanks for the review riddler. your pics are a bit blurry though, if you want them a bit better you should sit your camera on a hard surface so you don't wobble it as much i love the tumbler, though it is quite massive, but either way i'll be glad to get it. the figs in my opinion are really bad, joker should atleast have a different suit. oh well, it's worth it for that awesome van, and instance where the stickers are totally worth it. thanks again! batbrick away!

-1 ???theriddler???, on may 29 2008, 02:54 pm, said: who want's the second riddle? bring it on, oh mysterious puzzler.... perhaps it could help a little if you would resize the pics for your next one, with all that automatic resizing going on it needs quite some time for the site to load.... in this context, to see two pics of your clock was perhaps a little odd too....

1 great looking set, loved the review, pictures were good... sometimes blury but i think i will pick this up after i get the rest of the kotcs sets. riddler a tip i learned in photoclass is to take a breath in and hold it while pushing the shutter so you don't accidentally move while breathing. i thought it was silly, but it does work. again great review! looking forward to more...

0 uncle joker's cheap technic missile surprise great review, however, there isn't much appeal to the set after you see what the "surprise" is, though i can modify the truck to have an evil gas-ice cream making interior

1 nice review m8. shame that most of the pictures are blurry but nonetheless. just wanted to say that out of all my lego sets, this one, 7888 is the best. the tumbler is so cool once it is put together! those four huge wheels at the back make it quite unique! if you do not have this set i highly recomend it. edited by 4olic, 30 august 2009 - 02:59 pm.

1 great review of a great set. i always figured the hoses were welding torches (attached to jetpacks, yeah!) as the whole thing had the vibe of a mobile repair center. much like many of my favorite sets, this one has a base of simple bricks and plates and then from that solid foundation the rest is built out to be decorative or have the action features. this gives sets a very solid feel as demonstrated in this set, the first snowspeeder, and galaxy explorer. the mm armored drilling unit has a more technic base giving it a less solid appearance and though i like the set, that jet that luanches from the back is horrible, partially because of the useless orange containment things. the mega core has a nifty crane instead of a big useless jet. -tohst

1 thanks for those wonderful pictures and congrats! i think buying this on ebay was a good decision! i have no m:tron sets at all, but i like the mcm very much. it's just a wonderfully big set with many nice detials. lots of playing possibilities! i wish i had it too.

0 sinner, on may 28 2008, 11:35 pm, said: care to explain why? personally i think that aside from the colour scheme the new one is far better. why? suspension, more enclosed cockpits, bug-like appearence.... i suppose it's a matter of personal opinion though. i just thought that the mt-101 was very skeletal and couldn't really steer that well, although i do like it. also the mcm has a better design, in my view, as the wheels are closer together, making it look a lot more tankish than the mt-101. also space in the rear isn't wasted on having a shuttle. cp5670, on may 29 2008, 02:52 am, said: as for the hose/jetpack things, i always assumed that they were either welding torches or flamethrowers. take your pick. hmm.... well they don't have much else to defend themselves with, and i think in the uk the mcm was marketed as a mobile recovery center. fluyt, on may 29 2008, 03:56 am, said: anyways, m:tron is one of the greatest space factions, with mega core magnetiser as my favourite set of these guys (even though i do not own it ). the only thing that bothers me is the lack of (reachable) controls for the minifigs to drive their vehicles (but iirc it is the same with a lot of other space-sets as well) yeah they could have used the normal levers instead of the pronged two piece things at the front of the cockpit. but there is certainly a lot to mod. joebot, on may 29 2008, 04:25 am, said: but the old m:tron round magnet pieces are presumably discontinued. shoot... guess that bl and ebay are the only sources now... thanks for your input!

0 thanks for the review, maybe i can pick one off ebay.

0 zero1312, on may 29 2008, 08:22 am, said: thanks for the review, maybe i can pick one off ebay. yeah, i got this for only like 19 pounds, pretty cheap. it's a great set! cp5670, on may 29 2008, 08:55 am, said: it looks like you're right about the old magnets. i got a few off pab two months ago but they no longer have them. i guess i should grab some while they're still widely available on bricklink, as they can be useful in a number of situations. on a side note, one interesting thing about this set is that it seemingly had two us/canada names, mega core magnetizer and multi core magnetizer. brickset, lugnet and all the other sites i've seen call it mega, but i have some north american catalogs from that time period that call it multi and the box also says multi on it. i actually didn't know the mega name at all until many years after the m:tron line. hmm... i've never seen it listed as multi, but now i guess it has three names, strange that m:tron is basically the only space theme that had different names depending on region... clonecommando007, on may 29 2008, 10:11 am, said: this does look alot better than the new mm drilling tank. great work! yeah, i should take a comparison, yet the boxart on the mt-101 was pretty cool. sinner, on may 29 2008, 12:29 pm, said: thanks for an answer. i'll shut up now so we can focus on your review... it's okay, i have a question kind of not related to the review.. is there still a space review/moc index now that docking bay has closed? thanks again!

0 asuka, on may 30 2008, 02:17 am, said: of course i dont want to offend some technic lovers, and although i always was more the system kind of guy, why cant they just use some technic beams with studs at least? that's because of cost. the older beams needed a four sided mold, and the newer ones need only a two. lego do seem to be using both types more as of late though. asuka, on may 30 2008, 02:17 am, said: i grew up with 'just imagine', with pictures of alternative models on the box, and i dont think its that easy, especially for younger kids, to mod some of these terrific blown-up sets like it once was with sets like this one here.... implosion off! i've never heard an official word (...perhaps i should raise a topic...) but i think that they don't show them any more because it became a support nightmare. what do i mean? i bet tlg was tired of letters and calls saying "timmy can't make this model shown on the box. can you send instructions and the extra parts..." i know that for some recent models they were designed but not published. how do i know this? the creator said so!

1 this super set contains many of the city sets you can get for your mini city hospital. the smallest set is the 7902 car with a doctor. i thought it looked a bit too slow. here is a car you can build with the same bricks. the instruction manual for the ambulance does contain a picture of an alternate model, but it is actually quite hard to build something significantly different. this sets lacks some snot-bricks, so i had to be a little more creative and came up with this ambulance. it is more a hearse than an ambulance. the helicopter has a lot of slopes, so i built a speed boat for those special emergencies. unlike the first two sets, i used far from all the bricks in this. this set does really have some great parts. the brickshelf gallery with some more pictures. is anyone up to the challenge and build some alternate models of the last set in the super pack - the hospital?

0 what a showman!, guess you have to get in before someone else does the review! looking forward to the review....

0 darn i was going to review this set. i gues my review will be second.

0 monday my review, i hope you like that one also! but i can't wait for your review. who want's the second riddle?

-1 quote looking forward to the review, this looks to be the best of the new batsets. *gasp* are you kidding me? honestly, i hate this set. the batbike looks far too blocky, and that hammer truck looks super shoddy and thrown together. the only real reason i'd get it at all would be for the harely quinn figure - but i'd probably just get her separately on bricklink. besides, the tumbler and robin's jetski sets look far better to me. they actually seem to have great vehicle designs. no new villian figures, i know, but still some great old ones. er, wait a minute... oh yeah, hope your review gives the real scoop on this kit, deino.

0 thanks all, i hope my hq wil arive today, and deinonychus i don't wanna do stupid to you but must i do also a review of the hq set, i want to do that also a review of hq without the blurry pics. who want's the second riddle?

1 harley, the fig, is amazing. love that hat. batcycle, meh...ok. truck: flick fire missiles!!?!?? lego have you no sanity! sure they're great but you're putting them on every single action set!! hammer thingy; win. nice truck! great review!

1 this set looks really fun! the figs are sweet, can't wait to see that jester in the flesh. of course, the jester i'm talking about is the castle one but that doesn't mean harley isn't a sweet fig! thanks for that awesome review, deinonychus! ~peace

1 thanks for the review deinonychus! this is an awesome set, it may just be my first batman set

-1 great review! though you really seem to like this set, and it probably is a great one, i'm not a fan of the penguin sub, or at least i'm not from what i see.

1 man, tohse mini vehicles and minifigs are sexy as all heck! i love dr.inferno and the female pattern for agent trace (is it just me or she almost "busting out"? ). i love the dr. inferno hair, and the reappearance of spy-clops and gold tooth is simply gold (yes yes, pun intended!) i have to say this is shaping up to be one of my favourite sets, well, ever! batbrick away!

0 can't wait for the kick @$$ trailer review :d

1 me want this set

1 that's an awesome review. and a great set, it seems. with all of this year's star wars (i still haven't got rogue shadow) i can't afford agents too, which is a shame looking at this.

1 svelte_corps, a fanastic review of this biggest agents' set. at first, i was not very keen to have this set. however, after reading your review, you have make me swing up and down. its simply fabulous! thanks for your hard work. i am sure it's not easy to do this review. i love that female mini-fig. she looks awfully sweet especially with her new hair. great job!

1 omg! thank you, thank you, thank you! you made my day! so that means dr. inferno's hair isnt rubber! but one question, is it like that weird funny soft plastic like the ants from indy 4? please answer

1 wow this set looks so amazing! amazing! genius! da'vinci art i say! you've done an excellent job reviewing, and really, this is the review i've been waiting for. so cool! so classy! i love the mission briefing feature. to think that lego could go so high as to put something ingenious like that in there! too bad lego figures don't have fingers to make shadow shows, eh? genius! the jet lauching feature is pretty slick, and they even put a control center in there too! that's beast. loving that. the bottom...i don't see how that big buggy can get out or in there, but, awesome too! the back of the truck could use more detailing i think, but the jail pop-open feature is pretty cool, as is the speed boat storage rack. cabin; it's great! that roof opening feature is a great part of this set. also i think you can have multiple figures up there...maybe you can mod it to put a bed in there! it certainly looks big enough! inferno plane, wow that think is smooth, baby! i love how the wings contain rotors inside of them!!! that's awesome detail right there. that is a sweet ship thingy, so slick. the rest of the command center is pretty awesome too; we get a 4x4 wheeler and a crane, and lots of room! wow! just wow! great review, great set! you are well worthy of your custom title! i'm gonna go buy this for only $90!!!! woot!

1 wonderful review - one of the best i've ever seen on this site. man, we thought this might be the weakest set in the line, but it turns out it may be the strongest! everything about this set - from the color scheme to all the details to the minifigures to the piece selection - is just wonderful! i think this set has finally confirmed it: agents is everything alpha team wasn't, and is how they should have done a spy theme from the start. kudos to tlc for finally getting it right - and i sure hope there's a second year!

1 excellent review by an excellent reviewer on and excellent set. this theme really does seem to be one of tlc's best. edited by plural, 31 may 2008 - 03:24 pm.

1 7645 - mt-61 crystal reaper piece count: 600 price: $aud79.95, 49.95 euros (in most countries), 39.99 gbp, usd 49.99 it's happened in the wider world, and it had to happen to lego - yes, the 80s are back. space invaders, holograms, compulsory seat-belt wearing legislation, and the return of classic space. ok, we don't have a fully fledged classic space theme back yet, but if 7645 is the way of the future, i think lego is ready to do it properly. i wasn't a huge fan of last year's mars mission sets and only picked up a few on clearance, but this set is light years (excuse the pun) ahead of 2007's offerings. this mining vehicle is solid, compact, and well-designed. it looks impressive, and even better, it has fantastic power functions operability! behold 7645 - mt-61 crystal reaper! (ps i wasn't joking about the holograms or seat belts.) part 1: box, instructions, dsss (dreaded sticker sheets), parts front of box: back of box: 2 x instruction booklets: dss numero uno - for the reaper dss number two - apologies for the blurry pic but i wanted to capture the sweet shimmy of the metallic holographic background on this sheet the way it catches the light really makes a difference to the small alien craft and makes it look much more interesting from the plain stickers of last year. there's heaps of spare silvery stuff once the stickers are applied for those who use the leftover sticker material for customising. parts bags - 4 numbered with one extra with larger pieces parts everywhere - woo! i know the lego instruction books scold me if i mix bags, but i'm a devil-may-care kind of guy. in your face, tlc. i love mixing all the parts together before i build, it reminds me of my youth when the days were long, anything was possible, and i didn't need strict instructions not to build on grass or poke my eye out with a technic shooter. interesting parts - these may or may not be new, my technic knowledge is not that detailed. the little scoop parts are so cute and have a heap of potential uses. i love 'em. they're like smurf hats at miniland scale. these technic wheel things in orange are also cute. they kind of remind me of marigolds. giant fabuland marigolds! the track pieces - you get 70 of these - here's the section of track for one side - as you can see it's about 52 studs long. these hold together better than the small ones on the hailfire droid/ jungle cutter. part 2: minifigs, small mining transport, alien ship i have to confess - i forgot to take an individual snap of the astronauts . it's the usual bunch though - scaredy face guy, sunglasses in space man and a third one i can't remember. you don't really care, though? you're only interested in the alien commander and his matching arms/ legs combo deal. as brickbitz noted in his review of the smaller set, the glowy eye is just a 1x1 cylinder. the set also comes with 2 normal jellies - one pictured here for size. you'll see what happened to the other one soon enough... the alien craft is nothing exciting, apart from the gorgeous glinting stickers. here's the road safety angle. the commander actually clips onto a 1x2 plate with handle so he can't fall out! then the lime tentacle thing descends on top of him to keep him firmly there, like a baby seat. not very brave for an alien commander, is he? i mean, did darth vader ever use a seatbelt? tssk. with cradle up: this part of the build also includes the small astronaut mining buggy - small and effective. (please note in this build i've applied stickers to everything bar cockpit pieces.) this comes with radio and saw piece. part 3: the reaper! the first part of the build is the detachable shuttle. i really like the retro aesthetic of this with the angled wings and the side hoverpod things. it is much better than the comparable vehicle from 7699. the new flickfire piece is a waste of space - it's fairly limp. i prefer the simple flickfire technic pin to be honest. there's also a very nice little side workshop as you can see. i really like how the control unit is 'plugged' into the wall via 5 1x1 round plates (third pic, it's a bit dark). great detail. [the technic pins on the back are there to connect the power functions battery box. it's odd they're included at this stage of the instructions - maybe the intention was to release it originally with all the necessary motors etc but the price point was too high and they scaled it back] the base. the shuttle sits on that bley technic axle in the middle when the reaper is fully assembled. the little vehicle scoots down the ramp at the rear, which folds up to hold it in place when the reaper is in motion. you can see there's a crystal container here as well - another nice small detail which i found the 2007 sets lacked. there's also an alien here - thankfully not in those horrendous trans-orange tubes so prevalent last year. the complete assembly. isn't it snug? it's just the right size too - not massive but large enough to be a serious mining vehicle. the ominous black treads contrast nicely with the white/ orange colour scheme of the vehicle itself. the trans detailing - blue for weapons, neon green for energy - is carried nicely through the whole set. the blades and the scoops whirl nicely as the machine trundles along. top down view: tread detail: whirling blades of death! the buggy descends: probably the most disturbing aspect of the whole set is this pic: the jelly has an orange pump plugged into its heart which is connected to an energy supply on the left hand side! this vehicle runs on alien jelly juice! either that or it's milking the jelly in some equally disturbing fashion. how amoral is that! i know there's been debate about this - the jellys aren't innocent, they're evil energy crystal thieving maniacs etc - but i find it a bit odd that the humans respond by chaining the jelly up to the bowels of their mining vehcile and suck energy from its heart. people debate about violence in lego as represented by realistic minifig weapons, but i think the moral lesson here is even worse - it's ok to exploit foreign life forms for our own gain if they treat us badly first! (who-fans, i think the ood should have a word with the jelly commander ) that aside, this set is well-designed and fairly good value at $aud79.95. it's definitely a notch above last year's mars mission sets overall, with improved detailing and more useful functions. the holo-stickers are fab and it's nice to have an alien commander, even if he is a bit bulky and his fingers are identical to his toes. however, if all these reasons by themselves weren't reason to recomend this set, the following is.... part 4: power functions the best part of this set - and the reason i bought it, really - is the integration of power functions. bizarrely this isn't mentioned at all on the box and i only found out about it from the instructions when they were posted on eurobricks! (instructions for book 2 which has the power function stuff available here.) this is a great idea and hopefully we will see more new sets take this kind of approach (especially with the new train sets). luckily i got monster dino 4958 on sale for half price earlier this year so already had most of the necessary motors etc - the only one needed was an extra small one. what you need is listed in the instructions below with redirections to shop @ home to buy the motors. note there's actually a mistake on this page. the 2 small motors you need are both 8883 not 8882 (which is the large xl motor). way to confuse the kids there, lego! attaching them was a dream and only took a few minutes (in contrast to 4958 where it was almost impossible to remove motor elements without dismantling the model). basically the back platform and some plates and orange slopes come off, you attach the motors, and then the smaller plates go back on. these parts are now left loose: overall the look of the reaper isn't badly effected as you're mainly viewing from the front anyway: sadly i can't show you how it moves, you'll just have to trust me that it does ! the way it is steered is demonsrated in the instruction pages above. basically each motor is controlled by a corresponding switch on the remote. move them both forward to move forward, move one right to turn right, move both back to move back etc. it zips along! it's a speedy little thing! personally i wouldn't want to be in it's path as it comes roaring down the martian canyon! (my cat was scared as it was.) it is oodles of fun and definitely worth trying if you have the motors or can get them cheaply, and adds a whole new dimension to the 'play' aspect of 'playset'. it is also as i said very quick to switch between modded and non-modded reaper in contrast to the more fiddly dino creations. the only problem i had is that if it moves too fast, the weight of the battery box at the back tends to pull the whole thing back and it rears up. it does correct itself though. i only trialled this on carpet last night so it may behave differently on other surfaces - i will need to experiment! part 5: summation this is a great set made even better with the addition of power functions. at $aud79.95 it's well-priced. buy it! buy the motors as well (k-mart still has stock of 4958 at $89, wait for a 15% off sale)! you won't regret it. buy 2 and make competing battle machines! the only thing is... just don't torture that poor jelly edited by sinner, 24 june 2008 - 03:25 am.

1 im not that into mars mission... but this set reminds me of the jungle cutter

1 another great review. i'm looking forward to getting this set sometime soon. i wasn't aware of the power function aspect, similar i suppose to the old technic sets which had an additional instructions for those with the relevant motors. i knew those dino's i got at clearance would come in useful. nice to see the recent "bulldozer" treads appearing in black. grey seemed a slightly unusual colour choice.

1 these new sets are just totally off-the-wall radical :d. it's the little details like the scoops on the blades and the alternate alien energy source (lego didn't even have to include those, but they did!) that show lego are really getting back into their groove this year. the ability to add power functions is just so cool as well, i'm going to pick-up the creator monster dino set for the electronics when the sales hit as svelte has suggested. a very entertaining review, just like the agents mobile command center one :d

-1 this set looks 10 times sweeter with the power functions, too bad i'll have to buy some extra.

1 isn't it a lovely set? i too have one. (modded, of course )

0 so, is there some way to get all those motor bits at once, or do you have to buy them on their own? i don't think i've ever seen them in a store here...

0 this should be reported to the news .

1 well i guess its nice that they're making the story background a little more clear. with that jelly plugged into the power cable... hmmh, both jellies and crystals can be used as power sources, think theres a connection? both of them are transparent and greenish... maybe jellies hatch from crystals like eggs? or need them as food? or something important like that? yay for evil humans.

0 algernon, on jun 5 2008, 02:03 pm, said: why is it that agents and star wars get their own news articles but this fantastic set is totally ignored? i think maybe there's a bit of star wars excitement on the front page which has probably got a few members frothing with excitement. not every review needs to be frontpaged anyway .

1 thanks for the review, mr. mandalorian! this is an, er, interesting set. lots of frontal fire-power. very big too, and i like the idea of those two little craft that attach on the sides. sort of like little escape pod things. anywho, not one of the things on my to buy list, but i do like that radio-active sticker, that could come in use. looking forward to seeing your modifications, too! ~peace

0 thanks for the review. i have to concede this does appear to be the weakest set of the summer mm lineup. i've noticed a trend that the larger sets have plenty of parts potential but when assembled the model is not more than the sum of the parts... eagle base certainly didn't seem worth the asking price, at least this is one large model. on a positive note the lame aero tubes, darts and martian carrier pods have disappeared. don't get me wrong, i love mm and most of the lineup is great, this one just seems to fall a little short of the bar.

1 thank you for that nice review, mr. mandalorian. wow. somehow its almost like classic spaces back indeed.... its a great star ship. it looks stream lined, original and impressive and even the huge plane wing part looks rather cool and smooth on it. its equipped at least with some kind of engines on top of the wings and although theyre made with only two a little 'juniorized' parts its better than nothing. theres a lab or some sort of engine room with enough space inside to allow one or two mfs to play scotty.... yeah! the two cockpitsre nicely detailed with a cool use of these orange 1x1 round plates and to detach one or all two of them reminds a lot of the playability of the good old space sets. it seems even like its easy to attach them to some kind of cloud city twin-pod car thanks these hinged wings. looks like some solid fun to me. of course.... the cockpits arent airtight and even this reminds unfortunately of the post blue, grey and trans yellow era of cs. anyway, theres no real fun without some moding i guess. another great advantage of the sets that its not overpacked with shooting things. one technic shooter, cool in grey and only one trans orange prison pod too. well, i can surely live with that especially since its nicely asymmetrical. the drill rovers very charming, a little like a rebuilt oldsmobile convertibe stranded on mars. sweet! and that platform features plain nifty and well done too, very playable and useable for a lot of things. hmm.... recently i complained a lot about the dense use of studless technic beams for the inner structure of vehicles like these exoforce tanks par exemple which makes moding (in an economical way) pretty frustrating.... but the beams herere used in a very proper way. it should be fairly easy to mod, lets say, the back of that lab section up to perhaps even the cockpits to create a larger airtight area that could be boarded from the platform.... just to fit this certain spacers need for, um, realism.... therere many more nice details too like that 'satelite t.v.' thingy and that cylinder with trans blue 2x2 dish for the knob or these cylinders with cones on that handle, and that alien crafts pretty nice and detailed as well. like i said before.... i really feel like classic spaces back.

1 i think this thing is compensating the poor lab with the bar army.

1 sorry mr. mandalorian, i guess i was just getting a bit defensive because when this set first appeared here, there were literally 2 pages of people just bagging out the new mm sets (but then the thread took a turn and people started to warm to them, much like the agents). i do agree that it definitely needs some mocing, but with that work i think it has the potential to be a really amazing set in terms of what you could cram into it. the lab is a little disappointing, i've always wanted an enclosed cabin space in a vehicle this size because then all the little space guys can have a true meeting place! the drop-down landing ramp is my favourite part, it has lots of potential uses. maybe it's even possible to integrate pneumatics :d

0 hello shefols and afols, as well as tfols, welcome to eb news reviews, i am your host...for tonight anyway... shadows will take over after this episode, if we make more... today we are reviewing mars impulse sets 5616 and 5617. starting with 5617 alien jet, i must say it is a small and quick build, the jellie, is made of hard plastic, which surprised me, as i had expected jellies to be a soft plastic. the jet is mainly 2x4 plates, some swingy hinges, the "seatbelt" and a thing which i cannot seem to name my one gripe about it is that the jelly cant see where he is flying, it looks better with a mf in it. there was a red 1x1 as a spare part. we move on to the 5616 mini robot, which is basically a "safe" brick, with binoculars, soem cheese slopes, little arms, and legs. the best part i must say was the metal detector and "safe" brick, as these seem to be quite rare in sets (by my knowlage anyway). the austronaut has a face, shown in dr. sinsters review. the set also comes with a pick-axe and lime green gem. extra peices where a cheese slope, a green 1x1 and a white droid arm. that concludes these mini-reviews. i also will use this opportunity to show my photo setup. both sets are reccomended, if you either need a army, or are just trying to get a variaty of figs like myself. next wee-*camera fades* edited by sinner, 24 june 2008 - 04:17 am.

1 ohhh great idea to review the "old" potter sets! especially the line from prisoner of azkaban... i was in my dark ages then. luckily i was able to catch up on the missed figs with one internet order. this draco is the best tlc has made, if you ask me. the new one (also doubling for belloq and "guards" in the indy line) doesn't look quite as hautain as this one. buckbeak looks cool. looks like his neck/head can be moved, right? rather similar to lego horses. well designed. the orange brick doesn't have a pumpkin face on it, right? unlike the one from philosopher's stone in the set with the troll. i'm looking forward to more reviews by you, sir whitefang! good work

1 i bought about 5 or 6 of these sets when they were on sale in mid- 2006. i still have a few of them laying around unopened. i think i payed like under $5 for each and thats a great deal for all the variety of neat parts you get with this set.

0 nice review. i like the treemaking pieces the most of this not very expensive set. the buckbeak fig is very nice and can bow his head like the horses. i was annoyed to get another draco without some other not made figs (pansy parkinson for example). about the dark bley feathers; in the second version of hogwarts there were several of these feathers put in little 1x1 cones like it was a feather to write with it. i bought 2 sets of these and when they were for sale i just bought +/- 6 more of it. only annoying that i had then even a bigger army of draco's.

1 hello eb! yes, i'm cranking out the reviews! the other day i picked up this gem for an okay sales price at devonport, tas, while searching for the new batsets. i informed iamded of this as he is a spidey-suckup ( ) and he informed me this was the only set he didn't have of the wave 2 of this theme. so i ask you great eb members to please remind him of this when commenting! here we go with the review of doctopus' lair: anyway, unlike other reviews, this stars more people, the batbrick-iamded-dragonator-daisy review! (daisy is the mouse that came in the set) first up re the figs, and i must say they are great. i love fleshies and these are excellent to expand my batman world, plus having a spiderman to beat up is good too doctopus is great, though his tentacles are annoying to keep in order. peter parker is a nice addition, i love that torso. eve though harry osborn was totally absent from this scene, i welcome him as he is a good fig also. best of all is mary jane, fleshie females are hard to come by and i love that hair, my very first one! oh, and even better is bley daisy on the far right: another fantastic thing is that by mixing mj with doctopus you get a far more deadly and real villain than anyone could've forseen - the hippy! oh c'mon, tell me that ain't cool? anyhoo, here is a pic of doctopus showing his might: random fact: did you know i influence both dragonator and iamded in their sigfigs? dragonator adapts his from my ia series while iamded added mutt hair when i had him like that in a pic i posted. now onto the box, sorry about the lighting. the art is good and the cartoon spidey in the corner may have beenthe inspiration for a similar style in the new batsets: back of the box. again, sorry about the lighting and blur, it was gtting late and these were the last pics: finally we get to the first part of the set: the catapult. is that movie accurate or what? i love the part in sm2 when he uses his homemade genetic spider powered catapult to launch himself to the scene! oh well, it does comes with a cool spider web an trans blue spider, so it gets some points: and it is really fun! i launched spidey several metres once, i don't think he ever recovered. infact, he almost certainly webbed himself slightly cooler extras are these two. this awesome little boat is great for city, as is the simple but nice bouy, daisy approves: naturally dragonator ruins everything when he found out the "dragon" that would be riding with him was our nickname for daisy now finally, the main attraction - coctopus' dock. iamded and i threw dragonator in the water to see if he could swim. he er, couldn't one sweeney todd later, we continue! the overall construction of the building is very good. i know a lot of people hated stickers and i hated applying these, but they do look spectacular and perfect for any city setting, like a bank, a gotham bank as iamded has already noted below me the black lifesavers a very cool as are the web piece and log pieces: the inside contains the neutron copperplate triple bypass humdrum holy hum 5000, which does does, see movie. anyhoo, it is very cool, and includes a little control thingy on the yellow brick next to it. unfortunately, the inside is plain but for that: the other side has no wall too which is a bit of a letdown really, but atleast it allows daisy easy access. one gripe is those yellow 1x1 bricks, they serve no purpose and break up the colour scheme: better shot of the thingy thing. i quite like it, the use of technic parts actually works, and the whole set is worth it for those purple flames and dishes alone it closes up pretty well too, unable to hit the dish which is a nice feature: me and iamded liked it so much we threw a revived dragonator into it. unfortunately it disagreed with him, but it was fun: another shot of the dock. i like how they have gaps in the jetty, i know the movie version was pretty wack, and although the set isn't very faithful to it (looks more like a seaside library to be frank) it still is very nice. this is my first large blue baseplate too which is wonderful, though funny how the set only uses about half of it: the roof is a well designed and fun feature, it uses some technic connections to render it flexible of any degree, as you can see here by my opening of it: better shot of the roof design, it can lie flat or at any angle. i might use the design myself in the future: as much as i love the building this feature bugs me, for in order for it to work this wall has to stick out, which not only looks ugly but makes you be able to see through the corners. still, easily modded, and log pieces are fantastic for mocing. it also means that there are 7 windows all up for a good, sizeable building: by pulling out the piece in the center the walls both collapss sideways outwards, which is actually pretty fun and works everytime: overall view of the set including characters: now for the story that makes no sense....at all: spiderman is dead after falling down the wall mechanism (see above): only daisy can save the day! for dragonator is being held by the evil doctopus! and iamded and dragonator are too busy not caring! and brainbox is too busy complaining that this goes against all marvel continuity! unfortunately daisy is on a lunchbreak so tough luck dragonator: and daisy goes on a search for fortune and glory: okay, this is what i think of the set: build: 3/5 - fun, but those stickers ruin the experience somewhat, and if you don't apply them the instructions are a bit hard to follow. playability: 4/5 - great little gizmos and bits, not the kind that keep you going like with the 2007 aquabase, but good fun still. design: 4/5 - not very movie faithful no, but still a great little building and a smart design for certain aspects. minifigs: 5/5 - great figs with all different faces and very useful bits. price: 2/5 far, far overpriced even on sale sadly total: 18/25 - a good set that could've been better with a few minor changes. nothing wrong with it, but it doesn't really cross the line to greatness. that said, it has a lot going for it and definitely worth buying or atleast a look! thanks for reading batbrick away! edited by batbrick, 13 june 2008 - 12:21 pm.

1 lookin' good so far! though i must say it's doc ock, not dok ock... the catapult is, well, ridiculous, but the boat is very spiffy, and the buoy is a nice addition! i actually like the stickers on the window pieces, perfect for this building, and great for post-apoc scenes. black life-saver rings are a nice addition too.anyway, hurry up dragonator and batbrick! and daisy! i want to see the rest of the review! ~iamded away!

0 great review as always, batbrick! ) i always enjoy reading them because they really make my day! )))) i hope that we shall see more and more.... good day, gentlemen! )

0 i got this set in 2006 in a 'byrnes world of wonder' toy shop. i dont remember how much, but it was a deal. the box was all battered but it had everything. good review batbrick.

1 thanks for the review, even if it is a number of years late. i picked this up whn it came out, and thought it was a rather cool set (besides the catapult). plenty of cool pieces, and the baseplate has found a use in the batcave. although i think my dad managed to spill some beer on it at one point. that was awful to clean off... batbrick, on jun 13 2008, 10:44 am, said: and brainbox is too busy complaining that this goes against all marvel continuity! i wasn't expecting that! there i was, casually scrolling down, when i stumbled onto a picture of me.

-1 where is my soap????!!!! haha, anyway, nice review as always, batbrick! i too have the set and hate the wall jutting out, catapult, and missing wall. but hey, review.

0 batbrick, on jun 13 2008, 09:44 pm, said: for dragonator is being held by the evil doctopus! and iamded and dragonator are too busy not caring! wait... dragonator's not caring that he's being held by doc ock? what are you doing? a very nice finish to the interview, now i really want this set! the story at the end was neat (except for spidey dieing! ) but my favourite part was the exploding dragonator. nothing personal mate, it just looks cool when people are thrown into fusion reactors! ~peace

1 very good review! i always wanted this set, shame i didn't get it.

0 a few years late, but great review! i really want to get this set!

1 nice review! i would have snapped this up back in 2006 if i was not in my dark ages!

0 great review! and what are the stands that you used? they look much better than the white bricks that i use.

0 oops. sorry, valentin!

1 here's the 3rd of the whole batch of complete reviews done back in 2006. hope you guys enjoy them so far. product: 6206 tie interceptor theme: star wars no of pieces: 212 release date: february 2006 rrp: sgd39.90/usd19.90 availability: lego shop@home, target, toys 'r' us (us & europe), bricksworld (sg). lego.com said: challenge the rebels! blasting out of star wars episode vi: return of the jedi, the tie interceptor is the fastest fighter in the imperial fleet! open the cockpit canopy and fold down the instrument panel to put the tie pilot inside and recreate your favorite classic star wars battles! includes tie fighter pilot! cockpit opens and instrument panel folds down! it does seem to have more pieces than the average tie fighter, but this is actually cheaper than the 7263 tie fighter. of course, there's no light-up feature in this set. :sweat: yesh!! finally... a... tie interceptor!! this is probably the most anticipated for all set for all lego tie collectors worldwide, since the fighter, bomber, advanced, and even the expanded universe droid fighter had been released by the lego group. this set is near movie-accurate, since the bottom part of it ain't. :p the cockpit and pylons uses the same design as that of the tie advanced piloted by darth vader. except for one minor change, that is the aft interior of the cockpit is strengthen this time. and this is indeed good news, since the older models had a problem of hard hinge and loose brick connection. there's no landing gear for this set, but it doesn't require it anyway. this tie interceptor balances perfectly on its wings. standard instruments panel and, of course, standard imperial pilot. the "swoosh-able" or play factor of this set is definitely very high... just take a look. :d *camera view from own craft* *camera view from tie-advanced* *combat simulation of endor's battle from the archives* no bomber, since i started late in re-collecting. :p to conclude, for a typical lego fan, this set is a 60/40, 60 due to it's good design, and for a typical star wars fan, this is a must-get. the only flaw for this set is the same flaw for any lego set in sg, the price. :doh: comment(current in 2008) being a starwars fan... no... being a typical toy collector, space is definitely a premium... so much so that i turned to lego starwars to sate my appetite for more starwars products when i already have no more display space. for the next few non-lego pictures, they are the crown of my starfighter collection in 1/18 scale. so just view them for fun, eh? and no, i haven't had the chance nor the time to do up a scene of my lego starfighters blowing up spectacularly since the pieces would be very hard to put back... hmm... then again, isn't that what lego is about. "doh".

0 why have you uploaded this twice???

0 skipper 24, on jun 15 2008, 08:02 pm, said: why have you uploaded this twice??? because this review is very good! thanks for all the pics! i want to buy that set too! they are so big! but why did lego made them in these strange black/d.blue colors? this set is very old, i saw it one time in my local toyshop for 69 euro and now it's gone, pitty. will look on ebay.

0 great review!! thanks for posting!

0 y'know you can open the bag

0 ahhh bag building... that takes me back. i suspect that if i didn't do my bag building topic my eb life would have turned out very differently. for the negative nancies, i suggest you try it. i bought a set just so i could, and i found it fun. (not fun enough to do it again though!) thanks for the interesting review.

-1 nice review, i have the original at-at and i like it a lot. considered buying this one but it being motorized made me not. also, i think a set this size could really come with some more snowies! benny

1 great review indexing it, as i write this. how come you think the ctt is the at-ats predecessor? do you mean the motorized at-at or at-at's in general? i think this is a great set and i am very fond of mine. it's one of the few sw sets of mine that is on "parade" at all times. most are packed away in the attic. kimt [btw it's not alone, the older version of the at-at is keeping it company]

-1 nice review ! the "driver/pilot whatever you call him" ( ) 's helmet looks kind of odd, and why does have a long red pole instead of a kick-butt lightsaber?

-1 i never got the set. it looked way to skinny. i came close to buying it for the figs but then decided not to. if you compared this one to the later one there is a big difference. this one just didnt seem proporshined with the legs and its body.

-1 thanks for the review kimt - it comes at a... confusing time you can take off the top disk and lift it like the millennium falcon from the top now. i actually don't like this set that much. it takes about 5 hours and 15 minutes to build if you do it in one go, but the repeating sections makes this built the most tedious i have experienced. it has way too many holes from which you can see the colorful skeleton and is overpriced compared to the older 10030 isd. i remember thinking it was too expensive when it was 50% off at s@h! even the snowspeeder was "kewler" to less than half the price:

-1 hmmm, ive still got this set and i must say, i think you did a good job of reviewing it. but... overall, i hate the set, probably the worst ucs set so far (apart from the naboo fighter but that hardly even counts as ucs) from my experience. unless you really really want it and have nothing better to spent your $$$ on, in that case go for it. but in my case, it was a very repetitive build and final model was quite... well, bland, not must variety to it, if you know what i mean.for the price, i would really reccomend the ucs star destroyer, because thats a much better story..

-1 thanks for the review. eh, honestly, i though this was awful ever since i first saw the pictures. to me, an incomplete grey ball doesn't really work as a special ucs kit, for the sole reason that it's boring. extremely so. now, the new death star playset is a whole different story. they should have done that in the first place. edited by grevious, 24 june 2008 - 09:12 pm.

1 good job kimt, its a really nice set. it will be interesting to see the size of ds2 ucs compared with the new death star playset. keep up the great regulator job you are doing. morten

1 morten_sonne, on jun 25 2008, 03:36 am, said: it will be interesting to see the size of ds2 ucs compared with the new death star playset. i was thinking about the same!!! as for the review - thanks!!

-1 thanks for the review kimt! honestly, like the others have said, i don't find any appeal in ucs sets, especially this one. it's just a big, incomplete, grey ball.

1 kimt, on jun 24 2008, 03:22 pm, said: 4: zero swooshability i think its very swooshable, assuming you swoosh it at the same speed it moves in the movie. :d while i would never do something like this, i bet if you packed this sucker with a bunch of m80 firecrackers it would make for a fantastic end to a stop motion movie. with it being as delicate as you say it is i bet you wouldn't destroy any parts. edited by gotoandlego, 03 april 2010 - 02:57 pm.

0 i decided to re-read this review because i just got this set today. i dont really have a concern over the design or repeating build process because owning this set was never an option for me as i collect ucs sets... but i am surprised to see an almost total lack of positive posts. i really hope that i enjoy this build.

1 i've just ordered the bits for this from bricklink (i'm awaiting the final order now) so i'm interested in these comments. i can see that, since i'll be building it with the kids, i'll have to plan in plenty of breaks and do lots of parallel building to keep us all from getting bored!

0 very nice review jim! i haven't bought this set yet, but am planning to just to get a gg fig as i don't have one already. bought an imperial landing craft instead this week as it was on sale, but after this review, gg's fighter is sure to follow soon benny

0 yesterday i buy this set,and i'm waiting for a pack! this review is very helpful! jimbutcher, on jun 27 2008, 08:34 pm, said: ill try to do the sith infiltrator this weekend. i wait!

1 thanks for the review. bearing in mind that the whole point of this set is to get a cheap troll warrior, i actually quite like it. the cart isn't brilliant, but for 13 pieces it's not that bad. the troll fig is great as always, and i guess the rats are always nice to get (not so much in real life though). the sets that contain the trolls have a fairly solid number each (i mean, tower raid has three!), but nevertheless i think i may have to pick up a few of these. whitefang, on jul 2 2008, 02:49 pm, said: in addition, the flick missile really works. use a little bit of force from your finger and flick it, the missile will fly. well, it certainly does not impress me at all with such playing feature. the troll's hands are going to get quite sore then aren't they?

0 trooperdavinfelth, on jul 2 2008, 03:15 pm, said: it's all good... but!(i know, you expected a but ) it's a rat. or maybe a very large mouse

1 its a good review but you forgot another thing. the troll needs a shiled like they used to in the 2007 castle line the sets always had shields for the minifigs and it could be better if it was 3.00 instead of 3.50 but yes it is a good impulse great army builder.

1 grrr... you beat me to it! i got two of these in the mail today and was so eager to do a review of it. thanks for saving me the work. edited by wilhelm screamer, 03 july 2008 - 03:30 am.

0 hey, your review is great (as usual!!) as for the set itself - well, it's an impulse set after all - small and cheap, nothing special. well, the rat is special, hehe, for me the rat is the most interesting in the set (cause i don't have a rat). i don't have a troll warrior either, but i'm not very interested.

0 whitefang, on jul 3 2008, 04:06 am, said: i thought by calling it as a "mouse", it will be a little much friendly unlike calling it a rat. why is mouse friendlier than rat?

0 whitefang, on jul 4 2008, 05:43 pm, said: well, mouse sounded more friendly, because it can associate with tom and jerry. but, calling it a rat equal calling it a pest.. it's just a matter of putting it in different terms. that's all. the thing i dont get is how jerry is friendly

1 thank you for the review. the set is nice, i didn't need the flickfire missiles and would have rather a orc/trol shield instead, but i think i will pick one up.

1 looking at this is making me want to build one of the favourite sets of my childhood, 6649 street sweeper (might do that today actually). cheap. good pieces (despite the lack of a bin lid... that's just inviting disaster isn't it?), nice fig, and one of those blue brushes, which i've always loved but never managed to use. thanks whitefang.

1 thank you for the nice review. this set looks good. i have too many of the blue sweepthings, but the fig is nice and i didn't have this face, so i will pick up one some day.

1 thanks for the review! poor little minifig: this guy has to haul the heavy machine all the way from the depot onto the littered streets to locate some trash, but when he has finally found some and switches on the machine everything will be launched towards his pants.... no wonder he's looking sad.... a nice set though, and inventive too! when it comes to streetsweepers, i remember getting the first of it's kind on my birthday in 1991.

1 hello all eurobricks members, i will be doing a continuation of my impulse set reviews. this will be the third review at a go. hope everyone of you will find this review useful in a way. name: coast guard kayak theme: lego system / town / city year: 2008 pieces: 21 minifigs: 1 an image of a 5621, coast guard kayak roll roll, roll your boat it seemed the coast guard has a kayak of his own, roaming in the sea, making sure that swimmers will be safe in the beach. now, i am illustrating him as a life guard instead. this set is simply wonderful. among the 4 new impulse sets, coast guard kayak is the best looking set in my opnion. the kayak design is very simple but looks realistic . furthermore, if you don't need it to be a coast guard kind of stuff. use it as a leisure water spot instead down in the marina. i will think any lego citizen will love to have some water spot in their busy life. so come down here and wind down with this new sport. bits and pieces kayak and the bouy the bouy is very useful to position it at the coast of your water to highlight the boundaries in the sea, and warning incoming ships or vessels. oh, i did not make it tilted purposely. there is a white round base which allow it to tilt on both ends. useful parts these parts are useful to add on in your city. somehow, when i see that red cone, i can use it as a police stop, to inspect vehicles on the road or form a barricade with it. the bouy base shape is unique too. i like it very much. it is great to attached it by the side of the boat as a life bouy. the coast guard's life vest and helmet are very useful for water activites. the life vest was produced in past sets, and now it re-surfaced again. i am glad these vests made their way back. a look of him, without the life vest summary review playability: 7.5/10 (fun to play with, especially the bouy when you see it moving up and down.) design: 8.5/10 (design is simple but straight to the point, especially the kayak design.) price: 8/10 (an inexpensive set to get more coast guards and more kayaks.) overall: 8.5/10 (a very good set to have in your lego town. the kayak is simply so lovely to me.) hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine. comments and critics are strongly welcomed. pictures can be found in my brickshelf (when moderated)

1 thanks for doing these impulse sets, whitefang. this set looks like it has a good number of useful parts. i dont have the minifig torso or head, nor the oar or the life jacket.

1 one of the better impulse sets imo.

0 thanks for pics. the hawk, it seems to me, lacks a cockpit, theres not even a seat to keep the pilot from falling off. perhaps it they'd redesigned it to be a backpack jetpack sort of unit using similar pieces, it'd at least make some sense? based on the other mm impluses, can we assume this goes for 3.5$usd? at that price it seems to me, that the astro fighter at 5$usd was already a superior impluse set. guess i'd buy one on clearance, for the minifig.

1 thanks for another great review! i definitely like this set. sure, the interior might be a bit bare, but i think that the outside of the base with all of the great lava and rocks more than makes up for it. it is a bit weird that on the one side there is nothing on the inside. but that's easy to fix. anyone know when this will be out in the u.s.? thanks again for the fantastic review!

1 droool must buy!!!!!! to svelte_corps: how on this wonderful planet, did you get that??? i thought it was coming in september!!!

0 awsome review dude im proably getting this though the main downfall is there is hardly an inside

1 thanks for the step-by-step!! set looks great! mmmmm, clawdette....

0 great review!!! realy thank you svelte_corps! maybey you can put al the agents villains round dr. disco like a sort of dicussionroom or something...just an idea undersigned mowo

1 thanks for the review svelte_corps, i have yet to purchase an agent set but i think that will change shortly. i am not a big fan of the stickers but the huge laser gun, the unique minifig design, and beaucoup trans-orange pieces have me sold.

1 i'm still keeping my money payments until july 26th ...so i won't be able to buy this set unless i get some money prize or something however, i appreciate the review, and hopefully i will get this set sometime in the near future. i just love these new cybernetic arms

0 jimbutcher, on jul 10 2008, 09:44 pm, said: a hidden compartment! now this was a very cool idea by tlg, a secret compartment found by taking off the top slope of the hull you're supposed to slide the front of the hull off, rather than lift the top piece off.

0 led zeppelin, on jul 10 2008, 04:46 pm, said: you're supposed to slide the front of the hull off, rather than lift the top piece off. yeah, i was looking at the construction booklet and it reminded me of that (i forgot about it), but that makes it more fragile.

0 nice review jim, i think i would only buy this for darth maul though you definitely showcased all the cool features really well!

0 i got this set last year. and i think you made a mistake when you have remove a piece to access the probe droids and equipment, you just have to slide the entire main part. and i have a question, is this equipped with the new flick-fire missiles that don't fall off?

-1 i'm not real fond of slimeface. he looks too much like the joker-bombs. i was hoping for something newer. the slime printing is a nice touch though. steve

0 great review. i love that slime face !

1 thanks for review...(i hope svelt corps still reviews it ) slime is pretty cool, i knew about the torse for a while but its no less cool now

0 thanks for the review! it's great to see detailed pictures of slime face. the set looks good but not as good as some of the others in this line. great review!

0 i feel like a n00b asking, but what is the usd price? i didn't see a price in the review.

0 great review!! really thanks i slime face, even slimey as my slime sense nice that break jaw is also in it! undersigned mowo

0 batbrick, on jul 19 2008, 09:53 am, said: is it impossible or just very hard to mod? nothing is impossible to mod! probably the easiest part to change would be the front where the missiles are and the treasure chest slides out - you could make a sizeable compartment there. however the middle section is so narrow and the end fins are just that - fins - that it might be harder to expand without changing the shape of the sub. you'll find out soon when yours arrives! batbrick, on jul 19 2008, 09:53 am, said: the octopus sounds great, thanks for that, is he meant to be on any side? i'm guessing he's a mutant inferno creature. about slime face, is his head much different to the joker bombs? i know he has slime marks on his head, are they very apparent? it's not really clear but since all the other mutants are evil (or at least controlled by dr inferno), it's probably a safe bet the squid is too. slime face's head is different to the joker bombs - different eyes and teeth (although the smile is similar i guess) and the slime marks are much more apparent in the flesh (or abs) although they don't photograph that way. joker bomb face below for contrast:

1 wow, thanks for the review, that is one awesome set, slime face is excellent! i must add him to the collection, i think we need some new agents, there's so many inferno minifigures now... maybe next year? thanks again!

1 great looking set. and that glowy blue octopus is really cute, i might just get it for that. be great in a space moc.. wondering, from the pdf instructions i saw, it wasnt clear what the agent in the sub is sitting on, hows his seat work? and it looks like theres a compartment below him...

1 6927 all terrain vehicle year released: 1981 piece count: 167 minifigs: 2 list price: $14.50 a very unique vehicle in the classic space collection was this "all-terrain vehicle" which i always considered more along the line of a mobile lab. the set introduced/infused white and black bricks with classic blue space pieces. the result was this great classic vehicle. the set includes two figs (still red and white): here's a view of the vehicle which is really two components, the vehicle itself and the lab section: i absolutely loved the the blue windshield slopes (2 included), and the unique upside-down large blue slope: in the back of the vehicle is the blue lab: the back section of the vehicle has hinges that allow the jets sections to open: the brick design fits perfectly into the lab, and when opened, the lab falls to the ground: note: the little round trans. red 1x1s allow the lab to slide up and forward when the jet sections are closed. i tried taking off the red 1x1s and the lab does not lift as easily with them. the design is very clever, esp. for a classic set. here's a shot of the stand-alone lab: unlike earlier classic space windows, this set has train window frames with yellow windows. the top of the lab lifts up for playability: inside the lab are several computers and a swivel chair: back to the vehicle, here's a shot of the cockpit with white steering wheel: the left side has an upside-down wrench and black antenna: the right side, a walkie-talkie and another antenna. the antennas can be used as breaks to keep the middle wheels from moving: here's ashot of the under carriage: and a final shot of the complete set: for those of you following my classic space reviews, this is review number 9 of 10. my final review of an-all time favorite will be coming soon. hope you enjoyed this review. comments are always welcome.

1 oh man, this review takes me back! i got this set when i was 8 years old, and loved it. i remember modding it to remove the lab in the back, and i put in a giant laser cannon instead. 'cause when you're 8 years old, everything needs a giant laser cannon. cp5670, on jul 11 2008, 12:43 am, said: the only bad thing about this set is the name. it can't even roll over a single plate's height. not very "all terrain" at all. ha! very true. the vehicle is built so low to the ground that the front end catches on everything.

1 i've always associated this set with 6929, the voyager. they're of the same timeframe and more or less the same style. 6927 is without any doubt my favourite ground vehicle of space. it was pretty simple, but it was such a creative set. the stories you could tell with this model... g... most defenitely in my top 5 of space sets...

1 this set never got me as a kid. i suspect it was because of the wheels; i had mostly basic sets so it would have been more of the same. looking at it now i can see i have misjudged it, and i love the lab-lift method. i'm going to have to build this to see it in action! thanks for another great review.

1 awesome review brickster! i didn't you are also a space fan oh how i love classic space the all time perfect lego space related theme everytime i see one i want to buy them more and more, when compared to modern fang dangled sets with detailed figs and cool new accessories, they have nothing on classic space, simple beauty maybe its the blue/grey/trans yellow color scheme classic space forever edited by piranha, 30 august 2009 - 07:51 am.

0 wow! that brings back memories. i have that model too (in storage somewhere). the pictures are great. i will definitely be checking out more of your reviews.

0 great review. as much as i hate spongebob lego, i just might get this set. it has a good number of useful parts, like the computer and keyboard, and all of the brown pieces. how much does this set cost in usd?

0 great review! i want that set, mainly for patric and the spongebob with the bandage. but: why does bob have full length pants? i thought he wore briefs?

1 how much euro did you pay for it? it looks a great set, great interior, nice figures and funny posters. :) it's also nice: the newest spongebob sets are now also available in our stores and they are the coolest (belgium)!

0 cpt. pegleg blockbeard, on jul 12 2008, 04:23 pm, said: is sponge bob sets available in auzzi land? i have not seen them in shops... regards cpt. pb generally not, although as a special sale promotion target has 3830 bikini bottom express and 3831 rocket ride available now (although the sale starts 24 july for 20% off) and k-mart briefly had the krusty krab set last year.

0 i never have buy a sponge bob set but this looks so cool so maybe... (just maybe) i will buy it . i am curious of why tlc havent done the flying dutchman ship, it was in the first rumor list of sponge bob sets, that surely will be a must .

1 the official name for this lego set is "the emergency room". i have all the other spongebob sets, including three krusty krabs, two bikini bottoms, as well as one of everything else , now all i need to do is wait until next month to buy this set if i find it at my local toys "r" us. that spongebob minifig looks cute.

1 i'm not a huge fan of spongebob, but this set i might want also have. maybe i can combine it with the city hospital.

0 great review sinner, i haven't seen a bellville set review before! i just realised what you meant by 'fore' in the topic subtitle, too. imperialshadows, on jul 12 2008, 09:31 am, said: obviously, it really is all about the accessories, and it's got 'em, but not enough to make me spend that kind of cash, and i don't even mind having a pile of pink parts around. i agree, a lot of the pieces are good but i don't think i would get it. however, i do think i will get the set with the dogs, so my minifigs can have giant mutant hounds! jimbutcher, on jul 12 2008, 06:45 pm, said: and look what you found... a bucket! a bucket, in disguise as a watering can...

1 a nice review with a nice touch of sinner which made me laugh. the playfull puppy set has saussages i think i would buy a playfull puppy, it has nice pieces and the puppy can also be used for minifigs as a big dog. why haven't they not made a saussagesseller for city. maybe in the future. there are already more chickenlegs in minifigs sets.

1 sinner!!! you know, i had never seen a belville set in any review with such great pictures before! i just can't take my eyes off, in the master bedroom. the scene is quite, a little hot. enough of me, peeping up there. let's take a look at the interior. i am very surprised by its construction of the house. it's quite big and is nice of you to buy a great sweet gift for your daughter. i am very sure, she will enjoyed playing with it. somehow, it reminded me of barbie doll products. maybe, its too pinkish for me. the accessories is the "plus factor" in any belville sets. it offered quite a handful of great accessories to add into any types of mocs construction to add in the plus factor in it. sinner, you are a very nice dad! i like how parents, buy educational toys for their children to expand their imaginations instead of sitting in a couch playing video games and etc.

1 thanks for your report and the pics, my sister wants this set, but she's already got the last house and she doesn't play very often with it, but the new one looks very good, too

0 svelte_corps, on jul 12 2008, 03:19 pm, said: 2 questions though. 1) was it a fun build? 2) are those large figs anatomically correct under their frou-frou finery? if not, what the hell are they doing in the second pic whilst baby sylvia explores the oven? it was sort of fun, but it really is just a lot of big pieces. the kitchen stove is smart though. as for the figs, yes i forgot to add pictures of the happy couple! here they are. hinckley, on jul 12 2008, 03:27 pm, said: when your daughter outgrows it, will you turn it into a belleville star wars moc please? thank you in advance it could be a while; ask me again in three years. wout, on jul 13 2008, 03:58 am, said: why haven't they not made a saussagesseller for city. maybe in the future. there are already more chickenlegs in minifigs sets. i agree. there's a good chance of me borrowing certain parts in the future. whitefang, on jul 13 2008, 07:07 pm, said: sinner, you are a very nice dad! i like how parents, buy educational toys for their children to expand their imaginations instead of sitting in a couch playing video games and etc. thanks, but i must confess she does play with our ps3 too... ~vbbn~, on jul 15 2008, 11:30 am, said: aw, sinners' playing with toys again! when did i stop? elishelrot, on jul 15 2008, 05:54 pm, said: thanks for your report and the pics, my sister wants this set, but she's already got the last house and she doesn't play very often with it, but the new one looks very good, too i'm still undecided on if it was a smart buy. she played with it a lot this week, but last week she ignored it... and i had to fix it twice!

1 sinner, on jul 25 2008, 09:47 pm, said: i'm still undecided on if it was a smart buy. she played with it a lot this week, but last week she ignored it... and i had to fix it twice! my daughter is 12, and she still plays with all her belville stuff (mostly the fairy princess castle sets). if your daughter is anything like mine, you will definitely get your money's worth out of it. however ... as soon as my daughter says she's done with it, i plan on raiding the sets for all those great food and accessory bits. patience .... great review, by the way. the belville sets are indeed overpriced, but they're probably lego's best attempt at wooing the girl audience (i still hate the fact that tlc thinks they need separate "boy" themes and "girl" themes, but whatever). they're a very nice alternative to barbie -- you get posable figures with realistic body proportions, plus some creativity and building aspects thrown in.

0 i recognize the clock! it came with my old airport set 6392 back in 85! in fact according to peeron it mostly came out in train stations link belville looks horrible to me too barbie-ish and does not look lego at all. would prefer they went with paradisa instead.

1 7655: clone battle pack year: 2007 number of pieces: 58 number of minifigs: 4 price: 9.99 usd brickset welcome to my third review on eurobricks, i hope you enjoy! while at any store that sells lego (target, wal-mart, tru, etc.), you will notice that the clone battle packs on the shelf are way fewer in number than the droids battle pack. as you might guess, the clones are way more popular, and finding them gets harder and harder as the release date of this set goes farther into the past. so stock up! alright, heres a pic of the box: a small box, as expected for inexpensive sets like these. note the "build your army" button on the front: tlg obviously is encouraging customers to buy multiples, and with good reason, which will be explained later in this review. well, lets get straight to it: the contents of this set. you will notice a speeder bike, a gun turret, and some clones. looking good so far! lets have a look at the turret: an excellent star wars element to have around, especially for mocing. it is very cleverly built, using a tire guard from city sets for the general shape of the turret mount. all you have to do is attach the (new mold! explained later) gun to the 2x1 plate with the center stud, and... presto! i wonder how the clones build these turrets to fast in the middle of battle... a rear view: with a clone mounted: my only gripe about the turret is that you have to take off the gun in order for every clone to have a gun. now, we move on to the vehicle of the set, the speeder bike: a rather sleek and good looking bike, with some useful pieces on it as well, such as the blue cones, the megaphones, and the engines. some say it looks bare without the figs mounted on it, but i think it looks just fine. the commander drives while a trooper shoots on the back. a side view: and a rear view: my only gripe is the same as the turret: you have to remove the back gun for all the clones to have weapons while on foot. the back pistol attaches to a 2x2 round studded plate with a technic hole in the middle. finnaly, here are the new guns: this set comes with 1 new blaster rifle and three new pistols. it could have included one more rifle for the turret. and of course, the figs: includes: 1 yellow commander (lovely fig), 1 shocktrooper (comes with a pair of elctrobinouculars), and two regular troopers (so clean and white). the figs are excellent, all that any sw or lego fan should want. it could have maybe included one more regular trooper, but that might be pushing it. thats all for now, folks, here is the... final verdict: build: 8/10, extremely easy, should take the seasoned builder about 5 minutes to complete. a fun build, though. playability: 5/10, i guess you can get this with the droid battle pack and make them battle, but this set has no real play features of its own. but it is good for collecting troops and using them for mocs. swooshability: 9/10, i guess you can zoom the speeder bike around... minifigs: 10/10, four great figs that should be bought in multiples, a great army builder. design: 10/10, a clever turret, an awesome speeder, and four great clones. what more do you need in a 10 dollar set? price: 8/10, not bad i suppose, but if you calculate a dime for each piece, this set should come out to 5-6 dollars. but still, billions of these are being sold world-wide, and tlg is making a ton of money off of them. overall score: 9.5/10, a truly memorable set, one that will be a favorite for ages to come, and very popular. a great army builder for a small price, plus vehicle and turret! with only a few very minor flaws, this set is one of the best of star wars. and this concludes my review, and as always, comments are most welcome.

1 when i saw this topic i was like : "oh my god this set is out since 2007. this guy is so late!" but i read your review and this idea got out of my mind! thank you jim! i have 2 of these and i even have twice more droids than clones! i should have buy more but it's sold out now

0 yet another fine review your getting my fingers bleeding from all this updating the review index keep doing that - reviewing that is. kimt

0 thanks for the review... ...unfortunately the droid battle pack is discontinued for the uk s@h ...also the clone battle pack is discontinued for the usa s@h ( for the americans)

0 that's strange. i saw about 20 of them in my tru. anyways, nice review. i thought this set was great for armies.

0 thanks for the review. i want to add that the few parts which are contained in this set are very usable for own mocs. the rancor, on jul 12 2008, 11:11 pm, said: ...unfortunately the droid battle pack is discontinued for the uk s@h ooops - it's also not available in germany any more.

1 thanks for the review jimbutcher . i think this set is cool especially the cool redesigned stap i just it.

1 love this set! nice review also.. i had the set in my hands a few times but never bought it, though i drooled at it, i remember. i guess i didn't get pocket money at that time, it was not that common around europe in the 80s i guess. so better to say that no one bought it for me.. a few years later i got the safari truck, which is also really sweet. i like the colors of this model and the detail of it. the minifig is really classic, made only for this set (appears in some later train sets as well) and shows the exact image of the truck on the shirt, including the motor piece. one of the most detailed and loveliest little sets from a sweet era of legoland city! ps voted "o" for outstanding. edited by zzz, 14 july 2008 - 09:50 am.

1 o....m.... g!!!!!!! that looks sweet! how much did he say it was?

1 wow, it does look really cool. i love that...oops! it's gone. can't post pics of that yet, sorry. it was requested that we remove those pics. sorry everyone. have a nice day.

0 i wish i had seen it.... judging by the reactions it is a pretty good set!

1 it would appear that lego wants this beauty kept a secret...=p anywho, this is amazing. i found pics...somewhere...and...oh wow. this thing is a must-have, and i'll be saddened so much if i can't find it anywhere. i doubt they'd keep a set like this promo, though. those parts are great for town fans, castle fans, space fans...you name it, that set could be useful for it. ohhh goodness... ~trexxen, who is blown away by this amazing set...

0 god save the save as-function

0 bagh i missed it all i know is that theres a cottage and van! time for brickshelf no doubt they've been taken down to. edit: awsome just found the brcikshelf pics. edited by skipper 24, 14 july 2008 - 06:05 pm.

0 i now found pics, too. that's absolutely ! after 10188 town plan this is the best city set ever! i really like the neat landscape with the little hill (there are a bench and some flowers on it, too ) and this brilliant cottage ! great idea with that power function that the wind mill turns and then enable the lights of the cottage ! concerning the city theme i must say: in the last time tlg comes up with one great surprise after the other. does anyone know where and when it'll be available (this year i think - otherwise there wouldn't be already pics, would they?) and how much it'll cost (i think about 70 euros, what do you think?)? i only hope that it'll be available in germany, too, otherwise i would be really if i am not able to get it since it is a must for every city and environment fan! klaus-dieter edited by klaus-dieter, 14 july 2008 - 06:49 pm.

0 ok guys, respect tlc? crazy policy (they dont take care about thiefs selling those sets long before official release,but they complain about one small photo on web ). if someone still needs photo, simply email me on josefzizka@post.cz, i will be glad to send you three pictures

1 jsn, on jul 14 2008, 08:35 pm, said: i think the great thing about the cottage is its very reminiscent of classic holiday home type houses that lego used to make like this one from the late 80s which a lot of people (me included) believe lego need to make more of. i totally agree with you, jsn' date=! this house in your link reminds me of the old weekend/holiday cottages ( ). hopefully the cottage in the wind power plant set cottage includes a nice interior, too. the outside looks amazing anyway ! i really would like to see more apartment holiday homes, too, but how it seems tlg is on its best way towards doing that! klaus-dieter

1 i got this set for christmas, and you gave me the feeling for wanting to build it again. thanks for the review!

1 my sister got this from our grandparents once when she was interested with space but it fell into my hands later. i had a lot of fun with that. by the way, the name for the test thing is called a centrifuge. it tests a person's ability to withstand high g-forces. edited by filefolders, 15 july 2008 - 03:55 pm.

0 wow!!!! i'm just surprised...i thought these were all street dated for the 26th of july. at least that's what i read according to lucas information. oh well, gratz on getin one of the new sets. i'm looking forward to seeing the droid gunship and the twilight real, real, real soon!

1 thanks, bloody_jay. another brilliant review. i really like the helicopter. though i hate the stickers (it seem like there are a lot of it), it won't stop me from buying it. too bad that when will the dino line arrive in singapore. . . :'( guess i've have to wait for the meanwhile.

1 that looks like a really great set, although i don't think i'd have anywhere to put it. i don't think i'll ever be able to get the set anyway, since it doesn't come out over here.

1 that's interesting news about the european release. i'd definitely be interested to see how they modify the set - chains, ropes, and crates are definitely useful pieces. can't wait for pictures. to everyone looking for just the figures - don't skip out and get the smaller set and the tank. spend the extra $20 and get the t1. it's well worth it. i might pick up the steel sprinter and the fire hammer myself, still trying to decide. if i do, i'll review them.

0 thanks bloody jay! any chance you could be reviewing the other dino attack sets?

0 mr. lego_bildur, on jul 25 2005, 10:11 pm, said: thanks bloody jay! any chance you could be reviewing the other dino attack sets? possibly the steel sprinter and urban avenger, but i can say with finality that i will not buy the tank until i find it available for $30 or less. on that note, if anybody does find it for $30 or less, shoot me a pm. ;)

0 mr. lego_bildur, on jul 25 2005, 10:53 pm, said: sorry for the double post, but i just had another question in mind: how long/high/wide is this "badass" copter? (including rotors). have have heard of as long as 25 inches for the length, but is this true or is it just an exaggeration? 25" long, and the rotors are 10" long each (making it 20" wide). hope that helps!

1 thanks for the awesome review, metalandi! your pics are very clear and you go into detail about all the functions of the set. i agree, this is a great set - one of the best of the cg line for sure, way better than the boat set with the tower on the bionicle baseplate, and cheaper too. i even like the helicopter better than the oversized version. lots of great parts and a really nice build by the looks of it too. i can't wait for this to be released in oz!

0 seeing the pictures in this review certainly reinforce my original thoughts on this set: here's an oil-rig mod waiting to happen...

1 very nice review and nice set to boot. lots of little features that increase the playability. great pics too (i remember you had trouble before with the tower raid castle set, as i just got mine and was looking to review it, but saw your review in archives.....shakes fist at how slow aussies get sets ) great reviews on!

1 thanks for the great review. i'm loving this set a lot - it looks well designed, and the helicopter is awesome! plus, i love the new worker figure with the beard. quote i agree, this is a great set - one of the best of the cg line for sure, way better than the boat set with the tower on the bionicle baseplate i wouldn't say that at all - true, this base is bigger, but the other set was well designed as well - plus the included boat is wonderful.

1 nice review! this is just the "crown jewel" for the coast guard theme. i love the layout of its platform. it looks real neat to have it placed it in the midst of the deep blue sea, awaiting of any emergency rescue. sometimes, i feel that this set can used it to merge with my aqua raiders sets. i thought of using it as a land base, for the raiders to dock in their stuff before submerge into the ocean. ok, it's just a wierd idea of mine. just feel that aqua raiders and coast guard can work hand in hand, since they are naval expertise! it seemed, i can't view all the pictures somehow. nevertheless, i can still view some of it quite well. i love the command center. the amount of computer printed pieces simply make me smile, with the monitor, keyboard, radar screen and etc. the helicopter is cute too. however, i pity the victim that is loaded at the back. it seemed a little bit too dangerous. in addition, this set seemed to have quite alot of stickers, which can be quite discouraging. i do hope to see this set soon. so far, i quite like the current coast guard sets.

0 i agree with both of you. first, i have to add, that a few of the stickers were a bit annoying as it comes to put them on espacially the ones on the helicopter, where you have to put them on round parts. but i didn't really see this at a bad point, i really can live with it. second, it was a very hard decision, believe it or not, on which new set to buy, cause i got a huge 2008 set-wantlist. i guess it'll take some time before i can get most of the other sets i want

0 tenorikuma, on jul 19 2008, 07:49 pm, said: do they sell this set in brick-and-mortar stores in australia? i have no idea what a brick & motar store is...

0 tenorikuma, on jul 19 2008, 08:26 pm, said: sorry, i mean physical retail stores (toys-r-us, etc.) as opposed to online stores (like shop@home). can you walk into a shop in brisbane and buy this set off the shelf? if so, i'll get my wife to buy me one when she visits the land down under next month. well some sets [this cg platform is one of them] a store exclusive to toys r us but most cg and all other lego can be found in shops like target, bigw, kmart, myer, mr.toys toy world & david jones & then there is toys r us of course but they are usualy abit more expensive then other retailers but they usualy have the exclusive sets like this one. and its funny you are from japan because i'am going there in september with my dad [he's a missionary] and i was wondering where i can find lego in japan since i have not been to japan since 2001 and i was not into lego much then. im sure you guys have a toys r us right?

1 that's a great review of a great city set! thank you very much, metalandi! first of all i wanted to buy the 7999 cg petrol boat & tower. but now i surely will buy this amazing platform instead of the 7999 if my local toy seller sells the 4210. reason: 4210 is something very unusual set (i think we won't get a set similar to that in the next 20 years) and because of i don't like the petrol boat inside (no backwalls , nearly no interior ). klaus-dieter

0 thanks a lot for the review, brickster! i never had the chance to get some classic town sets, but i wish i couldve! i just wonder why lego cant release sets like this anymore....

0 thebrickster, on jul 19 2008, 02:30 am, said: i just can't believe someone would rate this set a 1. it appears to be a trend among these classic reviews, never with a comment of why. maybe a tfol... it is our "destiny" to show them that lego existed before 1997 and was -imho- way better than today. we need more classic reviews. i hope i can continue with technic sets.

0 people giving this "1"? g... i'd give it a "4". i'd give it a "3" but added a point out of nostalgia... i think it's a nice town set from the old days. the only problem i always had is the lack of an ambulance... and we got a female doctor! :-)

0 whitefang, on jul 18 2008, 09:11 pm, said: paramedic unit, does not seem to suit well for this set's name. it should be named as clinic, outpatient treatment, family doctor and etc. the definition of a paramedic is "...someone who assists physicians in providing medical care..." i think in more modern times a paramedic is generally thought of as a more qualified and experienced ambulance technician but the dictionary definition would seem to fit with the lego model quite well. cheers rog

0 oh! never seen that set before! fun and strange that wheel supension system. has it ever been used in any other sets?

0 indeed they have; they've appeared in 15 different sets, in total. they also have an identical width with the wide 2x2 wheels holder which is used on cars today. they are still excellent today, since retrofitting these suspension parts onto today's off-roader trucks won't give them weird proportions or any problems, and it looks perfect. plus they are useful if you're lazy and don't feel like constructing the pin-suspension used in the early 90's for truck-trailers, altough stability probably will suffer.

1 4/5. i've had this set since i was young. never understood why a tow truck needed to be an off-roader; maybe it was used to tow the other off-road vehicles. the suspension made the truck too tall to tow some cars, so i often took the hook out and use the truck as just an great off-road truck like 6672 (which also had the suspension wheels). other tow truck sets better filled their roles better, but that doesn't diminish this set at all. whitefang, on jul 18 2008, 09:19 am, said: i think it looks really out of proportion. no, for 25-odd years this vehicle was perfectly proportioned with all others in the town/city line. it's all these new 6 and 8 and 20 wide vehicles that are ignoring convention and making it look out of proportion. granted speed racer sets are more of their own line, but 6660 is smaller than most of the cars produced in the last few years.

1 u took me long way back in memory. thank you as it was a great memories with legos edited by vintagelegoera, 04 august 2015 - 07:04 pm.

1 skipper 24, on jul 19 2008, 07:25 am, said: cool set i really loved the classic town sets. this set has lots of detail, great reveiw. do you know what is exxon? thanks skipper. exxon is a big fuel company here in the us. there's a lot of exxon gas stations throughout the country.

1 great review of a classic set. man, this is sure a wondeful kit, even today. the level of detail is astounding for the time, and the whole kit is really cute. you know, i honestly don't get why some people have complained about the city gas station's figure count - the majority of lego gas stations had no more than three figures - including this one and the wonderful gas and wash express (which i actually own!). i also don't get why people complain about the stickers so much - because even older kits often had a lot. personally, i think stickers are okay, because printed pieces can't be used in as many places if the stickers are really specialized.

1 panda9001100, on jul 19 2008, 10:19 am, said: i love this set, it's nice and simple. maybe it's because i build this set by myself by ordering all parts and buildinginstruction. and i made one extra tanktransporter : excellent tankers panda. these make great additions to the station.

1 i can't wait, that thing looks amazing. also, the new lego idol episode i told you about a few weeks ago is up. edited by cyclone titan, 19 july 2008 - 06:02 pm.

0 thanks guys! the review wonb't be until tommorow, but to hold you guys in suspense...

1 best mars mission set ever deserves a great review. :d

1 wow! this is a great mm set! and i wouldn't say that, but wow! this looks awesome. it's not the theme i really want, but if i get this set by accident ( ) i won't mind! hope to see your review soon.

1 excellent i cant wait to see the review, this set looks very interesting.

1 iamded, on jul 20 2008, 12:36 am, said: anyway, i don't normally like it when people make a topic to say they'll review a set soon, but i'll let you off since this is one of the few mars mission sets i really like, and i'm glad to know somebody has the set and will be reviewing it. ~peace this practice annoys me as well - especially since i built this set last night and considered making it my first review until i saw this thread. i don't want to step on any toes, so i'll let the original poster go ahead with the full review. in short, to tide everyone over, this set is fantastic. i really like the alien ship, and the main drilling unit/break away ship is an awesome unit with tons of play value. highly recommended! edited by clubninja, 20 july 2008 - 03:41 pm.

1 is it seriously? this set was a must-buy for me in the first place, but now that i see it in so much detail, it's just perfect... even the alien ship is better than usual. i love the scooter that flies out of the escape pod, the backpacks, bulldog stickers, and water tank. :d i'll be getting this one! space fans unite!

1 ok, minus ten for the placeholder, but plus about ten million for the review. this set is just amazing. it's really earned it's colors, and i'm sure no classic space fan can complain, even snefroe . i didn't know it had the tilting function for the drill- s@h is so pathetic with its pictures, and they really missed this amazing function. the detachable ship is so cute, it's almost classic space in it's design. major thumbs up to tlc. hell, make it a hug, even.

1 excellent review, it's a great set, i really love the look of the little ship. would it be possible to get some walking pictures of the walker?

1 grevious, on jul 20 2008, 12:43 pm, said: wonderful review. i'd die if i had to upload that many pictures... man, this is it: the pinacle of mars mission's second and final year. man, this baby is flawless. there are so many indications that the designers took care in designing this kit - like the space for the pilot's backpack, the compartment for the mini flier, the sturdy leg design - etc etc etc. kudos to tlc for making mars mission go out with a bang. i have high hopes that whereever the space theme goes next year, tlc will make it worth the wait. thanks! and yes, it took me half an hour just to resize them, and an hour to upload them to brickshelf. algernon, on jul 20 2008, 01:09 pm, said: is it seriously? this set was a must-buy for me in the first place, but now that i see it in so much detail, it's just perfect... even the alien ship is better than usual. i love the scooter that flies out of the escape pod, the backpacks, bulldog stickers, and water tank. :d i'll be getting this one! space fans unite! ah, very good! and the detail is truley a part in this set. the water tank is actualy pretty nice. sinner, on jul 20 2008, 07:29 pm, said: nice review! i really want this set, but i love most mars mission sets so it shouldn't be a surprise! it's great to see a good driller at last. i feel the same way... we have been considering closing topics like this. in ~vbbn~'s defense, he was fast. thanks! mr. mandalorian, on jul 20 2008, 08:17 pm, said: ok, minus ten for the placeholder, but plus about ten million for the review. this set is just amazing. it's really earned it's colors, and i'm sure no classic space fan can complain, even snefroe . i didn't know it had the tilting function for the drill- s@h is so pathetic with its pictures, and they really missed this amazing function. the detachable ship is so cute, it's almost classic space in it's design. major thumbs up to tlc. hell, make it a hug, even. lol, thanks. i just wanted to claim my place for the review. however from the looks of it, only me and another member have this set. sinner, on jul 21 2008, 02:52 am, said: i agree. i told him that if nothing more exciting turned up i would... and thus i have. thanks! cardinal brick, on jul 21 2008, 02:55 am, said: excellent review, it's a great set, i really love the look of the little ship. would it be possible to get some walking pictures of the walker? thanks! and sure. i shall have them up tonight. holodoc, on jul 21 2008, 03:08 am, said: wooha! i thought i never would see a nice mars mission set, but this walker ist the best proof i was wrong. it really looks good and i love the bricks used to make the shape. the airtank is cool and for once i have to say even the stickers are looking good. man, did i really say that? normally i hate stickers. nice review (some pictures would have gotten better with macro on, but as it seems to be time to forgive i wont point on that any longer) thank you very much vbbn! thanks! and i keep forgetting to put on macro... i really need to. gloriusshadow, on jul 21 2008, 05:48 am, said: holy brick! i just love the water tank and those legs are soooo cool! i dont think i have enough cash to buy after the star wars release...yikes...! thanks vbbn,for a super review! welcome! few things: build time: 3.0 hours and my favorite stickers of the set...

1 i thoroughly enjoyed your review metalandi, thank you especially for taking photos of all the contraptions and detailing exactly how they work. as a member of classic-castle, the census always seemed to be that fright knights were a class 4/10 or 6/10 but as sandy stated above, it is one of the closest you can get to an evil faction. by today's standards, the contraptions seen here are much much more sophisticated and well thought out and are definitely missing in 2007's king's castle siege. i enjoy the design of this castle much more even if the towers are taller simply because the design in the king's castle siege left builders with an empty space right in the courtyard without even a base plate! and it's nearly impossible to get your hands in and play in the enclosed space (why would anyone unless you're simply posing figs, and even that was difficult). this castle instead, had a variety of trap doors and surprises, so despite the varied colors used here, it's not that hard to realize that the designers for this castle really took time to think things out and tried to make the castle enjoyable for the children that will play with it whereas our 2007 castle was strictly built to give kids the impression of an enormous magnificant castle with little to nothing inside. it's like comparing beauty (2007) to brains (this castle). edited by legobear, 20 july 2008 - 01:32 am.

0 metalandi, on jul 20 2008, 12:23 pm, said: i actually got one set left i would like to review, but i'm off tomorrow to italy until thursday, so i won't be able to do it until then. you won't be off 'till tomorrow. that's still a day away! there's still time! no, but still, i'll be looking forward to the review when you get back! ~peace

1 i have this set, and ilike it! 6097 have many usefull parts! greate review!

0 metalandi, thanks for doing this fright knights review, by opening up a misb set which you have bought recently. i am very sure the feeling is very nice, especially touching the bricks which is preserved for 11 years sealed in bags. i am quite fond of the fright knights theme. unfortunately, this theme was released during my dark age. i never really bought sets from fright knights. instead, i bought plenty of minifigs to build an army. if i could turn back time or find another misb set with a reasonable price, i am very sure i will get it. my soldiers need a castle to stay in. i will be looking forward to your next review. keep up the good job

1 wow, what a cool castle and set in general! i had no idea that this set existed (long dark ages) thanks to you metalandi for such a great review! the figures look really nice and the set is full of lots of little trinkets , details, traps etc! i have already had a look on ebay for this set. looks like a great set for parts too. i give the review 4.5/5 evil witches. cheers isc

1 my first post in this topic looks foolish now that i bought this set from ebay. i just really wanted the minifigs (although i already had the batlord and the black dragon) and the parts. they will help me greatly in building the impenetrable fortress of the dragonwarriors for my princess quest comic. by the end of this week, this set will be in my clutches!

1 quite the topic bump, but dang, what a cool set, and so tall. this is the kind of sets i had as a kid, but i don't remember this one. i'm jealous.s

1 great review again it's nice to see old sets reviewed. i love the control stickers there's a great level of detail this is really the second best fire station in my opinion.

1 i am a proud owner of this set this is one of the best fire stations ever. what amazes me is what the designers made with only 368 pieces. you get a very nice looking building in good size, a good baseplate, 2 cars, 4 minifigs, accessories... and great alternative ideas in the back of the box (like the fire boat or helicopter). this is a great example of lego design.

1 thanks everyone for the comments. it's great to see that you enjoy these classic reviews, esp. this set. panda9001100, on jul 20 2008, 03:10 pm, said: i made a little modification: excellent! you've also got some other very nice sets there, like that awesome monorail! you should share a review. rupi, on jul 20 2008, 04:25 pm, said: i am a proud owner of this set it's great to hear that some of you have this classic fire station. it really is a nice set with great vehicles and accessories. i also think the overall design is excellent.

0 i honestly glad i got the latest fire station [cant remember set number] its waayyy better i voted 3 its realy not that great but its ok.....

0 thebrickster, thank you so much for all these reviews of classic town sets!! omfg, this set was released in 1982 and i was born 1 year earlier, hehe :) nice little heli!

-1 a nice little model with some neat features for it's age plus the all-yime classic fireman as a bonus. however, this design of chopper (the police station around the same time was the same design) i think dated very quickly. while is was good to use the hinged car roof - which was relatively new at the time - together with the inverted screen it was superceded very quickly by designs that stood the test of time far better (for example 6657). also, i don't think i could everbuy a lego fire helicopter because it is not something we have in the uk/eire. police, coast guard, ambulance, military, etc, etc but no fire helicopters. not something i would therefore want in my lego town. great review though. many thanks again for doing these. cheers rog

1 i vote outstanding because it makes excellent use of the pieces that were available at the time. that cockpit makes excellent use of an inverted windshield.

0 thanks for another great review. i can remember the 6358 very vividly. my parents bought the 6340 for me and a girl friend got the 6358. i'm quiet sure it's my envy because until now i want to believe that the 6340 is better. my reasons were these: i own the 6340 (and on the instructions of the 6358 stood "legoland" which i thought of as old.) but this review induced me to get over this humiliation from my childhood ( ) and check ebay for the 6358. edited by bernddasbrot, 21 july 2008 - 04:07 pm.

0 a great review, i like this set it captures the classic town feeling well, and the ladder is cool! i can't help but feel thought that these reviews are being churned out to quickly, you should leave a gap, i am being flooded with all these great reviews!

0 nice reveiw it looks like a great set i think i know what i will do tonight- rebuild my lego fire department it has- [fire pickup truck, fire truck [from 2005 sorry cant remember set number] and the most recent fire station if i can find all the pieces......

0 nice review, whitefang, with lots of photos - exactly as a good review should be! as for the set - i own it and it's a very good one! the fire squad vehicle is a nice addition to my other fire dept. vehicles. it offers very good playability and this ladder is so long! you can have so much fun with it.

1 that's a great review/poll, whitefang! i gave this set a 5: it's simply ! the only thing which i miss are the respirators for the firemen since they already own air tanks. but otherwise this set is brilliant! i like it much more than the new one from 2007 since it's not that big and juniorized. klaus-dieter

1 great set. i found only one major fail - this - the hands of robot arms gets easly broken.

0 quote i am not against with the newer sets. it just that, part of the reasons which reflected in the review had fufill the basic key factors of a typical fire engine. in addition, it was my all-time favourite under the "fire-fighting" theme. yes, i agree! this set is wonderful even today, and is one of the best fire kits ever release. and actually, realistic scale is not really a necessity in lego - it's just my personal taste. for example, i've never liked the tiny planes in the old airports that much, but i can see why a lot of people like them better than the new ones. edited by grevious, 28 july 2008 - 03:17 pm.

1 one of my all time favourite i still love it even after all these years, though it did always seem a bit out of place as when i was a child id never seen a similar looking fire appliance in the uk.

0 nice pictures, but three questions: 1. how many pages do the instruction books have? 2. what are the spare parts? or: does this laaty come with two clone-commander-equipment sets and four assaij ventress lightsaberhilts? 3. where did you get it? 4. how much did it cost?

-1 i just got this set sunday, and it's so huge that i can't put it anywhere. it is pretty sturdy and heavy, that's where the handle comes in. i'm pissed that you only get 2 clones. rex has to fight on the ground while you need more clones to man the guns/cockpit. the legs were the most annoying and time consuming part of the build. and yea i agree, that if tlg had made numbered bags, it would have taken only 2 hours rather than 4. edited by ih master 13uilder17, 14 october 2008 - 11:38 pm.

1 i bought this a few weeks ago and absolutely loved making it. it's amazing how the paneling comes together to make such a tight fit, but can easily open up. the legs could have been a bit more poseable, and the guns don't launch easily unless you push hard and fast. i'd like the firing mechanism to launch more smoothly. but it looks absolutely amazing. about price, it was 13,000 where i am, but i'm used to lego being expensive in japan, so it was good value.

-1 probably my most wanted set(rgs is too much), but this seems a 'lil overpriced, i mean $90 for a skeleton? ii'll wait fr it to go on sale(which i doubt it will)

0 sorry for reanimating this topic. there is a technic brick in the mid section of this set. does anyone know the function of that ??

0 thank you that was what i guessed :) but i didn't see any detailed pictures of 10195, do we have the instructins or something now? is that how dropship lifts the walker ?

1 cagri, on mar 11 2009, 12:03 am, said: exactly kim, that's what i meant. i pondered and wondered that for a long time :) i decided to ask here when a friend wondered the same thing. i hope it fits with the new droship. it would be really cool. and it's also great that tlg knows what they'll be prodcuing a year later.. it does. the description of the new 10195 dropship and at-ot states that the at-te can be carried too. they've planned this for quite a while.

0 yeah, when i built it, i wondered for a long time. i considered many possiblities temporarily, like either tlc had gone crazy or i had missed a page in the instructions.

1 7676: republic attack gunship number of pieces: 1034 number of minifigs: 5 price: 119.99 usd brickset hey everyone, i just got the rgs yesterday at tru after i came home from camp. i saw all of the topics that i missed, and noticed a mini-review and a review with one pic, so i thought i'd make a huge, shiny new review that has lots of pictures and all of the requirements of kimt's index. note: i did not apply any stickers to it, as a personal liking. so, lets start by looking at the box: a shiny, clean, and futuristic box, quite different from the other star wars box designs before this. there was so much clone wars merchandise with this font and design in the huge display at the front of my local toys r us store, and not just lego. it so beautiful, with the white and sky blue... anyways, for some reason, the boxes of the new clone wars sets seemed more shiny than usual. maybe it's because they were just shipped, but once you pick up the boxes, they will feel really good in your hands, despite the fact that only about half of the space in the boxes are used... the back of the box: the back shows all of the main features of the set, plus pictures of the three other clone wars sets meant to be released alongside this one (although i did spot the twilight and homing spider droid, which were supposed to be released in september or october). so, on to the gunship: built straight from the bags. it took me about 4 1/2 hours, with breaks. it has an overall great design, but somewhat fragile, especially when building it. the cockpits always fall apart when opened, as well as the bubbles on the wings (which i will get into more later). the color scheme is very well done. you can always find the piece you're looking for thanks to the color diversity: red, dark red, lime green (ooh!), blue, black, tan, light bley, dark grey, yellow and white. also, split down the middle vertically, the ship is almost all symmetrical. front: side: now, lets start with the many features that this set is hiding. the front has lots of lime green, a rare color. but more importantly: ...a rotating gun is found on each side. they rotate in a pretty wide range, although fragile. cockpits: there are two main cockpits, right next to each other. not very detailed, and are the same. and for some reason, the whole cockpit element flips up to reveal: ...nothing. just the skeleton of the ship. probe droid storage: above the cockpit lies a plate that can be flipped up to reveal a storage area that holds: two of these probe droids. at least, that's what i think they are. hull: in this pic, two features are hidden. mobile command center: the first of the two is a mobile command center, but essentially just a hover chair. it is found by flipping up the two panels on either side of the hull. bacta tank: the second is the bacta tank found by just sliding it out of the storage area behind the mcc. one half of the tank opens: ...so a minifigure can go inside and heal his/her wounds obtained in battle. cargo hold: now, this is probably the main feature for this set. the two sliding doors (two on each side) slide open thanks to a clever technic mechanism. not much in here, just a gun holder and a place where the passengers wait to be dropped off in battle. speeder bike: i guess you guys saw it, the speeder bike. it is found by opening the rear flap. the bike is very cleverly designed by using a brown trike body. it's only a few centimeters shorter than the bike found in the clone battle pack. rear gun: just a gun similar to the front ones. engines: huge engines (or are they cannons?) that are really fun to build. they really give that cartoon feel to this set. missiles: in between the engines are two sets of four flick-fire missiles. bubble cockpits: there is one bubble cockpit on each wing that supposedly control the turrets at the front. very fragile. storage containers: two storage containers on each side hold the clone accessories. but, i wouldn't recommend putting them in there, because the antennae can fall out, or you might forget about them. sticker sheet: the dreaded sticker sheet (dss) has all of the stickers you need for this set. unfortunately, mine was crunched up. i don't like stickers much anyways, but i might still apply some. note the republic symbol stickers, why couldn't tlg just use that printed piece from a few years back? also, you get to choose between a bird-rat thing or a sleeping twi'elk as your hull decal. what they're for, i don't know, looks like the movie or show will explain it though. minifigs: finally, the five minifigs of this set. they are all great figs, including: commander cody: amazing, especially with the gear. the orange is nice, but i thought he was yellow. clone trooper: again, amazing. the gear is great, and the new helmet and torso are great! all of the clones in the clone wars line have the same heads. also, you can see the flesh beneath the helmet. asaaj ventress: not so happy about this one. the torso and dark blue legs are cool, but the dress is pretty ugly. the head is alright, but could do without the cartoon-y face (yeah i know, its from a cartoon). also has purple markings on back of head. obi-wan kenobi: pretty cool, besides the face. cool hair and torso, though. plo koon: beautiful! the true gem of this set, in my opinion. the head is the same material as kit fisto's. and the tosro is awesome, good for making a custom ki-adi mundi. well, that's about it, here is the... final verdict: build: 8/10, very fun and easy, should take the seasoned builder about 4 hours. somewhat fragile. playability: 9.5/10, lots of fun features, although some can break easily. swooshability: 3/10, i wouldn't recommend flying it around much, as you can barely pick it up safely. but with two hands gripping the bottom firmly, it can be moved around, but not spun or swooshed, etc. minifigs: 8/10, all very great figs, especially plo koon, but could have included more clone troopers. design: 7.5/10, some excellent ideas included in here, although some spots are very fragile. price: 7/10: should have been only 100 usd if not for the new molds. plus, at tru, it was 130 usd. overall score: 8.5/10, a great set to have for your star wars/ clone wars collection, with some flaws. save up for this one. so, how did you like my review? your feedback is much appreciated! jimbutcher, out. edited by jimbutcher, 15 september 2008 - 03:06 am. indexed

0 what's this thing on the clone at right ??

1 thanks for the review jimbutcher . i really like this new gunship but i cant own one until like two or three months and this is with all the clone wars sets .

0 thanks for all the feedback so far, guys! i meant yellow for cody's color.

1 i got this set in the spring during my "buy every new castle set available"-season. granted, i couldn't afford all of them, but i do have most of them now. anyway, i love the action elements to this set, and the siege tower really does look wicked. i'd like to attach the crownie tower to the king's castle to see how it fits, but i unfortunately don't own that set (yet). i also love the turning head of the soldier, and i've used it in my princess quest-comic as well, along with the turning head of the princess. the troll leader brings good variety to the army of trolls, but they still could use another face type and more torso options. it's a nice review, in any case, although the set pretty much speaks for itself.

1 very nice review pedro! you beat me to it. there was a review done about january, but i wanted to have a go, just haven't opened the box yet..... great pics and well demonstrated action elements too. i rate this as one of the coolest castle sets just for its playability and 5 figures. this will def add to my orc army, and i may purchase more of this set if they dont release a orc bp. keep up the good work!

0 i scream clone, on jul 29 2008, 06:39 pm, said: i dont suppose you have seen the troll impulse in aus yet? nah, got it in singapore when i was on a business trip, got like 10 of the things now. they're 6.50 sing

1 when i first saw this topic, i thought, "oh, great, another review of this set..." however i'm glad you posted it now, your pics are great and, well, it was just a generally good review! i'm looking forward to seeing more... ~peace

1 thanks for the review! from this set, i prefer the crown knight's tower - it's a very good-looking structure!

1 i have one of these and must say that this is the best castle set in the theme, and the most useful parts pack for its size yet.

1 nice short review, although a little hard to read. i agree that this set is a really great one.

1 i really liked this set, it's cheap and comes with a good supply of flesh heads and the new hair mold. i love the tent too. i'd give it a 10/10.

1 a great price point for a nice bunch of figs and accesories. pity about the fleshies though... god bless, nathan

1 fleshies sometimes come in handy. great review and good set, but as said by other: another russian soldier (or two) would be fine, tlc is being a bit too much of a cheapskate regarding minifigs lately.

1 good review. this is my second ij kit that i got and i think it is a great deal. only 10$ and get 3 figs and great parts to use. i may pick up 2 more so i have penty of ants and other goodies that this comes with.

0 hello again! wow, this really is an in depth review! at first when i pictures of the set i thought... "yeah, kinda boring." but after reading your review, i think i might buy it (when it's cheaper). the pieces look very good, and i love the droids and their accesories! thanks for the review! also, awesomestar, i knwo it is a default thingy but it would be good if the quote was taken out of your post as it does clutter up the topic (or "yopic" as dsr calls it).

0 awesomestar, on jul 29 2008, 01:07 pm, said: well sor-ree! alright, i'll remember next time. it was just irritating to have to scroll through the same pics for a while, that's all. besides, it's gone now! dsr also, front paged! i can't believe it!

1 that was an intresting race and i was split between the two until i saw whitefang`s reply and the fact you can use the sprinter as a militery thing(which you could do for both but sprinter just pulls it off better) and i like the radar on the back of it so i`ll have to go with the street sprinter. thanks for the nice topic brickster

1 i've got to go with the town one, since you have to stand on the dino one. steve

1 i vote for the dino quadbike, definately! i wish i had that but i'll have to make do with the much less violent european version (dino '2010' not 'attack') here's a comaprison... european version: usa etc. version: there's a subtle difference, but i prefer the us one as for the coast guard quad, i think it's ok but not as good as the new one.

1 price: 569 kr minifigs: 2 pieces: 592 stickers: 9 (my sticker sheet wasnt curled up) overview: before i start i will apologize for the bad quality of the pictures. it is getting dark here right now, so some of the pictures are a bit dark. 1) minifigs: the set comes with two of the new clone wars clone troopers, which in my opinion are pretty cool. it also comes with two short blasters and a bag of clone accessories. figs with helmets: figs without helmets: 2) the tank: this thing is huge (25cm long and 22cm wide), and far oversized in my opinion, but looks great nonetheless. i very much like the white and dark red color scheme, mixed with a bit of lime green (even though there is no lime green bricks ;) ). left side: right side: back side: both of the wings contain a hidden compartment to store the blasters and a part that rotates to reveal three flickfire missiles. the front opens up as well to reveal the engine. the side guns and the gun on the top rotate. inside the cockpit is space for two figs; one seated in front of two computer screens and one placed in a moveable seat, which moves up and down, allowing the fig to pop up the top hatch and staying hidden while the hatch is closed. this function is triggered by opening the backdoor. hidden compartment and missiles: engine: top hatch (open/closed): interior: 3) rating: build: 9/10 not much to say here. minifigs: 7/10 an extra fig or two would have been great; eventually a jedi or a commando. design: 8/10 this only looses a couple of points for being oversized, but its a great looking model. parts: 10/10 at 592 parts, this is one of the cw sets with the best parts/price ratio. price: 8/10 sure this thing is great, but i think its overpriced at 569 kr. (approx. $120). when build it feels more like a 450 kr. set. final verdict: 9/10 despite some flaws this thing is definitely recommended, and it looks great on your shelf, too ;)

-1 finally a review of this, thanks! 120 bucks? this tank looks tiny and though it's amazingly detailed it should have been smaller and only 40/50 bucks at most. it just doesn't play that big a part man. good pieces and mechanisms but no one's going to both buying a 120 buck tank, no offence, not unless it it's the at-te.

1 thanks for the review, christian, i was hoping for one soon . this set really looks good, but as you said, rather big. the figs are good, and i agree that ki-adi mundi should be included. i like the hidden compartments for the blasters and missiles, and the cockpit is really cool, considering it seats two (i thought only one). i will surely pick this up sometime.

1 nice review, thanks for taking the time to share your thoughts. looks like a really nice set and i'll be picking it up eventually when it makes it to the us.

0 do you have any pics of the wheels? i wanna see what those are like.

-1 thank you for the first ever review of the fighter tank. i like this set and every features it offers. but i think that the engine could have a better look than just four green cylinders in a grey piece.

1 this and the at-te and the spider tank and maybe the droid gunship are the few clone wars sets i'll buy. i loved playing as this tank in the clone wars video game( even better with cheat codes for extra missile spam ), so this is a must get.

-1 thanks for posting the review, ive been wondering about this set. to me it does feel a bit fig light, for 50 id expect maybe one or two more clones. im not to sure about the oversized issue, it seems to me its better to have something a bit to large and have a better level or features than something smaller will less.

0 this set costs a s$100 in singapore.i went to hng kong too see lego and the shops there are more expensive by a few dollars.however,i went to australia before and everything there is the same price but when there is a sale it becomes very cheap!anyway, thanks for the review!i was wondering about the details of this set.the clone's faces look a lot like anakin's face.why is that so?i thought it is supposed to look like jango's?

1 im definatly gonna get the atte. im thinking about getting the spider droid and fighter tank. i alredy own the older version of the republic gunship (but i still want it) agentrick57, on aug 1 2008, 08:44 pm, said: i loved playing as this tank in the clone wars video game( even better with cheat codes for extra missile spam ) sorry to get off topic... but i own that game! i liked playing as the republic gunship the best!

0 i wish they made more sets with those colored droids as well. we should have got them with the hailfire droid and dwarf spider set i think. i also just noticed look the ball turret on the manual there's no markings on it.

0 thanks for the review. i love these affordable little sets. not so affordable now because of the cool figs but i'm going to have a look on ebay and bricklink right now just in case! an army of tan red droids would look great. maybe we'll see some if geonosia appears in the new seires somehow unlikely since the confederacy was defeated at the battle of geonosis. i wish i could have bought this set when it came out but i'd just left university so i was super skint and had to miss all the ep.ii sets now they all cost loads even in used condition. at least now there has been a re-design of the gunship and at-te from the clone wars series that i can buy.

1 thanks for the review skipper. this is one of my favourite sets. i really like the colour scheme and the geonosians are awesome. keep up the good work kimt

1 i always thought this looked liek a cool set, with lots of nice (and sadly unique) pieces. unfortunately the only attack of the clones sets i got were the jedi starfighter and yoda vs dooku. amazing sets, but i would love to have owned them all. i'd never really looked into this set very much, so thanks for the review!

1 this is actually one of my favorite star wars sets. awesome rare pieces, and excellent construction. geo figs are a plus too. best of all, it's nice and cheap.

1 good review! i really liked the detailed geonosians, and i hope theyre in a later set so i can get more. knowing lego they'll release a huge arena playset with a few geos and sand red droids so people will buy the set just for them. jifel

1 great review! really shows off the main aspects of the set. wish i had picked up a tie when they were around... dsr

1 tiny turbos are good for parts, but i'm not so keen on them as they have no minifig drivers. so, i wasn't sure about this set. but your review has made me like them more, i probably won't buy the set but i appreciate it more. thanks for the review!

1 thanks for the review! i have quite a few tts.(tiny turbos). i never got this one, but if it's on sale....

1 thanks for the review. this is another good sw set. a true classic. i especially like the colourscheme of this set. the rebel gun is crappy though, but overall the set rocks. kimt

1 skipper, thanks for doing up all these sw reviews. it certainly had given me some valuable insights on these sets especially on the snowspeeder. it kind of making me regret to pass off this set. however, i had bought the hoth base instead but had never built it. i am just wondering if the snowspeeder had any difference? keep up the good work and always strive your best to make each upcoming review a better one.

0 there isn't much difference apart form it has stickers on and is grey. also the guns and tow cable gun are different as well as the engines. but if you look at pictures of the hoth base speeder not to much is noticeable.

1 great review! i bought this set when it came out but sold it a couple years later for some extra cash. i have no regrets selling this one, as i was never really impressed with it (different story for the 4483 at-at - oh how i wish i still had that one). the snowspeeder was alright, just didn't have any sort of "wow" factor to it. the best part of the set is probably the rebel trooper. looking at the last photo in your review, looks like you're about to have a major battle in your hallway. apart from the snowspeeder & motorized at-at, i see the arc-170 fighter, grievous's starfighter, and is that a podracer i see -- and what is the set with the treads? it's not star wars, but looks like a pretty cool set (maybe a mission mars vehicle).

0 skipper 24, on aug 4 2008, 12:52 pm, said: podracer not sure where you got that from (i didn't have them out)? i noticed the minifig between the grievous starfighter & the mod-dino2010 vehicle and it looked like a little person sitting in the pod of his podracer. guess my eyes are playing tricks on me -- my eyesight is shot & my wife keeps pushing me to go visit the optometrist.

0 skipper 24, on aug 3 2008, 11:09 pm, said: the minifgs on the box top. they spelt dack's name wrong good set though.

1 thanks for the rewiev! a nice set indeed, to bad i dint buy it when it still was in the stores.

1 you have to love the originals, well i didn't like the very first snowspeeder so this is the original to me. i like it more then the new one that comes with the echo base, beter color scheme and more realistic i think. i got this set in stores and still love it to this day =]

1 good review, i like it a lot. nice job

1 this is one of my favorite sw sets. it is a good size to the hoth base and the at_at.

0 7255 general greivous wheel bike chase review parts: 111 figs: 2 price: 10.00 the first set to include gg. 1. general set and minifigs (not manual because i don't have it) the contents of the box after being built. both minifigs. the set includes 5 lightsabers! my own design gg. gg's cape on the outside. gg's cape on the inside. 2. the wheel bike front view standing on legs. side view. gg can't hold the controls because of his arms. roller mode. the legs are a bit to chunky so to roll it has to be tilted forward. 3. boga the lizard. grey tip to the tail. the front back and saddle split in to three sections. 4. overall build: 4/10 there isn't really much to build. minifigs: 9/10 it comes with gg with the special cape and obi-wan in rots gear which is hard to find i think. design: 5/10 not really to scale but otherwise okay apart from boga which just looks like any old dinosaur. also the controls on the wheel bike aren't really right. parts: 6/10 comes with some dark green bricks and lots of rods ( the guns on the wheel bike) the boga feet are also nice. price: 8/10 10 for 2 figs isn't bad it could have a few more parts though. playability: 10/10 you can easily recreate the movie scenes with this set. overall 7/10 it would be better if the bike and boga were more to scale and more accurate as well as the set having more parts.

0 i had this set (15 rrp actually ;-)) and agree mostly with your review, although on the wheel bike itself two legs can be placed at the front end and two at the back to enable it to 'roll' properly. boga is very juniorised, and the set itself is very simple and contains many large pieces. the minifigures are good though (i traded my gg however ). just to offer my personal thoughts; build: 5/10 minifigs: 10/10 parts: 3/10 price: 7/10 playability: 10/10 overall 7/10 -- (not an average) tk

0 my brother had this set, and i think it isn't the best set, but great minifigs. could use a star corps clone or 2 from the bp.

0 i never got the original boba fett's slave 1. i wish they would make one to scale with the minifigures. i would be so cool. i am also putting up a review of the clone turbo tank probably tomorrow. it is a different variation to the one in the index. edited by skipper 24, 03 august 2008 - 07:12 pm.

0 thanks for the review. it looks like an interesting set, even if not as good as boba's. skipper 24, on aug 3 2008, 08:11 pm, said: i never got the original boba fett's slave 1. i wish they would make one to scale with the minifigures. i would be so cool. you mean it would be so cool? i agree that it would be, if they made a large minifig scale version like with the ucs millenium falcon. i would probably try to buy that. edited by shoc, 03 august 2008 - 08:31 pm.

0 very good review! i have he newest slave i and i like it more than this one. dsr

0 good review. i always wanted to know how it was different to the boba fett slave i. i would probably only get this though for jango fett. the newer one looks sturdier and proportioned better imo.

0 i can prodly say i own this little bugger. it's not much, but it is a nice addition to the series. they are also easy to build, so you can get a rally going quite fast. stauder.

0 did your version without the lul mace have trans blue grill things (like the ones on the back of the speeder) ? or was my set a one off.

0 hanks for the price. i got the set a while ago and couldn't remember correctly i have now changed it.

0 skipper 24, on aug 4 2008, 04:04 pm, said: did your version without the lul mace have trans blue grill things (like the ones on the back of the speeder) ? or was my set a one off. i bought mine online, thinking it was the new version but i ended up with that very lame lul fig. i just hate that fig... it's completely useless, we can't use any part of it for anything (although, i only discovered yesterday that the lightsaber blade was a standard one and not glued, as i always believed, so all isn't completely lost) in the end i still was rather disappointed by the set. it's too full of holes ( hum; i think there's kind of a paradox in that sentence...)... but the barc speeder and green clone are indeed fantastic. oh, and yes, mine came with sand blue grill parts instead of the trans-yellow ones... didn't realise it at first, and i spent half an hour cursing, thinking they forgot to put them in the box. but in the end, i don't know if the replacements are any better , since they're supposed to represent some kind of thruster light or something... all in all, i think it's my worst set... not necessarily for the set itself which is ok, but psychologically, there's too many things that went wrong with it...

1 the kid, on aug 4 2008, 08:20 am, said: i got the original version of this set with the luls mace windu figure. when tlc released the non-luls version i managed to swap - they sent me the new version (and a clone trooper iirc) and i mailed them back the old version. this was a great set; the suspension worked great and it rolled magnificently. nice review with good photos, but again your price is a little off: 69.99 is the rrp (unless the price you paid was 80). tk that was a great idea. i never even thought to send it back and get the new one with the other clone and the non lul windu.

-1 i voted below average since i'm not a very big fan of classic space.

1 7674 v-19 torrent number of pieces: 471 number of minifigs: 1 price: 49.99 the v-19 torrent starfighter was an assault fighter with exceptional speed and maneuverability used by the galactic republic during the clone wars.it was a predecessor of the alpha-3 nimbus-class v-wing starfighter, in terms of purpose and usage. it first appeared in the genndy tartakovsky?s clone wars 2d series. basics box front: the box art shows the torrent flying above tatooine, with the new blue and white ?clone wars?? style packaging, box back: the back shows some of the features of the set including the lifting mechanism and adverts for 7679 republic gunship, 7675 at-te and the 7673 magnaguard starfighter inside the box, there are 2 instruction books, a very small dss and 9 bags that are not numbered. bags: instruction books random manual shot parts list book one is mainly the construction of the body and one of the engines, book 2 is the other engine and the wings. for better pics of the manual look on lego's website. sticker sheet: a very small sticker sheet is included, which includes 2 republic insignias and a nose sticker. minifigure one minifigure is included, a clone pilot. the whole "omg only one minifigure in this set" and "its not movie accurate, i hate you tlc!!!11one2" has been beaten to death, so please don't make this review turn into that and to be honest i don't care because its an awesome figure. tlc have made the effort to print the life support device onto the chest plate so props to them. he has the "clone head" like the rest of the clones have in the cw releases, there are no extra clone bits apart from a long blaster, that's not included here. interesting/other pieces printed piece! rare/unusual pieces: there are 2 pistons included, as well as 2 weird looking technic pieces that serve as the landing gear during the build. which might explain why the set is quite expensive, it musn't have been cheap to manufacture them. the build it starts off relatively simple, the first 16 steps is getting the basic shape of the cockpit and the mechanism to make the middle wing move up and down. after that the next few steps are getting the landing gear/wing folding device done, it's actually the same thing so when the wings move into attack mode the landing gear retracts. this is then locked into place by the white beams that form the basic shape of the fuselage. up to step 46 is the fuselage, as well as fitting the hydraulics. this is what it looks like when the fuselage is complete. the cockpit is not "air tight", there's is quite a big gap top: bottom: the final few steps of book 1 is the construction of one of the engines, here it is attatched : the yellow bar is not permanent, its used to keep the white bit at the top from moving downwards. the steps are repeated in the second book so that both engines are now in on to the wings! first one attatched, the middle one is attached now: and finally the last one: it is now finished! the pieces that are left: so, you're probably wondering, how does it enter attack mode? well can you see this bar? push that bar to the center, and pick it up, the hydraulics move the central wing downwards as well as the side wings to enter attack mode: the outer wings have flickfire missiles on them, they obviously don't work, but it increases the playability of the set. the cockpit opens in a similar way to general grevious's starfighter released last year, using a sliding mechanism for other pics see here : http://s25.photobuck...eview/?start=20 and i'll be taking other requests for pics, maybe a video of it switching between modes. build: 7/10 very symmetrical build, the mechanism to move the wings might annoy some people. minifigs: 5/10 1 fig in a 50 set, however it is a starfighter design: 9/10 very accurate to the source material, lego have really made the effort to make the movement feature work. parts: 8/10 lots of technic, white and dark red pieces price: 7/10 could be slightly cheaper, playability: 6.5/10 need to buy some enemy sets to get the most of it, flick fires don't work. comments, requests, questions and criticisms welcome. edited by kimt, 04 august 2008 - 06:48 pm. indexed and poll added

0 the printed part isn't new it came with 10178 motorized at-at walker. also nice review, i would get the set if it was a little cheaper or came with more than 1 fig. whyhas it got 2 instruction books the set isn't particularly big?

0 actually we should care that there's only one fig in it since it's kind of expensive (though that's my opinion) , but the ship is really awesome . it's too bad there's not a battlepack that includes clone pilots. edited by bricklanta, 30 november 2008 - 06:15 am.

1 daxflame680, on nov 30 2008, 01:03 am, said: i built mine today. as soon as i tried to put it in attack position, the thingy rotates the wrong way and it falls apart. what a waste of $55 i suggest you to check again if you put the technic gear in the correct way cause if not than maybe that the problem . also, i don?t think it is a waste in my opinion, the ship is very well designed and is actually pretty strong (or at least mine ) and the pilot minifig is fantastic even if there is just one of them. edited by darkrebellion, 30 november 2008 - 03:17 am.

1 i love this set and i gave it "outstanding". i might note though that the cylinder is just there as a dampener; when disenegaged the wing function still works, just not as smoothly. interestingly though the cylinder is an old piece, (i have a few others) it's just that this is the first time it's been used without a spring... i had no problems assembling this set.

1 i remember to literally jump of joy when my grand-father offered it to me for christmas... it's an amazing set, the train is really beautiful and it comes with 11 (!) mfs, so can somebody ask for more?

1 oh ruben you lucky so and so this set is one of the most beautful i have ever seen! splendid looking build and 11 figures, all the same faces like but still you get that old woman pig-tail head piece which is just great! i thought you meant the monorail set when you told me about this but guess i was wrong (don't laugh i've been away from lego for quite some time) and for 80 euros it was a real bargain from a great friend! really nice review hope this sets brings you years of joy!

1 cool review. i actually have two of these. i got one for christmas when it was rereleased in 2003 and another one in a charity shop a few months later for 5. i love the minifigs even if they all have smileys, and having two sets of them can really fill up a town.

0 hairy ruben, on aug 5 2008, 12:00 am, said: the interior of the two however is laid out a bit differently. the space in the front carriage is occupied by a cockpit (or whatever it is called in trains) and some space to store your cable connecting the front lights with the engine. i can imagine it must get quite cramped and dangerous for the minifig driver with all the cabling. further back we have a quite random, weird looking engine. one part reminded me rather of a jet engine on a commercial airplane. the engine is accessible by means of the two side cargo doors. at the end of our first carriage we hit what looks like the train's restaurant, two tables and no chairs. there shouldn't be so much of the light cable in the front section or "cockpit." most of the cable should be in the central part of the train. then it is not so crowded for the engine driver. i have never had a problem with the cable and the space available for it. the only problem i had was that the cable had a loose contact after some time. when the train went into a curve (can't remember if it was a left or right curve) the light went off. i have now got the same problem with the cable that i put into my santa fe super chief. always when the engine turns into a right curve, the light goes off. my dad could repair the cable for the metroliner. even though he is quite skilled at repairing electronic things, he found it very difficult to repair since there were no screws to open the electronic plate. it annoyed him a lot. so i've been asking myself if i should really bother him with a second cable with the same problem. the train set itself is outstanding (and that's what i voted for). i only have the legend 10001, but it's 99% identical to 4558. i also have club car 4547. i don't have the legend club car 10002. the reason for this is i always had the choice between one big lego set or several small ones for christmas when i was a child. i always went for several small ones. metroliner 4558 would have been a big train set, but i really wanted a passenger car. so i bought 4547 with my savings without having the metroliner. i was quite happy when the metroliner was re-released. i bought it with my own money. then i could finally use the club car with the train it was created for. edited by legotrainfan, 15 august 2008 - 07:55 pm.

0 i don't like the set and i do like the set. the reason why i like it: it looks good. the reason why i hate it: this train was the first train for the new 9v system and it means to me the end of the beautiful 12v series. for this last reason i own this set. i voted average. only strange they named it metroliner. in holland when we speak of a metro, i need to think at short distance trains only used in big cities like rotterdam. and your minifigs at pic ain't right according the instruction .

1 my favourite, favourite, favourite old set. it's too bad i was born 2 years after its release, i would have had a major interest in classic town. i might actually get this one on bricklink... not that it'll go for a good price (i'll only buy if it does you see). an "outstanding", a highly useful and well-made set that really just stands out from its counterparts. edit: nevermind. edited by dovchenko, 16 august 2008 - 10:25 am.

1 super review, thanks. simply put, i'd have to admit this is one of the best indy sets. and in such a small package. it's a very detailed lil' jeep, and that's why i like it. i have this too, but i don't want to open it since it's exclusive. wait, i thought we were calling it "rown" and not "frown"

1 nice review! i would like to get this set... unfortunately i don't get brickmaster mag, and the prices on bl/ ebay will most likely be ridiculous. i wonder why indy doesn't come with his murse (man purse) in this set? thats the best part of the fig. the jeep itself is very nice, especially with the dark green. by the way, what is frown? brownish... something, i guess. oh yeah, and funny comic.

1 looks really nice, if they keep making bm sets like this, i might actually subscribe... nice comic too, remind me not to run into copmike and his gloveless hand...

1 surprisingly well designed set for lego overlords... i mean brickmasters!

1 6804 surface rover review set#: 6804 set name: surface rover released: 1984 pieces: 16 minifigs: 1 (white classic space minifig) brickshelf gallery peeron.com bricklink brickset.com introcomment: i have to keep my fondness for space going and since i'm no fan of the still "new" life on mars mars mission theme, i've decided to give you another review of a small classic space set. more to come in the following days. the box. unfortunately i haven't got the box for this set. but peeron.com was kindly enough to support me with a proper pic. and as usual this is a small easily brought home sized box. oddly tlg doesn't add the "flip" on top anymore. i remember standing in toystores, pulling 6 or more sets down from the hanger before accesing the one i wanted. it gave buying lego sets that threasure hunting touch. [snaps out of his daydreaming]... a small box with a picture of what you get. i've got no rear pic, so i can't tell if tlg did the same as on the 6701 set (split up the inventory). the fig: one single white classic space minifig. this is the worst one in my opinion. i never liked those white guys. and they get easily damaged by the sun. nah! give me a red or yellow instead (later blue or black). the surface rover: both i am the lucky owner of two of them. (yes this is a small showoff ) side though small, i still think this is a neat little set. compared to the modern "impulse" sets, this is high competable. i like the simplicity of the small classic space sets and this is no exception. the sr is made from very usable bricks, that can easily be used for making ship/base/craft mocs. rear as you can see, one of them has been used for surface exploration for many years. it could do with some replacements, but i haven't had the time, yet. the verdict: a fine little classic set. not much more than that. it holds some useful bricks and worked fine as an "impulse" back then. the classic children's birthday presents during the early 80's. i got quite a few space and town sets back then. remember to vote your opinion on this set. i gave it "average" for the bricks, the price (back then) and as an all in all conclusion. kimt

0 metalandi, on aug 5 2008, 08:56 pm, said: if you'd only know what memories you brought back! i think i remember this set better than any other i had, when i was a child. some time after i got it, i decided to disassemble it and combine it with the jeep from 6552 rocky river retreat. it came out pretty good, though. as it became the main attraction point of my town (beeing the car of my favourite minifig back then, and, and, and... looong story ), i kept it assembled that way from this day on until earlier this year, when i finally disassembled it because i needed the parts. great story. i enjoy hearing people reminisce about the fun they had with certain sets. i always wanted rocky river retreat but never picked it up. that's a great adventure set as well. i had never thought about mixing the two sets, but they do have components that would compliment one another nicely. if you still have the pieces, you should try restoring the sets - it's a lot of fun. simonwillems, on aug 6 2008, 04:37 am, said: this is by far my favourite outback series set! i loved the fact that you can bend the bridge in different directions so that the suspension of the car really worked to keep the car levelled, like you placed it in your last picture. i had lots of fun with this when it came out eleven years ago in 1997, the bridge scene could also be used in the adventurers serie of 1998. i think i may like the outback airstrip a little better, but it's close. i agree with you about the bridge. the moving pieces are a nice feature, and makes it harder for the jeep to cross. the bridge does make a nice addition to adventurers. i added it to my jungle adventure diorama a few months ago: stauder, on aug 6 2008, 05:27 am, said: i am kind of dissapointed they they didint continue the theme, as i only managed to grab 6487 and 6550 at leat you were able to pick up two of the sets. do you still have them and/or the pieces? bullet8542, on aug 6 2008, 09:57 am, said: why exactly did the outback, adventure etc. themes never quite catch on......just a thought. you're right - i don't remember them being very popular, yet they were really nice sets. perhaps they drifted too far from the "normal" town/city theme with fire and police stations? this would be a good thought for a future city/town sub-theme.

0 thebrickster, on aug 7 2008, 04:06 pm, said: at leat you were able to pick up two of the sets. do you still have them and/or the pieces? yes, i have the parts, the manuals, and even one of the boxes. unforutunaltey, the parts are mixed in a big pile of parts, as i never had any time to sort out my parts. you can see i used the yellow doors here, decals applied. the great thing about the copter was it had 2 suitcases, which as far as i can tell ain't a common part, not rare, but still nice to have. and it had the guy with the green jacket. the winch wasn't bad either, the only flaw was it was a "standard" lego copter, meaning similar ones where avalible in quite a few sets. do you plan to review it? staudie.

1 oh i loved this set when i was young! i think i got it for my birthday, and it was one of my favourite sets at the time. funnily enough, i was thinking about it the other day, and how i really should build it again... thanks for the nostalgic review.

1 here we are, my first clone wars set, and my first star wars review. here we have the wonderful droid gunship, one of the cheaper of the clone wars sets. this set is exclusive to wal-mart, and its one of the better exclusives out there (i'm looking at you, twilight ). first off we have a shot of the entire set with the box. a random page shot, along with pics of the parts list. the build is split up into three sections: the back, the cockpit, and the missles. the back has a lot of nice dark blue plates, and is the only part of the set which uses stickers. the bottoms shows various technic systems, which i'll get to later the cockpit has many details (mostly guns), and the rotating guns are a nice touch. the cockpit can fit a battle droid, but not a minifig. i'm not sure why a droid would want leather though the last part is loading this baby with the missles there are four black(small) and two dark bley (large) missles which are loaded in groups of three as sls. the middle mechanism is for the missiles, and the back part with the bionicle teeth are used ad landing gear the knob on top turns... to release the missiles on the clones ... leftover bits and the used ss(not so d this time around) the gunship versus a time traveling agent charge . overall build: 8/10 a basic build, but at some points repetitive. minifigs: 10/10 just your basic droids, you can't go wrong. design: 7/10 a basic design, with some interesting techniques. pieces: 9/10 a mix of old and new pieces, along with the return of this lovely piece which hasn't been seen for almost 10 years price: 8/10 $30 for a gunship? i'll take it! final verdict: 8/10 a great price for a small set like this, and it has a great bit of swooshability

1 nice review agentrick.$30 is a good price, but tlc think thats 40 so i'll have to pass. btw i thought this ship was supposed to hold many droids like in sw battlefront. oh well, its good for show. edited by skinny boy, 09 august 2008 - 09:31 pm.

1 so it comes with an extra gun-holding arm? it looks like it, and that's great. that way you can make all of the droids gun-totting ones.

1 emergency evac set #: 6445 theme: town res-q year released: 1998 piece count: 97 minifigs: 1 list price: $8 (usd) in 1998, lego introduced a new theme called res-q. the theme was really a quasi-coast guard sub-theme of classic town. the theme included boats, helicopters, emergency vehicles, and even a water hovercraft. most notable was the black and yellow color combination that predominated the sets. i only picked up a couple of sets from the theme including this emergency evacuation vehicle that i consider a van. i never got into the theme, but looking back at these sets, i have gained a better appreciation for their value in classic town. let's take a look at 6445 in greater detail. starting with the box: the back of the box providing a few alternate models: and similar imagery on the instructions: the set includes one small sheet of decals for the van: 6445 has one res-q minifig that i find pretty nice. i like the neon orange reflectors: he has a nice printed backside with the word res-q prominently displayed: this little set includes an abundance of tools: a black walkie-talkie is not pictured here's the emergency van: i like the back section that has a nice winch with turning wheel and a few hooks for tools: here's the minifig pulling the grappling hook for some res-q action. this is my favorite part of this set: the van isn't too fancy but has some neat features: while i like the blue windshield piece for maybe space sets, i'm not really fond of its use for the van: the van has no steering wheel, but rather two levers for steering: on the top of the vehicle are two emergency alarms and some extra lights: the back of the van has a large opening piece that allows wide access to the back section: it comfortably fits a long gurney/stretcher: here's the driver resting on the gurney: he should never have tried to pick up the gurney without a 2nd res-q minifig. and a shot of the back section without the gurney: lastly, a picture of the complete set: final thoughts res-q is really a neat theme that has great play value for kids. while it's not one of my more favorite town sub-themes, it does offer some nice pieces and an abundance of black and yellow pieces. i think a few of the res-q sets go nicely with the divers theme released one year earlier in 1997. i had a chance to purchase the largest set of the theme, 6479 emergency response center, at half the price, but passed back in the late 90s. i'd be interested in finding out what other eb members think of this set and the res-q theme.

0 thanks for the review pmj . i like the play value in this set even if i dont own it . the way the orbs are put into the rocket is awesome and i really like it, but at the end the set have some lack of detail .

0 another outstanding review by the "awesome set reviewer"! i enjoyed reading this review very much and i felt that you have redress twilight in an approriate manner. i have very mixed feeling about this set especially with its design. it seemed i will need to watch the clone wars movie in the theatre before i compared with it. most of the time, when this lego set is used in a movie, you will tend to compare it and what is the actual purpose for twilight, same as the rest of the sw vehicles and aircraft. for a high price like this, i can actually top up a little more and get the at-te, with the same batch of minifigs plus commander rex. if there is a special figure such as the v19 torrent (clone pliot), it will be a much ideal scenario. at the moment, i have not bring in any clone war sets into my collection, and i am quite sure twilight is not in my priority list especially when i am not a full-pledged star war collectors or i have strong intentions to complete the entire range in this recent release. therefore, i need to prioritise my purchase, and likely to get two rgs, since that is my favourite ship in clone war era. i am not comparing it with rgs. both sets defintely have their pros and cons. oh, i love that postcard you made. certainly looks very nice! svelte_corps, thanks for doing up this superb detailed review which had given "twilight" the neccessary attention it should have.

0 darkrebellion, on aug 12 2008, 12:17 pm, said: i like this ship even if it looks so bulky but i need to buy first other sets, so maybe this beast will be landing in my collection the next year (or this one if i am lucky ). i can just ask for something, can you post a pic of all your clone wars sets together with this one (all the sets in one pic, not many pics with this an each set ) please . i think a lot of people feel the same way - there was so much good stuff to get in the first wave that this is probably a backburner set for a lot of people, and some are probably waiting to see the movie to see how prominently it features. i will try and take a pic with some other cw sets, i don't have all of them though and some need to be reassembled as i built them on holiday and then had to pack them away i do think this line of sets has been the best sw lego wave released though. all of the recent releases have been amazing in their own way.

0 thank you svelte_corps for the review! i like the inside, nice and cosey! i also like your little garden! for me, this put the twilight different in a better perspective than my first perspective of the twilight. i voted outstanding. greets the-force!

0 seems like tlc has done a pretty accurate representation of the ship. the real fault for the ship's messy design has to go to lucasfilm, not tlc. my guess is lucasfilm is trying to recapture that "what a piece of junk!" magic of the millennium falcon. i guess we'll have to wait to see the movie to see if they succeeded or not. the idea of a "space mobile home" reminds me of the winnebago from "spaceballs." great review!! informative, entertaining, and opinionated. so many people shy away from stating an actual opinion in their review for fear of offending anyone. what's the point of making a review if you don't state what you think about it???

0 svelte_corps, on aug 12 2008, 02:19 am, said: hmm... dior. i can smell it now the ship doesn't look too swooshable (but, then again, more than the heavy rgs) i really like that review svelte corps! so much detail! unfortunately i would only get this if it was a very low price, like in a sale.

-1 thanks for yet another awesome review. quote seems like tlc has done a pretty accurate representation of the ship. the real fault for the ship's messy design has to go to lucasfilm, not tlc. my guess is lucasfilm is trying to recapture that "what a piece of junk!" magic of the millennium falcon. i guess we'll have to wait to see the movie to see if they succeeded or not. this sums up my opinion exactly. i can easily admit that the design of the kit is spot on - but unfortunately, the actual design of the ship in the new movie is garbage. actually, despite the millennium falcon's odd design, i really think it's a pretty appealing ship - and its really cool! i can't say the same for the twilight, though.

1 i think some people agree that this ship is better than when we first saw those pictures, at least i do. it looks like it has some nice accessories that come with the ship as well. my favorite of you custom things has got to be the octopus it's so funny and a great use for the headdress thing. great review. edited by skipper 24, 13 august 2008 - 11:24 am.

-1 dovchenko, on aug 13 2008, 12:29 pm, said: looks fine... but still that designs quite a downer. but look at that wing design! its lovely! looks exactly like the b-29 bombers wings look like.

-1 thanks for the review. i for one will get this set. i collect and therefore i need it. i vision something like this: a: i buy the set b: i built the set c: pics for my bs account d: set taken apart. sad, but true. it's not much, but super for parts. i agree (from what your review showed me) that this set is a little too much technic. a thing that's been invading our beloved brick built sets in the past years. i really have no need for a retractable front or functioning landing gear. what i need is a kick-ass ship with neat design and cool interior. the twilight does not offer that. "look at the size of that thing"

1 this is an awesome set in my opinion. i scraped my crossbows for mocing recently, but the set is still an amazing army builder. for the price for the sw battlepacks, which have 4 minifigs and a cheap vehicle, you get 4 knights ( this is 2 sets to equal the price of a bp ), 2 skellys and 2 skelly horses, plus 4 crossbows, 4 good wheels, and some other good dark blue and brown pieces for my ever expanding castle town. great buy.

0 i'm not a huge fan of this set but it is a great way to nab a fully mounted knight complete with a very attractive barding. given that in prior years it wasn't possible to get a barded horse in such a small set, this set is actually a decent way to build a mounted cavalry for your kingdom. looking at bricklink, it would probably cost as much to buy the knight, horse and weapons separately, and that doesn't take into account the skeleton or the extra bricks. despite my indifference to this set, i actually have purchased four of them in the past year simply because there isn't a cheaper way to acquire a mounted knight. (a quick question about the poll: are we voting on the quality of the set, or the quality of the review?) later. edited by blueandwhite, 13 august 2008 - 05:50 am.

0 tenorikuma, on aug 13 2008, 03:48 am, said: i should really get one more of these for the figures, shields, and weapons. this set is the only one with the scythe in pearl-grey, by the way. except, it's just plain dark-grey, you must have gotten this set mixed with another. though i've never heard of a pearl-grey scythe

0 perhaps he meant the pearl light grey lance, which is not that common.

1 first things first. the knight's helm does have a spot for a plume. now, i really like this set and it was the first one i dug into when i got my collection in the mail. it has a great selection of equipment for good or evil figures and the barding for the horse is outstanding. my only wish was for one of the long chrome swords for the knights. i think the new knights with the tall shield and chrome sword look excellent on foot and on horseback. it would definitely be neat to revisit this set with another human knight instead of the skeleton. make that change and add a lady to joust for and it'd be bang on.

1 indexed name: holiday villa theme: lego system / town year: 1988 pieces: 197 minifigs: 2 price: usd ? there were quite a few sets in the 1980's that weren't sold in the us. i remember reading once that it was because they contained wine glasses and tlg felt they wouldn't be able to market a toy that encourage the drinking of alcohol. this set was one of them. i remember seeing this in a catalog that came with a fabuland set and wondering what it was and where i could get one. i wrote to lego and got an overseas catalog which had the futuron 6990 monorail transport system in it before it was available in the us. i was amazed. i ended up buying 6349 holiday villa from that catalog but, for some reason, gave it to my best friend for his birthday. i've always wanted this set and finally bought it from bricklink this year.... my purchase included everything except the box. i really like the boxes. but, in lieu of a boxshot, here is the instruction manual: i imagine this was the image on the front of the box: the parts one of the things that appealed to me about this set is it's abundance of rare parts. this base plate is an excellent piece and was only available in two sets: classic lego telephone: technically, these blue windows 1 x 4 x 5 windows are only available in this set, according to bricklink. it was available in different form (with and without fixed glass, trans blue glass) in other sets. regardless this size and color window is rare and the blue door was only available in 4 sets. this was a huge selling point for me as i'm a window monkey. never heard that term? it's like a parts monkey (a collector who buys mulitples of sets just for parts or large lots of bulk from bl and sorts them into bins) but just for windows. tell your friends i coined the term: these sloped windows have endless possibilities in many themes (maybe not with the curtain decals applied) but are another great rare part that appears in this set: the build remember this piece? i'd like to see a badass agents car built on this car base! : i am a fan of the six-wide car but i see the appeal of the four wide. it has a very nostalgic feel to it: there's no denying that this is a beauty of classic lego 4-wide cars: this set comes with two mini-figures, one of which appears to be a painter. classic vintage lego figs: onto the house which begins with the basic floorplan: a kitchen that's open to the rest of the house and a little oven and hood vent is one of my favorite touches. it's one thing to throw an oven into a house set, but the designer of this set made it a cool part of the architecture of the house which gives it a unique feel: the completed first floor and carport: i do wish the sides of the roof were white with a little overhang like an actual roof. this method of white on bottom, red on top looks more like a child's drawing than a real house. this is easily fixed with some modifying. still, you get a lot of roof pieces in this set: here we have the completed set. the husband cleans the yard while the wife gets plastered on wine. don't tell the american kids! another angle: working in the kitchen: getting smashed before dinner. i think she may have a serious problem: the bedroom. a little stark, but the bed looks comfy: overall shot of the interior: rating playability: 9/10 (the possibilities are endless with drunky mcwine-wine and husband. really, playability is up to the imagination of the player. it's a house, not really very action-packed.) design: 9.5/10 (great design with plenty of rare parts. love the classic car, too! loses half a point for the all red roof...) price: na (i believe this was inexpensive, but since i have no proof, i will have to leave this factor out of the overall rating.) overall: 9.25/10 (classic sets like this all deserve 10s in my book, but looking at it with an objective eye it's excellent, but not perfect.)

1 this looks like a really great set! i wasn't around in '88 to get it but i like it! it actually has things inside the interior! thanks for the review. hinckley, on aug 13 2008, 06:11 pm, said: there were quite a few sets in the 1980's that weren't sold in the us. hooray!

1 nice set what a great find, this is one thing i think the tlg has forgotten about, the creator houses are nice but they are not really geared toward a town them (no mini figs, cars etc) these sets were and that adds so much to a town layout it can't be overlooked. i really like this i may have to start my ebay searching..... thanks hinckley

1 i just bought this! it's truly a wonderful set and i love the houses from that era as well. very charming. great review!

1 this is an awesome set, man... and a great review. just too bad it is so rare! i voted 5. by the way, does anyone know if there is a review for this? or other sets that come with a camper, perhaps? also, i was wondering if the creator houses are in scale and could be used with minifigs and such.

1 this would be great for any pirate fan, the extraback pack for the soldiers, some spare owes for the row boats, a female face for a wench, and a rather simple raft for that unlucky pirate lost at sea! over all a nice set, i am a little confused by the dynamite though... perhaps an easy way to go fishing or perhaps to clear a rock in the forseen future? or is it that she is just a suicide bomber attacking the white house water (joke not ment to be tasteless or offensive to those lost in the act of terrosim, greatest respect to those who have lost loved ones) great review, regards cpt. pb

0 cpt. pegleg blockbeard, on aug 14 2008, 03:29 pm, said: over all a nice set, i am a little confused by the dynamite though... perhaps an easy way to go fishing hilarious! i bet she threw out the penicillin and flare gun to make room for the axe and dynamite in her survival kit. who wouldn't? maybe she's a lost escapee.

1 good set, i laughed at the dynamite, but not as much as that axe... not many trees on the rapids. looks like she's got more than dynamite to cause havoc in the harbour...

0 water and lit dynamite isn't a good match.

1 thanks for this review thebrickster, i also have this set and think it's one of the best helicopters tlg made in the 90's. it's quite big and has got place for 2 minifigs in the cockpit. i also like the fact that there's a victim included in form of the x-treme diver, which also is a theme i always loved as a kid. do you have any other res-q sets left to review? it would be an honour for me to also do a review of one or more sets which are left, but unfortunately i got not much time at the moment.

0 cool, then i think i'll do a review of 6451 river response later today or tomorrow, stay tuned!

1 the helicopter looks nice and the resq minifigs were nice. the diver minifig had once been a personal favorite of mine.

1 a neat set with lots of accessories, but i never liked any of the lego helicopters with long streamlined canopies, as they are obviously more influenced by military helicopters and space ships, than by real civilian transport helicopters. i'd give it a 3 at best. very good and thourough pictorial review though!

1 this set was my first set ever from the resq series, and i loved it entirely! ofcourse i modded it slightly here and there after hours and hours of fun and excitement, it has great play value, even for a set in this size

1 6004 crossbow cart review because i may start collecting castle here is a review of one of my few castle sets. please note i hurriedly put his together meaning some parts are the wrong color, look out for them! this review will also be done in my star wars review style. the lighting is also particularly bad in the pics. on with the review... parts: 20 figs: 1 price: ????? 1.overview and fig the whole set. the fright knight's knight. the disemboweled knight. the head printing is just longer then the helmet visor. 2. the cart the cart has 3 crossbows and 2 norman type shields. the cart's advanced defense and weapons systems. all the parts from the cart. (forgot to add the fig in) 3.extras & overall here are all my castle figs. remember i don't collect castle. (yet ) oh yeah i forgot to put one of the old skellies and a ghost on there. could a castle fan tell me if any of these minifigs are rare. i have no idea because i don't collect castle. build: 6/10 pretty standard for a impulse. minifigs: 7/10 nice minifig with lots of accessories. design: 8/10 this set made way for some of the new castle carts of similar size. parts: 10/10 3 crossbows, 2 shields, arrow quiver, and spear as well as cool minifg in a 20 piece set! price: 10/10 well i don't know but lego was cheaper in '97 so it gets 10. playability: 5/5 pretty much standard for a impulse set. overall 8/10 good parts and price as well as minifig scores this set an 8. thanks for reading.

0 about the rarest one up there is that black ninja. i only have one ninja and he is dark grey. i also have five samurai. the witch may be fairly rare but i am not sure. i didn't really collect much in the fright knight era.

1 originally shared in the history & adventure forum for its adventure attributes, here's my favorite of the outback collection: first, let me say that this little set is one of my all-time favorites because it can be used to sumplement a number of different themes. 1) the set makes a great little adventure airstrip for adventurers and more recent, the indiana jones theme (see also german headquarters and port adventure). i've also used the set as an addition to my wild west town. the tan baseplate and windmill works great, just subtract the plane, modern equipment, and figs. and lastly, as the set was intended, as an outback/desert airstrip. set description: outback airstrip set # 6444 pieces: 157 minifigs: 3 release date: 1997 original price: $20 (usd) starting with the box: and the backside. notice the alternate models. i love the swamp boat: the building is my favorite part of the set. it is simple, has a little detail, two great roof pieces, and a single green window (great piece!): check out the great windmill piece. it's my only one and makes a great part for wild west and that farm you always wanted to build. i used it for the barnhouse of barnabas higgens and spring valley ranch on the side of the building is a great radio and a clear glass: unfortunately, no furniture can be found within the building: and now the airplane: front view; i love the twin propellors: side view: and the rear section: the back has a small cargo hold for some boxes/freight or some gear needed in the outback: the set includes three figs, two with cool shades: and some great equipment. i love the boom box: a shot of the whole set: and another: summary: as i mentioned above, this set is very versatile and can suplement a few different themes. it's my personal favorite of the outback collection and i'm really glad i was able to find the set in the late 90s (i almost didn't buy). sets like this are timeless and so much fun to build and display. hope you enjoy the review. edit: additional reviews: review by agentrick57 (december 24, 2007) outback airstrip review in history & adventure forum (february 10, 2008)

1 this is probably my all-time favorite lego set. it was originally given to me for my birthday by a close friend of mine back in the release year of 1997. the cargo plane was, by far, my favorite vehicle ever. unfortunately, someone stole the plane from me when our families went on vacation and the rest of the set was given to my cousin's oldest son when i was no longer interested in my lego collection. now that i'm back into lego, i use that building's construction for various projects, especially as a dr. inferno look-out shack using parts from extra mission 3: swamp raid. the shack compliments the original set greatly. edited by skorpius47, 19 august 2008 - 01:44 am.

1 one of the best in my humble opinion. as far as i know it was never released in the uk so the only reason i managed to get my hands on it was on a family holiday to the us, i think theyd only recently opened the lego store in disney. arguable the best feature is that it seems to fit into a wide selection of themes, is it a airstrip in the middle of nowhere, is it next to a only mining town thats not deserted the possibilities are rather open and thats truly great.

1 legoman132, on aug 18 2008, 09:36 pm, said: this was a cool set i thoght of it as i was building the post plane. interesting thought. i have the post plane but i haven't opened it yet. i suppose it's the yellow. the plane in this set is much different than most of the other classic town airplanes in that it has the double tail section. here's a shot of the new 7732 air mail set - definately a nice set:

1 i have had this on my bricklink wanted list for ages, and yet noone with my criteria has it. nice review and brilliant set.

0 no, yoda was released in no less than 3(4) sets. ok, so i remembered wrong. i just have plenty yodas and one is more than enough for the set list click here thanks for pointing that out.

0 thanks for the nice review kimt . i like this set especially by the fact that it is the only set containing the dooku minifig and the curved lightsaber , i also think that the minifig is cool but i also own the dagobah x-wing and the wookiee catamaran sets so i have enought minifigs (a clone wars version would be very cool ) and the extra-thingy is well, just ok. the bad part is that i don?t buy the set when it is out and now is go for $40 on ebay and bricklink . edited by darkrebellion, 18 august 2008 - 09:51 pm.

1 i missed this set.but i reallly like the yoda and count dooku.i especially like count dooku's lightsaber.one thing though,is it me oris yoda's lightsaber blue in the picture? edited by pr0visorak, 20 august 2008 - 12:21 pm.

1 i was very lucky to get this set and i love it, i dont have it built cause i bought it for parts but it was fun while it lasted. .

1 great review, kimt! at that time, it was still in my dark age and i hated myself not to get this set earlier. this is quite inexpensive and you are able to get two greatest characters especially count dooku. the minifigs are excellent, especially the unique design of count dooku's lightsaber. i have no problem with the speedbike, as it looks quite alright to me. as for the elevation of yoda's jump adds some playabilty, but that does not work well for me. nevertheless, the main attractive factor is count dooku and i have to rate it a "5". i never own a yoda, except for the magnet version.

0 kimt, on aug 18 2008, 05:04 pm, said: thanks for the review. it's always good to have a 2nd opinion on a set. i've added the usual poll and i'll index it tomorrow (must sleep). super pics and great to have "in-build" pics a fine set which i'll surely buy when i find it. your welcome! i was going to make that poll, but thanks for doing it. and i always try to take clear pics and in-build pics. lt. col. thok, on aug 18 2008, 05:06 pm, said: very nice review. one thing you have to consider: when lego sees pics of the star wars universe, they have to decide which would be the easiest set to make with the most playibility. therefore, they chose the hmp. thanks! one thing i belive is this: lego is starting to make the blue droid faction(aat, vulture droid, etc.), but sometimes makes brown ones(mtt). so maybe they will make a $50 maf in brown later, like the brown vulture droid last year. let's hope! edited by ~vbbn~, 18 august 2008 - 10:12 pm.

0 and it's now a part of the index. i've added it as "review 2" since we've already got one. thanks for the review and it's always nice to have nmore than one view/opinion on a given set

1 i remember getting this for christmas, and despite the earthy grey parts i relly enjoyed it, and it is nice to see pictures of it again- thanks.

1 thank you for that very interesting review, metalandi. a cool set with a lot of features and some nifty vehicles, very playable and well designed indeed. perhaps a bit too colorful for my likings, but pretty impressive in its conception for sure. i wish we could see some more landscaping coming along with todays vehicle sets as well...

0 set data 4920: the rapid rider year: 1999 subtheme: rock raiders pieces: 37 (+1 extra - trneongreen plate 1 x 1 round) price: euro 3,50, used, not including s/h, on ebay building time: less than 10 minutes. more info: bricklink - peeron. i could have owned the 4910 hover scout (see metalandi's review here), but while i was buying some used sets, i forgot to buy that one too! so, here's my only rr set, the second smallest one (if we don't count japanese promos; sweets are surely sweeter if they come with a lego set!) pieces: face and torso closeup; i like the torso, the face is good except for the bandanna. building is based on two big pieces: landing skids and plate 6 x 6 x 2/3 cross with dome. let's go! building is over: review: pros: small set (= cheap), 1 fig, two accessories, some interesting pieces like the rock and the crystal. no stickers but 3 printed pieces! good color choice. cons: tipper bucket is fixed, no hinge. no levers or steering wheel, it probably moves by using the buttons on the 2x2 tile. it deserves a 4/5.

1 this was the first rock raiders set i got. i really like it, and i think i got all of them except the huge cargo airlift thing. i remember these sets coming out and getting the big base for christmas, though they are all destroyed now... sadly... . nice review.

0 when i first saw this review title, i thought it said "rapid river review" thinking it was an indian set (6766). nice review though. i never got into rock raiders. i would have loved the large drill bit piece for set #s 4970 and 4940. this set looks like a little boulder hawler, and a nice set to introduce someone unfamilar with the theme. i esp. like the fig and the little 2x2 drill bit tile. the overall set looks like it has some very useful mining-type pieces. nice review and thanks for sharing.

0 jopiek, on aug 24 2008, 10:48 pm, said: a very good set indeed, we have at least 3 of them, but we like them all. what do you mean by "we"? you own three sets of the orignal 1994 series or the 2002 legend series?

0 got this one as well, not much surprises in such a small set, but the fast-food pizza idea is pretty cool. as far as i know only the small mcdonalds promo and this set are related to food/restaurant thing (until the cafe corner that is) but since i have a classic lego city i can't miss this set.

0 whitefang, on aug 24 2008, 04:12 pm, said: flyut, if you need decals for the stickers that are featured in this set. hang around here until imperialshadows drop by to give you a little surprise if he is free. imperialshadows, on aug 26 2008, 10:53 am, said: surprise? free? i'm not even close to free, i'm rather expensive, but i do have a surprise for everyone! i think you'll be interested in the companion article to this fine review, my first set restoration project. that's great, maybe i'll be restoring my 6350 - pizza to go in the near future, thanks . now to figure out how i can get my printer to do what i want (sometimes that thing has a will of its own ) great thread about restoring pizza to go

1 i remember having this set when it was originally released a good few years back, but i don't think i have it anymore. i remember i thought it was really awesome though. i thought the oven and pizza storage in the back of the car were the greatest parts, the little sink on the inside was cool too. didn't realise they had made a legends set out of it... i'd love to own this set again, but misb examples on bricklink go for an extortionate amount of money. ah well, se la vie...

0 it's defintely nice to see this past classic town review re-surface again. i tom bricks, on may 15 2009, 10:05 am, said: i used to want this set so badly and i almost got it when it was rereleased. i still wonder why i didn't because with a building, van, 5 pizzas, and a then very rare female fig. this set would have been perfect for someone with a smaller collection like i had then. what surprised me the most is how well this set still holds up to others today. off to bricklink! i agreed that this set is perfect for someone with a small collection. in fact, i feel that this set is one of the "must have" set that can allow you build your pizza franchise in your town. posades, on may 15 2009, 10:45 am, said: definitely one of my favorite sets from my childhood; i still remember my sister getting it for me for my birthday and me building it that same day. too bad i had it displayed all these years on my windowsill so the pizza delivery van and pizzeria have become yellowed. is it possible to restore it by getting those bricks or parts again? yellowed bricks is really very saddening. it reminds me of my breezeway cafe. those were the days where we are too young to know how to take good care of our toys. alywin, on may 15 2009, 10:59 pm, said: i also always think the girl minifig is supposed to be a customer... lego is really up to everyone's own imagination... you are right! the girl could have been a customer. i thought of her as a staff. misrepresentation could be so easy, but then again, the box nevr stated its role too.

1 nice review. i have this set, and i like it alot. its a master peice!

1 indexed allright, hi everybody again! today, i'm gonna review the biggest set of the res-q subtheme, 6479 emergency response center. with this one i think, the reviews of all the res-q sets are complete now, and while i'm in a reviewing mode right now i thought i'd bring that up. this set hast got many nice aspects and also some very rare pieces, and comes with a wonderful amount of vehicles, including a speedboat, a tow truck, a helicopter, and a trike which can pull a little boat. so sit down, get your popcorn and beer, we're off to stormy weather at the coast! sub-theme: res-q set nr.: 6479 name: emergency response center number of minifigs: 5 number of pieces: 420 release year: 1998 unfortunately i don't have many of the boxes of my res-q sets anymore, so i'll start right off with the instructions this time: on the backside there is no alternate model as usual this time, but only a different shot of the whole set: next, a general overview, sorry about the slightly bad picture quality on some pics this time: originally this set has 5 minfigs (which all are really nice!), but the guy who drives the tow truck has been lost in the flood here's a picture of the missing fig: let's move on to the vehicles, we have something for the water, the ground and the air in this set, first the great tow truck: i love the mechanism with the hooks in the back: next on, da speedboat! at the rear, it's got a stretcher and a wench, which adds a lot of playability: if there's a a little accident near the coast, the trike comes to appearance: for more complicated stuff, we have a little helicopter (i broke the rotating piece at the top yesterday, ouch! : ) no space for a victim you say? well, not really, but the helicopter also got a wench with a hook in the back: now it comes to the station itself, at the docks a neat life belt sign is mounted (remember, at this time there weren't real ones as today): a little more right an equipment holder is placed, with various tools on the front... ...and fire fighter equip at the back: at the very front a little lighttower secures the shelter: i haven't quite found out what this thing is supposed to be, maybe somebody knows another equipment holder, this time with all the stuff you need for diving: more equipment... ...and even more! we come to the hear piece of the station, the control room with lots of buttons and scrrens: last but not least, a quick shot of all the accesoires and tools that you get, which really is an a-ma-zing amount! this set might have a few junioriced pieces, as the big window in the front or the "briedge" on the roof, but that doesn't matter, because there is nearly one other set in which you get so much rare pieces and such an overwhelming amount of accesoires, so i can recommend that for everybody who is a pieces-fanatic. not to forget the playability, the great figs and the, in my opinion very good color scheme. once again thanks for taking the time reading and looking at my review, i hope you liked it. edited by thebrickster, 31 december 2009 - 09:19 pm.

0 do you mean this one http://www.brickset....aspx?set=2962-1 ? i would also like to get that, alone for the fact that it's the only res-q set with a female fig

0 yes, the review is great indeed, i love in-depth reviews with tons of photos! as for the set - i'm not planning to buy it, but it looks ok. i think it's a good tank.

0 wow, this is one great review! fantastic pictures, this looks like one cool set with heaps of neat functions. a shame it doesn't include exclusive figures (like ahsoka and captain rex in the at-te or plo koon and asajj ventress in the gunship), but you can't have everything. so again, thanks for this sweet review! ~peace

1 wow, this ship is really big, judging from the size of its hull!!! wondering where can i keep it when i've bought it. ;)

0 mattzitron, on aug 13 2005, 11:30 pm, said: the strange thing is, for the first time i can remember the minifigs came decapitated, and there's no neckwear. i recall jake saying something about it being new lego policy to supply the minifig heads and torsos separately. what with the expenses-trimming and all, it's apparently one of the many little quirky things they've discovered in the manufacturing and packaging process that people have done for years without thinking (in this case, putting the heads on the torsos) but that turns out to be a surprisingly significant expense (timewise, i suppose). think it was in one of his blog posts, but not sure. too tired (ie, lazy) to go hunting for it now, sorry >-|

-1 mattzitron, you have done well to display images of the dung stain hull... its a darn shame that it can't be extended. however, i see no reason why lego couldn't produce a special middle hull piece that is compatible. although the way they've made the hull is a bit stupid. the old system was a lot more flexible. better still why can't lego design a hull that can be extended in length and width... then they could be as made as long or wide as desired and that would be great!

1 i'm interested in the scan of the back... i have an idea for a new avatar. :)

1 right so here's my review (finally). the whole gallery of box, parts, minifigs and finished model is here, over 2 pages. so on with the show. minifigs http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=1340864 in the set you get krakaroff (i dunno how to spell it) and victor krum. the figs are exactly the same, bar their heads. these are two fantastic figures, the expression on krakaroff's face is priceless. judging by the design i think we might get a yellow krakaroff cropping up somewhere, which would make me a happy bunny (he'd make a fantastic viking) ideally i'd have liked more than 2 figures for my money, three would have done it, i think 2 is too few. piece count http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=1344573 http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=1344571 http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=1344572 for a ?40 set, the piece count is quiet good, i don't know the exact number but when building it, i didn't feel short changed, bar the exception of the hull. now i don't hate the hull, my problem is that is doesn't connect with bricks like the old pirate ships. there are pros and cons to this, on the plus side its more secure, and your whole ship doesn't need to be taken up with support structure. the negative side being, you can't really make it bigger (as they've only released a megablocking 4+ set with the right piece, and its the wrong color). i also like how its wide, meaning you can fit loads of minifigs on the main deck. overall though i liked the pieces. of note are gold studs (http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=1344510) (5 in total, you get one spare), the return of the black falcon shields (http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=1340835) and the new drumstrang shields. the construction a simple fun build. nothing too fiddly. the finished model http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=1344474 (big picture) i really like this set. there's no bones about it. it seems lego with the latter half of 2005 have given people who loved their original pirate ships hope for the future with this and the fantastic viking longboat. even with the two 4+ pieces (the hull, and front of the ship) i wasn't put off. http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=1340841 http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=1344461 the front of the ship is a nice piece, and can be used for stuff like castles. http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=1344490 http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=1344491 http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=1344492 http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=1344494 and the hull isn't all bad. what i really liked was the little cargo hold, at the moment i have a treasure chest in there, but there' space for about eight of them i reckon. playability wise it does make alot of sense, and as you can see you can imprision minifigs below deck. http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=1344484 http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=1344488 http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=1344506 http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=1344500 the quarters are great as well. you can comfortably fit about six minifigs in the main gally, three by the steering wheel, and a couple up above the top cabin. you could fit more, but it'd look strange. my only gripe is the design of the top cabin. when you want to open it up, you have to remove the mast. i know its simple enough, but i think that it wouldn't have taken much for tlc to design it better. but saying that its easily done, and i like how the cabin can be lifted with ease from the steering deck. http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=1344540 the final play feature is the plank. you can while away the hours murdering hapless minifigs who've displeased the cabin. a really nice addition for pirate fans. the final verdict[/b playability: 9.5/10 - lots to do for all the kids. piece count: 9/10- a great selection, loses one for the hull. figures: 8/10 - just needs one more! construction: 9/10 - nice and simple. value: 8.5/10 - let down a bit by lack of minifigs, and the cons of the hull. [b]overall: 8.8/10 overall this is a set worth getting, especially if you miss proper pirates. it wouldn't take much to turn this into an amazing pirate ship moc. hope you liked my review. matt

1 [burns]excellent...[/burns] i love those parts shots, great stuff in there! this really is a good sign for the new line, hopefully there'll be the same level of usefulness in the others. thanks for taking the time to finish it up! did you scan the back of the instructions?

1 i received this set with a $25 gift card, so it was a great buy. it follow with a similar build to the 2007 trucks, but has a few improvements. of course, the name of the set could have been a bit more creative... and yes, this was an academy review. set name: truck and forklift number: 7733 pieces: 343 theme: city year released: 2008 price: $25.00 usd, ?19.99 gbp, 24.00 euro 1/box now the box follows a design similar to most other city sets. it has the set information and photo of the set on the front, (sorry for it getting cut off, i will remake it). now the back of the box shows what each bag builds. bag 1 is for the forklift, bag 2 is for the cab, and bags 3 and 4 are for the containers. it also has the set's features. 2/contents the instructions: there are 2 books included with the set: one for the forklift, and one for the truck. minifigure(1) the first minifig you build is a simple cargo worker. interesting/new parts: here we have some interesting and new parts. they include a yellow seat, a 1x2 plate with clips, and a 1x4 slope. 3/the build cargo1 the first cargo palette has a few crates on it. i really like the sticker on the small box. forklift: the forklift is a very fun extra to build, and it is probably the best forklift that we have had so far. it is very realistic and is very strong. cargo2 the next piece of cargo is some octan barrels on a meter. i am not sure what it is supposed to be, but it is still a nice addition to the set. minifgure(2) the second minifigure is a classic driver with sunglasses and a coffee mug. very nice. new piece! this is a very nice new piece that is included in the set, a hollow canopy. i believe it is also in white with the police mobile command station. truck: now anyone who has had one of the lego city harbor sets from last year, then you will probably find this build to be very similar. mostly in the cab part of the truck. the trucks build is very solid, and very realistic. i sense ths will bring the ratings up quite a bit. mystery cargo: for some time specualtion has been going around, what exactly is this? it seems like nuero poison.. i am very happy with those 2x2 cylinders in trans-yellow. in fact, you can join in and guess what it may be in this topic. containers: the first container is built to hold one palette. it fits onto the truck. it produces a very pleasing result, and has a better look to it than the containers from last year had. the second container has the ability to hold two palettes, and has a design similar to the first. then, you build on the wheels. the back ones have beautiful mudflaps! finshed set: ---------------------------------- parts: 10/10 (lots of useful pieces, great colors, and some very cool new pieces.) minifigs: 8/10 (i would have liked another but it was $25, so i guess its okay.) price per part: 10/10 (almost 350 pieces for $25. ) playability: 8/10 (forklifts are always fun, and there are lots of things to do with this set.) overall: 36/40 90% a- this is truley an outstanding set, and it will make a great addition to anyones collection. mocers would aslo like this, due to the fact that it has some really nice parts. it has a great build, and utilizes some awesome new techniques. it also has details, something you might look for in a set. highly recommended. hope everyone enjoyed the review! if you have any pic requests, questions, etc., please ask! i look forward to hearing your comments, and the judges comments as well. 7733 peeron.com 7733 bricklink catalog 7733 shop at home

1 very nice review of a set that i've been dying to get, but my friendly neighborhood lego store never seems to have in stock. the yellow seat is most definitely not a new piece. i had two of those in my old beta-1 command base, almost 30 years ago!!

1 a very fine set indeed and something at least a little different to the more usual city sets. sweet! and it could even be a little sweeter to me with car doors... well, nevermind. thanks for that very nice review, ~vbbn~!

0 that explains why it isn't in our local stores. i also got it from s@h, but my box hasn't got the "special edition printing" on it, surprisingly.

1 nice review, vbbn! i stumbled upon your yellow seat as well. didnt you have one already or what made you think its new? the big letdown on this set is the big canopy. i would have preferred single bricks for that. and for this truck there is no real need for a hollow canopy - it could as well have been made of solid bricks. maybe we get another set with different use of the canopy. this is one of the reasons i didnt buy it so far. and im especially not interested in another forklift, i have plenty of those... i agree its the best one we have seen so far though.

1 thats really a sweet and charming little technic set, thanks for that fine review!

0 what that? looks like a walker! an imperial walker? no??.. theme: space, blacktron i set name: alienator set number: 6876 number of pieces: 82 figures:1 released: 1988 list price: ?.99 (it seem no source online has the price) peeron.com bricklink.com as always lets have a look at the box first as i?m luck to own a boxed version of this set. walking across a planet with a grid pattern sky! the back shows a great selection of alternative models. after opening the box we find a single instruction booklet inside the instruction booklet now we come to the man in the black visor the mark i blacktron and black and industrial he look. in my opinion i think he probably has the second best lego space torso. before the focus group decided they needed to be brighter now turning to the walker itself, it?s a simple build which i don?t think even i with my great skills for messing up could get wrong. the final unit is built in three key parts. the command pod which is attached to the body by two pins at the back. the walker legs, this is pure design genius. simply built easy to replicate and no fancy parts. the top section which open to reveal the blacktrons high-tech tools. time to put the entire set together, i think you?ll agree it looks great for such a simple build. looking like you could take on the universe. a side view of the finished product. a frontal view of the alienator what the hell! how did that take down an at-at. this is one of my all time favourite lego space sets. actually i didn?t have it pre-dark age and only recently bought one. what attracted me to it was an old boxed set, but since then i?ve discovered a set that i wished i?d owned long ago. the rating system figures: 8/10 (i love the dark industrial space look) parts 7/10 (yes it may be nearly all black with some yellow highlights, but is have a good range and they fit to make several great models.) fun fun fun 8/10 (it walks well and it?s a great set, it has a large number of possible mods.) design 10/10 (it?s ingenious the walking mechanism is so simple and yet so good i can?t fault it price ?/10 (while i could tell you how much i paid i was luck on ebay so this remains a question mark) grand total 33/40 (reduced top level due to lack of price knowledge) conclusion. a set which in my opinion showcases what lego was about in the 1980?s. the set has an excellent design ethic and looks great, with very limited parts it retains great action and functionality. twinned with the great main model you?re shown that there are a number of other great models you can make with the same parts. this set is what it?s all about for me, i?m very glad i bought outside my normal theme when i saw this. actually on the strength of this set i recently order 6894 blacktron invader and can?t wait to get it and see if it lives up to the alienator.

1 i loved all of these "walker" sets. it was such a smart technique. i made one myself with what i had ...ahhh good times! thanks for the great review.

0 the y-wing is the work horse of the rebel alliance. its well armed and heavily armoured, but youll need it because youll be moving like a sleepy hut!  general rieekan set name: y-wing starfighter set number: 7658 number of pieces: 454 figures:2 released: 2007 list price: 39.99 lets us begin with the box. the front shows it in all its swooshing glory. http://tdy.org.uk/images/7658-02.jpg the back shows some of the many features of the set and also others you might like to buy in the star wars range. after opening the box we find a single instruction booklet now we come to an important aspect of any star wars set the figure, here were provided with an anomalous rebel pilot and his faithful r5 droid. the pilot comes with the fairly standard lego star wars non-hero helmet printing. whats he going to do with the blaster taken on the entire empire? one of the more interesting parts is the assembly of the engine, which if like me you dont pay enough attention to the instructions when building you can end up getting wrong. the key detail i got wrong. just before fitting the last engine. if we look carefully on the side we can see a missile launcher. i didnt think torpedoes or concussion missiles were fired from there but i may be wrong. after fitting the engine the models looks like this. in all its glory. manning one of the alliances fighters. not so ready to take on the empire was he? so overall we have a well designed model, which is in my opinion far superior to the original we were offered with darth vader way back when lego star wars was new. this y-wing is sleek and looks great in my opinion, the firing missiles are also a great touch. the rating system figures: 5/10 (for the same price the last x-wing had far more figures) parts 6/10 swooshability 9.5/10 design 9/10 price 3/10 grand total 32.5/50 not to shabby. conclusion. so finally the answers to the questions youve no doubt want to know is the set worth the price. ill be frank 39.99 is too much for this set. despite this i currently have a squadron of three y-wings, the reasons is this set has been on sale a number of times at 30 its certainly worth the money. lego recently placed them online with a price of 20, this i think was a great price for the set and well work picking one or more up if you wanted to start your own rebellion.

1 a wonderful set and a really charming design, well detailed and pretty smooth at the same time. perhaps that small gap at the cockpits an a little weak point, but we can always mod a little. thanks for that very neat review, cardinal brick!

1 i like the model, it is one of the best rebel sets out there. but i don't like it that there is no landing gear. when you set this one on the floor/ your rebel base it looks like it crashed or something and looses its look of superiority actually quite fast. it needs to be at least 2 studs high, if not more, from the ground. tlc is in these days afraid of flimsy landing gear, as they gave to us in the early sw time. now they want something sturdy for playability. but i think there should have been some details on the bottom, especially a landing gear that unfolds. i also don't like the mistake of tlc (that they changed this year with the release of indy hopefully) to give the pilot a usual smile face. the old yellow version of gold leader even had a headgear. i hope tlc realised this year that we want more detailed faces. well, the licenced sets we got proved that, but who knows. the upsides of this set are the amount of pieces and detail, especially the engines were fun to build and perhaps the most interesting construction i have seen in years. also it is big, bulky and looks sleek at the same time, just wonderful. and next to the 4502 x-wing it looks in the perfect size! i gave this the highest rating, even if the underside disappoints. but whatever, it is lego, you can add some landing gear on your own! thanks for the review, your pics were really really good, next time make more of them please!

0 is it worth the money since the new y-wing comes out next year?

0 yodalikespie, on 03 september 2011 - 07:21 pm, said: is it worth the money since the new y-wing comes out next year? please, check the date prior to asking questions in old topics. three years ago in this case. it's rude to expect people to answer questions like that, especially since it's such a generic question. besides, how is he supposed to answer the question without knowing a lot more about the new y-wing...

0 i think it is a fair to ask questions here with the expectation of a new y-wing in the coming year. i came here to look at the review even though it is a few years old. no images to go with the review. bummer. i'd like to see a more friendly tolerance on dated threads being bumped.

-1 fallenangel309, on 19 september 2011 - 02:01 am, said: again, we know next to nothing about the new y-wing. it wouldn't be possible to say whether 7658 is worth the money relative to the new one until we know what the new one looks like, what its minifigures look like, how much it will cost, etc. also, note that yodalikespie has been banned. is that a threat? is it fair to ban someone on the forum because they revived an old thread and made inquiries? thought this was a forum to discuss lego and that is what he was prompting. i don't really care why he was banned but this isn't the only time i've seen this type of behavior and discourse here on eb.

1 another fine review! i love the last (action) picture. thanks for sharing! btw, i am so looking forward to that 384 london bus review.

1 finaly we get a new mech for takeshi. and yes, it's yellow. it brings back some flashbacks of supernova. good times. anyways, i recieved this set at christmas last year, with 3 other ef sets. set name: assault tiger number: 8113 pieces: 163 theme: exo-force year released: 2008 price: 15.00 usd, 18.95 eur 1/box the boxes this year are much different than those from previous years. it has some gaps in it, and has a cardboard backround inside of it. the box itself shows assault tiger and the set information. the back shows a combiner. the cardboard backdrop: a very nice jungle look to it. it has lots of fog as well, creating a pale effect. 2/contents the instructions: the instructions are clear, and straight-forward. also included is a lego "blooper." the remains of the sticker sheet: the stickers aren't too bad. i didn't apply the saw sticker as i wanted it to be left plain. the buzzsaw: a very cool piece. mocists will love this. 3/build the figures: the figures included are takeshi, who features a nice new torso. also included is the mini robot. his is a very neat little guy, but sadly, he doesn't really become a weapon. more of a block of red and black bricks. the torso: now the torso design for assault tiger is very different from the past years. it now uses a castle-like piece as the main structure. also of note is that he has a mini throne. no controls, sadly. and with the orange cockpit piece, it's impossible to see takeshi when looking at the at close on. see the third pic. the legs: the legs are slightly similar to the mt-201 ultra drill walker's, but have been modified to fit the at. they are quite large, and suit their purpose. the arms: the arms follow a new design, but the only problem is, they have no elbow or hand articulation. nice weapons though. the finished product: ----------------------- parts: 10/10 (lots of useful pieces, great colors, and some very cool new pieces.) minifigs: 8/10 (a robot would have been nice, and a better weapon mode for the mini-robot would have been good.) price per part: 7/10 (a stretch...) playability: 8/10 (the lack of elbow and wrist articulation isn't the greatest. overall: 33/40 82.5% b- assault tiger is a nice set, but some of those small little things can truly take a toll on the final rating. i think that i would only recommend this set to anyone who wants the yellow, and hardcore exo-force fans. s@h link peeron link i hope you enjoyed the review, and if you have any pic requests or questions, please ask. edited by sinner, 01 september 2008 - 01:52 am.

1 thanks for the review, ~vbbn~. i have to say, ef has never really caught my attention, but this set seems alright. to be honest, when i saw the topic title, i was expecting a tiger- looking mech. the mech itself is cool, except for the huge leg pieces. i think the minifigs are great in ef sets, with the dark colored outfits, like dark red or dark green.

1 thanks for that good review, ~vbbn~. thats really a fine and pretty solid looking mecha. i think that the designers did a good job on this last wave of ef sets, and the inclusion of these mini robots was also a pretty smart idea!

1 nice to see a well done review. this set is one of the few exo-force sets i haven't built myself yet, but i will get it on sale, guess soon. i'm do not like the use of slizer-style ball-joints in exo-force, even though they are modified to 2x2 bricks. in this particular set i think the arms look weak, and they lack elbow joint like the "green 2008 mech" set. (forgot name of this years green mech). quite a shame, i find it really hurts the functionality of that "green" set and could imagine the same with the "tiger". i guess with the new pyramide brick as cockpit, the cockpit is still open from the sides and the back. i modified my "green 2008 mech", which use the same cockpit design, with a few green bricks, and it is now completely closed from all sides. i rate the tiger at average, but i may change my mind when i get to build it myself. front

1 since my last post i've had the chance to build the tiger, and i was surprised in a good way. a much better set than i actually thougth. front

1 i just bought 2 of them since they were 5$ each from lego. i really wish they did not cancel this series.

-1 i voted "average". i think this is the least attractive among the 2008 exo-force sets. i saved my money to buy some of the 2006 mechas.

1 what do you mean the trolls should outnumber the crown knight? how are you going to manage that? well heres the answer. theme: castle set name: troll warrior set number: 5618 number of pieces: 19 figures:1 released: 2008 list price: 2.50 (gbp) $3.50 (usd) 2.99 (euro) 5618 peeron.com 5618 bricklink catalog 5618 shop at home lets us begin with the box. the troll warrior and his might cart. set sets for children to pester for at christmas. now for whats inside. the contents of the box, it doesnt look like much. now for the troll himself, im glad they selected this troll torso rather than the other one for the impulse set i think this one is the superior one. also he comes well armed with a spear and sword but no shield sadly. someone really needs to look at the rodent problem in the castle sets.. now the cart, nice easy construction as with all impulse sets, im still not convinced by the flicking missiles. a line of those would do some damage. what an oncoming army can expect to see.. all together now and it looks rather good. so there we have it a cheap way of bolstering the troll army and outfitting them with some more weapons. also for anyone planning a pied piper moc another set with a rat in it. the rating system figures: 8/10 (|preferred troll torso and helmet style. ) parts 7/10 (two spears and a sword but sadly lacking that all important shield.) fun fun fun 4/10 (somewhat more to do on its own that other impulse at least the troll can fight the rat!) design 7/10 (well designed even the flicker missile doesnt look bad) price 8/10 (at 2.50 more than the other castle impulse.) grand total 34/50 (lack of a shield and to small to stand alone for my rating system..) conclusion. castle fans got a great army builder with the knight and theyve been lucky enough to receive another one with this set. im glad weve got a troll impulse as it allow for enlarging the armies of evil some the crown knight dont totally outnumber all their opponents.

-1 i'm not really impressed by this set as much as other impulse sets. the knight impulse set #5615 offers more in my opinion since it gives two helmets, two weapons, a shield and an armor piece along with the weapon rack. i'm not a fan in the slightest of flickfire missles and projectiles like on the cart, and the previously mentioned one piece axle limits the wheel usage in other mocs. i would've liked to see an added chest armor piece at the very least and a shield would've made this great. those things are so rare and it would've bumped the piece count up to 21 to match the knight set. since both are showing the same price on s@h(in us dollars at least), it would've made sense.

-1 thank you for the nice review. the set is not that bad, but a shield would be a nice addition. i also don't like the flickfire missile. a camp site with a fire and a chickenleg would also be nice about the rat; isn't it just foodsupply for the troll? the only problem would than be that the food is running away.

0 thats the problem i couldnt quite tell what, its a bit of a problem in a reviewer. maybe a hose to clip to the fire hydrant i dont know.

1 this here was a set that i new i had to get. a beautiful minfig, amazing minfigs, what more could you want? so was this set worth it? i guess you will just have to read the review to find out! set name: the batcycle: harley quinn's hammer truck number: 7886 pieces: 267 theme: batman year: 2008 price: 35.00 usd, 44.96 euro 1/box the new box art for batman is pretty stunning. it's clean, and really sells the set. for this set, harley quinn's truck is pictured attacking batman, with the set information. the back of the box shows a nice little comic, the other sets, as well as the set functions. 2/contents the instructions: the instructions for the set are, as always, clear and straightforward. they display the colors well, and have what we expect in an instruction book. 3/build minifigs: the stars of the set! batman is back with a new torso, much more metalic than before. harley had all new printed torso, legs, a new head, and that sweet new hat. batcycle: the bottom part is very sturdy thanks to a small bit of technic. the red throws it off a bit, but it isn't seen once the top part is put on. it has a nice use of the smoke stacks, and looks very nice in the end. the top part is simple, but suits the purpose well. it has handle bars, and a nice motor. the blue is a little strange though. hammer truck: the hammer truck begins with a very sturdy base. it has lots of detail, and really looks cool. rims added: lego did a very nice job at giving it a checker board appearence. the only problem here is that you stick a sticker over two bricks, multiple times. jewels: inside of the crate are these shining jewels. look how they illuminate the darkness in gotham... more added: then, we add on a spoiler and the crate. looking very nice now. the detail is again, outstanding, and it has a good amount of smoothness to it. the infamous hammer! okay, i haven't said this yet, but the square pieces need to stop. first on those sw backta tanks, now on the hammer? it creates a sloppy look for the hammer. still, this is the ultimate wacking weapon. added to the truck: on the truck it works pretty well. but the handle is to short, and it's near impossible to smash batman. the finished truck: the finished truck is really nice. the big wheels give it the monster truck feel, and the way that lego alternated the colors works well. the cockpit is a little palin, but that's not a major issue. the "i love joker" sticker is one of the best stickers i've seen. it's simply a classic. the finished set: ---------------------------- parts: 9/10 (lot's of good mocing pieces, and red and black are always usefull.) minifigs: 10/10 (awesome!) playability: 9/10 (the hammer is a little short) price-per-part: 8/10 (it's a liscensed theme, so meh.) set 7886 is a very nice set, and has some great details in it. the minifigs are very cool as well. however, their are some flaws. first, the hammer is two short, and is kind of square. the batcycle has a few awkward colors in it, which throws it off a bit. this set is definatly worth the money. batman fans will love it. and also wacking fans will like it, for that hammer... and if you would like to buy this set, here are a few useful links: s@h link peeron link please let me know your comments. and pic requests and questions are welcome!

0 i saw two stickers next to the window. one said "whack him" but i can't make out the other one. can you post a picture of it? good review, by the way!

1 cues the indy theme song let's follow indy on his pursuit on the stolen ark. indy rides full speed ahead on his white horse, but the nazis are pulling away! will indiana jones be able to grab on to the truck and reclaim the treasure? or will the nazis and their high-powered mercedes trucks prevail? let's find out! 7622 race for the stolen treasure set info set name: 7622 race for the stolen treasure theme: indiana jones released: 2008 price: 29.99 usd 34.95 euro 24.99 gbp pieces: 272 minifigs: 4 price per piece: about 11 cents and now, the main event! first, the box shots the front shows a nice image of indy on his horse, trying to make it on to the truck, and the attack truck taking aim. the back this side shows some of the features of the set, in little pictures on the left. instruction manual not much to say here, as it's the same picture as on the box. inside the manual on one of the last pages we have a nice picture like the one on the back of the box, showing some features of the set. random manual pic here we have the nice piece call-outs that we have come to expect lately. the bags were numbered as well. the pieces a nice selection here, especially if you like black, dark bley and bley. "cool" pieces the golden treasure chest has a really nice sparkle to it. the set also has a good assortment of coins and jewels, and some wonderful silver 1x1 dots. the canvas covering this is quite nice. it has a nice dark tan color, and some nice detail on it as well. the minifigs first comes indy's beautiful white horse. i always like lego animals and this one is no exception. here are the figs on the left indiana jones, and his nice stubble, printed legs, side bag and the best lego hat in history. and the nazis, peter, hans, and klaus. their torsos are very nice and the hats are amazing. they look really nice with all of their tan. the extra parts here you get two of the nice silver 1x1s, some clear 1x1s, and the usual technic pins and levers. now the finished set! first we have the attack truck the truck looks very good. it looks very military like with the colors and the design. it is designed wonderfully with really nice mudguards and a well-detailed front. the only fault of this is i think the top part where the gunner stands is a bit bare. the front here you can see the front, which has a nice smooth look with some nice details as well. the front ridged piece works well here. the gun this is well made. it is built by attaching a lightsaber hilt in a sort of videocamera piece. the actual area where the guy stands is pretty bare, but not too bad. backside of the truck the spare tire here is a simple, but nice touch. a side view the mudguards are smartly built by clipping wing flaps on to handle plates. this part gets a bit tedious, but the end result is worth it. the big boy cargo truck! this is another really well built truck. it has a lot of the same design elements as in the smaller truck, such as the mudguards. front view the front of this truck is as nice or better than the other truck. it uses good snot building, and everything fits in well. a close-up view of the tire area just behind the tire you can see those silver 1x1s being used as the suspension. this is a really nice addition and it looks great. note: it's only visual suspension. it is not supposed to work. the canvas cover in action now the canvas attaches by putting the holes in the canvas, on some little blue technic pins and then clamping them down with the hinged pieces. it looks really nice and curves nicely. the windscreen treasure! my favorite piece in action. i took this picture with the flash on, so you can see how it sparkles. i think we have waited far too long for this great piece. the complete set! everything all together. indy is chasing fast! indy's got it! brickshelf folder now, for the ratings! price: 9/10 (not bad, but could have slightly more pieces. at least it has 4 minifigs and that makes up for it.) parts: 9/10 (a nice selection of parts, lots of greys and black.) design: 10/10 (the trucks are really well-designed, the mudguards are excellent.) playability: 8/10 ( i always like rolling the trucks across the floor. ) build: 9/10 (pretty good, but gets a bit repetitive in some parts.) overall: 45/50 brickset bricklink entry peeron lego s@h even after intense fighting, everyone always gets along when there's food to be eaten... "hey indy! vant some mustard?" "how about some ketchup?" summary this, and all of the other indiana jones sets are some of my favorites. they all have nice colors, good design, and great minifigs. although i need indy in a different outfit pretty soon. his outfit is starting to smell a bit ripe . this set in particular is very well designed, and i can't wait for some more indy next year. thanks, and happy building! edited by erdbeereis1, 29 august 2008 - 03:47 am.

-1 nice review. i really want this set, but i think the 35 here is too much (more like 25 would suit) and haven't found it cheap enough on ebay yet incl. shipping.

1 i love this set... indy is what got me back into lego.

1 very good review

1 great review, i was debating on whether or not to snag this up before its gone, and i think i will, great review and thanks again!

-1 good review, thanks! for the mail van, while it certainly adds interaction and fun to a lego town, it alone lacks details and playability, and thus not a good set, especailly taking its price into consideration. its value is pretty much just like, if not less than, some impulse sets, in my opinion...

1 it's a good set, but i think the first sticker shouldn't say "7731"

1 legoman132, on aug 29 2008, 06:35 am, said: this set is nice it looks like a dhl van makes you wonder if there was some kind of promo or hookup in the pipeline that never happened?? i have this set and i really like it. it works well with either the new city sets or with my older 1980s/1990s sets. i actually like the use of the old style car base and mourned the day that these became exitinct the first time round (c1990). thanks for the review! cheers rog

1 a very good review of an especially charming and lovely set, thanks! the whole cg theme looks very nice to me with a good and detailed set design, and this ones no exception. although it would be nice to see more car doors and some new mf faces, though.

1 thanks for this review. i was thinking of getting this set and having read your review went out today and got it. what a great little set. what i particularly like: very sturdy build. feels very solid as you build the pickup (compared to the fire pickup & trailer i also have) the orange pieces (my first pieces in this colour!) the tyres which give the smoothest ride of any lego town/city vehicle i've ever built the raised suspension and side runners the coast guard dude (again a first for me) and his mega-cool flippers and aqualung the jetski controls - the handlebars actually move left to right which is a great detail little details that lego didn't have to do (the grey handle by the ball joint; moving handlebars; the new tyres) as you can probably guess, i have voted outstanding for this set! erdbeereis1, on aug 29 2008, 06:02 am, said: color separation is not a problem here, and since it is a small set, the piece call out is not a necessity. you do get a piece call out with this set (i did anyway). it's on the back of the small poster that is included in the set! thanks again cheers rog edited by rriggs, 02 september 2008 - 02:53 pm.

1 thanls for the review, i was looking at this set last time i went to the lego store, but in the end decided not to get it. now youve made me really doubt my decision. one question though do you think the jet ski is as good as previous ones?

1 erdbeereis1, on sep 2 2008, 09:15 pm, said: i meant the piece call outs during the build that show which pieces you need for that step. oh! cardinal brick, on sep 2 2008, 09:05 pm, said: one question though do you think the jet ski is as good as previous ones? i have to agree that the jetski is an awesome little piece of design. apart from the handle bars it has a really cool orange piece on the front (a piece i've never seen before) - the 4x3 wheelarch sort of thing... cheers rog

1 the coast guard sets are very eye catching. the color scheme is making me want to pick up the entire line, although the off-shore platform hasn't been released state-side yet. i've had my eye on this particular set for a few weeks now and is near the top of my to buy list. with instructions provided on lego.com, i build a dr. infero version of the jet ski to replace the one used in mission 2: swamp raid. it's a very sturdy design, bulky enough to make it feel like a real vehicle. great review, too. thank-you for the closer look at the set.

(i don't know the original price. i got it from bricklink with no box for $17. unfortunately, i was not able to locate the euro or pounds price.) pieces: 123 minifigs: 5 off we go! unfortunately, i don't have the box because i didn't like the idea of spending over $50 for a set with under 200 pieces. so sorry, no box pics. instructions i think the image on the front is very good. it seems less setup somehow than the instructions these days. it looks more like someone snuck up on them while they were going about their duties and snapped away rather than something that was planned. the parts a nice selection here. there is a pretty good amount of printed pieces in this set which is always nice. for example, the zebra print tile, as well as the pirate flag nowadays would almost certainly be stickered. the set also comes with a nice dark grey burp and a red boat for the pirates. the minifigs the main buying point of this set for me were the minifigs. this set comes with 5 of them which is quite good for a small set like this, especially when compared to the sets of today. the set comes with 1 alligator, 2 pirates, 2 islander warriors and king kahuka himself. i really like the islanders' torso and leg prints. the leafy skirts are a nice touch and the make-up on the faces is superb. some parts i liked these shields have a nice design on them and i always like the treasure chests. a picture inside the manual this is a feature that i liked in the manual, it shows an overhead view of the baseplate so it's much easier to find where to put the piece. i certainly could have used this feature in last year's aquabase invasion set. a close-up of the king the face print is nice. i wonder who kahuka's make-up artist is.... the finished set! first, the pirates' boat the boat is really nice. the sail is made out of a nice cloth, and connects simply to the mast. and now, the main part of the set, the throne! this is a really nice model. i think the colors and the design make it really feel like a different part of the lego world. the rock sculpture looks fantastic as well. the throne, which is sort of a stretcher thing attaches here. it connects on a 1x2 tile with a stud in the middle for easy removal here is the treasure that the pirates seek the treasure rests on tiles inside of the rock. the zebra print tribal drum this is simple but nice. one thing that's great about this which i mentioned earlier, is that this and all of the other pieces with designs on them are printed. that's right, no stickers to be found here! i have used these zebra-print tiles many times for mocs, as they make a great exotic detail piece. the lovely rock head i think this is wonderful. it really adds a lot to the set. it is well built with grey slopes, curved pieces for the mouth and nose, headlight bricks for the eyes and feathers and horns for detail. the backside the complete set! overall, this looks great in my opinion with great landscaping and some fun parts. well, it looks like the pirates walked all over the islanders and stole their treasure... in fact, it looks like it was pretty brutal. brickshelf folder now, for the the ratings! price: 8/10 (for $17 not a great price per piece value. but when you add 5 figs in, it makes it a decent price. plus this set hasn't been in stores for 14 years so that adds some cost) parts: 9/10 (the set has some really nice printed parts, as well as a baseplate, which in my opinion, is great) design: 9/10: (no flaws that i can think of right away. the rock face is very well built) playability: 8/10 (not really anything to play with, although you can sail the ship and steal the treasure) build: 9/10 (rock face uses nice techniques and the rest of the set is simple but looks good) minifigs: 10/10 (the minifigs are just fantastic. great prints, and just overall fun. overall: 53/60 bricklink entry peeron brickset it looks like the pirates have picked up a new recruit from the island... summary the older lego sets have a really different look to them than the new sets, and i think it's nice to have a mix of new and old. this is definitely a great set with a nice build and great minifigs. add to this the great printed pieces and that old pirate charm, and you get a very nice set that i can certainly recommend. thanks, and happy building! edited by erdbeereis, 17 august 2009 - 02:39 am.

0 erdbeereis1, i've had a quick look your review and i must say it's quite superb! i'm dead tired so i'm going to take a nap but i'll be back later to read it more thoroughly.

1 an outstanding set because who doesn't love islanders. outstanding review as well.

1 very solid set. 5 minifigs and plenty of weapons to go around, adding up to great playability, what more could you want? (aspecially from a set this size) only i would have liked another cutlass, a musket (instead of 1 of the pistols) and for 1 of the pirates to have another head, but those things are no big deal, it is still a lot better than sets nowadays. edited by fluyt, 23 december 2008 - 09:50 pm.

0 i switched my shock trooper legs as soon as i got this set. as for the new pieces, i'm pretty sure that they were also featured in the striking venom set. nice in depth review! i switched my shock trooper legs as soon as i got this set. as for the new pieces, i'm pretty sure that they were also featured in the striking venom set. nice in depth review!

1 stauder, on aug 29 2008, 08:45 am, said: has anyone noticed the boxart includes the 3rd leg both in the lowerd position as well as the raised one? stauder. i believe that's to show off the functions of the set. nice review, you carefully explained every detail and i think that i'll buy this set now. i'm glad lego decided to make two seat's in the interior and they did a very nice job on the third leg looking good both up and down. i think i will switch the hips of the shock troopers into black, like the other shock troopers.

-1 i like this set, but i don't like the pure white legs for the shock troopers. it looked better with the black leg joint piece. i also think the set looks like half an at-te.

0 did anyone encounter the problem with the main turret? apparently, the very tip of the piece (cone shape) can't be put onto the "pole" piece. i check the instructions 2 times and still can't find what i'm doing wrong. is it just me or did anyone else got this problem as well?

-1 i could have gotten this set if i wanted to but it seemed like a waste of money to me. i don't like the shock troopers helmets that much. i feel they should have printed visors instead of cut out ones like they have in my opinion it would make it look a lot better. the at ap itself sounds like it has a lot of holes in its cockpit which drags the set down and make it seem like they haven't exactly put a lot of effort into it. great review!

1 wow talk about a bumper! nice review baby! this set is quite nice, i would have goten it if i had had the money but didn't back then so didn't get it. it has a nice parts selection! why did lego do the shock troopers with white hips? and the bp ones have black hips. confusers me. commanderfox

1 i did enjoy it thanks for sharing your thoughts in this set and reviewing it. i'll add it to the index. maybe you should consider joining the reviewers academy and rule the galaxy (or something )

0 doctor sinister, on aug 30 2008, 08:22 pm, said: i assumed it was the droid's eye. great review btw. now i know what all the little bits are! i have this set as well, i quite like the droid. dr. s. dr. s. yup, only notice it after re-watching aotc. it's the sensor for visual data. tlc gave the better effect than hasbro, since they made it glow like in the movie. kimt, not at the moment, since i have slowed down quite abit due to my day job. though, i still definitely enjoy the company here to contribute more reviews when available(meaning after i find a better way to co-exist both my hasbro and lego stuff spending). millacol88, yup, those accessories definitely makes me want to start lego clone troop building.

-1 there's plenty of reviews in the review index. (pinned topic)

0 alakazam! the good wizard is the wisest minifig in all of legoland. he is a master of the wand and can see the future. with these abilities, he helps the knights predict where the trolls will strike next. because this set is not in stores in the u.s., i was luckily able to buy this set on my vacation to germany. it is interesting that it is a euro exclusive. 5614 the good wizard set info set name: 5614 the good wizard theme: castle released: 2008 price: eur 2.95-gbp 1.99 pieces: 16 minifigs: 1 the review unfortunately i don't have the box, because in got smushed in my suitcase on the plane, so needless to say, it was not in top condition... the manual the manual is an extremely small fold-out. but the image on the front is nice. on the back of the manual, there is a picture of some of the 2008 impulse sets. this is a nice feature. the parts for an impulse set this has a pretty good selection. a very nice owl, and an interesting clear ball piece. all built this set took me forever to build. i had to take numerous breaks as it was the toughest, longest build i have ever faced! for an impulse set, this actually looks pretty good. the owl perch is nice, also the crystal ball table. the wizard is a very nice fig, with great printing on the legs and hat, and i love his beard. brickshelf gallery the ratings price: 8/10 (not bad, but i feel that impulse sets are slightly overpriced) parts: 7/10 (impulse sets are focused around the minifig, but the parts in this set are pretty good) design: 7/10 (the crystal ball is a good idea, and the owl perch is simple but nice) playability: 6/10 (there is not much to play with here) build: 8/10 (as i said before, it took forever. really it took all of 1 minute) minifig: 10/10 (the wizard is fantastic) overall: 46/60 bricklink lego s@h brickset abracadabra, blades of four... you are now a dinosaur! summary for an impulse set, this is very nice. the wizard is an excellent fig, and getting an animal in a cheap set is always great. i would definitely recommend this set. thanks, and happy building!

0 good review for a simple set. while it does come with the basics for an impulse set, i just feel that it lacks something though i am not sure what. perhaps a printed magic scroll? i am still not a fan of the printed cap (especially the stars), but i do like the printed pants displaying his various goodies hanging from his belt. the plain torso is to be expected from a wizard minifig i suppose. overall, it's not a bad set but it certainly feels to be lacking something, imo.

0 kudos on a well presented and written review. i think the reason this set didn't release in us was because it didn't have any warnings about choking anywhere on the box, therefore no lawsuits in us for lego. cheers isc

1 cardinal brick, on aug 30 2008, 06:23 pm, said: the question is what could you do with this set, i mean its just spacemen in a line? what could you do? the possibilities are endless!! 1. you can stand them in a line 2. stand them in a circle 3. stand them in a square 4. sit them all down 5. sit some of them down and leave some standing up (adult supervision may be necessary for tfols attempting this one) 6. take them all apart and scatter the pieces like some kind of huge space mine has gone off 7. yeah, ok. that's probably enough for now seriously, i love all the sets of minifigs from all the different themes and this is a great one. i always wanted them when i was a kid but never did. my focus always was on town sets (petrol stations and police sets please stand up) and there was never enough pocket money left over for space. sigh! you are so lucky to have this great set! thanks for sharing cheers rog

1 thanks for the review! the latter space mini-fig sets were great as they gave a nice variety of men. i'd love this one...

1 nice set, lucky you! the only reason i buy the mm impulse sets is lack of good space minifig packs like this nowadays ...

1 7670: hailfire tank and spider droid number of pieces: 249 number of minifigs: 4 price: 19.99 usd/ 25.99 eur/ 19.99 gbp brickset hello everyone, today i will review the extremely underrated hailfire tank and spider droid set. i hope this review does it justice. so, let's start with the box: note: this picture is not mine. standard box for star wars in that time. the background on the box looks like it's from geonosis, indicating that this set is from episode ii, and not iii or the clone wars. the back of the box (not shown) shows the playability functions and some other sets that were released at the same time as this. overview here is an overview of the whole set. it comes with one construction manual and no sticker sheets ( ). this is a very simple set, but with not much to it, it is still a very important part of the cis army, especially if you are interested in army building. i like to call this set a "super battle pack", and you'll find out why soon. let's get right to it, and look at the feature of the set: the hailfire tank. front a front view of the very cool tank. here you can see two triangular shields on the hull. the main body is very simple, but altogether very effective and clever, and making it really look like a hailfire tank, although a little bit sized down from it's movie version. the trans-red stud used as the "eye" makes the tank look more menacing. side the side view. the wheels are very easy to make, but it's a real pain to connect all of those chain links together. i don't see what you could use the links for, except for another tank, but maybe someone creative will find something for these. the dark tan is nice though. the wheels are held on by technic poles, and the tank rolls on the wheels fairly well on carpet or a hard surface. back this is the back of the tank. here you can see eight flick-fire missiles (four on each side) of the new type, so they don't easily fall out. also note the modified 2x2 with extended hole piece sticking out of the back. this may be used to easily push around the tank. i just wish you could fit a droid in the body for the cockpit... now we move on to the spider droid, or what i like to call "the dwarf spider": the front. this one is also simple, but very cleverly built. the main body is two semi-spheres connected together for rotation, and an antenna, a cannon, four legs, and eyes made out of a useful telephone piece. the picture speaks for itself as far as how the gun and eyes are built. side a side view. you can now see the legs better, which are more sturdy then you would think. each one is made out of two pearl bronze exo-force robot arms, a useful bley handgun piece, and a dark bley battle droid body, all connected to the under body (a big knob-like piece). back the back. not much to say here. i like this spider droid because it is very sturdy, and the legs are easy to adjust. finally, we look at the minifigs: there are four minifigs in this set, which is quite generous for a set of this size. it comes with a yellow battle droid commander (i really like this one), two battle droids, and a super battle droid. all three battle droids have the new blaster pistols and one twisted arm. that's about it for the review, so here is the final verdict: build: 8/10, very fun and easy, besides the chain links. should take the seasoned builder less than 20 minutes. playability: 7/10, the flick-fire missiles are fun, as well as just zooming around the tank. could use some clones for a battle. swooshability: 8/10, you can roll around the hailfire fairly well. minifigs: 9/10, a generous amount of figs, and all are pretty good. design: 9.5/10, a really simple and clever set, although a little too small for the movie version. price: 10/10, a very fair price considering the price-per-parts ratio and the coolness of the set. overall score: 8.5/10, a very neat set to have, a great army builder, and great for display next to all of the other cis sets. the price is fair, the figs are good, and the build is very clever. that's all for now, folks. please feel free to give some feedback! edited by jimbutcher, 15 september 2008 - 03:08 am.

-1 kimt, on aug 30 2008, 04:21 pm, said: thanks for sharing this review with us. i think this one of the sets. in europe this thing is waaaay overpriced and thus makes it a crappy set. we pay nearly double the us price. so i rated it poor. also because the figs included does not make it great. the hailfire is well designed and looks great, but that's just about all there is worthy of a positive mentioning. sorry. [on a side note: as a bronze-awarded student, where's the price in eur and gbp? and where's the poll?] [nevermind the poll, i've added that one for you ] oh yes, i will add the other prices, and i was going to make a poll for it (i made one for the homing spider review), but you beat me to it. thanks!

1 thanks for the review, jimbutcher. i really like that set. it combines interesting and good design with some awesome cool parts and a neat amount of charm.

1 this is a great set, i have 2 of them now, and i plan to get more. it is much better than the droid battle pack. for 10 bucks more, you get better battle droid arms and some canon "vehicles", good enough for me.

1 kimt, on aug 30 2008, 05:27 pm, said: i just bought this set the other day and i must admit that it gets a "below average" from me. the price is not corresponding with what you get. which would be implied, had jim added the eur or gbp price in the info[hint hint ] the spider droid is flimsy at best. making it stand or even move without tumbling over is hard. also why the brown cylinders on the legs? keep the colourscheme clean, please. the figs are fine, except that i dislike the clone headgear and the fact that the helmets now have holes in the sides, allowing the flesh head to show within = goofy looking. i am soo replacing the clone heads with black ones. great review of an acceptable set aw, that's too bad, kimt. while i must admit it is flimsy, i still love this set. oh yeah, i added the other prices, thank you.

1 thank you for that good review, jimbutcher. i think that this is really a pretty interesting and original looking set. maybe its not very stable, but it owns some special 'war of the worlds' charm for sure...

0 mass-manufactured and designed to withstand extreme amounts of punishment... it's an iron drone, and it's marching on its sentry! set data 7711: sentry year: 2006 theme: exo-force subtheme: robots pieces: 74 (+4 extra) <- both counting hinge control stick and its base as two separate pieces price: euro 7 circa, misb, including s/h, on ebay; rrp was euro 5 circa / 5 usd. probably 5 ukp. building time: 20/25 minutes (10 minutes building, the rest of the time placing stickers!) more info: brickset - peeron being 2006 my last dark year, i wasn't a big exoforce fan but they were ok. i tought 2007 models were better, and still think 2008 models are the best. that basically means 1) it's a shame that there will be no more of this line and 2) this is my first 2006 model, yet i bought in in july 2008. ok, let's do this one. box front: box was battered due to italian post; they'll do their best to give lego boxes a "war" outlook. close-up: the japanese katakana read "tokushu butai" -> special (military) force(s) box back: amazing alternate model; some like it more than the original design. box content: a small but capable sticker sheet, two bags and instructions. sticker sheet: and they're numbered! random instructions page: connecting legs to the body instructions page - sticker detail: that's why they're numbered. instructions page - parts inventory: does anybody check if they're all there before building? surely not me. loose pieces: nothing rare, i think; small techinc parts come in different colours, as usual (you often don't see them when the model is complete, but sometimes you do) the iron drone: "strong and durable" (and much better looking than those crappy mm jelly aliens) building starts. the open cockpit - front and rear view left leg - front and rear view; right leg is built of the same pieces. left arm - with laser cannon the cannon - great use of the hollow studs with the "plant tree palm top" right arm - with twin missiles complete model - front view complete model - side view and rear view rating and review. parts and building: nothing new, but both models are o.k. instead of waiting the last page of the manual, you'd better put the stickers in place while building. looking at the box you'd tell stickers background is (trans) purple. it actually is trans clear (excpet for the yellow and black stripes - warning: hazard!). try not to put your fingerprints on the sticky side! consider using tweezers. posability: both legs and both arms feature three joints; and that's good, so that the weight doesn't have the sentry falling down. final model: smaller compared to 2007 claw crusher and 2008 batlle arachnoid, but cheaper and surely worth the money. the "minifig" is just another iron drone, not much to say. final rating: 3,5/5 edited by sinner, 01 september 2008 - 02:22 am.

1 thank you for that fine review, thebrickster! i really like how this two small sets create an intense and adventurous atmosphere against the backdrop of a pretty exotic region. the setsre well designed and very nice with a fine amount of rather unique and well fitting gear. the whole theme offers a lot of playability in a set-up thats a little different to tlcs standard sceneries for sure. and... it always reminded me of 'who goes there?', too...

-1 a nice set review. as for the theme itself, i though it was a very interesting theme. sadly i dont think lego put enough effort into it, i was personally upset not to se a second year even if i didnt buy any of the sets. it reminds me of the artic theme playmobil did at one point in the distant past to be honest. i think a number of good artic scenes were missed, when it came out a really wanted to get a ski plane but it never came, i built it myself in the end but i dont know how lego missed that one. on a slightly random note i do know that at least one lego minifig did make it all the way to the real artic with a research team, sadly i dont have any pictures to offer you.

0 4645?4?n, 74121?7?w??? those are some wierd coordinates.

1 great review, i hope tlc does another. i rember reading a book once based on the theme which stated the scorpions and thespiders and such were aliens .

1 great review, whitefang and co.! a thoroughly enjoyable one, i'm glad we have a series of reviews that you can expect to be packed with humour and craziness. looking forward to the next! ~peace

0 imperialshadows, on sep 1 2008, 06:57 pm, said: it's amazing! it's stupendous! it's almost like whitefang is a reviewer with previous experience! it's almost like i wrote all of shadow's lines! it's almost like staudie is being as annoying as ever. oh wait, that's all true! great review of a neat little set. i used mine as the air conditioning unit on the roof of my chinese restaurant. then some dork told me it didn't look believable or something. i liked it. um... so. great review! thanks for presenting it! i give you a that amazing x factor is supposed to be the magical touch of eb news team! glad to see it falling in place! oh, i want to take a look on how you have make use of a jet turbine engine turning it into an air conditioner unit. imperialshadows, on sep 1 2008, 06:57 pm, said: and, let's just take a moment to get sentimental. a year ago, today, staudie had a lame idea: interview the members of eb. he flailed around with it for a few interviews, including the infamous one where hinck attention whored sinner into a corner and sinner were featured, reprising their roles from the whacker and the walrus. it was quite memorable, but then, a short time later, someone new joined the team, bringing it to a new level of polish and bad jokes. still, this tribute isn't dedicated to that genius of the written word, nay, it's dedicated to the whole staff, including the new guy who is still a secret so don't bother asking, i'm not telling! ha! i salute you, eb news, it's been a damn fine year! that is some fine history from the eb news. i wonder how staudie can keep up with his sanity, asking questions around. i am so happy to be part of the team. happy eb news 1 year anniversary! imperialshadows, on sep 1 2008, 06:57 pm, said: i hope i can survive another. minus away the earlier mishaps, i am sure you are able to survive another year. iamded, on sep 1 2008, 07:13 pm, said: great review, whitefang and co.! a thoroughly enjoyable one, i'm glad we have a series of reviews that you can expect to be packed with humour and craziness. looking forward to the next! be sure to watch out for the next one. well, i have not planned for the next one though. adam, on sep 2 2008, 06:08 am, said: it can never be a happy ending for stuadie! so why did you give him one? nice review give staudie a break! he deserved to have some good treatment at times! you had spelt staudie's name wrongly. geez, i am sure he will be driving the quad bike ramming towards you.

1 i chose above average. it has a great minifigure.... i wish i had it....someday i will!

0 you already know how i feel about the review. as for the set, i'm not entirely sure. it's a fine witch, but you've already gotten her in the witch's windship and a few other sets. i vote average on this. a good minifig (though one does not have the need for more than one witch) and some fine additional parts.

0 this is a very good review, no doubt about it. about this set, this is a cheap way to buy this set with a witch and some nifty accessories such as the black cat. in fact, i think this is the first time i had ever seen a black cat. it's simple, but not very useful in my collection. because other fright knight sets also offer the witches too. i don't need many witches. overall, i feel that this is an average set.

1 yay, another fright knights review! odd comic at the end. skipper 24, on sep 1 2008, 07:05 pm, said: ever wanted to turn into a animal, wanted to curse your enemy or just wanted to be rich beyond your wildest dreams. you should go visit the witch and her fireplace. she can brew you up a potion for any occasion or purpose. so head down to see the witch right now. sounds like a song or nursery rhyme, somehow. anyway, to the review, it is a great review, such a small set but you've summed it up well. this is one of the few unpromo fright knight sets i didn't get, sadly. not 'sadly' because of willa the witch, i have about four of her, but the special cat, and the other bits (one can never have too many lego bats). i voted the set outstanding, i think it is for its size. kimt, on sep 1 2008, 08:16 pm, said: you already know how i feel about the review. good or bad feelings? edited by shoc, 02 september 2008 - 11:45 am.

1 thanks for the cool review! as for the set: a witch, a bat and a black cat!!! that's more than enough for such a small set!

0 i voted "average" think the minifig and black cat are great.

0 yeah this was an ok set. i remember getting a few of these at tru. the boxes were smashed up and i got some 30 percent off. (still not as cheap as regular us price ) some ok bricks and a great minifig. thanks for sharing your thoughts and opinions on this set i'll rate this set as average. oh, yeah i've added the review to the index.

1 great review of a neat way to bulk up your castle guards and their associated weapons and shields. i hope we continue to see sets like this in the future, they have to be a good money maker for tlg and they always please the fans. francis marion, on sep 2 2008, 10:39 am, said: they should have given him a horse ... with that lovely new barding. nobody would complain about the price then, even if it was $15.

0 imperialshadows, on sep 2 2008, 08:46 am, said: ... with that lovely new barding. nobody would complain about the price then, even if it was $15. i sure wouldn't... especially if it was the silver chainmail barding.

0 the cobra, on sep 2 2008, 11:33 am, said: - why are the figures already built? are today's kids so dumb? let's go back to those old minifig packs! probably to reduce the size/complexity of the package, thus, saving tlc money. i don't see it being a big deal as customization is always an option. concerning the set: not much to say other than it does what it's suppose to do: build up one's army of knights. the variance of faces and accessories are great. i especially love the chrome sword. the price isn't bad either since the package comes with five nice figs and some great equipment. edited by dj2005, 03 september 2008 - 06:46 am.

0 i was going to get this, but when i rang up s&h, apparently they'd sold out already. price is a little on the steep side as well, and i can only see it going up on sites such as amazon as the number of people wanting them goes up, which it will it it's anything based on the star wars battle packs.

0 how were you able to get three small shields. i only got two in mine. i am going to check the trash just in case.

0 swman, on oct 6 2008, 07:27 am, said: how were you able to get three small shields. i only got two in mine. i am going to check the trash just in case. i think it only comes with two. the extra one probably slipped in from another set. sorry for any confusion!

0 i think this battle pack is a little expensive, but the minifig ,their heads and weapons and stuff are very very nice! but because of the price, i'll rate it " average" ^^

0 it's an ok set, but it's extremely overpriced where i live. i simply couldn't justify paying $17.99 +tax for 5 minifigs. the fact that these figures are featured prominantly in other sets makes this set a difficult purchase. given the price, i find it hard to look at this set with much enthusiasm.

-1 it's way to expansive for what you get, besides you pay more for the package then its containts...

0 dear all, i found this to be a very usefull army building set. at 2 euro per minifig it is relatively cheap in my book, so i bought 4 battle packs recently. although, it could be difficult to integrate all of them in your army. personally, i reshuffled some of the weapons as to integrate them better. but that is a personal preference ofcourse. kind regards, teddy

1 set name: crossbow attack set number: 7090 theme: castle pieces: 54 minifigs: 3 released: 2007 price: 5.99usd, 3.99 eur, 7.99 cdn legoshop.com description: ready, aim, fire!it's a battle of brave knights against the evil skeleton rider! includes 2 knights, skeleton and a skeleton horse! rolling wagon has a launcher that really fires! bricklink inventory peeron inventory brickshelf gallery now, on to the review! the box as you can see, the front of the box illustrates the set very nicely, showing the skeleton warrior attacking and the knights firing their crossbow. the back the back of the box shows a small battle happening between a knight and a skeleton, as well as the main feature of the set, the firing crossbow (more on that later.) the instructions not much to say here, its the same as the front of the box. the back of the instructions this merely shows pictures of other sets in the castle line. random instruction page this set does not use piece callouts to tell you what parts you will need in each step. however, the set is so small you should never have trouble finding a piece. the minifigures this is the main reason i bought this set. you get two knights, one with a standard helmet, and the other one with a new mold. you also get a skeleton warrior. the horse the set comes with a skeleton horse that looks great. however, it is a single molded piece that has no articulation. close-up of the warrior riding his horse here you see the brave skeleton riding in on his...ah......er......um......noble steed! the accessories/weapons for minifigure accessories, you get an axe, a skeleton sword, and a skeleton shield. extra pieces i was left with one skeleton arm and one leg when i was finished the build. the crossbow wagon and now, to the main part of the set, the crossbow wagon. it is really just a plate with some whells attached and a lot of those cheese wedge pieces to create the track for the projectile. back view this view shows the mechanism that makes the crossbow fire. it is powered by a rubber band. you pull back on a technic piece, which creates tension in the elastic band. when you let go, the elastic pushes the piece forward, which in turn hits the projectile and makes it fire! it works fairly well, but i would have prefered it fired farther. entire set the skeleton charges at his adversaries! the knights prepare to counterattack! overall build: 10/10 the build is simple, easy and quick. set design: 7/10 the crossbow could have worked a bit better. playability: 8/10 the crossbow is fun to shoot. minifigs: 10/10 it doent get much better than this. i love that domed helmet mold! price: 8/10 the set is very affordable and worth the price. overall score:43/50 conclusion overall, this is a great set and a solid army builder. you get three minifigures for a fair price and the crossbow wagon adds some much-needed playability. i bought two of these to bolster my army and to stock up on those rare domed helmet pieces. basically, get this set! thank you for taking the time to read my review. i hope you liked it!

0 nice review, to start off. you got all the details someone could possibly need, in my opinion at least. i do enjoy this set as well, and i've bought only one to keep my minifigs as unique as possible. despite my personal preference, i still find this a nice army builder. good amount of minifigs for the price, as mentioned earlier, with each being different from the other. though i would like the catapult manager to be armed with at least something, i still feel that he can just flee if he's ever in trouble. he's a good guy to use for the castle gimmics if you have it. one more small comment. i also love those domed helmets, even if they aren't actually new. my favorite of them all, being followed up by the racer helmet.

0 nice review . i still thing sets like this are the reason castle has done so well, it allows you to collect a large number of minfig for not very much cash, which i certainly indulged in. my only complaint is that you end up with the evil skeletons out numbered, however heard of the good guys winning with the numbers in their favour.

0 millacol88, on sep 6 2008, 01:55 am, said: i've experienced that problem too. i find my knights outnumber my skellies about 3:1. a crownie dies easyer than a skeleton. it's so hard to perforate the lungs or pierce the heart on a skeleton with a spear or crossbow bolt, isn't it? a great set with a reasonable price. thanks for sharing it with us. added to the index.

0 i really like this set, and it's probably my next purchase from a store (if i can still find it). there's alot of great pieces (i especially like the spiked thingy on the front), and it makes a great addition for any skeletal army. above all, i just love the spine-chilling feeling of it. if i were a minifig in a legoland, i'd be scared out of my pants-piece if i saw a carriage like that rolling towards me in a dark night.

1 one of the best sets from the new castle theme. we havent seen a carriage in a long long time. and it looks so spooky and sceary! lots of minifigs new skeleton horses (3!) this was the first set i got from the new castle theme!! outstanding!

1 i bought this set to have the scared minifig, but i found a lot of cool pieces and stuffs... i love this set ^^

1 that's a super review erdbeereis1, as usual and as we can expect from one of the academy teachers. i gave the set a 4 (above average) because i think there are quite some minifigs included for its price (which is, i think, not that expensive at all) i also like the parts that are included, like the sceleton horses and weapons, wheels,... imho this set is a great armybuilder ! btw: in belgium i have seen this set being sold for 15,99 euros.

0 big cam, on nov 20 2009, 10:41 am, said: you say in the review it's great to get 9 minifig's, but there are only 2 minifigs and 3 skeletons?? he's probably counting the four horses as well.

1 7040 dwarves' mine defender theme: castle released: 2008 price: 10 usd pieces: 73 (3 minifigures) introduction: here i am, with one of the newest castle sets realeased in early 2008. it's a small battle wagon with blades on the front, probably to demolish rocks in mines. but in this case, our hero dwarf has to use his machine against the evil trolls who want to destroy his happy kingdom. there is only one small booklet for instructions, no alternate model: parts come in two bags, one for small pieces and one for bigger ones: apart from the lovely figures, the brown parts will be quite useful for any castle builder. extra parts are not even worth mentioning, there are no stickers: figures are detailed enough, dwarf is lovely with his beard but his legs won't move because he is short: figures are the main attraction for adult players. we haven't seen castle army builder sets for a long while and this is closest we've got in recent years. the dwarf is a little taller than it should have been but it's not possible to do so without creating a completely new mould for figures and that would be expensive. its beard is oversized as well but that gives him a legoish look which i like a lot. the trolls - that's what everybody calls them but i say they are orcs - are obviously evil but they are friendly enough not to scare our munchkins. but i wish they had different torsos or at least different faces like crownies. there are not enough weapons to arm everyone but the flag pole is really nice: unlike the star wars army builders, this set has very little weaponry. only one sword and one pike creates scarcity for 3 figures - star wars sets had 4 figures for same price! so i hope our middle age warriors don't come across any stormtroopers :) building in progress: when you pull the chain the catapult fires a round brick: the set has quite good playability, moving blades and firing catapult should be fun for little children. i wouldn't expect more functions for such a small sized model, it hardly covers my hand. the blades move with the front wheel on the right: there is only one little downside, there is too much friction for the wheel and blades won't move synchronized. you may come over this problem by adjusting the blade height and lining them with the wheels. mow the little buggers! you can adjust the blade height: there isn't enough room for the dwarf: folder when public: http://www.brickshel...ry.cgi?f=338578 rating: -figures: 8/10 dwarf is amazing, trolls are great too but i wish they had different faces. -parts: 7/10 brown slopes are new, rest is ok too. -price: 7/10 acceptable but we have seen sets with more figures for less. -design: 6/10 it looks kind of steampunkish but could be better with a little detail. -building: 6/10 not repeating itself, still nothing exciting. -total: 34/50 castle fans will definetely order this one but average lego player may not be interested. conclusion: overall, it's a nice set and i'd recommend it if you like the castle theme. you'll find some good use for the figures and this is the cheapest figure set of the year - at 3.33 usd each. it could have more armory and weaponry but otherwise it's quite alright. skip lunch today and order this little set! links: brickset reviews bricklink entry peeron inventory

1 best. set. ever. i got my copy years ago from a guy on the old rec.toys.lego newsgroup (anybody here still remember that newsgroup??). i traded him a guarded inn, a black falcon's fortress, and a couple other small castle sets for it. no regrets on that trade. it is hard to incorporate a monorail into a town, especially if you have a bunch of trains too! i ended up making my entire monorail system elevated. there's just no easy way to make a monorail / road crossing. i also gave up on having it run in a loop. instead, it runs back and forth between two endpoints.

1 this remains the definitive city set in my eyes. i never managed to get one but from the instructions it seems to be perfect in just about every way. i got the two space monorails a while ago but the much higher prices on this one have kept it out my reach. this set is a lot bigger than either of those though. i always liked the monorail system a bit better than the trains because you could easily incorporate height into the tracks and spread them out in all three dimensions. quote edit: and bricklink is wrong giving 1991 as the release date. you're right; it was 1990. it was apparently released in 1990 in europe and 1991 in north america, going by some us and german catalogs i have from that time period. edited by cp5670, 06 september 2008 - 06:06 am.

0 thanks for all the nice comments! holodoc, on sep 5 2008, 11:05 am, said: i had to laugh when reading your comment on the minifig seats. don?t you own many of those? i don?t know where to put mine... well, of course i do have quite some seats (a drawer full actually), but this was my first set that had them in black... when i was young however (long time ago, you know ) i always had a short supply of seats, so that's why i noticed and mentioned it.... whitefang, on sep 5 2008, 02:18 pm, said: this is an outstanding review which deserved to be featured here! thank you for drawing attention to this review through classictown.net, i have not been a frequent user of the boards lately and the release has mostly passed me by but i must say that it looks like a great site! whitefang, on sep 6 2008, 06:45 am, said: are the both of you doing grading out of the academy, when he is not a student there? indeed i am no student of the academy, i have another academy (university) to attend to, leaving little time to venture around eurobricks latlely, a shame, i know... i hope my review is in accepted here despite my lack of grades concerning the art form

1 very nice review indeed. b.t.w. a lot of children just love this set. one year we had it with us to legoworld and children asked a lot of questions about it.

1 what an amazing set and a truly wonderful review! thanks simonwillems for the work you spend on this.

-1 judging from videos i've seen it seems that the monorail does very well on slopes. i wonder why there haven't been more or at least an updated set? i also wonder why the trains can't incorporate some slopes like the monorail.

1 yeah its very nice along with all the older sets. i've got the cement mixer that was released around about the same time as this.

1 thanks so much for the great review, i love that truck! i hadn't realized there was a real 4-wide recycle truck out there. i must get it one day to replace this abomination currently doing garbage duty in my town: i think that truck has seven pieces total in it. i do like the blue color though ...

1 i did not see this! nice review and beautiful truck. i like it!

0 i owned it and loved it when i was young ^^ i really miss it.

0 a very robust set. the fact that it seats two figs plus has l&s makes it a unique set. i definitely liked the big airport subtheme tlg created in the early 1990s.

0 perfect perhaps the front sprouses are for foaming the runway? you've certainly kept that set in near mint condition, haven't you? now all we can wish for is a new firetruck combining this l&s version and the new

1 nice review cobra. thanks for sharing. i esp. like the doctor's torso. i rate this little set a 4 based on the design of the vehicle and the classic doors. blogged! edit: i must have missed this review after it was posted back in sep. i went ahead and kept the blog, since it's always enjoyable to look at these reviews.

1 mhh maybe put the pizza horizontally ^^ and gimme some! it was a nice set, it's a nice little crane !

0 i have this one. the newer 6571 station is better in some ways, but i always liked the big airport-style fire engine in this and the windows covering the garages. one mod project i have in mind is to expand the base, adding a second room in the area beneath the control center. interestingly, this set had two different box pictures. there was the original 1989 yellow legoland box and a 1991 blue system box, and the blue box has the vehicles in different places. quote price: usd $85.00 / gbp unknown / eur unknown if this is referring to the original price, it wasn't that much. $50 is more like it.

0 i think the 6382 fire station is the better one from the 80ies.

1 big supie, on sep 7 2008, 09:46 pm, said: i think the 6382 fire station is the better one from the 80ies. i agree, have that 6382 set for about 27 years now, but i have always like that one 'futuristic' truck when i was a child so i also still have some feelings for this set as well. @crazydance: nice review after all!!!

1 from memory argos sold it originally for about 21 gbp. i seem to remember this as i could not afford the airport released the same year as this was about 29.99! seems such a small amount of money now, now have 2 copies of this set, only 1 boxed :-)

1 found this set on a flea market in munich, yesterday. just 25 years after its release. the instructions for a total of five models, two of them printed, the other 3 are just photo instructions in the book. it still has the box in good shape, despite some wear from the age. sadly five little pieces were missing, and 5 wrong pieces inside instead (2 complete wheels and a classic 80s-90s plane wing (dumped into my bricks). but i was able to replace the missing minifig torch and the 4 missing plates with identical pieces from my collection. the box and contents the set still has the original box. inside the pieces, plastic insert, instructions and a 1987 technic catalogue, imagine that set livespan today. four years and the 8841 is still in the catalogue. classic technic design from early 80s showing a function drawing of the steering and the main model a small set, but with a flap shoeing the contents. all pieces in the inner box and the papers included. 5th model: soapbox racer this is more or less a soapbox racer with working steering, but no engine. it's got a rather blocky design, but still looks sleek enough and is a simple build little over 100 pcs out of 180. the soapbox at step 2 just included the steering at step 6 completed and ready to race downhill. total: 7/10 simple, but effective 4th model: simple chassis very simple and boring alternate using just 1/3 of the 180 pieces in the set. it even hasn't got a seat construction. it's just a plain steering mechanism attached on wheels with a spartan chassis of just a few pieces. this is the whole model at step 5 just attach the steering mechanism and wheels and you're done total: the worst alternate model of the complete set. just a boring 4/10 3rd model: balance very original small model. it's a small model of a working classic balance. and it works with small parts laid on the scales, altough they've got just a 4x4 footprint. it's a fast build. just 15 minutes and you've done it. the model as it looks at step 3 finished. easy build with just 63pcs out of 180 total: very original model, it actually works with small weights, but a very simple build. still a 7/10 alternate model: tractor with equipment this is the second model. it's a simple but boxy design featuring a harrow and a plough. the tractor has a similar design to the very first tractor set, but much smaller. the plough is about 24-wide and the harrow is completely snotted even back in 1983. has two functions: working steering and the coupler for the equipment. uses almost all pieces of the set. the tractor at step 8, the steering isn't completely attached now this is the completed tractor the complete harrow finished alternate with the plough attached. total: nice, but quite ugly and boxy design for a tractor with 4 wheels of the same size. takes me to a 6/10 main model: desert racer this is the main model, with a nice (for early 80s) but boxy design. it has two functions. steering and a working 1-cylinder rear engine, which is of the old 2x2 piston type, since the small piston design wasn't invented back then. this is the only model of the set, which has piece callouts in the instructions. the printed alternate model has no callouts, they weren't invented on both models back in 1983. the three smaller photo instruction alternates have a piece callout at the beginning showing all needed pieces. the seat is a nice, but blocky design and use a primitive snot technique. this is the model at step five. the piston is already attached. imagine this state on step 5 in modern sets. back then lego had challenging instructions, not the step madness like today this is the engine just made of plates with a hole in the middle for the piston step 9. the piston engine is completed. on step 12 the roll bar and the seat are installed. only the steering isn't completed yet. front view of the finished model. just 15 steps needed back then. bird's eye view of the whole set displayed on the box model verdict: nice design, especially the colorful seat in snot technique, but quite boxy especially the engine, since there were only the huge pistons. still a 9/10 set verdict: design and models: 7/10, very boxy designs, due to the age. the chassis alternate sucks build: 9/10 classic 80s technic building. quite challenging but fun sturdyness: 7/10: rear section damaged after the table fall, but rather easily fixed fun: 9/10 blast from the past. overall: 8/10 mfg widdi edited by widdi, 07 september 2008 - 04:11 pm.

0 name: electric passenger train set no.: 7725 theme: lego / system / trains / 12v / train set year: 1981 pieces: 485 minifigs: 1 price: usd 70.00$ (which equals about eur 50 and gbp 40) introduction: our most favorite theme is 12v trains. actually i got my first 77-series back in 1981 (5th of december, i was 2,5 years old) just a week before my brother was born. some years later i got the 7740. after our dark ages we (my brother, cousin and myself) got all 12v trains at least once. this 7725 was gathering dust in my brothers' room. the train in all its splendor. as you can see it doesn't occur at the back of the 12v era train instructions although its larger brother the 7740 does. some investigation learned that all the sets at the back of the instructions date from 1980 so the 7725 wasn't released yet. here you can see the front of the 7725 with the driver in the cockpit. the driver is in fact the only minifig that was included in the set. as you can see, our version of the train has a different front than the one in the instructions. apparently the former owner used 7861 (lighting set (12 v)) to upgrade the train with working back- and frontlights. i like the original lights but didn't notice that the train had those double lights until i did the review. maybe we will give the train again it's original signs and put custom leds in it or so so that the train can drive into two directions with accurately working lights. another thing about the lights that puzzle me are the backlights. while typing this i realise that the former owner might have added those, so let's have a look at the instructions then. as it turns out, the lights are there also in the instructions. i recently learned that only the last car or coach of a train has it's red lights on. so unless the train drives with only the front car it will never use those red backlights. here you can see the cockpit with the engineer. the cables don't look very pretty but well, the train at least has working light. here you can take a look at the inside of the engine car. while the 7745 has a nice 'fake engine' there, just the weight bricks and the ugly cables, apart from the engineer and his cockpit, no other nice features here. b.t.w. lego always used tiles in such a trains to make it easier for kids to take off the roof and have access to the minifig passengers etc. here the 'proof' that it is an electric train. the pantograph of the front car. it has the same kind of panthographs that the 7745 has. the middle car has 4 chairs. as you can see, some vandal must have nocked over this one. hope they leave the cables alone. this early morning train seems to have one passenger: a workman. i like the small 2x3 windows from this car very much! they give this care a nice look. also the door in the middle adds something special to the train. as far as i know, no other passenger train has the doors in the middle. here you see the side of the train, just after the train has left brickingham station where the worker, probably from set 6647 (highway repair) that was also released in 1980. a closeup of the last car with steering stand to allow the train to travel back and forth without having to 'make head', in other words: putting the engine in front again. the train, shunted to an end track so it can be cleaned (i think it is apparent that it definitely needs cleaning very badly). this set can be found on: peeron lugnet brickset bricklink entries playability: 5/10 (the train is fine, but with only one minifig not very playable without other sets; also no accessories at all!) design: 7/10 (nice train, the inside could have been a lot better, but i really like to original front lights!) price: 7/10 (the train came with motor so not a bad price, goes now for quite some money at ebay.) overall: 6.5/10 (nice set but the 7745 is a better train i'm sure) well that was it for today. i hope you have enjoyed this review and got tears in your eyes seeing how nice the 12v era was... it never comes back, but maybe lego rereleases some of this sets in the 2009+ train era (very likely that this is just wishful thinking). edited by jopiek, 12 september 2008 - 04:56 pm.

1 a very nice review, jopiek! you know, i was wondering how lego could justify having two 12v-powered passenger trains at the same time, but after reading the review, and seeing the lack of figures and accessories, i guess i understand why (plus the train is rather compact). oh, and i can't help but think that the chairs in the middle carriage are somewhat oddly placed, because those placed next to the door are unusable because the door takes up room needed for figs' arms. also, it appears that your set also has the newer couplers, i.e. there's no hooks for the decoupling rail to grab hold of. with the light assembly it really won't matter, play-wise, or if you don't have any decouplers, but it's still a bit of a bummer.

0 are you going to review the other 12v sets if you have the time?

0 beach cruisers set #: 6445 theme: island xtreme stunts year released: 2002 piece count: 97 minifigs: 2 list price: $7 (usd) during a trip to legoland california in 2002, their big store had a neat little display of some new sets and themes including island xtreme stunts. the new theme offered great colors including orange, tan, and light blue; which immediately caught my eye. the theme focussed on island fun with some adventure, and included some great figs like the brickster. i had to buy at least one set choosing truck & stunts trike (review coming soon) at the time. the theme was short lived and many of the sets were on sale at discount toy stores not too long after their initial release. i picked up this set, 6445 beach cruisers for $3.33 (usd), which will be my first of three island xtreme stunt reviews. starting with the box, a race between the street surfer and skate boarder: the back shows some alternate models including a sail boat and jet ski: same image on the instructions as the box: but the backside shows the island xtreme stunts video game for different platforms: the set includes a small decal sheet for the skateboard: i love the two figs included within this set. one is a "hippie-type" with shades and leafed muscle short, and the other "pizza boy" skateboarder. check out the "pizza boy" on his skateboard: two green brackets are included for attaching each fig to the long grey bar. using this piece, one can make the skateboarder do tricks and flips. the "street surfer" vehicle is pretty nice to: the sail is placed on a black bar and lance, then attached to the vehicle: here's a picture of the vehicle. to me, it has that old "soap box derby" look to it - like something kids would create to race down a hill: the vehicle doesn't have a steering wheel, but rather two levers which i think work well in the cockpit: here's the underside: the set has three neon orange wheels that attach to technic axle pins to attach to the vehicle: lastly, the entire set with a few extra pieces: final thoughts while island xtreme stunts is not the best city/town sub-theme, esp. for the traditional lego classic town fan, it does have some fun sets like this little beach cruiser. good figs, a skateboard, and a very "rollable" (fun word equivalent to "swooshable" but for vehicles with wheels), vehicle. you can even blow on the sail to get it to roll across the floor. this set is a lot of fun!

1 great review! i would buy the sets, but sadly tlc doesn't sell them anymore. i have one question only: how can you be reviewing at this time at night!?! i would never dream of doing that! well i can't wait to see the other reviews!

-1 her name was sky lane. it's quite sad, though, to actually play the game--the "xtreme tower" is the only set that made it into the game itself, and it was a really watered down version of the information center from the first two games. but the island was, in the game, filled with incredible buildings that would have made really cool sets.

0 hippie dude? thats snap lockitt, island xtreme is one of the best themes ever, im trying to get the sets off bricklink, thanks fo the review i need this now.

1 this is a really nice small set i think. it fascinates me that those are actual printed parts. that's something we don't see too often anymore. the figures are very good, although i must say i like the name hippie dude better than snap lockitt. does anyone know why the brickster has one blue hand? thanks for the great review! edited by erdbeereis1, 09 september 2008 - 06:45 pm.

1 nice review white fang. this really reminds me of an "all-american" set with its red, white, and blue colors (and the white stars). although i really like the fig with its scruffy bearded face, i find the green torso a bit odd for this set. i suppose i would expect some sort of red/blue racer fig with a white/blue racing helmet. swamp sharks - too funny! . you always add a nice addition of humor to your reviews. now i'm going to check out some wonder woman clips on youtube.

1 i love the classic sets of that era and a great review helps show off the simplicity of some older sets.

1 what would we do without the trucks of legoland to clean up our town? well, i didn't want to find out, so i bought this set straight away! 7991 recycle truck set info set name: 7991 recycle truck released: 2007 theme: city price: usd 14.99-gbp 12.99-eur 14.95 pieces: 206 minifigs: 1 review time! leading off, the box the front shows the recycle man loading up... the trash can? one thing here is really bizarre. on lego s@h and everywhere else, it says that this set is called recycle truck. which makes sense as it has a recycle logo on the truck. however, on my box, it says the set is called garbage truck has this happened to anyone else? or is it just me... here is the back of the box which shows some of the things you can do with this set. the bags with this set you get 3 bags which are numbered. and do you see what i see? yes, that's right, the dss is in a bag so it doesn't get bent! why tlg doesn't do this more often is beyond me... bag #1 the set comes with a very nice selection of pieces. a large number of these are orange. manual silly me, i forgot to take a picture of the front of the manual. the picture is the same as on the front of the box. the back shows some of the 2007 city sets in a nice little scene. and inside. minifig here is the friendly garbage/recycle man. he looks nice but with the same head as so many other city figs before him. come on tlg! give us some new heads! the sticker sheet the stickers actually are pretty decent as far as stickers go. i like the recycle sign. after bag #1 this is where we stand after the first bag is built. bag # 2 the parts contained in the second bag. more nice orange pieces here. extra parts some nice 1x1 slopes and 1x1 round plates. everything built now that everything is built, let's check it out! the design of the set is very nice and the color scheme looks great. when you see it, you immediately know what it is. the back has a droid arm that acts as a handle to dump the trash/recycling in the truck. it's simple, but works well. here you can see the dumping mechanism. it works by a sliding technic beam with a stopper on top of the truck you can store the worker's cart. this works really well. i think though that the top of the truck overall looks a bit jumbled up with a few too many different colors. the bottom. trash dumping time! this is a good feature of the set. a very well built snot front section. this looks fantastic with the grills and number plate sticker. someone has left a big mess on the street... brickshelf folder ratings! price: 10/10 (for $15 this is a very good deal at 206 pieces) parts: 9/10 (lots of orange) design 9/10 (a very well designed set. especially the front) playability 9/10 (the trash dumper is fun and the added broom and cart make for good play value) build: 8/10 (simple, but stayed interesting) overall:45/50 brickset lego s@h bricklink peeron taking out the trash... summary this is a great small set for the price with fun features, nice colors and good design. i would certainly recommend this set, no matter what it's really called thanks, and happy building!

1 this is one of those sets that make me really want to start building up a city. it's a great value, has a lot of useful pieces, and is just plain fun to play with. i do miss vehicles having doors though. great review. i was a bit curious as to how the dumping mechanism worked. as well as the sticker count.

1 nice truck indeed, but the yellow one is better i think, at least if you put them on a roadplate it seems to me that those road plates are too small for that. also it will not empty completely because of that panel. well, for the rest it is a nice set and a fine review!

1 thanks for the review! this is one of the few city sets that i own (despite loving the theme so much, most of my town is either custom or classic), and it's about as beautiful as a big garbage truck can ever be. quote nice truck indeed, but the yellow one is better i think, at least if you put them on a roadplate it seems to me that those road plates are too small for that. also it will not empty completely because of that panel. well, for the rest it is a nice set and a fine review! well, the truck barely fits onto the old roadplates (not on curves though), so if you put it in a display it probably won't look bad. i think from what i see, this and all the other 6 wide vehicles will fit much better on the newer roadplates, which are four studs wider than the old ones.

1 that's a really nice mod badsneaker! the added bulk serves it well.

-1 i like this set, but i can't give it a good grade for playability, as the rearmost hinging section is too stiffly hinged, so when you open it, it's likely to break if you hold it just over the shovel and broom. my truck thus has that function, and with it of course the whole container tipping, disabled. i also moved the cab a bit forward and the front axle rearward to give the cab the typical garbage truck look, as they are often very low slung. this also created space behind the cab for some equipment.
