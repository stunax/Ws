these plates are great in setting up your space base and giving your ships a place to land my favorite though is the lunar crater plate which i use to death in my comic 
why pay 350 dollars just download the instructions on buy the pieces off bricklink this is was i did when i wanted to create the blacktron ii in the futuron colour scheme also i tend to like both sets of base plates i bought the black ones myself and they were of great use but there more for creating the idea of a city or space station something more completely man made the gray ones give a better look of the roads being laid over bare rock especially when you introduce the plates with the craters i would love to see a 4848 baseplate with roads through them which would allow more building space on the side and maybe some craters also 4848 baseplates with craters but a few different kinds to create more or a realistic look and less of a repeating pattern and with all those rocks you have to put everything up on supports much better looking bases then
lokix on jul 8 2008 0309 pm said why pay 350 dollars just download the instructions on buy the pieces off bricklink thats the problem the instructions arent anywhere to be found not that ive seen the set does seem to have some rare parts but i doubt 350 worth
cp5670 on jul 8 2008 0504 am said these are pretty good but i think they look too much like the standard town roads from that period i like the black space plates from the early 90s better 6710 oh how i love these plates afew years ago i found a local retail store with about 67 sets of these in their basement warehouse i was given special access to along with many other old space goodies hehe i love the things i have loads and ive used them for multiple space bases and battles along with afew grey crater plates and the large grey plates 15x the size of a normal baseplate you can get quite a monorail layout going sigh i should really clean up and get one set up again so i can take some pictures
kdog on jul 8 2008 0948 pm said thats the problem the instructions arent anywhere to be found not that ive seen the set does seem to have some rare parts but i doubt 350 worth by looking at the pictures used to display this set ive a sneaky suspicion it did not come with instructions but meant for the pictures to be ideas the whole set was suppose to teach children to use their imagination giving them instructions would somewhat defeat this while trying to figure how to build things from looking at pictures would be a much better educational experience
thebrickster on jun 22 2008 0141 am said it looks like your boat is in really good shape considering its 30 years old excellent review i know i got it for a song on ebay most 1970s sets dont seem to be in much demand
how about these policemen are unarmed
nice review sinner the old sets i donÂ´t know  every old set especially equipped with the old nonmoveable arms minifigs look very odd nowadays i agree with you with the hull shape and its possibility to be extended but every other aspect the lack of detail the keel itself you canÂ´t float it in shallow water keeps me from rating it higher than 310 in my opninion the best police boat so far is 4021 click to enlarge
i love those minifigs theyd go for alot on ebay i bet great boat as well i love the old hull design
lol i cant help but smile everytime i see the quote on this thread dont worry these police are armless lol
as you may have seen in my topic in general lego discussion i received a bunch of old lego from my stepgrandmotherinlaw among the bricks were instructions and pieces for an almost complete set 345 from 1969 i was very excited to find this out so i put it together i recently took it apart and reassembled it taking photographs along the way for the sake of eurobricks so without further ado set 345 house with car first off is the car this was still constructed in the bucket of bricks i received so i never took it apart next ill show you the instructions lots of added bricks per step which was fun however the angle of the instructions sometimes made it difficult to find where things were supposed to go the inbuild shots finally an allaround view of the finished set sadly i dont have much time to post more pictures or thoughts however ill try to come back and update the review later this week until then enjoy
great review mariko this set is way before my time too i like how lego used to create simple one story houses instead of the really tall house that we see in todays town theme such as 8403 city house one story houses such as 345 just look more realistic to my eyes the simplistic minimalism vibe that i get with this set is something that is hard to find in todays much more detailed sets although trust me i love love love todays detailed sets  the brick is epic
kimt on dec 28 2005 0252 pm said toothbrush and mild soap  and lots of time gently scrubbing a cleaning and great review  i love that set wub wub im sorry that you seem to miss the stickers  if you find somewhere to download printable copies of them please let me know satis kimt thanks for the tip i tried it on a few pieces and they look much better unfortunately it does take a lot of time i need a lego cleaning machine with this many pieces
quote im also impressed by the colors of the shields even a good cleaning wouldnt do that with my old shields have you ever tried replacing the heads by modern heads just to see how that would look remember never try to clean stickers  kimt
imperialjohn on dec 29 2005 0206 pm said you might find the stickers here ive searched that page before  it doesnt have the stickers but it has a lot of other useful ones od thebrickster send me a link to a page that has remakes of the good old classic shields and more you can find it here thanks brickster satis  kimt
ive tried this once remember normal white sticker sheet in an ink jet and the transparent plastic on top  ps the one on the right is the homemade one
imperialjohn on dec 29 2005 0511 pm said ive tried this once remember normal white sticker sheet in an ink jet and the transparent plastic on top  ps the one on the right is the homemade one so youre using two layers stickers doesnt that make it very thick
i guess its easiest to put the entire shield on a transparent sticker and cut the edges i would also do that with the white stickers because now you can still see the gray edges of the shield perhaps you can make a bigger black or brown in the other case outline you also wouldnt be able to see if the sticker is exactly in the middle
indy565 on dec 31 2007 1024 am said wasnt this the first castle lego released hey indy565 we try not to revive old threads imded pointed out how old unless theres something to add now this doesnt mean you can never revive an old thread but just do it when theres a reason  yes i believe it is the oldest
rare classic sets are always a priceless part of any lego collection and its a good thing you still have this first set of yours luxor or did you purchase a new one excellent review btw its always a pleasure getting a closer look at these classic sets which i wouldnt have known to exist had i not seen this review overall i think its a really good set at that time of course judging this one by modern standards wont be fair but at the time im pretty sure it was a cool set to have though less cooler than having the harley davidson set
thanks for the review luxorv an interesting old set though i find it hard to imagine a square smoke stack instead of roundish it truly has that classic lego simplistic build with all studs showing and making do with standard partsm except the few you havepointed out luxorv a nice flashback 35 years agonow thats old school anyway brick on everyone 
thank you very much for this wonderful review this is the oldest lego set in my collection i received this model from my grand parents many years ago  im not exactly sure who in my family it used to belong to but it has a home with me now its a very simple but attractive looking vehicle and functions pretty well too overall very nice
thanks for the great nostalgic review great pictures i love the shiny glow of 37 year old bricks sets were simpler back then but not less exciting in their own way i wasnt even born in 1973 but one of my first sets was the 1982 update of this 6630 bucket loader almost 10 years later but the very same bucket assembly only the colours have changed
ah the good old daysthanks for the review yoshi648  cute and cool at the same time its interesting to see that the same front end parts had been used from the early 70s up in to the late 90s  nice again to step back in time and keep on bricking everyone 
its simply amazing how far lego has come in 30 years
the computer is my favorite part sadly i dont own any classic spaceexept for some space police and a blue classic space man
nice 442 is the lowest set number i have seen for any classic space set so it must been released with the first wave in 1978 its remarkable that a lego spaceship this old and small can seat more figs than the much bigger mx71 recon dropship of today anyway i just want to grab it out of the screen and swoosh it all over the place lol tlg please make these classic space sets again i promise ill buy many
great job i love reading vintage reviews as it reminds of our childhood days glad to see this in very good condition by the way i will move this to lego trains  town to see if thebrickster will like to include this set inside the review index over there i believe he is maintaining vintage town set reviews over there and this suits there well
in 1977 trans or yellow slopes existed already and using them would have made the plane more realistic a third rear wheel would have enhanced playability and design rather than this ugly black round brick its the reason why i voted below average even considering 1977s standards however this set is nice and simple offering good playability
oh did i drool over this set as a kid since i never got it i didnt know how bad the rocket really was great review xenologer on jul 4 2008 1225 pm said come to think of it when were technic axles invented the white ones were
ahh the good old days thanks for the review
hey ebers i got my market street on monday and finished building it last night i know its not such a nice review like yoda did the last times but i hope you enjoy some of the pics first a pic of the complete building the 3 minifigs and i pic of the stairs one of my highlights at this set more pics you can find here my opinion about the set i like this set very much it was really fun to build it im happy that that i got some more cherries and a croissant now sweet  a funny idea is the salad in the one box at the front i think normally its a hairpiece of an exoforce fig i also like the colours of the house the dark blue is sooooo nice i think i have to take more of this soon the lighter blue is also nice this set has really nice details like the stairs or the owl at the entry of the market or the balcony i paid 8999 eur a fair price for a really nice set greetings sandra
thanks for the review my favourite detail is the salad d btw could you exchange the modules and make pics of that id like to see how the building looks with the flat roof instead of the dutch style one im not sure though if the vents on the flat roof makes sense as long as its only used as a garage top  maybe they should be removable as the balconies and such things to make the modularity leading not to weird results other than this in combination with a lot of money and the cafe corner set this really could get me into city 
thanks i love the look of this set i love the mix of colours it breaks up the model rather than being a single monotone colour hes used several complimentary colours in order to make up the model i agree i think the chimneys on the flat roof is weird ontop of the garage but not so weird one you place it ontop of the building i guess hes done it to give us the choice of roofs and chimneys you can always remove the ones you dont like he also seems to have screwed up a bit on the tiling for the sidewalk on the side module on cafe corner and the building module of this set the sidewalk has the pattern light grey 1x6 at the front then dark grey 1x2 next then dark grey 2x2s however on this hes put the 2x2 tiles first then the 1x2s at the back easilly fixable though overall i love this set thanks for the pics compliments cafe corner perfectly
apophisv on jun 20 2007 1032 am said btw could you exchange the modules and make pics of that id like to see how the building looks with the flat roof instead of the dutch style one im sure that a could do that its a good idea i hope you can wait a few days ill do it this weekend and make more pics then holodoc on jun 20 2007 0322 pm said thank you legocastlegirls for your quick review y its the first time i realize the back of the market street the tan bricks are a replacement for some windows id guess i do love that building especially the top floor with the neat balcony wub of course you are again left alone filling the interior but i just had some food parts ordered at bricklink xd i also think that this is a replacement for some windows and i like this idea because i often see houses with that kind of windows holodoc on jun 20 2007 0322 pm said one thing id like to know this is an onlineexclusive right can i order it at a legostore kln  oberhausen and get the sum rewarded on my voucher booklet sweet i heard it i dont know that this is an onlineexclusive but i know that you can order it at your legostore and when you get it you get the stamps for your voucher booklet at your next visit at the legostore but you have to bring the bill with you barbossa on jun 20 2007 0410 pm said i am totally agree with snefreo1 the yellow cylinder and the lamppost should be on a level above the tiles actually i have put a 2x2 plat under the lamppost on my cc looks much better if you ask me yeah i also agree with snefrooe and you ive never seen holes at the footpath for some lamps it is really dangerous for all the nice little minifigs  greetings sandra
it was the same thing in france in the middleage happy that today this taxe is gone d
youre a lucky man y thanks for those cool pics 
thank you interesting indeed those are quite expensive though perhaps 60 dollars or more
impressive really impressive mike 8 many tks for sharing these great pics  i really love it  thats a really sweet way to make us want legions of blackies d darn you  i really like the fact he still has a megaphone  classic all the way  now i want to sing some metallica p quote blackened is the end winter it will send throwing all you see into obscurity death of mother earth never a rebirth evolutions end never will it mend never fire to begin whipping dance of the dead blackened is the end to begin whipping dance of the dead color our world blackened 
very nice copmike i cant wait to get my boba now those ebay prices arent to bad hmmmm d
iamded on jun 28 2007 0743 am said so were you serious about any of the boba fett luke skywalker stormtrooper  darth vader ones because id love to see a boba fett and vader one d dead serious  the vader  stormtrooper maquettes are already sold out have to go ebay on them in august luke is coming out in the 6212 xwing bonus pack and boba fett was up for preorder over at starwarscom shop before it also sold out maquettes on copmike
well it has taken me over 2 years but i have finally bought this maquette its a real beauty just dont ask what it cost my set of maquettes is finally complete
great reason to review a great thread your collection is truely something to behold
mutley777 on dec 1 2009 0729 pm said well it has taken me over 2 years but i have finally bought this maquette its a real beauty just dont ask what it cost my set of maquettes is finally complete youre not surprised im jealous right but i have to ask what did it cost joke dont tell it because otherwise burglars would be on their way great review maybe one day i get one of these too
nice review and great little story d y look at the normal horses their legs are positioned like that too only the skellie horses legs are touching so as to strengthen the middle otherwise it could easily snap in half also i think the new skeletons are nice their head is awesome i just dont see why tlc couldnt make the bent droid arms with the hand facing vertically instead of making a new arm design completely straight
nice review and a great story also grevious this is a great set and a nice little army builder one at that the only thing that saddens me about the line itself is the new arms on the skelies they just look far to big when placed next to a normal fig for me the old versions of the skelies were far better why tlc changed to this is beyond me still i shall be buying alot of these sets just to increase my army
thanks for all the comments guys and thank you joem16 and iamded for pointing out the reason for the skeleton horse leg positioning  well ill be gone on vacation until the 16 but i may pick up a set or two while down in tenessee so if i do expect a review and another story when i get back 
this is the only one of the new castle sets ive been able to get hold of so far i know others have done it before but as soon as id got it there was something i just had to try heh cool skull
great review i love this set
great review y small set with great figs and piecesmust buy the story was hilarious  any chance you are going to review another set im still waiting for a certain member coughhinckleycough to review skeleton tower d piranha
iamded on nov 9 2007 0351 pm said it seems the catapult defence has been taken off sh for nz so i assume its out of stock for us its been off for a while you guys might want to check your countries too peace  catapult defense is still on for me but the final joust has disappeared all the sets are still in my stores though so no worry sweet batbrickismuchcoolerthaniamded away 
i bought this set last night and it is great my biggest surprise was the wheels that were included i didnt even know they existed and there arent even that new back to the set he is such a cute dinosaur d since he is so tubby i think he looks like a baby i suspect my wife wanted him more than me my biggest interest in the set was to have more motors and ir parts so i could make an ir car overall i highly recomend this set but as others have said be warned that the box is very oversized i wish lego would give up on this whole 11 picture thing wacko
ive got it also but i think ill replace the ball joint pieces with the kind of pieces that give the wings their angle
great review sweet maybe i will buy this one but not this month buying lego in billund has left me totally broke x 
nice review
impressive review really clear photos too thanks dr s
ickelpete on jul 13 2007 1106 pm said great review dunamis i hope you have as much fun with this as i have one point yes they are new axles they have appeared in a few sets this year yes the kids seem to love it as you pointed out and the wife still thinks i am crazy so its all good i read your review after i posted mine seems like we shared the same thoughts on a majority of it i always think it is good to have multiple opinions on sets as it gives the community more data points to evaluate a given set
thanks for the bonus review i am still on the fence with this one so every opinion is good dunamis on jul 14 2007 0741 am said but what about the atat in case you dont know the atat in the dark side development kit had a single motor and a moving head it worked by the head simply swinging from side to side due to balence shifts i suspect the atat will be same i also think that there will be no remote for it either edited by sinner 14 july 2007  1131 am
tks once again dunamis for a great indepth review  i really look forward to your supped up and moded atat p i am really not found of the design but i think its still a nice parts pack especially with all these nice power function elements  yoda
thats a nice looking dino set there great review dunamis also on this side of the border see that big thing above the us thats canada where im from byob still means bring your own beer my uncle is already on his third molsons edited by lieutenant colonel thok 14 july 2007  0221 pm
i kind of like the design of this but more importantly i really want to get my hands on the power functions motors and ir control system id prefer the 8275 technic bulldozer but theres no way i can stretch to the 100 price tag so i was thinking i would have to see if i could get a 4958 monster dino cheap in the january sales then two things happened today firstly i saw the dino in tescos reduced from 70 to 55 then my wife said shed buy it for me for christmas wow thats never happened to me before i love my wife wub cant wait till christmas now
i ended up buying both this and the dozer  i plan on using my dino for a ir car in a month or two
this is both my first set review and post about a star wars set even though i have been collecting them since 99 i got this one early this year so i thought i would post a review on it please bare with me i am not a great photographer so with that in mind here goes front of the box 75083 atdp boxfront by whitesidewjw on flickr back of the box 75083 atdp box back by whitesidewjw on flickr shot of the bags 75083 atdp bags by whitesidewjw on flickr the sticker sheet i normally dont apply them but for this i am going ahead and putting them on 75083 atdp sticker sheet by whitesidewjw on flickr minifigs i really like the two atdp pilots but the best agent kallus really does shine of course we get an extra stormtrooper 75083 atdp minifigs by whitesidewjw on flickr no new molds in this as far as i can tell however these printed 4x4 domes are really great i can see lots of uses for these in space mocs 75083 atdp new printed elements by whitesidewjw on flickr bag1 complete nothing earth shattering here an easy build 75083 atdp bag 1 complete by whitesidewjw on flickr bag 2 complete 75083 atdp bag 2 complete cockpit seats by whitesidewjw on flickr cockpit assembly 75083 atdp cockpit assembly by whitesidewjw on flickr bag 2 complete 75083 atdp bag3 complete by whitesidewjw on flickr foot assembly i like how they positioned the slopes 75083 atdp foot assembly by whitesidewjw on flickr complete atdp 75083 atdp complete by whitesidewjw on flickr complete atdpside view 75083 atdp side view complete by whitesidewjw on flickr complete atdp over view 75083 atdp complete overview by whitesidewjw on flickr complete atdp rear view 75083 atdp rear view by whitesidewjw on flickr extra pieces 75083 atdp extra pieces by whitesidewjw on flickr the verdict minifigs 55 we get a total of four figs i like the two atdp pilots and agent kallus is a well done minifig i can complain about another storm trooper either parts 35 other than the dome pieces i commented on before there is really not any new parts in this if you build space star wars or machinery this will still be a welcome assortment experience of build 45 this really was a fun build it came together fast but was challenging enough for its target age group playability 55 this thing is much more sturdy than it looks the legs take a little bit of effort due to the double locking hinges but hold together very wellthis is a very minor complaint value 45 typical 4999 for 500 pieces i must admit i paid a little more than msrp due to shipping but i cant complain about the value overall 2125 i really believe this is one of the best walkers that lego has designed the only changes i would make would be adding real control panels in the cockpit and it would be nice if lego made a real widow to fit in with these types of builds rather than a transparent tile over another plate all in all i would recommend this set and i hope the rest of the 2015 star wars sets are on par with this
great review thanks for doing it im a big fan of this set the minifigures are good as is the parts selection i like the piece used in the cockpit to secure the minifigure in place i wouldve liked to see some panels in the cockpit though rather than translucent red pieces that said however they are useful pieces
thanks for the review cannot wait for the 2015 sets
thanks for the review i have two questions  what is the driver standing on when the hatch is open and he is looking out  could you show the face of kallus without helmet please my only complaint is that the colours of both kalluss and the driverss uniforms are wrong kalluss uniform is way too dark and should be more dark olive than black and the driverss uniforms are too bright and should be more greyish compared to what we saw in the series
great first review as a huge walker fan its great to get one thats not a redesign or one of those tiny battlepack vechicles
awesome i am really looking forward to buy this but is it really 5000 us i was hoping more around 3000 also i was wondering how the hip section for the legs work does it have a stiff turning axis to it
a great review of an obviously fantastic set a musthave for 2015 thanks
firstly great review  i was really on the fence on this one this review has greatly changed my view on this modular a definite buy for me love the interiors and the whole concept the more i see it the more i see the little features which put this set apart or at least slightly different from the others of course great playability for the younger lot and i think a nice building to give any lego city more character and colour
can you please take some picturesexplain how the water tower is built i understand that there are some tank treads bot how exactly and it is there can be only one edited by yooha 01 january 2015  0714 pm
looking forward to picking up this set on saturday  nice review love the tiny details and the printed parts
great review the intro was great but im still not convinced on this one the height seems too small for comparison with the rest of the modulars the play features are ok but i wish it would have been taller
thelazychicken on 01 january 2015  0614 pm said great review the intro was great but im still not convinced on this one the height seems too small for comparison with the rest of the modulars the play features are ok but i wish it would have been taller totally agree with you the height does seem rather small also 2x buildings on a 32x32 baseplate with a lots of spare studs behind the buildings are these buildings 12 studs in width it still looks great style wise however this might be a set i buy and look at it after i have built it  regret the amount of  i have spent on it 239 for us aussies  edited by snaplock 01 january 2015  0742 pm
thank you for the review it was very interesting and changed my opinion of the set im now considering a future purchase  just one question the mirror is on cardboard i was hoping for it to be a window piece with a mirror on one side i hope its not the same cardboard we had on some of the early harry potter sets or the element wont last long
legos affiliation with six wheelers go back a long way i think the first one was released in 1981 more than 25 years ago this year lego added another one to the family mars missions rhino 1 as its title sounds its been a while since ive bought and opened a large box so maybe this isnt a surprise to most of you but the box does not open at the front as with many larger sw boxes but at the side the two printed sealsor whatever people call them have gone as well being replaced by one larger print in the middle of side the box also isnt as thick as a large sw box like the sandcrawler the general size is however still quite large pict0001jpg 28191k 102 downloads the back side shows the mars mission theme sets eccept the rhino i guess it shows this set will be released as a tru exclusive or something only to show up in legoland shops and maybe lego shops its a shame really because this is by far the best set of the theme pict0002jpg 28542k 89 downloads when you open the front cover you see a larger picture picture of the rhino obviously it seems to be some sort of multifunctional truck i think the basic function is to drive around and explore for that it has a drilling device and six giant wheels pict0003jpg 2737k 82 downloads the set comes with two instruction books im afraid to say they did not resolve the grayblack colors issue colorwise the real thing does not look like the instruction book because of it pict0004jpg 30263k 75 downloads the rhino looks really big because of the six giant wheels i guess its more or less the same size as mtrons magnetiser with the big difference between the two being that the wheels have been turned around creating a unique wheel design for a lego model pict0285jpg 29059k 83 downloads pict0277jpg 28626k 80 downloads the wheels look very cool even though the first couple of wheels stand a bit closer to each other dont know why that is hm  and they could have used a bit more body but the design is pretty good i know armagheddon isnt far away  pict0292jpg 21675k 70 downloads the suspension of the wheels is a bit flimsy sure it allows the truck to move around in a more realistic way than the old sets but its not as flexible as some older sets like sws ctt nor do the wheels have much body the black bars you see on top of the wheels are more window dressing then functional pict0293jpg 24478k 88 downloads the over all shape of the rhino is kinda bulky it looks more like a beatle than a rhino if youre asking me it has three major sections but i wouldnt call it a modular building though the cockpit is the first section its spacious and detailed pict0290jpg 26277k 0 downloads pict0291jpg 29975k 87 downloads the cockpit hangs down from a weird angle its attached to a large vertical technic brick that is part of the rhinos main structure so its not a seperate spaceship which is a shame oh well you cant have it all i guess pict0301jpg 29113k 78 downloads ah yes stickers all over the place but theyre cool the mid section of the rhino dominates the basic shape of the model its as if those two large white parts form a strong and thick shield protecting whatever is inside from whatever is outsde pict0007jpg 21322k 67 downloads unfortunately there is nothing inside its extra space needed to house the spaceship thats really a shame a command center of some kind could have given the rhino a bit more panache pict0286jpg 25135k 87 downloads however whats really great is the way in which they fit together one side has an orange 1x2 plate that fits in between two white 1x3 plates of the other side creating yet another unique shape for a lego model but again its a shame they didnt do more with this section xo pict0283jpg 28775k 82 downloads the third and last section is a platform for a space ship pict0299jpg 2895k 77 downloads pict0287jpg 19978k 75 downloads the platform itself isnt really special no details no stickers its just a skeleton to carry the spaceship nothing more nothing less no your space ship doesnt fall off even if you rotate the platform into a launch position pushing the weight of the ship backwards in fact the position of the ship onto the platform is so solid its kinda difficult to imagine how this ship flies off  the ship on the other hand is pretty cool its all sorts of things at the same time it seems it transports two aliens but also a small car that reminds me of the small sets of spacepolice 2 blacktron 2 pict0295jpg 3074k 85 downloads pict0298jpg 26813k 75 downloads pict0294jpg 27684k 76 downloads the shuttle reminds me of a star trek shuttle and i think it needs some modding but i do think it looks pretty nice sure the cockpit is a bit too low a pilot needs to lay down instead of sitting down and the dropping mechnism if there is one at all isnt all that brilliant either the main structure is a bit too technical for me i prefer actual parts with studs not these lego technic bars and pins pict0006jpg 22443k 74 downloads the crew pict0276jpg 23943k 70 downloads ah yes theres also this green plastic residu think they are supposed to be the aliens and theres also this weird alien craft but i didnt bother to build that sad good wub great innovative design lots of potential i even like the colors sweet lots of playability its a big attractive model i dont see any weak spots in the design that could compromise stability or structural integrity not so good  too many technic parts some sections on the model like the gun and the drilling device are a bit to flimsy id say 758510 price 750 danish crowns about 105euro
seems like they infuse system sets with more technic bars must be that technic isnt selling too well and they want to educate ppl how cool technic can be p its quite apparent when even the small bike needed technic frame
this is a great review and so is the set y i thought i would buy it but when i saw the price i changed my mind xd i always liked flying things better though like the dropship although that is a bit pricey too i guess xd
this set is truely incredible a must have but this set is also incredibly overpriced n  com on its only a big vehicle  nothing really special to justify the near 100 price tag this set is clearly worth something like 65 at max look at the incredible dropship for 34 thats a good value for money y edited by mutex 15 july 2007  0457 pm
i echo the consensus of this thread  too much technic looks great too expensive looks great
kahgarak on jul 16 2007 0953 am said please build the alien craft im sure that we would all like a review of that  ok then ill do that later on but i will not touch that plastic residu xd
i wish the wheels would be arranged like the turbo tank this one looks too movable
yes they can hold the crystals they cant move the hands    but they do have the clawlike hand of the droid arm edit could you post some general beauty pics of the rhino and the attached craft such as front side back etc all we have of the ship is one top pic edited by mr mandalorian 20 july 2007  0518 am
great review wonderfully detailed dont care for the ship at all its that technic under a hollow shell thing like the ctt if it wasnt for the figures i would have hated it and nothing about these figures excites me ill end up finding the least number of sets possible to provide at least one of each figure for the general population collection and skip the rest unless they do as i expect and flop here thus leading to huge discounts i like this set  at half off 
the life on mars theme was so much better with the aliens dominating mars instead of the humans and the aliens were so much better with their own names etc good times anyway i think this is the best set in the series it looks so neat and reminds me of the pelican form halo xd edited by iamded 31 august 2007  0511 am
two of my daughters are building this as we speak i agree the design is a lot smaller than i would have liked but theyre loving it no question the figures are the real draw here and at 6 and almost five years old theyre doimg a good job building so far at least for the 46 range in my house this set is a home run thanks for the great review mostlytechnic
very nice review mostlytechinc once i saw this set i was interested in it for the colours and piecesthanks for this review to shed more light onto it
yep my family all thinks they should have made a bigger set added figs and just been printing money this feels massively rushed into production which is weird the other princess sets that just came out look worlds better
i wish elsa had more of a white hairpiece rather than blonde but it could be worse not a bad set overall although olaf doesnt look right without the twigs on his head anna is a really nice and accurate fig
the review is very well done thanks i dont know the movie my key question is whether the bricks in the set will allow to build my own snowice creations now with transglitter being part of the design approach i am not so sure can those who have already bought it tell me can transglitter be used as transparent with snow particles or is it just terrible i cannot really tell from the review pic above
im literally of the exact opposite opinion to op here i love the structure and the parts this is a fantastic little parts pack that ill be snagging more of when i find it againbut ive no use for the figures not a big disney princess fan its all about the parts this set is freaking amazing d
there is a very simple reason for the flowers and greenleaved trees you should remember from the movie it was actually summer when elsa set of the eternal winter… the orange flowers do bother me from a design point of view i would have liked it better if they were a pinkpurplebluewhite color same goes for the leafy bits they could have used the pinkpurple ones they are gonna use in the elves sets it would have been fantastic if they had given us white leafy bits like snow covered branches im sure loads of us could use those in our mocs edited by bennemans 13 january 2015  0614 pm
hello everyone i am back to share with all of you another of my legends of chima polybags review it will be pretty comprehensive since the finished built will be quick and will be focusing more of what kind of fun that you can derive from there this polybag was bought in september 2013 when i visited legoland malaysia and i did not hesitate to put this in my shopping basket name 30253 leonidas jungle dragster theme lego system  legends of chima year 2013 pieces 30 minifigs 1 minifigure price usd na gbp na euro na sgd na resources brickset bricklink an original polybag image of the 30253 leonidas jungle dragster back view of the original polybag image of the 30253 leonidas jungle dragster the road scout of the lions tribe this polybag design is definitely plan to be the quickest and fastest dragster to recce enemy front by making a swift scout for the lions tribe i believe by the sound of the name jungle dragster it might just be suitable to use in jungle terrain well i dont quite agree that this is a dragster even though it has the kind of open view concept of rolling in fast but it does not have the length of a typical dragster similar to this town polybag design for example still it is nice to have smaller variants of their vehicular supremacy instruction manual front instruction manual back the lego building content with just 30 lego elements you can be pretty quick to be able to display these laid out content after the built is completed these are the remaining spare parts i am fond of the wheels which are some useful parts other than that there are nothing spectacular about it my name is leonidas and i belonged to the lions tribe do not be mistaken of his name leonidas to be the king of sparta who led the brave men of 300 spartans warriors to fight to the death against the persians instead this character is based on the bio resided in legocom you will realise that he is aligned with the lions tribe and is a proud lion footsoldier he may have that goofy idiotic look but he can be very serious in his commitment to discharging his duties you are able to observe his nice back view printing which reveal his black and blue sash leonidas has a dual facial feature to reveal his much serious appearance leonidas is one of the common characters available in the legends of chima universe it can be found in a total of five sets it is a great pity that there is no weapon being made for him in this polybag design which will certainly make a fine addition the completed built of the jungle dragster this is the main design of the jungle dragster which is very simple looking there is no distinct fighting capability from the vehicular design and it look just like a regular patrol vehicle one thing i like about this is the close distinct colour schema of the lions tribe other than that there is nothing special about it moving off with my jungle dragster to conclude this polybag is really meant for lego fans or collectors who appreciate legends of chima or wanting to sample the legends of chima theme it is a very simple built but yet could form a decent force size for recce purposes before sending in the big arsenals to whack their enemies either way i will only suggest you to buy it if you really love this theme at an inexpensive price otherwise it is perfectly alright to give this a miss summary review playability 410 you need to have more lions tribe vehicles in order to bring the best and fun out of it since this is more of a supporting vehicle design 410 simplistic built of the dragster and main focus is just acquiring the minifigure price 410 bought at about usd7 which is not an awesome price so get it if you can get it more than half of this price overall 410 if only you are a huge mega fan of the legends of chima then you need to get this i gave it a 2 based on my review score card what about yours i hope every one of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine comments and criticisms are strongly welcomed pictures can be found in my flickr
good and helpful review again whitefang i probably have no use for a lionish creature with goofy looks

sinner on jul 18 2007 0824 am said i thought you would like it i am pleased to say that i didnt know that the jig is up was also a common line most of what i remember about the old batman tv show actually comes from the movie as i own that mum bought it for me i tend to put in on if i have friends over and i am drunk enough i like the darker side of batman only and thus anything that is against the idea that batman is as big a loon as the guys that he hauls in i dont like joel schumakers movies fall well within that category wait what are you saying you prefer the joel schumacher films if you like the darker side of batman i recommend the tim burton films joel schumacher is as campy as the jig is up imo he added freakin nipples to the batsuit for gods sake p youd have to be nice and drunk to enjoy his films  i really like batman batman returns and batman begins sinner on jul 18 2007 0824 am said santa brings presents here in the middle of summer in full winter rig he is a hero at least he can come down chimneys here without being burnt p  no no no no i saw a movie once im pretty sure its a wallabee xwingyoda on jul 18 2007 1127 am said tks mate for this brilliant review d i loved your batfabuland story  always fantastic to read like always sweet i really love this set and i shall buy 2 copies one to build as is and another one for my town loool regular biplane for the tarmac and my swat copter  btw i would have a request could you post pics of the parts inventory please  many tks in advance  yoda what nice things to say  thanks mate you always make me feel brilliant  here is the parts inventory click to enlarge the scarecrow plane would make an excellent crop duster and the batcopter will make an excellent swat copter sweet sweet thanks everybody else for the nice compliments as well im deeply concerned about price differences in other countries it seems pretty ridiculous and counterproductive for tlc has anyone posted about this in the embassy forum
what about the cartoon batman the animated series will always be the definitive batman to me the two tim burton movies were okay they havent aged well though and i really dig what christopher nolan is doing with the new movies christian bale did a fine job in batman begins  but when i watch the movie i hear kevin conroys voice in my head the cartoon rocked and as much as i enjoyed the justice league unlimited cartoon my biggest complaint was always more batman please
hinckley39 on jul 19 2007 0359 am said what nice things to say  thanks mate you always make me feel brilliant  here is the parts inventory click to enlarge hehe meet yoda the ego booster d tks mate for these pics for once very few parts i want to change on that plane  ill just swith to some black parts like the two 2x12 and the 2x4 and i will get rid of those coloured 1x1 slopes on the side  he is batman no need to show his copters right from left p cant wait to get that set  stealth mode on  yoda
excellent hinckley y y y  looks like a nice set  i like the mix of dark batmanpieces and a bit lighter badmanspieces batmans new blue headpiece looks a bit off though i love your stories wub  especially nowadays when im a afofl xd keep up the work mister dark tan on copmike
thanks for this great review y  and welcome to eurobricks n whats with the obi wan head darn tlc piranha
kernow on jul 22 2007 1048 pm said a new r2 unit as well dont remeber this in the film but great to have one in a new colour wub its also at this point that you come across a big disappointment on the box you get a flesh quigon what is actually in the box is an epiii obiwan more to come  nice review and i cant wait to see part ii  the quigon incident is just plain stupid  nice to have a new droid y part ii wait on copmike
thanks for the review im glad to see lego including details of everyday life like the food though a plate would have been nice steve
nice review i like the buildingport the most mmmdark blue plates wub pity it is a toysrus exclusive in the netherlands there are only toysrusses in the greater cities
yes that was definately an optic illusion looking at it again the gap looks a lot shorter thanks  shakar
ok here is the set alot of us star wars fans have been waiting for the 7666 hoth rebel base wub first the box now the great minifigs that stunning k3po fig now the snowspeeder aaaaggghhhhh these parts are all stickers now for the turret the 2 cones on the side press in to fire out 2 blue lights saber blades d now for the small crane thingy yes the part under the engine on the snowspeeder is another sticker 8 echo base well the front door anyway d  the main control room d again these are stickers on a tinted clear panel and on the slope  i have no idea what this is meant to be d finally 2 shots of the full set wub well over all i really like this set and think it is great value for money the minifigs alone would set you back more than the cost of this set the build time was a good 2 hours or so and was good fun the snowspeeder is not as good as the second snowspeeder and no where near as good as the first in my opinion but i did love that first one the k3po fig is perfect and it is good to be getting more droids that arent r2d2 and c3po it is a shame about the stickers but that is the price of keeping the cost down i suppose the only printed part in the whole set is the snowspeederxwing windscreen i will definately be getting atleast another 3 of this great set 910
i love it depending on the australian price if it comes down here that is incidently i have no idea what that other yellow thing is either thanks for the review
wow you are so lucky to have that sett   men  tlc dont let me wait  hh i mean tru
a very good review thanks mutley777 y hmm that shattered base looks better than i thought a very playable set really nice for the snowspeeder i prefer the main gun design of its predecessor but the grappling hook gun is a good improvement if the door would just be large enough for it p
dont worry guys the snowspeeder fits through the door easily 
great review  now i want it even more 40 that sounds reasonable in comparison to our recent experiences
mutley777 on aug 2 2007 0237 pm said ok here is the set alot of us star wars fans have been waiting for the 7666 hoth rebel base wub first the box now i really dont know what to get for christmas    the biwing baron or this and its quoted because it says limited edition i may never get this set now 
thanks for a great review ive got a pile of tru and lego credit i wanna spend and was thinking about getting this since i got a sneak peak of your review in the academy but its not here in the us yet too bad wonder when itll hit i do disagree about the manuals though i find the thinner stapled manuals easier to use than single large squarebound ones since they lay flatter when open have any links to the prelim photos of the front end i dont remember seeing that and was curious how different it looked

really thorough review jim i am super jealous that you have 2 of these and i have none with no opportunity to get one any time soon
great review with fantastic pictures as for the model im glad that they chose to make it less pretty  real le mans prototypes are rarely a sight to behold it is function and aerodynamics over form i would however have preferred more realism for the sake of learning  the front shouldnt open like that  instead it should be easy to remove the whole front cover leaving the suspension easy to work on  the aero seems to be realistic except for the rear end where theres no indication of a venturi channel this should have been easy to include  there is no fuel tank nor fixed fuel connector right behind the cabin  there are no air jacks seriously this is one of the most unique features of a race car like this and lego forgot about them instead they automated two functions which are manual on a real race car  the top cars at le mans are hybrids with ingenious systems i would have loved to see the front wheels connected to some kind of spinning apparatus indicating a kinetic energy recovery system if i get this set im going to make some modifications
i was very skeptical of this set because i really thought the redesign degraded the looks of the amodel a lot but after building it i must say this is an excellent set good job tlg
im still not a huge fan of the model but this is one awesome review the effort and quality can be clearly seen and i hope you continue making reviews like this
great review jim i have been sitting on the fence about if i will get this set for a while but i saw one built for the first time at a local brick show on the weekend it definitely looks better in real life than any pics i have decided to buy one
wonderful review but i am still not sold on the set if we get more sets with the bright green i might be tempted to get it but until then it is too few parts in bright green too few different types not the number of pieces to be able to use that colour effectively in making mocs
excellent review thanks what is the cost in us not released in my area the shovel is obviously my favorite area it looks detailed and strong i love the treads because i need them to move the 4 x 4 barrels on my superscaled turbolaser turret very good pics too what color are the treads i never had them they are plastic or rubber edited by grand moff viceroy 03 august 2007  1234 am
ickelpete on aug 2 2007 0845 pm said the treads are dark grey i not too good with naming colours the treads are the same as in the snowmobile set released earlier in the year they are a hard plastic thanks you have proved yourself strong enough for the dark side
5150 lego on aug 3 2007 0610 am said you found it in the us where im really liking this set its looking better now that im seeing more of it at differnt angles imvery curious how wellit pulls and and can pushdoze before the clutches start slipping the clutches are only for the shovel and claw on the front and back the tracks are driven directly from the xl motors and first impressions are good they seem quite powerful it will climb over a small cusion quite easily
nice review ickelpete thank you
could you please please post the instruction boolets number codes located on the back in tiny print so that we can download them from legocom and have a look for ourselves i think a personalised flag would be a good finishing touch to this set thanks
lham on aug 9 2007 1200 pm said could you please please post the instruction boolets number codes located on the back in tiny print so that we can download them from legocom and have a look for ourselves when i read this i first though you meant set number but this model cant be found there yet and now i realize that you mean something completly different what is this code youre after
thanks for the review your video was very well done seeing those sticker sheets is daunting
great review thanks for paying a little extra to get it now and review it for us you must be a younginthose phone booths thingys are called pay phones  jj theyre tough to find nowadays
incredible set thanks for the pics so many details and unique prints and colors im not that into the simpsons but definitely a top tier set
thank you all for the great feedback arslock on 13 april 2015  0219 pm said can you post a pic of it next to the simpsons house just curious about size comparisons soon but my area with the simpsons house is very messy so i will have to make room for it first gooker1 on 13 april 2015  0410 pm said great review thanks for paying a little extra to get it now and review it for us you must be a younginthose phone booths thingys are called pay phones  jj theyre tough to find nowadays lol
mestari on 14 april 2015  0115 pm said i have sooo mixed feeling about that i loved the simpsons house save for the terrible wall in the homer and marges room but this so far is inferior in almost every aspect the walls made of panels is a bummer i expect a d2c set to be better that this 60 stickers the same thing same price for less bricks and smaller build then the house strange coloured bricks on the outside wall some ugly mix of yellow  tan agreed glad my gf likes to do stickers 60 yikes but looking at it now i think the tanyellow is supposed to represent where the paint is fading on the back of the store i guess
thats actually not bad sizing imo sure it looks like you get a lot more with the house but the kwikemart has a lot more of those little references that make it simpsons i agree with some of the complaining a real jasper behind a transblue panel would have been cool you could always bulk up the roof with more foliage i think it has a great foundation as a set but could do with a few mods to make it better thanks for the pictures i greatly appreciate being able to see reviews like this before dropping 200 on a lego set
its the level of detail that floors me a licensed set with the mindset of those great creator sets i think it displays much better than the simpsons house which from the outside is a bit drab
nice review but i have one question is the transparent dome of the squishee drink removable
great review of a classic set y
imperialshadows on aug 13 2007 0729 pm said nice review of a surprisingly interesting set y thanks imperialshadows on aug 13 2007 0729 pm said that baseplate was in a few other sets but never with that pattern would have made a great base for some of the classic 80s houses lego used to treat us to in tan was part of the adventurers egypt sets as recently as 2001 it was a base for ogel versatile plate that hopefully hasnt disappeared completely indeed i wouldnt mind one of all many of the raised plates are too raised i think the new one in the police station and the hospital is but i think this one is perfect imperialshadows on aug 13 2007 0729 pm said just so you know that monkey is drinking too much and likely to fall in the pool   i believe he is hoping to take the barman with him xd he is one of hinckleys characters on holiday
tks sinner for that cool review  this set is not one of my favs never was really a big fan of those raised baseplates but had fantastic parts and mfs  it has great playability with really cool 80s miami feel wub that pink was actually pretty cool and went well with that lime green i think its lime but im not 100 positive once again this pisses me off so much that i was in my dark ages when this theme was out  i loved it especially all the beachwater themes wub i really wish tlc decided to bring that water paradisia back  who knows  after all they need to make some girlie sets  girls are a part of their market totally neglected  how many women we have on the boards  really a tiny few unfortunatly  so tlc please bring paradisia back in may 08 p  please  yoda
xwingyoda on aug 13 2007 0811 pm said tks sinner for that cool review  my pleasure xwingyoda on aug 13 2007 0811 pm said this set is not one of my favs never was really a big fan of those raised baseplates but had fantastic parts and mfs  this is only my second raised plate so i still like them p this set has been on my want list for a long time because of the windows xwingyoda on aug 13 2007 0811 pm said once again this pisses me off so much that i was in my dark ages when this theme was out  i loved it especially all the beachwater themes wub me too we are almost the same age so it make sense xwingyoda on aug 13 2007 0811 pm said i really wish tlc decided to bring that water paradisia back  i wouldnt be surprised if they do i think there is a greater chance of a return to paradisia like sets than fabuland i also think tlc is missing the mark with belville
mortensonne on aug 15 2007 0153 pm said great review very funny with little you helping with the building i got the wagon myself i really like it what more did you get morten loved the review does anyone know if my own train sets still available in shops in the uk or just from ebay bl etc
thank you guys for your nice reply  i have to add two pics of my freight train showing a bit more clearly what the size matter is about this is what it looks like when you put the hopper waggon right behind the red car of 4512 it looks a lot better without the red car i had a lot of fun with this review and i will add another one look at the 2nd pic   the next days stay tuned

youve done it again yoda  great reveiw i really like this set but in my opinon 50 is steep considering i wont actually play with it i mean half of it is a track for peat sake ill eventually get it for the mrs puff figure though y
yoda comes through again i love this set but it just costs too much for australians so i will be giving it a miss  it is a shame as it has clams in it 8
yoda i dont thank you for this review and after the chump bucket review too because im so exited to have them that since i ordered them from sh i come back home aftre the work the faster i can with the hope to see a big box on my bed and this even if i know that it tooks more than 67 days to have my order this mrs puff figs is really really nice wub and this 3rd sb head too

holodoc and yoda dont be so hard with or i will call my stronger friend you know this aquasquirrel aka sandy star treck off sponge on d
i might get this and convert it to a lighthouse and warehouse for a city docklooks nice wall on
it looks like a good set but i would rather get the neighborhood one
the lizard looks the best to me  put him in a town and youve got a monster terrorising the residents dr s
great review as always y lego is timeless so there is no such thing as an old set i never build brick monsterscreatures but this set had such a nice assortment of parts that i had to pick a couple up as they werent clearancing out on shop  home i absolutely love dark orange and tan so it was an automatic win i love the use of familiar characters in the review i can almost hear hinckley screaming my megabloks p you sort of look like youre planning some vulture stew though might have to start a new challenge to determine a winner there sinner and his big pot o doom vs giant vulture only thing is does everything horrify the mrs she seems perpetually shocked andor dismayed at the goings on here now that i think about it i can see why im occasionally shocked andor dismayed 8 brick built beasties on y
a very fine review of a very fine set thanks sinner y the variety of cool colors in that sets just formidable one more beautiful creator set indeed roaarrrr on 
imperialshadows on aug 16 2007 0843 pm said only thing is does everything horrify the mrs she seems perpetually shocked andor dismayed at the goings on here now that i think about it i can see why im occasionally shocked andor dismayed 8 i just love playing with the new princess you will be seeing her shocked and dismayed for a while to come holodoc on aug 16 2007 1043 pm said i also bought this set but in combination with 4883 when it was on sale 50  hurray at sh dont remind me  i bought that set on sh when it was on sale but my bank delayed the transaction so it sold out a broken man i seached stores over and over again for a good deal on that set and i found it last week for 25 aud 60 list ahhh sweet holodoc on aug 16 2007 1043 pm said i have different feelings about this set on the one hand i love the lion he is really impressive even my wife not known for being lego enthusiastic asked me if there were more animals of this kind the lion is  restricted  poseable and the colors used are fantastic wub 3 models can be built simultaneously  thats great on the other hand i still dont know what to do with these rotation joints wacko and the other models are somehow disappointing compared to the lion well i will have to get back to you on what i do with it p i do agree though that most of the other models are not worth making i made the snake because in the instructions he is shown terrorising the lizard 
sinner on aug 16 2007 0401 pm said i just love playing with the new princess you will be seeing her shocked and dismayed for a while to come shocked and dismayed when you give her flowers last week she was also shocked and dismayed i think shes just allergic for both flowers and animals i hope shes not allergic for skeletons too p d by the way great review you made a nice warm soft place to sleep for hinckley xd
wout on aug 16 2007 1113 pm said by the way great review you made a nice warm soft place to sleep for hinckley xd nothing but the best for hinckley p ickelpete on aug 17 2007 0436 am said great review sinner i regret not buying this set when i saw it cheap in a local sale  dont worry it could be worse i regret not buying cloud city and the technic backhoe for half price a few years back  wacko
mr mandalorian on sep 1 2007 1227 pm said so uh are you willing to sell that vulture sweet i was going to buy the set so i could moc an eagle out of that vulture but i never bought it pleeaase xd sorry but i actually wanted almost every part in this set its one of those sets i could buy 100 of and still want all of the pieces wub in particular the vulture has several hinges black wings and the dark red pieces that i want loads of sorry 
nice review although that picture of the ad reminded me of how some of the things surrounding jurassic world lego that is seems hastily put together just look at that the minifig he is star lords head and hair indiana jones torso with different arms and city legs to me that seems a bit weak especially for a video game
nice little review now i definitely have to check if the toys r us in dortmund has it too edited by kcmatze 03 may 2015  0134 pm
im pleased to see that this is available for purchase at least in some parts of the world rather than only being available with the jw game nice review ill going to scope out whether toys r us in sweden is carrying them although ive never seen polybags in there before
great review but spoiler i didnt see or even hear mentioned a galliminus or any sort of dino trap in the movie i wonder where this design came from
lego 31036 creator toy and grocery shop thanks to eurobricks for making this review possible for years lego has offered a house of some sort in the creator line each year  with the standard creator 3in1 instructions thats given us a very wide variety of housing in 2014 they added a business option with their 31026 bike shop and cafe set this continues into this years toy and grocery shop set these shops are smaller than the very detailed modular buildings but that should help them fit in better with the other city sets and this also lets them get into more kids cities with their lower pricetag name toy and grocery shop set number 31036 pieces 466 price 3999 minifigs 2 theme creator year of release 2015 links bricklink peeron brickset the box the front of the box shows the a version model out of the three plus insets of the b and c versions i like the sortaeuropean looking backdrop it goes well with the styling of the buildings interestingly the main model is shown opened up for play while the two insets show those versions folded the box top on the top of the box lego helpfully shows that with 3 of these sets you can make a whole street the box back on the back you get to again see all three versions together but this time folded its a little creepy though with those clones running around  the manuals yep three actual printed manuals theres nothing indicating them as being a b and c models but its pretty obvious looking at the designs which is the main model and which are the alternates the contents bags of parts and two plates nothing terribly exciting to see here the minifigs nothing new here but two nice figs nonetheless well bricklink does say that both figs are unique to this set but theres not any new parts to them the closest thing to rare is the female head  its only in this set 2013s dragon mountain castle set a uk store grand opening set and one of the 2014 holiday freebie sets the faces arent that unique but i guess this exact combo of two faces on the head is i love the kid torso with the spaceman on it the minifig backs no back printing on anything here except for an alternate female face sorry i do like that her two faces are so different though thats much better than when a head has a scared and a more scared face the c build enough with the basics lets build im going to review them in the same order i built them backwards since you can tell immediately looking at the 3 designs that theyre going to use different numbers of pieces and so forth i figured id build the smallest first lest it seem like a letdown all three have some basic similarities  the two plates are hinged to give a building that opens for play they also do have interiors which you can see starting to form here the c build front its a pretty quick build so its done already heres the front of the building with it opened up like this it appears to be two separate stores a newsstand and some sort of shop you can enter all the printed tiles help give the newsstand a detailed appearance but im not sure why theyve got a 100 bill lying on the ledge the c build rear from the back side the interiors are pretty plain the shop half has a plant in a jar and a weird chair and the newsstand just has a register the c build sides heres the two sides of the folded building on the hinge side theres a bunch of windows in a disjointed wall with random colors on the other why did they put in a huge window when the set does include a transclear door that could have gone there and you get a small patch of plants like so many sets seem to have these days the c build extras thats a lot of leftovers there and not just little stuff  multiple doors stairs etc and unused sand green is always a little sad the b build 1 a pretty similar start with the hinge and little garden and some tiles along the ground the b build 2 now we see a big windowed wall some details like lights and how it has the usual alternate model weird part usage  like a 1x4 brick with side studs being used over the doorway even though those side studs will not get used the b build front the finished building gives us a nice little post office with a lettercarrying bird on the roof hope thats not their normal method of delivery something about the colors just doesnt work for me though the combo of white  light grey  dark grey  black  sand green plus tan is just too much the tan window and door frames i dont like the b build inside on the inside things are weird the counter on the left is ok but the light above the door with a yellow clip ugly is too big and everything else over there by the door doesnt make much sense either the b build sides i like the front side here except the colors are still too much the bench greenery mailbox on the corner and streetlight are all nice the boy is a little creepy though  binoculars in hand plus a telescope on the roof of the post office why the hinge side shows more of the weird colors you get in the wall but thats going to be hidden when the set is open plus we even see that on big modulars at times so its not so terrible the b build leftovers again a lot of leftover parts its obvious this was another alternate but itd be nice to see more of them used to make a bigger building but lets move on to the model that does use them all the a build 1 the first half starts like this maybe its just my bias but it already feels like a more detailed build bottles on the wall the yellow and red awning over the window etc the a build 2 the other half starts off with detailed work too i think thats a red vending machine the stairs are also very solidly built i also appreciate the effort to get that diagonal base where a door will be  its such a nice touch to have sections of a building that arent right angles the a build 3 not too much has been added but i wanted to showcase the tiny toys before they get hidden by a wall that robot and train are just fantastic little micro builds the a build 4 things are coming together quickly the walls windows and doors get the first floor nearly done im still not big on the sand green and tan combo but i do really like the red and yellow awnings the a build 5 it appears the shop owner lives upstairs since weve got a bedroom forming here the bed is a little plain but the table and lamp on the other half are great and my big fingers did not like putting all those railings on the balcony with the telescope posts and tile tops knocked quite a few off before i got them all done the a build front and its done all the details make this set really feel like a minimodular the roofline has great greebling and the shop contents and on and on its not perfect though the tiny car above the toy store door isnt nearly as good as the toys inside and the kids yellow scooter the wheels arent even on the ground much less able to roll the scooter looks decent though so that counts for something well at least as long as you are at this angle since the boys only got 1 foot on the 1 stud wide scooter the a build inside most of the interior has been seen already the roof though does a nice job of being interesting for a roof a skylight the edge rails etc and you can see theres not much wrong color in the walls the a model sides an interesting building when folded up very tall and skinny you can tell its not really meant to be displayed this way  its meant to be open the good  lots i like the awning the diagonal door the flowerbox under the upper window the folding gate on the balcony that lets it be used in open or closed mode and the green  white  blue colors the bad  well the stairs end short of the upper door i still dont really like the tan doorframes i think black would have been better and why dont the upper floors match up in size the a model leftovers ah thats more like it just a few small pieces left as spares the errors you might have to click through to the fullsize versions but i did catch a few weird errors in the manuals first in the photo of the newsstand the map in the front corner is on there sideways the map does have a clear north arrow printed on it on the second image the boys feet are hanging off the edge just unusual to see an alignment error in the manual like that the comparison here are this set and the modular detective office side by side theres a huge difference  as youd expect but is the difference more than youd expect this set is 466 parts 40 the do is 2262 pieces and 160 5 times the parts 4 times the price looking at them side by side id expect a bigger difference in both the conclusion so whats my conclusion on this model i love the main model but the alternates are meh its a nice set for someone looking for a town building other than police and fire stations but who isnt ready to move to the modular line compared to the modulars though it seems overpriced part of that is because the huge modulars are actually a great deal compared to other lego sets im also a little surprised that its so small when you compare it to the city sets like a police station those are generally designed with much more open space letting them be more of a playset this one is small and cramped so itd be tougher to play in its not really a city set though the ratings value 710  its under the 10 cents a part mark but thats largely due to having a ton of tiny parts all those flowers and decorative 1x1 round studs add up quickly design 710  good and bad on the colors and theres a big difference between the quality of the main vs alternate models having so many leftover pieces is one thing when the creator set makes 3 very different models ie a boat plane and truck when its 3 buildings it seems wasteful to have so many parts leftover minifigs 610  im not sure they both fit the set i suppose the boy is going to the toy store and the woman is going to the grocery but theres no storekeeper in either the woman doesnt look like a storekeeper to me so thats why i assume shes another shopper i love the boy but the woman is just soso  except that i do appreciate the head having two very different expressions but again that doesnt fit the set i cant see her scared face being used playability 610  the shops are detailed with registers and so forth but its all so tiny itd be hard to play with the figs in it parts 910  tons of windows and doors plus nice sand green bricks but some things the large blue curves used on the roof for example are weirdly specialized and would be hard to use in another building design overall 710  id recommend doing what i did  build the alternates first then the main since thats how youll want to leave it id really like to see the price a little lower compared to other sets again the part count is inflated due to so many tiny parts and the finished building is tiny but its loaded with neat details
nice review mostlytechnic i particularly like the use of grey background surface for the pictures it somehow makes the building stand out more good job
a terrific very comprehensive review  but im not at all impressed with this set it feels like a mishmash of bricks with no clear design aesthetic and as such blatantly underdeveloped ie designed to hit a pricebrick count point rather than provide a solid set in the creator town tradition compared to other creator sets at this price point 31025  mountain hut for example it feels utterly uninspired and ugly edited by johnny6666 04 may 2015  1002 am
stevkir on 04 may 2015  0806 am said any chance you have a picture of the news stand next to the detectives office building as i would love to see the scaling for that sorry i do not  but itd be tiny and not look like the same scale johnny6666 on 04 may 2015  0959 am said it feels like a mishmash of bricks with no clear design aesthetic and as such blatantly underdeveloped ie designed to hit a pricebrick count point rather than provide a solid set in the creator town tradition compared to other creator sets at this price point 31025  mountain hut for example it feels utterly uninspired and ugly well i felt like the main model almost got to good looking  id replace some of the tan with black but otherwise im ok with that one
cheers for putting in the time to create a wonderful review i am not a huge fan of this set i like the colour combinations but it all seems a bit alltoosimple it can and will be nicely modularised though
thanks mostlytechnic for this review i only brought this set to continue the shop series from creator in my opinion its only half as good as the bike shopcafe one plus it doesnt fit the same as that pair of shops oh well maybe next year lego creator will have a better one brick on review on mostlytechnic 
thank you andy for your speed review y so theres nothing left to open while advent  i like all the tiny sets it neednt be another police and fireman   but well what would an advent calendar be without them d one thing about the train traffic lights tlc used to give us similar lights but you could show either of the lights with the other one being covered that one was waaay better  just a little piece more would have done the thing and i wont mention the radarcrapdish x let me quote franz beckenbauer is denn scho weihnacht legendary quote from an promotional job he did years ago  is it xmas already
asuka on sep 13 2007 0115 pm said but although i loved the last years one i think they could do another theme or perhaps even two calendars because right now castles pretty hot imo really hope they do different themes next year but not sure how theyd managed 24 different minisets for castle can envisage 78 minifigs but what else
andy0306uk on sep 13 2007 0136 pm said really hope they do different themes next year but not sure how theyd managed 24 different minisets for castle can envisage 78 minifigs but what else one word civilians yes i know not going to happen  
whoa its out already places order i guess i should thank you andy because i might have missed this one just like i missed last years calendar now all i have to do is wait two weeks and pick it up at the post office across the border
andy0306uk on sep 13 2007 0223 pm said thanks are not needed but if anyone wants to show me gratitude by sending me all their orange andor pink bricks   pink bricks mine would fit in a matchbox   3 and 1   but i wont send them anyway p d
phoinix on sep 13 2007 0318 pm said no girlsagain and no santa whats up with that sure there are many nice pieces to give life to every city layout i would love something more simple a girl taking her dog for a walk a boy on a bicycle simpler thingsnot all the workmen again i agree a girl with a dog or a boy with bicycle in a small set would be so nice and strange enough so difficult for tlc nice review
xwingyoda on sep 13 2007 0657 pm said ohh tks for the news 8 it really looks interesting belville always have great parts in cool colours  excellent indeed  yoda wow interesting lego is really expanding with this advent calendar thing watch next year theyll have ones for specific themes boy o boy think about it star wars advent calendar indy advent claendar of course this is only speculation but it would be cool xd ill probably buy both of these even though im a boy   so i get 2 surprises every day instead of one p 
im a big fan of anime and have watched some mechas like full metal panic neon evangelion genesis it is a mecha and chobits well she is a robot so i was curious to see what this new exo force line was all about the colorful sets and mangalike characters didnt persuade me right away but the urgent need for a couple of white 3x3 wing plates made me purchase this little thing it cost me 70 dkr as you can see on the box this is 930 euro or about the same an american has to pay for the new republic cruiser pretty expensive for so few pieces 90  a spare technic pin the box an actionpacked box with one of the sides being oddly empty except from the legologo whats inside there is a small building instruction two polybags no bag building here and a sticker sheet with alarmingly many stickers the build it takes so little time to build this set that i didnt get to take any pictures of the process every step was accompanied by an element description although i doubt most of you will need that with so few pieces to keep track on most of the dark green bricks have a sticker  even the slopes where the rough surface makes stickers fall off easily there should also have been a sticker on the windshield but i wanted to keep that piece clean for better usage later im one of those who keeps stickers on the bricks the model you want to see this model from the front as the back is pretty much neglected there isnt much for the pilot to grab a hold on either he is pretty much a sitting duck up there with the screen giving him only partial cover there is a huge wrench next to him which kind of symbolizes the crudeness of the mech the set isnt called cyclone defender for nothing the right arm might hold an ordinary light assault riffle but the other has a spinning disc with samurai swords which you can turn with the yellow knob on the backside those of you who have seen robot wars might remember the incredible power of this melee weapon from a robot named hypnodisc it would have been nice had there been a pullback motor to power the disc im sure lego has a lot of these in stock but the simple mechanism still works reasonably well the riffle comes off and a pin makes it easy to hold with the hand but the disc is fixed to the arm it is also a problem that the swords get misaligned quickly during play the minifig i really like this minifig because of the neat idea with an expression on each side that lego has made a standard for exo force posability most mechmocers show off their creations using gundamlike poses with two joints per leg one being the ankles and one for an arm i thought of some less serious poses crawling silent like a ninja belly gliding kick off upside down final rating i have to disappoint you here this is my first set in this line and i have absolutely no idea of how good it is the last robot i bought was the awesome 6889 spyrius recon robot for the same price but it is in a completely different genre the set had what i expected two white wings and is as such a nononsense set i guess it would be of more use if you have some more exo force which i dont 610 ups has great minifig weapons and is easy to build downs crude design and a bit too expensive for what you get brickshelf gallery
nice review  but you paid how much this set is priced around 7 euros here in germany which is a very fair price for what you get in my oppinion its a little disappointing though that i couldnt think of any alternate builds for this set and there are no inspirations on the box or the ef website
i guess thats what some people refer to as sarcasm 
dj force on sep 17 2007 1102 am said i guess thats what some people refer to as sarcasm  oh 8 my bad 
i couldnt find a review of this wonderful set in here so here it goes i got the set for msrp 180kr  24 euro which is a fair price here in denmark as all other creator sets there are instructions for several models 3 in this case the box the box is a little larger than city sets in the same price range the primary model is shown on the front while you see the secondary ones on the back what you get 312 pieces in 5 polybags and two building instructions one for the primary model and the other for the rest the built it was impossible for me to speed build this model because of the nifty functional details from the retractable landing gear to the wings that can turn by means of the handle in the back of the model it took me a full hour to build it because i had to test how it all works together the finished model the landing gear isnt fully enclosed when retracted and the models are subminifig scale but i still love the design of the models the doors for the rear wheels open as you pull the wheels down and the final piece of functionality comes from the wings that can either tilt the horizontal stabilizers or have elevators wing in wings out wings in wings out ratings as a whole i actually like this set even more than the big rig the models are just as diverse but the added functionality makes the plane more fun to play with than the rig price 710  a good price but not a bargain as the big rig design 910  there could have been a sligtly higher level of details in the main model but all models are really good looking and i especially like the design of the hovercraft functionality 1010  i guess you could ask for working rudders opening cockpit and so on but the plane is really filled with movable parts and the turning of the wings works really well secondary models 710  a hovercraft how awesome is that if only the last model was just as inventive instead of a standard helicopter modifiability 810  the bricks are in ordinary colours and there is a good variety of them giving you plenty of possibilities for mocing you can easily make the main model into something that looks more like an f14 910 probably as good as it gets for a creator set in this price range it is entertaining to both build and play with looks good and the secondary models are worth building as well brickshelf gallery
great review lasse d a definite two y up i bought this set for the swingwing concept i was very curious what tlcs design was like i have been working on modifying it just a little to look more like the f14 so far i have completed the back section but i need to finish the cockpit overall this is a great set i wub tlcs swingwing concept model on
a fine set a great review and good additional pictures thanks lasse d and sinner teamwork on y
lasse d on sep 21 2007 0509 am said thank you sinner for bringing the pictures of the hovercraft i think it is a really cool model but the steering wheel doent work too well i agree errr sorry if i have annoyed you by posting the pictures looking at your brickshelf folder you had taken photos of the hovercraft as well and i seem to have stepped on your toes  feel free to beat me up or i could do it myself if you prefer 8 i prefer bigger pictures as i get tired of clicking waiting clicking waiting if the pictures are all there all you have to do is click then wait p 
batbrick on sep 21 2007 0451 pm said glad to see creator making great sets the theme has so much potential i just wish that this set had more models  according to the guy that designed this set there was a space shuttle alt model but this year lego decided to not show them wacko lasse d on sep 21 2007 0536 pm said you didnt step on my toes because i took the pictures after you posted them p i just wanted to add them for completeness thats a relief  i didnt make the helicopter as it didnt impress me very much i was curious about the hovercraft though
3499 is not too shabby the big guy itself is nice but the gem of the set is the mech really nice mech i must say great for posing the mini figs suprisingly nice little buildvehicle never seen this element beforeits probably nothing new though lol no articulation of the legs nooooooo phew the front two legs do articulate would of been bad if they didnt overall i give the set 7810 not the best but its actually quite nice and the yellow mech is awesome if it was him on his own then 9410 cheers
i so need to buy this where did you get it from it says limited so i guess its only available in certain stores as the bridge walker was or supernova or golden guardian
iamded on sep 22 2007 0742 pm said nice y doesnt look that bad at all but whats with the firs pic the one of skeleton tower wacko is it so we can see the corner of the intructions p  thats what i was thinking wacko in the future when i buy all the exoforce sets off bricklink or ebay ill get this one for the decent yellow mecha and cool function carrying mecha and just for completion sake most people are getting to worked up over this one bad set doesnt mean the end of exoforce though i would like to see less twolegged mechas and more unconventional designs like the shadow crawler and bridge walker batbrick away 
consider the first pic a freeby pic to whet your appetite  8 
i got a set of this but i planning to sell away to earn money to buy another set since im almost broke right now d i got a set of this but i planning to sell away to earn money to buy another set since im almost broke right now d

it is no secret that marvel is one of the most successful companies right now from the avengers to the xmen and down to even the most obscure characters like antman every one of their movies has been a big hit until now the latest marvel movie fant4stic was released last month and while i have not seen it yet im sure its just as great as their other movies i mean it has the word fantastic in the title after all and being the smart business that they are the lego company decided to get in on the hype early and capitalize on this movies undoubtful success two years in advance by making a set featuring fant4stics main villain dr doom now thats what i call forward thinking but did they do a good job with it or were they being overhasty lets find out set number 76005 name spiderman daily bugle showdown theme marvel super heroes subtheme ultimate spiderman year of release 2013 pieces 476 minifigs 5 price 4999 usd sh description quote swing into the daily bugle and stop dr doom™ dr doom™ and his henchman beetle™ are attacking the daily bugle in their speedy jet to steal spidermans™ secret identity its up to spiderman™ and nova™ to swing in and stop them trigger the daily bugles explosion functions to cause destruction as the jet fires missiles stop dr doom™ from hitching the jets anchor hook to the safe with spidermans secret inside knock beetle™ off the building with the swinging web attack and drop dr doom™ inside with the rooftop trapdoor then fly nova™ in through the broken window with the dumpster catapult function and send those villains back to where they came from includes spiderman™ nova™ dr doom™ beetle™ and j jonah jameson™ with accessories and weapons the first thing that comes to mind after reading this description is wow thats a lot of tms anyway here are some resource links for this set brickset bricklink rebrickable the box since this set is based on the ultimate spiderman cartoon the box has the usual usm design with the red marvel super heroes background an illustration of spidey in the upper right corner and the usm logo in the lower right as usual there is a minifig line up in the lower left and since this was before the terrible redesign you can see the full body of the minifigs i really miss this type of line up there is quite a lot going on here doctor doom attacking the daily bugle in his jet while simultaneously reaching for j jonah jameson below with his jets claw spiderman reluctantly swings in to save him while nova fights off the beetle its a pretty cool scene even though its not very accurate to the show in beetle mania the episode that this set is based on the beetle was indeed out to kill jjj but it was in order to stop him from exposing his identity not spidermans although spidey was next on jjjs list and while he is a recurring villain on the show doctor doom had nothing to do with this plot and didnt even appear in the episode aside from a brief cameo its awesome that they included him anyway though so im not gonna complain note that the tower is so tall that it wraps around the top of the box there you can also see a scale reference with the spiderman minifig on the back of the box you can see the interior of the bugle and all of its play features which there are quite a few of since this is a playset its all illustrated pretty well although legos choice of sound effects is still a mystery to me i dont get why they dont go for spidermans signature fwip instead of fazzing and i didnt know that a breaking window made the sound btoom but i digress contents inside the box you will find three instruction booklets one smaller than the others a comic book a fairly large sticker sheet five numbered bags and two loose pieces a white string piece and a gray 16x8 plate there arent really any notable pieces and nobody cares about the comic bock no offense to the artist so lets get right to the instructions they are pretty straight forward and easy to follow some of the pages have a ghostly image of spidey nova and dr doom in the top right corner which is fitting since these are all minifigs that appear in this set which is strangely not something that can be said for many other super heroes instructions with this type of artwork minifigures as with most super heroes sets most people will get this set mainly for the minifigs so without further ado lets talk about them spiderman is the same old bootless one you get in almost every usm set not much to say about him some might complain that we dont get spideys alter ego peter parker in this set but in the usm cartoon mj is actually the one who works at the daily bugle not peter curse the creators of this cartoon for ruining our chances of getting a new peter parker minifig by trying to mix things up next we get j jonah jameson he appeared in a spiderman 2 set before but this is a complete redesign he now has a blue suit with a red tie a unique face print and that combedback hair in dark gray this new hairpiece doesnt suit him at all and the old flat top hair was perfect for him in my opinion so i dont know why they changed it the good thing about this change however is the fact that this piece is exclusive to this set in that color nova on the other hand is spoton he comes with a new helmet mold and some nice torso printing however he too is missing his boots tlc should have started making dualcolored legs a long time ago here are some reference images to compare them to okay so jjjs hair may not be completely black in the show but i still think they should have given his minifig a black hairpiece his suit is also not quite the right color he rarely appears in person in the show including the episode this set is based on and is usually seen on screens around new york so this is the best picture of him i could find i guess i should be happy they included a minifig of him at all in the episode it was actually mary jane who was at the bugle during beetles attack so it would have made more sense to include her but we got her in the spidercopter set one year later so thats ok all three of them have back printing in jjjs case im using that term loosely since it is only comprised of two lines but its nice that they went through the trouble of adding them both jjj and nova come with angry alternate faces it almost looks like theyre trying to outangry each other who do you think looks angrier let me know in the comments section below now lets talk about the bad guys even though he would be better off in a fantastic four set its great to finally get victor van doom one of the greatest marvel villains ever and in comics in general he comes with a dark green hood which was new and exclusive in that color at the time and he is the only minifig in this set that has leg printing beetle is a regular minifig with wings the metallic printing on his face and torso is pretty nice but i wish it would have continued onto his legs as well the beetle looks quite accurate to his onscreen counterpart the only thing that could have improved him is a new helmet mold with pointy eyebrowsantennae doctor doom however looks nothing like he does in the movie i just dont understand how lego could have messed him up so badly maybe they were working off of early concept art or something here is a back view of doom and beetle beetle would be a pretty boring minifig if it wasnt for his wings which are awesome with their holographic texture they are so mesmerizing i could look at those things all day this piece also appeared in trans light green in the galaxy squad sets which came out at the same time here they are without their gear as you can see they both have back printing as well and no doctor doom does not come with an alternate facial expression which is fine since you cant see much of his expressions due to his mask anyway heres a look at dr doom and nova without their headgear some say that dooms face looks too cartoony but i think it looks fine nova is wearing stylish goggles as a way of explaining his white eyes its a far better explanation than the batsweatband they did the same thing with the masked wolverine later here are all the figs with their accessories jjj comes with a camera so that he can take more pictures of spiderman beetle comes with one of those overused adu guns which is a very poor representation of his wristmounted blasters i hate to say it but even those bulky new stud shooters would have been a better representation of his weapons spidey comes with his usual string of webbing and nova comes with some iron man style translucent studs the weird thing is that they are red while his powers have a blue glow in the show doctor doom sadly doesnt get any accessories but who needs weapons when you have a jet with a claw and flickfire missiles the build the first bag contains spiderman a brick separator and the parts to build the ground floor of the dbc building after a quick and straightforward build you get this the dumpster and street lamp are separate from the building and since the lamp post is not built onto any baseplate and is quite topheavy it gets knocked over pretty easily maybe its meant to be that way but i would have preferred it if you could stick it onto the baseplate of the building on which there is unfortunately not enough space to do so as you would expect the second bag has the parts for the first floor of the building this is also the bag that contains beetle after another fairly simple build youll find yourself with a two story building with a spiderweb one side and a fire escape on the other however you have to apply three stickers during this section of the build which is never fun can you guess whats in bag number 3 yup the second floor of the building you dont need superpowers to predict that one also this bag contains nova and jameson the build of this section is a bit repetitive since the second floor is mostly the same as the first and it takes slightly longer to build since you have to build the rooftop as well also in addition to the two window stickers you have to apply ten 2x2 tile stickers trying to do this without having any of them being crooked is a real pain in the megablocks the next bag contains doctor doom and the cockpit of his jet dooms cape is in the usual square white box and the string for the claw is folded up in a piece of tape heres what you get at the end of this section looks more like an escape pod than a jet at this point the final bag is the smallest as it only includes the few parts needed to finish the doom jet once you build the wings and tail you stick them onto the cockpit via technic pins and youre done spare parts these are the parts that are left over after the build there is the brick separator of course an extra antenna and the usual little bits and bops whats really awesome though is that they give you an extra pair of beetles wings considering what a neat piece this is and that this is the only set in which it comes in transblack make this a very welcome spare that you can use in your customs the finished set here is the complete set the dbc building looks quite tall especially when you count the antenna comparing it to a screenshot from the episode the general look of the building is there although there are some inaccuracies aside from the fact that it is obviously way downscaled the screens that show jjj ranting about spiderman should have been hexagonal not square and should have wrapped around the building however considering how many stickers you would have had to apply if they would have made it accurate im actually glad they kept the screen mercifully small much like doctor doom himself the doom jet didnt actually appear in the beetle mania episode however it did appear in a later episode titled not a toy in which spiderman plays around with captain americas shield accidentally drops it in doctor dooms latvarian embassy and has to try to retrieve it and yes that episode was as godawful as it sounds heres a screenshot of the jet from that episode like with the dbc they managed to capture the general shape of the vehicle although it doesnt look quite as good as in the show the color scheme is too dark and it looks kind of blockier lets take a closer look at the jet there is no real way to reel the claw in unfortunately however there is a stud on the back of the jet that you can stick it onto needless to say this is not the ideal way of storing it i would have much preferred it if they would have attached it onto winch instead the engines on the wings can be turned even though they dont turn in the show and there is a flickfire missile on each side even if its not much to look at at least its a very swooshable vehicle on top of each wing there is a tile with the emblem of latvaria there was no such emplems on the jet in the cartoon but they are useful pieces that make it clear whose jet it is so im glad they included them there is nothing inside the cockpit except for a seat and unless you want to ruin dr dooms nice dark green cape i wouldnt put him inside of it they could have at least printed a control panel onto that empty 2x2 tile play features since this is a playset lets look at all the play features it has to offer like all playsets the building is open in the back so you can play inside on the ground floor there is a potted plant and nothing else seriously is this all they could come up with for this floor they could have included a security desk a lounge a second plant or anything else as it is its just a boring empty lobby the first floor is a bit more interesting there is a safe a swiveling chair and a pin board with various pictures of spiderman there is one tile that reads the true identity of spiderman which is supposedly what the villains are after i wonder how jameson got this information in the first place speaking of jameson the second floor is devoted to his office where he can sit and yell at his nonpresent employees demanding more pictures of spiderman it also has a swiveling chair as well as a desk with a lamp and a computer there is a technic beam connecting his desk with the ceiling of the first floor which you can remove in order to take off the upper half of the building but its difficult to do so i dont recommend it as you may have noticed in the picture above there are a few red pegs sticking out of the building these are for triggering the play features most of them are on the roof there is one on what looks like an air conditioning unit if you place spiderman holding is webstring on the jumper plate in front of it and push the peg spidey goes bungeejumping off the building wee there is also one that sticks out of the side of the building which when pulled triggers a trap door the third red peg on the roof can be used to pop off the dbc sign why is it called the dbc you ask it stands for daily bugle communications since in this version of spiderman the daily bugle is not only a newspaper but a news tv station as well one that promotes its own highly biased views so basically the fox news of the marvel universe i guess if youre an old school spiderman fan you could just leave off the c and have it just stand for daily bugle the sign above the main entrance wont be so easily modified however there is also a peg between the first and second floor which when pushed pops out one of the windows on the first floor the safe is only attached to a couple of jumper plates and has some jumper plates on top of it as well so you can easily attach the doom jets claw to it and rip it out of the building as seen on the back of the box there are also some snot bricks on the corners of the building that you can attach spiderwebs or spidey himself onto for some wallcrawling and webslinging action this is not so much a play feature as it is just a feature but as i mentioned earlier there is a fire escape on the left side of the building this was a neat idea as it helps it feel like a building in new york city but it is executed very poorly there is no hole big enough for the minifigs to climb down through so they would have to climb down the ladders from the outside which makes no sense no wonder spiderman always needs to rescue people from burning buildings there is one more play feature in the form of the dumpster you can open the lid put a minifig inside and make them jump by hitting a tab in the back remember this is before the introduction of super jumpers but nevertheless its a pretty strange place to launch minifigs out of i guess even super heroes like to do some dumpster diving you dont think this was funny no well me neither but thats the type of humor that this show loves to use sigh anyway lets get on to the ratings ratings design 25  the set looks ok despite many inaccuracies the dbc building and the jet somewhat resemble their onscreen counterparts and dont look too bad but they definitely could be better build 15  a mostly unchallenging and repetitive build with an attrocious amount of stickers minifigs 45  definitely the strongest point of the set some of the figs could be better but four out of five of them are exclusive to this set doctor doom is easily the best and probably the most desirable one  unless the fant4stic movie portraits him so badly that nobody will be interested in him but thats impossible playability 45  as you would expect from a playset the playability is quite high although i still feel like there could have been more parts 35  not many rare parts if youre looking for parts for building your own skyscraper with tan walls and lots of doors and windows though this set is for you price 35  at 476 parts for 50 this set is a bit pricey but it is somewhat justified by all the large window and wall pieces overall 35  this set is mediocre at best playsets are always a good choice for spiderman sets since they give spidey something to swing from but unfortunately they are rarely pulled off well the jet is blocky the building is barebones and the price feels too high the only reason to get this set are the four exclusive minifigs this set was discontinued early this year but if you still see it on clearance somewhere go ahead and get one for the minifigs and parts or buy multiples and use the parts to build a better dbc building i hope you enjoyed this review it is part of the reviewers academys 7th anniversary were not doing a big celebration this year due to other commitments but look out for more reviews with the 7th anniversary banner soon now if youll excuse me i am off to see fant4stic i hope its as fantastic as it promises to be 2 hours later i was wrong i was horribly horribly wrong
hahah entertaining and informative a great read thanks for the review on a side note i thought fantfourstic wasok on the poorer side of ok the exposition felt like it was from a 3 hour film because it was so long and towards the middle it started to drag the ending was terrible edited by mutant orc 12 september 2015  0953 pm
this is my favourite set should be making more spidey sets like this imo cough oscorp tower cough
yeah im really hoping the concept artdoom minifig joke is just that i picked this set up on whim mostly because a needed a building to add to a moc as a parts pack its not a bad set at all
i actually am surprised at the poor points this set has gotten as this is one of my favorite sets that marvel has put out i actually would like to hear what your thoughts are on the usm  lego dr doom comparison oky thanks for the review httpmarvelanimateordoomusmpng edited by zorglorfian 14 september 2015  0644 am
thanks everyone darthbrickus on 13 september 2015  0253 pm said thanks for the review ive had that set for quite a while and its among my favorite marvel superheroes sets actually compared to the other stuff we usually get to accompany the minifigs all those laboratorys the most recent construction site and the hydra fortress  yeah youre being a little harsh here perhaps youre right maybe i was a bit too harsh on this set dont get me wrong its not a bad set especially compared to some other sets we have gotten in this price range but somehow i was still expecting more darthbrickus on 13 september 2015  0253 pm said maybe youre still suffering from ptsd after watching fantfourstic i still have not seen it actually and i dont ever plan to so dont worry no okys were harmed in the making of this review im a brickmaster on 13 september 2015  0355 am said yeah im really hoping the concept artdoom minifig joke is just that yes the whole doctor doomfant4stic thing was obviously a joke everybody knows what doctor doom is supposed to look like except for the makers of fant4stic apparently zorglorfian on 14 september 2015  0644 am said i actually would like to hear what your thoughts are on the usm  lego dr doom comparison oky thanks for the review httpmarvelanimateordoomusmpng theres not much to say really doom in usm looks just like he does in the comics and lego recreated that look perfectly again hes definitely the best part of this set
overall i wish marvel in particular would have more playsets in its theme batman has several great ones in the dc theme but then again if this is the best playset to date for marvel maybe its better just to leave well enough alone i would definitely like to see them attempt something in the 100 us price range because i think it could be good marvel needs an equivalent to the arkham asylum set regarding this set i saved myself some money and bought the 4 minifigs i needed all but spidey on bricklink for less than half the set price edited by dmarvin 17 september 2015  0625 pm
another great review oky i love this set

hello everyone by now many excited lego star wars fans have started receiving their ucs falcon some of us here enjoy writing reviews and sharing our thoughts i mentioned to yoda that i was planning on doing a review of this set but it would likely take me a few weeks of 12 hours per night to finish building the set yoda suggested that i do the review as i go so everyone could see the progress of the set what a great idea so here is the first entry feel free to comment along the way i will try to post photos and updates every night on the build then wrap up the review when i complete the set if you have any specific questions or photo requests please be sure to ask ucs millennium falcon reviewed by dunamis set 10179 5195 pieces 49995 from lego shop at home the box obviously this is a box like no other first of all it comes in its own shipping carton inside of that there is a standard lego carton finally inside the lego carton we have the actual millennium falcon box and a nice little letter thanking you for buying the biggest lego set ever shipping box naboo set provided for scale lego carton and letter lego carton the millennium falcon box is really quite nice there are lots of photos and it does a good job of selling the set there are 8 individual pieces of tape that keep the lid on the box the limited first edition comes with a seal on the lower left corner millennium falcon box naboo set provided for scale lifting the lid straight up reveals one compartment of several bags on the right on the left we find a thin square box like a pizza box that contains the official certificate of authenticity two sticker sheets and one enormous manual under the pizza box we find two more compartments each filled with several typical lego bags the box weighs 24 pounds stickers pizza box pieces in compartments not quite sure what the little 30th anniversary sticker is for yet the certificate of authenticity is on heavy paper and is suitable for framing more to come tomorrow its late here
nice review ill be watching and waiting for the rest
will follow this impatiently  really like the start of the review y you always seems to pull it of nicely in comparission with the exasperating yoda xd p build on play on on on
many tks dunamis for doing that its really great and i cant wait monitoring your progress on the beast 8 like it was mentionned in another thread the box looks less gigantic than i thought  remember the isd box  that was a huge box  is the instruction book in the pizza box  how big is it  im sure its really big and i hope for our sake that the colours are clearly marked xd if you know what i mean d  tks againand im so looking forward to your next post  ras 74 on sep 27 2007 0851 am said you always seems to pull it of nicely in comparission with the exasperating yoda xd p what what what  have you stopped your medication once again xd yoda
excellent beginning our numbers are very close but i havent the luxury of space to build it so ill be enjoying it by proxy through you enjoy y
what a wonderful idea and how nice from you sweet and go killer go
the manual the gigantic manual measures 17 x 12 and is almost an inch thick it is spiral bound with a cardboard like front and back and it is 314 pages interesting decision not to break it up into multiple manuals it is almost unwieldy at this size and thickness unfortunately the manual is not available electronically from the lego website hopefully it will be soon missing were the little instructions at the beginning telling you to not build this beast on shag carpet and to sort out the 5000 pieces before you get started i guess they figure if you got 500 to spend on this thing you can build it however you want as usual we get the regular lego manual features  piece call outs for each step  parts inventory at the end of the manual  page numbers  photos of all the other 2007 sets at the end of the manual manual paperback book provided for scale various manual photos 8x8 plate provided for scale im about 2 hours into building and sorting im trying to stay a day ahead in my posting the build has been easier than i thought so far despite the massive number of pieces it has not been too hard to sort and find what you need build photos will start appearing in tomorrows entry
wow i never thought id be impressed by a box but i certainly am now any chance of seeing all 5000 bricks in a big pile vader on sep 28 2007 1014 am said my gawd that manuel is huge thats enough to put a sane man off of buying this setthank gawd none of us are sane thats all i can say xd too true never had i imagined thinking about buying a 350 lego set beforechristmas is soo close yet soo far
so i see they even do mistakes on these  that beast looks really sturdy  that is great  are these yellow parts new  i am not a technic fan and never saw these before another question for you is the instruction book easy to follow especially regarding the colours does the black rally stands out comparing to the dark bley and so on  i sure hope so  cant wait to see moer hehe yoda
xwingyoda on sep 30 2007 1157 am said are these yellow parts new  i am not a technic fan and never saw these before you dont have the building crane 7905 either same color same shape there piece no 32555 four of them included i assume youre not a town fan p 
i have been taking photos for this review for a few months and i finally took the rest of the photos last night all the parts if you want tan this is the set to get main model the garage is a great addition but the car only just fits the main house is very nice looking the windows extend to the sides but not the back the chimney and drainage work very well and i love the basement i think the front works very well when i was making this i was multitasking doing weight training do a set do a step do a set and i ended up missing one of the row paths i discovered this after i finished the basement  the removable roof reveals byo floors probably why this is called a model house the roof was quite interesting to build this is my first large house set so it all was very new to me i love the garage door more nice pipework this photo i misfocused but there isnt much to see anyway the door is a nice touch the grill to the right on both sides is not just decoration as it hides the hinges for the door i also made one of the submodels i was considering keeping this but i decided against it once again the sides have windows but the back doesnt the truck is there to make the photo more worthwhile the roof to this one doesnt come off easily as all the tiles are used for the front just to clarify these houses arent attached so you can arrange them however you want the fronts are quite elaborate and it seems that lego were trying to make this almost like a simpler market street the truck is too small for a minifig but it probably was my favourite car thoughts i highly recommend this set in most countries it is good value for money including australia the design is excellent and three instructions are included the third is a school if anyone has made it and wants to post photos feel free at least one person at eb has made it i love how each house has its own car due to the way the primary model is made it is a bit weak at the corner but that was a design choice my only real complaint about this set is how lego is going though a mould transition and thus some roof slopes are rough others are smooth i can accept either and lego has been moving to smooth slopes for years now but to have a set with about 5050 is annoying the mtt was the same but that is my only gripe with this excellent set wub
thanks for the review and tons of pics ive been wanting to pick this one up since i saw it i thought the 4956 creator house was nice but this model town house is in a completely different league i also like the alternate models that you can see in the catalogues
thank you for the review sinner at first i wanted this set for the 4 blue 1x1 slope tiles but i can see there is much more into it than that it sure is a great value compared to what you get in the building bonanzas no cars and less detail it was funny to see the little side story in your pictures would it be hard to modify the cars to fit minifigs better
i found the use of parts well done by the designers i made a car and then tried to make a house from a different instruction book i could not as several pieces were already used in the car nice to see them using all the parts like that rather than having a lot of extra bits moral of the story one instruction book at a time sweet
lasse d on sep 28 2007 0803 am said it sure is a great value compared to what you get in the building bonanzas no cars and less detail i was all for the white house until i saw this set i still wouldnt mind it though d lasse d on sep 28 2007 0803 am said would it be hard to modify the cars to fit minifigs better the problem with the blue truck is a lack of headroom however the truck is quite low and i cant see it being too hard to change and still have it looking good asuka on sep 28 2007 0830 am said great for every city builder for sure i guess we waited for sets like that we dreamed about them im glad we got them now  i think lego were really listening with this years creator sets wub with the exception of the ferris wheel they are all sets that you could buy 10 of and not have too many hard to use parts asuka on sep 28 2007 0830 am said edit congrats it seems youve got your bucket back p well in this reality anyway xd who knows what goes on in the wacker and walrus world but i do seem to be a tormented soul 
awesome review luckily you have two cute little friends and one beautiful lady to help you out p i likewise love wub this set and your review does it credit i laughed outloud a lot as i read it i especially love you trying to look through the windowless back d d d great job now sort that out and start building for our competition xd
excellent review with great pics and cameo appearances by some of our eb favs y definitely a set that was on my to get list already and this only confirms that might make me want two just because i love tan so much and id like to see if something could be done to bulk up that car great job as always 
i too have bought this set and the only thing i notice which is a bit odd with the exception of there being no floors in the house is the lack of a steering wheel in the car
thanks for the review sinner i definitely want this set now the mixed rough and smooth roof bricks would annoy me on a model like the mtt but here it looks as is if the roof is quite old with some parts being worn and pitted and some parts being replaced with new roof tiles i quite like the effect i agree on which is the best vehicle and if it doesnt fit minifigs just mod the heck out of it xd
sweet looks like an awesome set i might get it i have to see looks like it has a lot of good parts zots

nice review i like this set alot y 
great review sweet i wasnt aware that the catapult rotated either this set isnt on my buy list though as it is all more of the same for me thanks for the cool moc d i always plan to add a moc to my reviews but i always run out of time 
sinner on oct 13 2007 0248 am said great review sweet i wasnt aware that the catapult rotated either this set isnt on my buy list though as it is all more of the same for me thanks for the cool moc d i always plan to add a moc to my reviews but i always run out of time  true there are too many catapults already and in my opinion some with a better design as well but my lack of interest in this particular set doesnt reflect at all on my opinion of this review which i enjoyed very much please continue making great reviews like this one grevious y
great review i just built the original and this one has clear advantages over the original though i wish lego would stop putting torsos with defined breasts and curves on children i really like pretty much every change i wont be getting it and id be lying if i said im not a little disappointed for the first four years my motherinlaw got me the new winter village set for christmas after the last two which didnt really fit thematically in my display i had hoped for a new oneparticularly since my daughter is getting to be around the age where she can play with them i mention her specifically because ive seen lots of people dismiss those who are a bit disappointed as rabid adults who dont care about kids getting cool sets and i dont think thats fair i may have to see how much some of the parts go for on bricklink the rerelease is better than the original but not good enough that id want to spend 80 to get a set thats nearly identical to one i have edited by tea weevil 29 november 2015  0431 pm
hobbythom on 29 november 2015  0407 pm said great review you almost make me want to buy one i dont know what it is with these sets on the one hand they are so nicely designed and cute on the other side i never seriously consider buying one i cant explain what it is that holds me back a lack of money maybe thats the thing that usually holds me back anyway i have the older version so i am not interested in this set
regarding the reason for the different designs on the inner bags i think that the white stripe is the new version with the nonstripe version being old i suspect the reason some sets have both versions is simply that theyre still using up some of their supply of older bags good review i didnt realise there were quite as many changes as you highlighted tree roof etc
cheers for putting up the review some nice improvements but not enough for me to pick it up the original set is good enough for me pity the poll has no option yes but only in addition to new sets not in stead of new sets edited by withacee 01 december 2015  0938 am
thanks for a nice review i am building it as we speak and i like it so far since i didnt have the old one i cant complain
thanks for the review they definitely improved upon the original but since i already own the original i cant justify this set also unfortunately it seems to be the trend but im sure there are a lot of first timers out there too that will snatch this up since it is a really lovely building and the updates make it better for sure
review  42044  display team jet introduction the smallest of the 2016 sets is the display team jet it doesnt seem to have lots of functionality but maybe the landing gear is retractable this set kind of reminds me to the 9394  jet plane although its obviously a lot smaller as you can read in my review of the 42052  heavy lift helicopter basically anything flying is 1 for me so lets find out if this set also fits the bill note all images can be clicked for hires versions set information number 42044 title display team jet theme technic released 2016 part count 113 box weight 193 gr box dimensions 154 cm x 138 cm x 59 cm set price msrp € 999 price per part € 0088 links brickset bricklink the box being a small set it obviously comes in a small box the display team jet is an aerobatics jet used in air shows on the box its flying rather high but at least its at a safe distance from the crowd front side shows the main model together with a small section indicating you can use digital building instructions to build this model back side the back side shows the bmodel a stunt plane and again a reference to the apps for digital building instructions more on the stunt plane later content of the box the box contains 2 instructions booklets a and bmodel 1 sticker sheet 3 technic liftarms 2 bags instruction booklets both the instructions for the a and bmodel are included in the box sticker sheet a lot of stickers for such a small set apparently no panel is left untouched liftarms three liftarms unsealed nothing out of the ordinary for a small set bags two bags containing the rest of the parts highlighted parts this section describes the new andor otherwise interesting parts yellow 5l axles the 5l axle in yellow has never been released before so its one of the new parts for this year black 7l flex axles for the layman this seems a common part but the 7l soft axle actually has never been released in black before combined with the rerelease of the 19l soft axle in black this will open up lots of possibilities for those of you thinking youve read this text before you are right the new drag racer contains these new 7l flex axles too white panels this small set comes with a whopping 10 panels great for the ones who like panels not so great if you think tlg is using too much panels lately rudder this part the small bionicle wing is the same as the one used in last years 42033  record breaker part list this set contains 113 parts all listed below the build this is the collection of parts used to build the jet it sure looks like we are getting a landing gear the build is fun but pretty straightforward there arent any special or cool techniques used in this set it almost took me more time to apply all the stickers than to build the actual model finished model the finished jet does look cool though the white and yellow color scheme combined with the stickers work really well i have seen people refer to the plane as being orange but its definitely yellow technic or lego in general tends to have some color variation when it comes to yellow i do concur this is the warmer variant of yellow but its not orange the back of the plane looks nice too although i am not a big fan of the rudder part it looks too detailed compared to the other panels its not a big deal though and maybe its just me parts left only three common parts left features and functions this set has a single feature and that is a retractable landing gear its operated by the black 12t double bevel gear near the cockpit in the following picture you can see the landing gear retracted this image shows the landing gear when the plane is ready for landing hopefully the pilot will roll the plane before landing but you probably know what i mean video heres s short video demonstrating the display team jet bmodel this set also includes the building instructions for the bmodel a stunt plane the building experience for the stunt plane is more or less the same as for the jet well what do you expect when both models are planes with a limited number of parts for an alternative model the stunt plane looks fine theres not a lot of functionality in this plane but its worth mentioning that the tail wheel allows the plane to roll on a flat surface the plane also has working propellors both functions are demonstrated in the video unfortunately the landing gear of the stunt plane is not retractable parts left a couple of extra leftover parts but its nice to see that most of the parts have been used in the bmodel as well actually theres probably an extra yellow technic smooth 12 bush left i just found it on my desk but it could belong to one of the other sets video heres a video demonstrating the stunt plane summary two nice planes for 13 bucks thats basically what you get both models look good and the set has some interesting new parts especially the 7l flex axle will be very popular it comes with a decent collection of white panel although they are very common nowadays both models have limited functionality but each of them has at least one function to give the model some playability for kids other than the swooshability that is okay it might lack some proper functions but i still think kids will love this set i can see kids running around with one of the planes in their hands all in all i think this set delivers what youd expect score lets see how this set flies remember that the grades are based on it being a small set obviously a set like this cannot be compared with a mercedes flagship 8 design for a small set the model looks very authentic 7 building experience no surprises 7 features just the retractable landing gear 8 playability it has swooshability so i see kids running around with this model 7 parts lots of panels if you are into that 8 value for money cant go wrong with these small sets 75 fun for kids more image can be found on my flickr page thank you for reading i hope you enjoyed it
very nice little set and a lot of those new white small panels its a need
for 10 euros very usefull parts i like it as well as other 2016 sets i like the gear retracting mechanism a lot very good set for good price thanx for good review  max
megaroi on 01 december 2015  1056 am said hi there nice model great review i almost reverse engineered this model but used wrong parts for landing wheels didnt know how to fix the nose proper and so on so i was very interested in this model and i like playing with it i love the reviews but i think i have to mention that the yellow axle must be a 5l the picture shows a 5l and a 5l would fit the size of the model the cart has also a 5l in yellow what sitze is the yellow axle in this seit really 4l as written in the text greetings robert the picture of the manual says 4x 5l yellow axle and that seems to line up with what im seeing in the pics as well so i assume the 4l is a typo
very nice review for a nice little set i especially like the smoothness of operation for the retractable landing gear i dont like the lack of symmetry for the propeller of the b model though but understand the alternative would be to add one extra small panel to the set or skip two of them in the b model
i am definitely getting set for the panels
fixed the video and fixed the stars in the voting thanks for paying attention guys
boulderer on 27 december 2015  0544 pm said my favourite of the 2016 sets ive built so far id go so far as to say this is the best budget set in years i would have loved this when i was a kid  great swoosh ability  good to hear that im gonna check the toy shops in my lunch break tomorrow see if they got their shipment in yet if they have ill definitely buy one of these little sets
got this at the weekend mainly for the parts but built it first agreed with other comments  awesome swooshability
another great review jim and again i love the model those pearl gold wheels this one definitely goes on the buy on sight list
jim great reviews but can i suggest you one thing take some pics before you apply the stickersand some with the stickers on it helps to have a comparison
theitalianbrick on 01 december 2015  0932 am said jim great reviews but can i suggest you one thing take some pics before you apply the stickersand some with the stickers on it helps to have a comparison you are right i came to the same conclusion when writing the review i tell you it doesnt look that good without stickers but i dont have a picture to prove it to be honest i compared it to the model posted in the 2016 topic a few days ago i applied the stickers before building the model so i wasnt able to make a proper comparison i will keep it in mind for future reviews thanks for the suggestion
jim on 01 december 2015  0410 pm said thats the best compliment a reviewer can get i thought that was the best compliment a salesman can get  seriously though even though i am not quite sold on the helicopter your reviews are very well done you put a positive light on it whilst still being completely honest
thanks again for the review i am not sold on this one yet but i confess it took about 2 years for me to finally appreciate 9396 maybe i need to see this in person
great review with high quality pictures well done im glad you took the time to do it properly cool that you have built both models i agree with the mudguards they sure look good on this model
thanks for the thorough comments i agree that the set has some limitations both in construction and realism but i think theyre acceptable given the pricepoint and size the antenna is definitely ludicrous  i really do suspect they had a surplus of the swords to use up and yes the way the steering knob is mounted is loose i also noticed that the ujoints to the claw are not in the right spot like you mentioned but didnt include it since it still works fine that axle coming forward to the claw has a very long unsupported section that does bend a bit when you raise and lower the claw it works but is a bit of a cheat that im kinda surprised they let through i just checked and the bucket from 8043 is a couple studs too wide for this set im betting that was seriously considered but itd have meant scaling the whole thing up and that would have put it into a higher price point or they could have pulled the mold for the 8x14 bucket back out and remade it for this set i really like the model you built and thats interesting about the cabs being basically flush with the top but sticking out the side in image searching as part of my research i found both that style and ones like this with the cab sticking up more like the photo of the caterpillar one in my review i wonder if thats a useuropean difference or different types of mining or what because both styles definitely exist in the real world
great review and great pictures  many thanks for talking the time to review this set  i am a fan of lego technic construction stuff but this set is not so appealing to me but then again i am sure some people will love it
some mods all wheel drive v6 instead straight 2 cylinder bucket instead gripper back lights and oldschool worngear mechanics instead of linear actuators edited by efferman 26 december 2015  0552 pm
nice mod there effe might inspire me when i get one and start modding it
cool mod by effe but the original model out of the box is one of the poorest models tlg ever released looks from front to rear as a cheaped out set with really lazy design effort a shame for the responsible lego designer parts assortment seems to be ok but this should not be the most important criteria sry jim i really appreciate your always very well done reviews and offen i agree with the overall judgementsverdicts and of course tastes are different but especially that review sounds like gushing praise in my ears just my 2 ct edit ooops just saw the review isnt done by jimblush so sry jim now my final comment belongs to mostlytechnic edited by kumbbl 27 december 2015  0733 am
here is a video review via jang to add to the review i like both a and b so will buy both
majklspajkl on 05 december 2015  1145 pm said my opinion on the frictionless axlepins is that the flex axle might be easier to stick in them than in regularblue axlepins didnt actually try it though  frictionless pins have accurate round hole while blue friction pins have something squarish flex axle will fit in both but using tan pins doesnt require strength conncetion with tan pins is weaker too
review  42038  arctic truck introduction arctic vehicles arent new to lego back in 2000 the town theme already had several small orange arctic vehicles in 2014 tlg again released a number of arctic sets in the city theme formerly known as town some of these sets are actually pretty big containing over 700 parts looking back in history it seems that arctic sets may have found their origin in the technic theme although these sets were white instead of orange they are unmistakenly arctic the 1986 technic arctic sets contained the infamous technic figures unfortunately the 2015 arctic truck doesnt contain any technic figures but nonetheless its great to see a new arctic vehicle in the technic line not counting several snow scooters lets see if the new arctic truck lives up to the expectations note all images can be clicked for hires versions set information number 42038 title arctic truck theme technic released 2015 part count 1219 box weight 2110 gr box dimensions 478 cm x 280 cm x 72 cm set price msrp € 7999  us 8499  £ 5999 price per part € 0088  us 0093  £ 0066 links brickset bricklink the box the box measures 478 cm x 280 cm x 72 cm and weighs around 1385 grams the box actually feels pretty heavy which means its filled properly this seems to be a trend in the technic theme slightly smaller boxes can save shelf space for retailers the front the front of the box shows the main model and in the lower right corner theres a image with the dimension of the model its 40cm long and 18cm wide the back the upper part of the back of the box shows the functions of the main model the lower left section shows the bmodel which looks very promising more on that later the lower right section shows the motorization options for the main model the crane partially and the bed can be motorized besides motorization some leds can be added as headlights the side on of the sides shows one of the newer smaller style panels this is the first time it appears in orange when you take a look at the sticker you can see that its not symmetrical not sure why tlg cut of one of the sides of the stickers since the position of the panel is very suitable for a continuous sticker content of the box the box is pretty densely packed which is better than semifilled boxes it feels like you actually bought something which matches the box size the box contains 2 booklets 1 sticker sheet 8 bags booklets  sticker sheet unfortunately the instructions and sticker sheet havent been packed with cardboard protection which results in a curved sticker sheet and slightly bent instructions in my case this wasnt so bad at least no real damage highlighted parts this set proves to be a great parts pack especially when you might have missed some of the 2014 sets black link treads usually the link treads come in dark blue grey but this sets includes 96 black treads which is great if youd like to replace the dbg ones in your mocs or other official sets undercarriage and suspension several parts are included to build the undercarriage driving the treads four large tread sprockets and eight small tread sprockets which are used as return sprockets also included are four steering portal hubs and four steering portal axles for driving and steering the vehicle several frames including two cshaped pivot frames and two steering ball joints to create an undercarriage much like the 4x4 crawler the set even includes two hshaped frames aka dog bone frames new changeover catch parts this year 2015 three new parts have been introduced to improve the changeover catch more on these parts later new pin connector another new part for this year 2015 is the 1l round pin connector which looks like a pin connector but acts more like a bush new pins furthermore this sets includes quite a large number of three relatively new parts 17 x pin with pin hole 14 x 3l pin with 1l axle and 11 x 3l pin with 2l axle which have been introduced this year 2015 when the new 3l pin with 1l axle was introduced in 2014 it was only a matter of time before the new 3l pin with 2l axle would appear both new pins are a great addition to the parts portfolio panels last but not least this sets contains a fair number of orange panels including the 3x11 panel in orange which is the first time weve seen this part part list below is the entire part list for the 913 parts as usual this part list can be found at the end of the second booklet the build the build immediately starts with some of the new parts used to build the compact gearbox in the center of the model notice the two 20 tooth bevel gears one would have been enough to drive the 12 tooth bevel gear so the second seems to be useless tlg probably used it in the amodel because they needed it in the bmodel which you can see later the front and rear suspension are almost identical the front side also has the 13l gear rack used for steering the picture below shows the steering rack on the front suspension in more detail at this point you have more or less finished the chassis the gearbox is in place and the majority of the functions has internally been connected to the right gears the small turntable shows where the crane will be attached later on at the end of the first booklet some of the bodywork has been attached to the chassis the orangeblack color scheme never fails to please me throw in some cool stickers for the extra effect and we have a winner if you decide to motorize the model using pf the top of the cabin can be lifted to accomodate the battery box the chassis uses lots of orange and some black panels to give the model its distinctive look the protective black bumberrailing is a nice addition which adds something to the exterior the dumping bed at the rear can tilt to empty its load its operated by a mini la the treads which look very cool in black are driven by a large tread sprocket and returned by two small tread sprockets the front and rear sections are identical building the undercarriages feels a bit repetitive which is a problem for most tracked vehicles finished model adding the crane to the model finishes the build your model should look something like this when you take a close look at the finished model you realize this is something else its trully a unique vehicle the color scheme is brilliant and the fact that its an arctic truck is really neat its a welcome change for the technic line to see a vehicle like this this picture emphasizes thats its a very cool vehicle imagine this beast plowing through the snow as far as i know its not based on a real life vehicle ifs probably a combination of several vehicles and some imagination i can be totally wrong though the rear of the vehicle shows the crane and drum placed on the tipper bed from this angle you can see some of the internals of the model the gearbox behind the cabin for example the crane can be partially motorized rotation and base while the boom is operated manually what i like a lot is the protective railing around the vehicle left over parts some leftover parts nothing noteworthy features and functions this set has several functionsfeatures steering driving suspension crane tipping bed steering as you can see in the image below the steering mechanism has quite a bit of negative caster please correct me if im wrong which causes the treads to rotate a bit upwarddownward instead of only to the left and right driving you mention driving as a feature yes i do and let me explain why normally i would ommit this as a feature and take driving for granted however driving this vehicle on a flat surface causes it to simply slide over the surface for other arctic vehicles this would be a plus but with a tracked vehicle it limits playability this is one of the main drawbacks of these tread they simple dont work properly on smooth surfaces suspension the suspension is working properly you do need to apply some pressure but all things considered its not too bad crane the crane has four degrees of freedom base rotation lower boom upper boom hook it does what its supposed to do base rotation and lower boom can be motorized and switched using the gearbox while the upper boom and hook are operated manually tipping bed the tipping is operated via a mini la conclusion while the set does offer various functions and features driving and steering is a serious issue therefor this set is more likely to be showcased than to be played with bmodel instructions for the bmodel are of high quality looking at the image below you will see what i mean heres the finished bmodel a tracked jeep with a communcations device this alternate model looks so good it could easily have made it as a main model one thing that does pop in mind how would this look with tires more on that later when you are in the artcic region its imperative to have proper communication channels since theres no internet backbone you will need a big antenna of some sort this bmodel actually features a small trailer wagon with a transmitterreceiver heres more detailed image of the bmodel without trailer wagon i would buy this model in a heartbeat if it were a main model simply gorgeous the side view doesnt give away that this in alternate model the stickers also work really well in this model and again nothing to complain here the model even has a small crane at the rear operated by the mini la here you can see the arctic fleet comprised of both the amodel and bmodel i bet these two can get some work done a bit of a messy picture but this should give you an impression of the size of both models leftover parts not too many parts left which is obviously a good thing alternate model with tumbler tires just like me you probably have been wondering how this model would look like with tumbler tires well here it is as i imagined it does look great admittedly these are not the type of tires we ought to use but to be honest i dont really care again the negative caster results in quirky steering the tires are a bit too big so they hit the chassis when you compress the suspension while this has absolutely nothing to do with an arctic vehicle i really love this picture summary were almost at the end of my review so what do i think of this set lets start with getting the elephant out of the room this set lacks proper driving and steering does that make it a bad set definitely not its a great set but it lacks some playability when it comes to moving the vehicle the crane and tipper bed do work properly so theres still some playability left does this set look cool definitely i think its one of the coolest no pun intended and most original models of recent years the orange and black color scheme works great and the stickers are well designed the bmodel is of very high quality and some might even prefer it over the amodel and if you are not interested in either of these models this set provides you with a variety of great parts all in all i think this is a great set maybe not to play with but it scores high on all other criteria pros original model great color scheme lots of interesting parts great bmodel cons steering and driving dont work too well repetitive build of undercarriages minor con score below are my scores based on different categories 8 design original and good looking model 7 building experience fun to build albeit a bit repetitive 8 features packs quite a few features 7 playability some features work some dont 9 parts comes with interesting parts 9 value for money two great model in a single set 8 cool as a bonus heres picture of the main model with tumbler tires why because we can
i was supposed to publish it together with the 42039  24 hours racer but it somehow got backlogged after completing the reviews for the 2016 sets i felt i needed to finish it was already 90 done that cmodel looks cool
i could be wrong but i am 100 sure that ive seen this review before
great review and pictures as always its an odd combo but i agree that the b model looks good with tumbler tires therize on 14 december 2015  0932 pm said i could be wrong but i am 100 sure that ive seen this review before i believe jim posted the same one in the reviewers academy
another great review i like this set very much both models look good to me and its a great part pack for me the long list in the high light parts session tells everything as for the real world counter part of the a model how about this try googling snocat and there a lots of such things
richard dower on 15 december 2015  0207 pm said sopaint them pink some ski goggles also have yelloworangeish glasses so i reckon orange and white form a contrasting combination
jim on 14 december 2015  0915 am said while this has absolutely nothing to do with an arctic vehicle i really love this picture this really puts me in mind of one of those arctic 4x4s from the top gear arctic special
thank you jim nice review it´s a great set a lot unique parts and not just pins axles and beams i bough it to bring me back to lego from my da 10 years ps soon i will post an alternative model
you wrote a very accurate review of this set jim its a pretty good model with some obvious problems but its an even better parts pack your pictures with the tumbler tires are great what is the material of the gray background nerdsforprez on 15 december 2015  0126 pm said lets not forget the cmodel made by buster haus pretty sweet c model thank you for the mention
jim on 14 december 2015  1117 am said seems like it it has been sitting in the reviewers academy for a while dont worry we love your hq photo skills so you can post everything you want  well love that anyways edited by rm8 14 december 2015  1126 am
mister phes on oct 20 2007 1238 am said youve done a good job of this review mr imperialscouts but two things 1 background far too bright and the set is far too dark easily rectified with brightness  contrast adjustment 2 no poll to rate the set out of 5 nonetheless this should be frontpaged on classicpiratescom alas i cannot make polls in the pirate forum so a generous moderatoradmin would be so kind to add one nonetheless the picture was fixed and appears to be alright but im glad that the review is enjoyed
im not generous but ill do it anyway xd now i need to write an artistic statement and then i can write my own review for broadsides brig
huzzah and title change as wellthe best conquistador out there 
id give a 2 but you put 3 two times is a nice set but is not really cool is a worse version of lagoon lock up
a nice little set silly parrots on
great review cool comic wub i give the set a four and i will go and buy it now as i am missing many of those parts oh its not for sale off to bricklink then d
hello well as this is my first review i hope you like it the 7744 police station is simply fanstastic the many minifigs and the vehicles makes it really nice the great playabillaty and and great space makes it great for children i think but latest but not least the pics general overview the front of the box the back of the box inside the box top of the box instructions the minifigs the cars patrol car dog car the dog the motor well now the police station  the mailbox the crime report room the handcuffs holder handcuff suspect who wears handcuffs jails satelite little things water machiene and if you dont like water we have coffee to well and as last the interrogation room well this was the review i hope you liked it bye
klausdieter on nov 23 2007 1134 pm said thank you very much for the review theforce the new police station looks great i really like its lovely interior  amazing by the way i have a question are there any beds tables orand seats for the prisoners in their cells i just saw a toilet bowl in the prison cell from one of the box pics well from the last police station there should be a bed inside the cell there are graffiti on the walls inside the cell too haha cute 
hooray assuming from the picture on the box we will also be getting the old police car and bike in blue aswell i really like this set it seems the best police station weve had in a long time and what a great amount of figures thanks for this great insight theforce 
its mine wub just got my luke today from tru in in merrilville in  so heres some pictures and thoughts still in the packing with the box pieces out in the fresh air put together ready for some serious vader vacking  if you this close youre so dead its yet another lovely maquette wub the only downside is that the lego sw sign doesnt even resemble ok ive exagurating a bit  the ones from the other maquettes check out this one from the blackhole trooper compared with the luke one the luke one is has a massproduced look over it with just a printing   the other has depth  a painting on it now im waiting for the long overdue boba one heres the other maquettes reviewed darth vader  stormie blackhole stormie maquettes on copmike
verry cool love it what was the price
copmike on nov 22 2007 0409 pm said its 6999  tax  boba on copmike golly gee batman thats too expensive for that in my view
ah yes i saw a whole shelf of them in my trutouched it too too small and way overpriced waste of miney the luke is 6 high what is that great review edited by vbbn 22 november 2007  1119 pm

exobuilder59 on nov 25 2007 0820 pm said finally we have seen the light ive been waiting for a while deciding if i was gonna get thiswell ive decided after that wonderful review i am good job reviewin wub thanks iamded on nov 25 2007 0850 pm said cool review thanks d i personally think the minirobot is awesome and dare i say cute this was described on amazon to be a mobile lab im not seeing that i do however see a crystal hauling vehicle sweet pretty cool not as bad as previous sets peace i suppose its cute if you like that sort of thing p as for the lab its hitech to examine a piece of dirt so its good y dark sword ragnarok on nov 25 2007 0905 pm said very cool im getting this one as soon as its in america well maybe depends on how much money i have it is  quote i stopped by the tru in portland or
thanks for the review its a neat little set i hope it comes to australia sooner rather than later that minifig head was also used in 7699 mt101 so that may be why it seems familiar
thanks for the review sweet aside from the fact that i like the model this set has a few new and useful pieces so i will have to get it wub
great review but am i the only one who thinks this is a pretty homely looking vehicle the small exploration robot is cool but the large windscreen on the main vehicle reminds me about jack stone i also think the bases of the vehicle parts are very basic and look almost unfinished with the holes and such i think i will pass this one even though the alien has a jet pack and there is the nice mini vehicle
tks for the great review mm  its always appreciated to have reviews of new set having said that i really dont see the point of that set and its such money and time wasted imo i dont like that theme apart the dropship and 6wheeler and that tiny vehicle doesnt do the trick for me i see it as a really cheap excuse to try and please classic space fan with that horrendous mm graphics and what amazes me is that you guys loke that d money saved on  yoda
thanks for another 08 review y this set is an attempt of a classic but has failed part pack on d piranha jelly jetpack  
thanks for posting the picture of this new mm set when i first saw the mars mission sets i was a little apprehensive about the design and the aliens they could have at least make movable arms  but anyways when i bought the small fighter i was totally hook my fave set from the line is the mech
during the annual thanksgiving road trip to the relatives i stopped by the tru in portland or lo and behold the new mars mission sets predictably i bought them i present to you the mx41 switch fighter man what a long name the box standard mm on the front it shows the fighter in flight mode and a yellow note telling you that it transforms the back shows three pictures showing it happen the parts once i open the box the first thing that comes out is a bent and rolled up instruction booklet and i was forced to put it under a stack of beer books for an hour then theres the dss yes two of the stickers do feature a cobra i wonder why because this sets decal should be a beatle xd decent parts nothing too special then i noticed this little part its used for the flickmissiles but i have no idea what else it would be used for  the build the alien ship when i looked at the box art for this set i was releived to see that the aliens dont have another curvedforward wing ship instead they have this little beauty which appears to be the alien mini cooper small and hot wub anyway partially completed even if you dont like the set it has some nice green flame peices which work nicely for space laser swords fully completed the only annoying bit about it is that the crystalholding thing in front wobbles all over the place the alien fits into it by way of impalement it must hurt getting in and out switch fighter cockpit the set makes good use of the alpha team cockpit for controls it has a meagre handlebar that the astronaught cant even reach the rear shell of the fighter starts out around the alien containment chamber its a bit odd that the containment chamber has an alien sticker because the instruction booklet lists it as holding crystals the crystal canister is held back by a technic pin this is without a doubt the ugliest color arrangment ever warning mass stickers x the cockpit fits into grooves in the shell then it clicks into place in a 1x1 brick with a horizontal clip the wing mechanism the wing for some reason the body of the mechanism has a blue brick wacko the wing and mechanism connect to prevent the fighter doing a nosedive while in tank mode the wing mechanism completed the underside the body and wing connect by way of a miscolored red brick i have no idea why its red black would bave been much much better completed tank mode all in all this looks pretty neat the wheel base is pretty short but its not bad transform the set transforms neatly if ungainly without antigrav support it would fall forward on its nose each time it transformed jet mode its all right but it could be a bit better the shell keeps slipping back forward to the tank mode because theres nothing to stop it sliding spare parts overall i thought this set was great it could do with some fixing such as the mismatched colors but it should be a definate buy for mm fans brickshelf gallery when available
cool review im actually liking that new missile part as it seems to combine a bar with a pin but its a real eyesore if you ask me
hmm its actually a nice bit better than i expected and great review thanks but think ill pass on this one i quite like the alien fighter though heh and loved the way you described how he sat in the cockpit
very cool review mr mandalorian this isnt a bad set the alien craft is very sleek if only theyd gone with the old alien body in transgreen and the transforming is alright the tank mode looks sweet sweet peace
after seeing this set review it change my mind about this set by the way thanks for the great review
thanks for that very good review mr mandalorian y i think that this is a plain beautiful set oh how i wish that tlc wouldve taken that direction from the beginning  the design is much more practicable with fewer nonsystem parts and technic beams with studs this makes everything much more easier to mod and a lot more useful at least imo y so its for sure not very hard to make the wonderful enclosed cockpit one brick higher and even that little alien ship looks decent and nice xo and the fighter looks sleek and elegant too in both modes thats just very cool compliments tlc now all we needre aliens with moving arms and here we go classic space on forever xd
wow this is actually quite a neat set it is definitively my favorite in the line after the big drilling unit begingeek im not sure it would nose dive when transforming from tank mode i guess it would pick up speed and transform quickly since it doesnt seem to have any downwards pointing thrusters endgeek
i really like the transforming aspect of this the one thing i wish mm sets would include would be baseplates i liked that about the classic space stuff because it really helped create the environment some red rock orange mars baseplates would be great
hmmm great review for a great set y
john cleese on nov 25 2007 1056 pm said cool review im actually liking that new missile part as it seems to combine a bar with a pin but its a real eyesore if you ask me a needed solution to those blasted flick missles from falling out while swooshing sweet wonder if the range might have an issue seeing its held in there but who knows maybe they now pop out with a greater velocity than a mere finger flick i had resorted to technic 12 bushings smooth to lock in the missiles technic axle with stud
mr mandalorian on nov 26 2007 0929 pm said 1 thanks guys 2 i dont think that tank is very fast maybe if it drove off of a crater 1 there will always be kudos for a good review at eb  2 yeah it does look quite slow and tanklike it is a shame lego didnt make a more obvious way shoving what goes on brainbox on nov 26 2007 1015 pm said the one thing youd have to make sure of though is that it was fairly light and the wheel base had a fairly large surface area actually thats two things so as to make sure it didnt dig into the soil if that happened transformation would be harder as the wheels would dig into the ground and drag through the soil then itd nose dive you mean the ungainly way in which the wheels have to turn in order to change from tank mode i think you are right as well on the other hand if it has antigrav then it doesnt really make sense to have wheels as well i mean if the power goes then the wheels cant turn anyways
konas2002 on nov 26 2007 0521 pm said i really like the transforming aspect of this the one thing i wish mm sets would include would be baseplates i liked that about the classic space stuff because it really helped create the environment some red rock orange mars baseplates would be great thats a really fine idea and would for sure be very cool y
so hinckley can you give us a hint on what our walrus friend will do with the dark panther i cant wait to see 8
sweeeet wub its nice to finally see a set thats not bipedal or  tripedal quote exoforce is an anomaly in my lego interests i dont know why i like it so much or why i keep buying it but i do that would be a problem wouldnt it p quote the cockpit itself is constructed very well but the canopy seems like an afterthought closing on to the robots head and leaving his back and sides completely exposed i dunno at least it has a canopy unlike past sets
thanks for this fantastic review hinckley i cant wait to see the comic  i really love this mech as i am a fan of nonbipedal mechs though i am terrible at making them the purple is great and i cant wait to see what mocers will use those awesome new spike peices for 3 robots in one mech is a really good deal too and that spider droid just adds so much more to the set and thanks for taking the time to do this sweet not to sound like a smartypants though but the grill peice in purple is not the first time this has happened two were included in the 06 joker helicopter  thanks again to the brickmobile 
awesome reveiw thanks for the pics did the instructions come with a comic
thanks for that very neat review hinckley y this set looks indeed very interesting with a very cool antlike look and a simple but essential overall design the cockpit seems better protected than many other ef ones that spines lovely and the way these iron dronesre attached is simple but effective  and hey did i miss something orre there really no crappy shooting devices p thanks to the minirobots and their inventor i guess 
another fantastic review hinckley i really like this set i wasnt to keen on it when i first saw the pictures bit having seen the review i am starting to like it it seems quite sturdy and it makes a change from the usual 2 legged mechs as well as that purple is welcome anywhere i have such a shortage of that colour i like the rusty orange colour of the robots and their backjet packs are quite cool and the mini robot looks sweet
thanks everyone im glad you are enjoying the review im working on the 8118 right now and will have comics up for both starting tonight hayatoson on nov 27 2007 0402 am said awesome reveiw thanks for the pics did the instructions come with a comic the instructions do not have a comic but i always write one for my reviews featuring my sigfig or other fabuland creatures interacting with the new set
kmoi on nov 27 2007 1112 pm said dont forget bianca and gavin o lordship of pies d truly another excellent review the pictures are absolutely splendid as usual im really glad those airvent pieces were done so well while i remain skeptical about the new giant spikes youve sold me on this set i cant wait to see the fabuland comic and your final verdict hink me too 
i too got an error message when clicking on the images but the text links work correctly 8 i wonder which way gavin will meet his death this time d luxorv
sweet caant wait for all of these sets to show up in the us
dark sword ragnarok on nov 27 2007 0808 pm said sweet caant wait for all of these sets to show up in the us uh he got that in the us
darnit hinckley  you always make us wait for the comic which is almost everyones favorite part   xd i just noticed ryos uniform had a camo pattern with all the orange he has its kinda pointless edited by lt veers 28 november 2007  0448 am
this designers were on a roll with this one until it came to the flying unit it looks like a shambles epecially the guns looking rather simplistic although they used something similar to the light and sound globe peice which is kind of neat i dont think ill be buying this but your review almost talked me into it
sinner on nov 28 2007 1253 am said how well do the tracks work the last tank was too light and it didnt roll well at all  its similar in weight but i didnt have to press down so hard to get the treads to move barely at all really i think the mobile defense tank although a better overall design suffered from the odd angle of the treads and that was mostly why the treads didnt turn well plus what was with those weird exhaust pipes anyway they are both cool tanks although i like the mobile defense tank better 
fantastic great review thanks a bunch for all the pics theyve shown me how in my opinion bad this set is p i just expected it to be more bricky rather than technicy oh well i wasnt planning on buying it anyway xd i noticed you spelt minifigs minifgis in the first paragraph in case you wanted to know xd so again thanks and im looking forward to seeing the rest of them and the comics peace
thanks for this great review hinckley  i know youre loving this attention xd p i actually like this set and like it a lot more now that ive seen this review ill most likely get mostly for the figs and parts i reckon it would look a lot better alongside the rest of the 2008 ef mechs anyway thanks for the review to the brickmobile 
cant wait for the extended review 
i think this is probably my least favourite set of next years selection but i still might get it partly because of this review thanks btw i quite like the minirobot and while there are a few problems the front cockpit the exposed axles i relish the idea of moding them out and correcting them and the change back to the original figs is welcome i didnt really get any of this years sets only last years makes it easier from a mocing potential anyway
thanks for that neat review of a very nice set the color schemes great and that minirobot looks very comical and funny indeed sweet sweet
i would agree the spider looks really cool too bad we cant see how the combo mech looks like instructions are not online yet  there should be another combo mech but youll need the storm lasher set p
cool another y y y y y y out of y y y y y and could you post a pic of all the minirobots and planes
thanks for the review although i still have no intentions of buying this its neat to know whats inside the build etc the etc being the comic  xd  its wierd because i dont know what it is i dont like about this set
exobuilder59 on dec 6 2007 0130 am said are you talking about the dwarves mine sweet yes when in 2008 do these sets come to germany 
exobuilder59 on dec 6 2007 1111 pm said um i do not know i live in the usa sweet sorry my bad 
fantastic review ill post my views on the set later when i have more time but ive already fixed the poll
thanks for that nice review its a 5 for me just a great little blue coats set perfect for army and fortress building sweet
thank you for the comments sweet i wonder who voted 1 surely such a nice set doesnt deserve such a low score wacko
mister phes on dec 8 2007 0747 pm said its not a bad thing to vote sabre island 1 if someone feels that its genuinely worth 1but twould be interesting to know why i do see your point mr phes but 1 i would like to know why heshe thinks sabre island is worth so little
i gave this one a 5 its one of the little pirate sets i had during my youth and i loved it for several reasons first of all it contains 2 of my favorite minifigs it can be used as a small independent base or in combination with one of the bigger sets eldorado or trading posts as a lookup or outer defense besides all that this set just looks beautiful i love the colors blue baseplate and the whiteyellow tower one of the best littlemedium sized sets ever made by lego
remind us what aberbrick is mr radar or better still give us a link and give your moc plug xd
bonaparte on dec 8 2007 0940 pm said i gave this one a 5 snip it can be used as a small independent base or in combination with one of the bigger sets eldorado or trading posts as a lookup or outer defensesnip i hope that when i got eldorado fortress for christmas the one i got for 25 i can somehow combine the two to make a single larger base i will post pics of the results one day if all goes to plan
col whipstick on jan 3 2008 1237 am said did i hear right a catapult in the 16th17th18th and 19th centuries wacko perhaps its an appeal for lord of pies to have his own personal catapult to pelt the pirates with whipped cream pastries should they try to sail past but this begs the question why waste perfectly good pie on those scurvy mangy muttfaced villians what a wonderful idea p a pie catapult although it is a waste of a piewe have ourselves a dilemma
i liked the set but it could have done more plus the strange price of 1550 just seems odd must be the modern pricing systems wacko another rowboat with a pirate would have been good y y y out of y y y y y
lord of pies on jan 3 2008 0851 pm said what a wonderful idea p a pie catapult although it is a waste of a piewe have ourselves a dilemma theres plenty of stale moldy old maggot infested grog around eldorado fortress perhaps thats worth wasting on the scurvy seadogs afterall my men have taken to eating only coconuts brought by islander girls in their skimpy undies xd
its a fantastic set cant think of anything wrong with it to be honest even if the island is a bit small the plate itself is still useful and the rest of it is also very useful walls can go toward a bigger fort cannon can extend your ship soldiers extend your army boat extends err your boats and the island prin is just cool
great moc it seems you did the math when doing this one and hit the nail on the head which pierced a megablock causing it to self destruct  stauder
thanx for the compliments  stauder on dec 9 2007 0147 am said  which pierced a megablock causing it to self destruct  stauder yes any destruction of a megablock is a good thing thanx stauder sinner on dec 9 2007 0607 am said  do you still have the tow truck i definitely still have the truck wub i dont have the heart to destroy it  captain green hair on dec 9 2007 1154 am said  butstart dodging cannonballs now boom harr p just dont hit the gas station dont want to destroy my meager town too p p
indy565 on dec 16 2007 1031 am said nooo  patients my young indy loving friend sweet anyway thanks for the reveiw i wasnt going to get this set but i just might its a coin toss between the truck chase and this one which one do you guys think i should get
db24 on dec 16 2007 0209 am said thank you for the great review looks like a very nice set so many snakes 10 in all  5 green 5 red
this is great thanks for the reviewbut theyre using a new skellie i thought those were just for the reanimated deadnot just skeletons unless that skeleton is supposed to be reanimated either way it makes me sad  that marion is beautiful wub worth it for the set alone and that sw reference is great xd
awesome i want it soo bad  how much was it edited by indy565 16 december 2007  1255 am

thanks for that fine review big pete y a really adventurous set with a good playability and neat traps that mayaesque stickers also very decent i think that the box art of these indy sets is pretty cool too with all these action scene pics nicely done tlc overall a very lovely set indeed tomb raiding on 
thanks for the great review ill probably be picking this one up if only for the minifigs how can you not complete your alfred molina minifig collection and the idol piece tinypiesrus on dec 15 2007 1041 pm said oh i watched this scene a few weeks ago and the pilot is fishing while waiting for indy to escape this is correct and in pure serial film fashion the pilot is has just hooked a big one just as jones starts yelling for him to get ready to leave  badger
no hovitos no ah well if i get more pirate sets next year id use the islanders as hovitos in the video game they have the same torsos id really like to get this maybe in june ill have luck 
it looks like a nice set but im not interested in the minis its got a nice drawbridge though thanks sweet
i want this set but its 60 aud which is a ripp off i like the yellow car wub  y by the way good review y
picked up from the lego shop in bluewater yesterday front of box back of box price 250 gbp contents a very small instruction manual instructions front intsructions back 25 pieces 23 used in the model regular construction mini fig start of the assembly roll in the drum just attach the drum a little tap with the hammer hammer not included wheel it into position time to start mixing also time for a well earned tea break the cement is all ready now and the 2 left over bits extra cement is always useful and not really wasted overall a nice little set and i am pleased to see little sets appearing again at long last the only negative is with the drum of the mixer although the angle can be adjusted you cannot tip the contents out of the mixer all in all i would say 810 for a good little set comments   edit by hobbes replaced pictures with clickable thumbs and corrected set number
great review and nice touch putting the minifig in the mixer y and i think you are the first to review this set so all in all good work steel
thanks for the review does anyone know if these mini sets are sold at tru
omg i absolutely love how you reviewed this set i think you are the only person ive ever seen on eurobrick with such a thorough review i read eurobricks daily and this really raises the bar in terms of how a person does a review please do not resize your pics they are perfect crisp large thorough and clear it gives anyone who really wants info on the set just about everything they need to know about it i had no idea they used that lil thing to have the cement mixer spin cool idea   nice set but perfect perfect review thanks much xd
thanks for the review brickmaster i wanted this set at first but i realized i dont want it as much anymore seems like a waste of 90 
i dont recall mine having an alignment problem on the tubes could you perhaps take a closer picture of the area did yours also have two of the same sticker for the wings of the alien craft
thanks for this review lots of minifigs is a plus although half of them are junk jellies but dang the base just doesnt seem impressive it looks so cheap like a skeleton the tubes are just ridiculous but hey at least it comes with two cool spacecraft thats nice
i agree it does seem very scarce but ive taken apart the nerf launcher made a new module with the tube the launcher used and beefed up the base with some computers and other things for 90 dollars i would pass i agree on sale it is lovely though and none the less ive been entertained for ages with them flyin through the tubes d
set 7741 the box back cool pose on back the insides the dss theres acually a printed piece the new handcuff piece with sb in the back the finished product the inventory police page the mail page is this a new air plane the fireman page the back a future doctor hair piece price 55 play 55 overall 55 i wub it
thanks iamded you never knowus 
caseyref on dec 26 2007 0202 am said i quite like it but i feel that my lego city is getting overrun with helicopters and planes also i have got the helicopter from the 7237 police station set but it is not as good as this plus iam sooooo dissapointed that the x stickers x are blue instead of black and green as they will not fit with the sets i have already got d nice review thanks if you look at the police picture from the instruction booklet it looks to me that the 3 sets in the bottom left corner are the bike 7235 patrolcar 7236 and prisoner transport 7245 from 2005 but with new blue stickers
thank everybody sinner on dec 26 2007 0609 am said thanks for the review pspguy i think this is a very nice little chopper but the biggest reason why i will probably get this is for the handcuffs d are the side windows flush like the old ones or recessed like the new ones are supposed to me the look recessed to me   yes youre right  what if your asking how they are but together you snap the window piece into the holder edit scrypt on dec 26 2007 0336 am said if you look at the police picture from the instruction booklet it looks to me that the 3 sets in the bottom left corner are the bike 7235 patrolcar 7236 and prisoner transport 7245 from 2005 but with new blue stickers hey thats copyrighted mister p edited by pspguy 26 december 2007  0521 pm
the binoculers  you must have a small moniter
nice review y i will get 2 of these at the least especialy since theyre going to be 15 aud wub 
a nice simple helicopter i always had thoughts of this but after the review im gonna go get it well not at the moment xo 
so here it is the long expected  review of the town plan i bought it at the legostore riem arcaden last saturday i paid 14999 eur for 1981 pieces this set is separated in 4 parts 1 the servicegasstation 2 the cars the petrol pump and the fountain 3 the cinema 4 the town hall the service station has a lot of really nice details like tools for the car repair or the table with the cashpoint and the foodstation theres a croissant a banana and a apple in this set one of my favourit parts is the trolley with some tools you can see it at brickshelf at the second part are only a few pieces and i needed not much time to built the 2 cars the fountain and the petrol pump theres something at the truck i dont understand maybe i did something wrong but the truck has no backlights wacko i like the petrol pump thats why i post a pic of it the cinema is the highlight for me it has also really nice details like the popcorn table or the gumball or candy machine the colours sheme is really nice the front of the building with the big displays is a cool idea overall a really nice building the town hall has also a really nice colour sheme i love that dark green mixed with the white stairs a lot of plants around and in the town hall as you can see some figs who married there not more to say about this building see the pics and enjoy it overall this set is a must have it was really fun to built it this set reminds me of the back to the future movie with michael j fox the whole gallery is at brickshelf there you can find a few more pics i hope you enjoyed this review regards sandra
thank you for the great review sandra y  i wub the detail that tlc added to this set i would like to add that i think all the buildings look sweet  i really like how you compared the look to back to the future when i saw the first pics i thought the same thing the look of the set is definitly the 1950s i am  to see the price though i am sure this set will be 14999 us too great review model on
thank you for the review sandra this set looks finally nice better than my first view i really need it ive already planed to integrate it to my new layout it will be hard to wait for it
legocastlegirl on dec 28 2007 0212 pm said theres no necessity to take pics of all the film posters there are only 3 different film posters at the set always one poster twice and you can see every different poster at the brickshelf gallery if you need more details then you should maybe buy it  regards sandra ouch 
thank you for the review
really cool review i have got so much to do that i even did not know that set is already available the cinema is great aredhel
xwingyoda on dec 29 2007 0125 pm said ps  tedbeard  do tone it down youg man  if youre not happy with sandras work do provide one yourself instead of bitching on how you view a review and on how sandras post is veryt far from one according to you  wow i have not been called a youg man by which i assume you mean young for a while as a forty year old with three kids thats unusual sweet i tried very hard to remain positive in my critique and complimented her on those things she had done well i felt that given the somewhat juvenile omg bestreviewever tone that was creeping in amongst the replys that it needed to be tempered with some thoughtful suggestions as to how a good review could be made great your ad hominem approach is offensive and far more negative than i was and to suggest i should do my own review is ridiculous i live in canada and we do not even have the set available here yet thus i am interested in seeing reviews of this set if i already had the set i would not be so interested and next time you propose to critique a critique perhaps you should actually read what i wrote i said she wrote a good review for a specific audience i did not say it was awful or whatever you seem to have assumed i meant saying something is good but could be improved can hardly be characterized as bitching 
thanks for the review i really want this set because 1 it looks fantastic 2 has harder to find colors 3 is a 50th anniversary commemorative 4 some of the models are based on the 50s sets i love the old stuff the tanker truck is a perfect recreation of the old ho 187 scale esso tanker truck i have one and you can look at it for comparison if you would like lego ho vehicles id like to modify the truck from this new set to look even more like the old esso truck getting rid of the green and adding some decals
thanks will this really is a nice set your new camera and the backround looks great the pic quality is very good thanks y
ok i thought it might be to much to ask i will try vader s review and again thanks for the review y
thanks for the review agentrick57 it is a beautiful set and quite cheap for me 50 aud for 965 parts 8 not sure what i will do with the rabbit though it is huge d i was considering doing this review myself but sinnerton is a mess  
got one for 90 usd one of the best trains everfunny as train perfect for parts what else to say y
hey thanks for the review i think i will definately get this set dp8 edited by darthperson8 05 january 2008  0330 pm
darthperson8 on jan 5 2008 0429 pm said sounds dorky d  it doesnt sound it is  since i have network problems im editing my post dont want to redio the whole post if my network crashes  yoda
xwingyoda on jan 5 2008 0424 pm said i totally dislike assembling those technic treads especially 80 of those small things so you havent build the bat tank right it comes with 2x 79 thread pieces wacko  thanks for the review ill definitively get this set maybe monday   love those droids wub
apophisv on jan 5 2008 0506 pm said so you havent build the bat tank right it comes with 2x 79 thread pieces wacko  oh i did  painful memories xd i think they are great looking but what a pain to assemble  especially the tiny ones at lzaest the bat tank had the larger ones  yoda
i totally like this set wub i bought it some days ago it looks really nice together with the mtt and i am going to get the atap today sweet edited by stealth hunter 05 january 2008  0444 pm
wout on jan 5 2008 0927 pm said a druid battle pack would also be a nice idea for the castle sets may i ask what you paid for this my first and second idea was that 25 euro was a bit to much for this  xd whatever p bloody typo i say however the upcomming castle advent calendar might include druids p i paid 30 for it  dang 1 cent more expensive as sh d  trudop561 on jan 5 2008 1121 pm said they released the battle droid commander in 2000  yes another nice tone meessa so happy  first you are very welcome for my review of a set present in your wishlist then the commander you are talking about has a tan body with oreange markings only check  and the commander here has a full yellow body like in the spiderman set doc ocs hideout 4856  therefore those 2 commanders are 2 different mfs yoda
yeah finally yoda got his sw d i got 2 of them after x mas  they are really cool  especially the spider droid 2 of them on  happy yoda on p edited by aaylasecura 05 january 2008  1038 pm
nice review and you finally got an 08 set i havent gotten any i blame walmart for putting products out late  d instead of a sbd tlc should have included a droidekanew version y the scale is a bit off so this is a dwarf hailfire droid p p
nive review of it yoda but i was going to do a review of it but now i see this i dont want to do it anymore  next time try to do it with action it is rare that people do that they only do it with the set and not further 
nice review thanks it still seems overpriced to me though also the box shows the droid torsos that are used for feet on the spider droid as being light bley yet they are clearly dark bley wacko tk
great review very precise as for the spider droid construction i have already worked it into a moc httpwwwbrickshelrycgif290980 strykersingle gun hydraseven guns hammermissile pods steel
thanks for the great reveiw yoda fantastic pictures very crisp i am now going onto bricklink to purchse to because you have reasured me that this is a good set ashoka
great review as weve come to expect from yoda y nice to see that tlg is finding new and interesting ways to get around the no minifig only sets restrictions with hasbro clearly this is another army builder with a minimal vehicle as were becoming accustomed to heck even the diminutive hailfire is technically a droid as well thus making this all minifigs from a certain point of view only negative it is a bit overpriced ill have a better feel for that when i get one treadslinks always drive up a price so it might just be fair the spiderdroid is a winner even with the unusual parts assortment i like it when lego thinks of different ways to use things i think it promotes the same from us im not sure what i think of the new battledroid commanders but at least i can make extras easily if i need to as i bought a bunch of yellow droid bodies off bricklink once thinking i might want to make some kind of new droid out of them they were cheap at the time now i expect the price to go up just because of this potential use between those and the grey ones its good to see more becoming available hopefully well see black and a few other colours produced for some nice customizing possibilities all in all a nice little set with a great army building potential especially on a buyonegetonehalfoff or better type of sale until then ill grab one or two and be glad to have them
i got this set for a few months 1 or 2 and i agree that it is small but still it looks great on plates clone troopers just for fun 
i got this and a couple of other sets on mondayand to tell you the truth i was a bit dissapointedi like the set i like the parts but its definitly not worth its rrp of 45 nzd if you ask me i should be more like 35 nzd but hey i still like it i got it for 30 on ebay so im not complaining y y
i havent spotted these in the us yet im looking forward to finding them overall the 2008 lineup is a excellent and its going to be difficult for me to decide which themessets to pursue theres a lot to choose from
thanks for the takes on these two sets yoda stickers or not i still think these are charming sets with all the essence and nostalgia of the older sets back in the 8090s am i the first one to notice the new doors used in the back of the van not only is it using the popular new frame but the old container doors have been redesigned to fit with the new frame as well pity theyre not yellow though
very nice cheers yoda ill definitely be getting the post van not sure about the plane though both are awesome but i think i have enough planes can you tell me though the wheels on the van are they rubber or plastic they look a bit tacky
these little sets are really nice they cought my eye the minute i saw them it would have been so great if there was a post office to go with them there are so few buildings in lego city the design is very classic and i am ofcourse considering to get them but it seems that i have a lot of small cars and planes on my desk  recently i took a flight with cyprus airways from thessaloniki to cyprus and the two promo plane sets were there i was so tired though that i couldnt stay awake to buy them im taking a flight again on tuesday and i hope they are not out of stock thanks for a great review yoda a fine job as always cant wait for your next one
thank you for the nice review pity of the stickers but the design is nice 80ies on
great review yoda i find myself saying that line alot d  i love these two little sets wub tlc continues the great city line that started in 07 and continues into 08 its also nice to have other sub lines besides fire and police  p i hope there are many more postal sets like a post officethat would be sweet hope these are mainstream and not those damn exclusives  postal on p
loool  spielberg goes on a career change d these are some nice sets i really love that car looks sleek
cool finally its an entire line i can actually afford to own every set d i cant wait to get my hands on them if its possible could you give us the demensions of the box it would be apprectiated y dp8
thanks for the review i definitely plan on getting this one thanks again sweet
thanks for the review sweet this set is on my wheniseeitibuy list xd
thanks for the great review very in depth y y those wheel pieces are quite old by the way i have 1 from some time ago peace
i finally got around to finding this at my local tru probably going to do an interior soon
agentrick57 on jan 26 2008 1242 pm said probably going to do an interior soon have funits pretty hard theres hardly any room in my house now i will post pics soon i was able to fit a small fridge  freezer under the stairs 8 
i had this set and its really a very nice and excellent house thanks for the great review hehe enjoy it very much my fave part was the bbq pit 
looks like ill need to buy another one i just started the garage which is attached to the house but i ran out of yellow bricks   btw nice moc takuto20 y i might have to steal your idea and make a third story since its abit tight downstairs to fit everythingooo yea and i like your kitchen and the dishwasher   edited by darthlegois619 23 march 2008  1100 pm
thanks for the review dunamis this is a great little set im also very impressed with takuto20s mods ive been trying a few of my own i liked the tower block design but a lot of stuff needed fixing firstly i added a 4th wall and made it so the storeys could be lifted off like in the other models i also added flowers on the windowsills and doorways out on to the balconies still to be added is an extra door for the top floor which im going to get from the new doors and windows pack i added a chimney that goes all the way up the back of the house and has a fireplace on every level each floor is fully furnished with a fireplace wash basin and bed on the upper levels and a corner sofa and coffee table plus an extra large fireplace on the ground floor finally here is my idea of what to do with two copies of this set all the parts pictured are from 2x 4996 except 5 extra fence panels and the minifigs the house on the left has its garden at the rear
a big thumbs down for me this doesnt look like lego at all  n n n n n out of n n n n n
am i the only that one that thinks it is not so badwhat i am trying to say is wouldnt planes be this big in real lifei know it has a lot of big pieces but how would they make them any smalleror how would they the big pieces into a bunch of tiny pieceswell any way i do think in some cases that if there is any juniorized involved it should be with duplo complaning off
thks for this caustic review d ill wait for the parts on bricklink i think youre a bit unfair with this small oversized submarine  oups sorry i mean plane here are some advantages i tried to imagine  1 thats the first submarine with a plane nose 2 thats the first unprinted nose 3 thats the first shark that make me laugh and which has a plain white fin 4 and at last you should have notice that that the first submarine with a wing made of several plates it is said that this set has more than 200 parts hide and seek  xd you may have lost several bags im eager that people buy this set a lot  id like to buy a lot of these new white 4x4x2 curved slope for my mocs can you take a picture of the plane crashing in the sink  is it fire proof  i think that will be too easy this year to decide what is the crap of year 
this still looks like a cool set but the price not so much do all lego police set come with the polizei option or just ones from europe i have not bought a police set in years edited by legoman132 11 september 2008  0530 pm
hello and welcome to another redman set review well actually the first redman set review im your host redman and today i adorn my medieval outfit to tell you about the impulse set simply titled the knight this is a great set with 14 pieces 2 of which are spare and a minifig with 2 weapons 2 helmets and some shiny armour all this is packaged in a tiny box just short of 10 cm or 3 inches with a neat little instruction manual that folds up to the size of the weapons rack included in the set as you can see this set only costs a measly 7 nzd disclaimer redman not included here we see the box clearly showing what the box holds on the top we see a 11 scale picture of a minifig for those new to lego or who have forgotten how big a minifig is i guess  xd the instruction manual showing the nice and easy built with me for size comparison d sorry about the dark image i had to lean over the light to get a birds eye pic  here we see the 2 different soldiers you can make with the set a knight and a guard or standard troop or soldier or whatever you want to call him note each set comes with only 1 minifigure and additional accessories of course you know im in the picture just for the sake of it im not really one of the soldiers xd the neat little weapons rack or rather equipment rack as it holds not only a weapon but a shield except the ovoid ones helmet and armour nice and easy storage so your equipment wont get dirty lying around on the ground d one of the spare parts is another of those robot hands so you can stick that in place of the shield and allow the rack to hold 2 weapons just thought youd like to know that  and here we see the nifty little structure of the thing it can even support a whole minifig note the grey stud on the bottom bar is a spare part i just find it better used there to hold the armour  huh i dont remember this picture 8 it appears i drifted off and these guys dont look too happy i overtook their weapons equipment rack  i should go xd so in conclusion this is a great set for army building at a reasonable price with nice equipment and it can be picked up as a little extra with your normal shopping xd thats all for today folks sweet redman so what do you think should i continue with these redman reviews  p or just stop now xd comments and criticism welcome  peace
nice review iamded id better go and check toyworld tommorrow sweet shame about the price though only 3 more dollars to get crossbow attack  iamded on jan 19 2008 1244 am said and here we see the nifty little structure of the thing it can even support a whole minifig d batbrick on jan 19 2008 0136 am said edit btw is it just me or does my new avatar make me seem a bit creepy 8 batbrick youve always been a bit creepy p xd
great review iamded lots of pics all the details wish i could find some of these sets locally but so far no luck  i fully intend to steal your use of a character to do the reviewing should i ever do one like this xd oh and if eb news presents ever needs someone to do a commercial well be sure to get in touch with you y batbrick on jan 18 2008 0736 am said btw is it just me or does my new avatar make me seem a bit creepy 8 are you sure its the avatar doing it 8 d 
very good reviews i think that redman is really ok a very little cute curious fig sadly he is not in the impulse set  i wish to see redman still around about your creepy avatar yes it look a bit creepy skull nausicaakro this impulse set is storage in 8 copies with 8 wizard set 16 city set 2x 16 mission to mars set so if you want buy 10 of this like me you must find 2 different toy center
you should continue with these redman reviews there great
i would have purchased a few of these except for the fact that i do not like the new torso that they use
awesome review i like the turkey leg hanging in front of the troll xd yea the back looks a littleempty 8 well overall i enjoyed the review see ya soon
nice review sweet this is a must buy for me since i wub the new sand green giant troll now i just have to wait until its available in the us  general tarful
thanks for this excellent review vader it seems you are succumbing to the castle side of the force i love the new helmet and the new orc torso is fantastic as well which is great to see that the troll faction has many ranks too the troll himself i love i agree with you in saying i prefer the sand green version the battle wagon is cool one of the better wagon designs and the flag is a great touch which improves it sadly the back is rather empty but a few modsll change that  and of course this set includes the infamous chicken pole one pic request if you have time vader could you please post a few pics of the new helmet on its own and on a human soldier please batbrick is back 
thanks for the review vader the first picture of the troll is great the gold armour really shines xd a fantastic set ill definitely get a couple of these wub as for the ogresgiant trolls the dark tan one fits in the mine setting well but for above ground settings i prefer the sand green one y peace edited by iamded 19 january 2008  1021 am
some people say they like the shadow knight helmet better but this one is way better
thanks for that vader i love this helmet wub it will certainly work great as an asian dynasty war helm i reckon thanks again batbrick is back 
thanks for the review i love this set its a cheap way to get green trolls and i love the new helmet it looks great and i think it will be very usefull for other factions as well sweet dnl
vader on jan 19 2008 0132 am said am i the only one who thinks this helmet looks a bit like the juggernaut from xmen
thefrisian on jan 20 2008 0304 pm said am i the only one who thinks this helmet looks a bit like the juggernaut from xmen now you menton it i think you are right that really would work well as a film version y
thanks for the review of a set i would otherwise probably have passed on out of curiosity how did you know it was for you you seem to be building quite a collection why castle now was the fantasy element all it took just curious thanks again and god bless nathan
lego city truck  forklift set  7733 pieces 343 price 2499 usd store of purchase toys rus release date january 2008 after discussion of the mysterious yellow cargo contained in this new city transport set and a visit to my local tru i purchased this set i was immediately pleased with the pricepiece which i think is pretty reasonable 343 pieces for 25 starting with the box great city artwork boasting special edition tha backside of the box no alternate models comes as no surprise the dreaded decals i was looking for the skull and bones for radioactive but no such luck my favorite part of the set a very clever forklift side view and the backside what i like about the forklift is the bars across the top giving the vehicle a reallife design the double wheels in the front with two pieces that can hold the wheels also adds to a clever design i like the figs although not much new  perhaps ill make the driver into a werewolf later the set includes three cargo pallets the first some sort of fuel with gauge the 2nd two indy containers and a square 2x4 brick i have not put the decals on yet and the mysterious yellow cargo your guess is as good as mine   on to the truck the front section the front grill another angle the back i like the opening mechanism that is very simple but works well also is the large plate tile piece inside i like this because the entire interior has no studs and the trailer section of the truck orange and yellow tail lights and the rear trailer open the complete set summary this is a neat set that reminds me a bit of classic lego city but larger it is very playable and has a lot of accessories adding to the value the build was very simple and enjoyable took me about an hour it is a great addition to a number of city sets including the cargo ship container stacker the world city cargo train and the new cargo plane as i mentioned previously i have not yet put on the decals that im sure will really add to the overall look of the set the forklift is awesome and i like the cargo containers the truck could have benefited from a few additional details chrome smokers and an undercarriage box that really opens considering everything i would buy this set again hope you enjoy and perhaps this mysterious cargo will make its way into a brickster mystery y
general kannon on jan 19 2008 0510 am said im guessing the main difference is the fact that the box says special edition its either that or its a toysrus exclusive set as my armoured drilling unit box also had special edition on it
im curious for those of you who are not into city sets and want this set for the forklift what would you use it for
thanks for the review i think the special edition is just for making people intrested and make them want to buy that set or something
some guy on jan 19 2008 1117 pm said i think the special edition is just for making people intrested and make them want to buy that set or something hmm thats a thought but why would they pick this particular set i would expect theyd do that with a slightly bigger set like the heavy hauler perhaps why do you think theyde pick this one
mr tiber on jan 19 2008 0246 pm said hmm thats a thought but why would they pick this particular set i would expect theyd do that with a slightly bigger set like the heavy hauler perhaps why do you think theyde pick this one good question maybe its merely a gimick to help push the city sets with all the other competing themes the cement mixer is a special edition as well
this set looks pretty good to me it is six wide isnt it that is nice for a truck like this
hey thanks for the review the brickster i was just wondering if you could possibly upload a picture of the instructions for the forklift and if possible tell me the piece  of the 1x4 slope bricks to bricklink them thanks
greetings and welcome to another redman review im your host redman and today i adorn my medieval outfit to tell you about the impulse set simply titled the knight no wait thats the old script xd i mean the good wizard sweet the other castle impulse set the first being the knight this is a wonderful and in my case unexpected addition to the castle line i did not expect to get a nice good wizard but rather another plain white skellie for the impulse and was pleasantly surprised when i saw the first picture of this set the impulse sets give you pieces you wouldnt expect to see in such small sets for example the knight came with the armour and this comes with an owl a gem and a crystal ball piece it comes with 11 pieces including the wand owl and gem and no spares which doesnt really matter as it doesnt need any the box sports the set number age range which i blissfully ignore xd awesome castle logo and the assembled set with the usual 11 scale picture of a minifig the back of the box shows pictures of the boxed skeleton tower and kings castle siege sets note the price is in new zealand dollars and is really the same prica as any other impulse set next are the instructions which are separated into 3 parts 1 for the minifigure 1 for the table and one for the bird stand very simple also worth mentioning is the parts numbers are next to their respective parts for replacement parts etc on the back we see on the top half pictures of skeleton prison carriage skeleton tower and kings castle siege this time not of the boxed sets but the sets themselves on the lower half we have 8 pictures each of the different impulse sets the wizards torso is plain sand blue with no patterns or anything but it doesnt really matter is his beards in the way  the head is that same old white fade to grey beard head but the white beard covers up most of the grey my favourite part is the pants i love that were getting printed belts and legs again his belt has 4 gold crosses as seen in if you look closely the new crownies torso and the crownie archers torso and a belt buckle and the legs have a bottle a coin and a small bag nice little wizardey items the er items no accessories no models the stuff in the set include a little stand for the owl and a table utilising the new 4x4 round piece in light bley with the crystal ball in the middle encasing the yellow gem held on by a 2x2 circle piece in blue why blue im not sure maybe its because the crystal is yellow and the crownies colours are blue and gold so the blue piece with the yellow crystal symbolise the crownies colours or maybe tlc just felt the need to include an odd colour p in conclusion this is a wonderful set with some neat accessories and it doesnt really need to be bought in the masses after all you needs an army of owls and wizards  p so it works fine as a single set and adds a more fantasy feel to your crownie army thats all for today folks sweet redman thanks for reading another of my redman interviews any suggestions on how towhat to do to improve it is greatly appreciated as are all comments and criticisms except those blatant thoughtless criticisms that dont help at all p peace edited by kimt 10 august 2008  0131 pm
tinypiesrus on jan 20 2008 0605 am said the wizard is pretty good and comes with some good parts it would be nicer if he had a torso with printing on it i agree in fact its a point ive already made on this board simonwillems on jan 20 2008 0259 pm said the only thing that could have been better in my opinion is the wand i always liked this one again a point i agree with and already made on this board im not blaming you guys  the op in this thread should at the very least have linked to the existing thread about this set on this board  edited by amperzand 20 january 2008  0501 pm
simonwillems on jan 20 2008 0259 pm said thanks for the review of this nice little set for its price 3 euros here in holland it contains quite a lot of useful parts the only thing that could have been better in my opinion is the wand i always liked this one i miss those wands they couldve used it but i think the wood wand kindda adds realis to the set and since many fans dont like their castle theme to be too fantasized i guess lego decided to use a mold that was still being used for various sets when i get this set im going to put it on the tower in the kings castle you know the one that is right above the throne room  thatll be a great spot and then ill finally have all the necessary characters the king in his throne the knights on the walls the wizard on his tower top and the princess in her tower room that floats in mid air and is connected to the throne room by a 2stud wide bridge d i love the kings castle siege set wub
not bad i could see picking up a couple of these guys along with a few of the new knights i actually prefer the wizard as these impulse items are simply too expensive for army building imo later
blueandwhite on jan 21 2008 1015 am said not bad i could see picking up a couple of these guys along with a few of the new knights i actually prefer the wizard as these impulse items are simply too expensive for army building imo later same thats why ill probly only get the wizard because they are quite expensive if you compare them to the 2 ones i used to get back around 2000 and you got about the same peices aswell 
iamded on jan 21 2008 0303 pm said thanks everyone for your feedback sorry i knew you had done a review but i didnt think you had to post a link to all other reviews already done on that set  its just expressing my opinions and sharing my thoughts about the set as well as giving people a bit of info the way i see it i dont really have to post a link in the first post but you can feel free to post a link to your review if you want to give people your thoughts and opinions besides nz never gets sets first and most of the ones i pick up have already been reviewed  peace so your saying you did the reveiw i thought it was redman xd 
iamded on jan 21 2008 0908 pm said no that was on behalf of redman xd peace ohof course im very sorry 
iamded on jan 21 2008 0503 am said sorry i knew you had done a review but i didnt think you had to post a link to all other reviews already done on that set  its just expressing my opinions and sharing my thoughts about the set as well as giving people a bit of info the way i see it i dont really have to post a link in the first post but you can feel free to post a link to your review if you want to give people your thoughts and opinions on most message boards one doesnt duplicate the topic of an active or recent thread theres a good reason for that the boards would soon become a mess if that practice became widespread i assumed that keeping posts on the same topic together was also the rule here and therefore expected any posts like your opening one to be a contribution to my existing thread on this topic it appears though that i was mistaken on these boards one is free to start a new thread on an existing topic in future i may well do that thank you for drawing my attention to that back on topic i thought your review was pretty good as were the pics y edited by amperzand 21 january 2008  1220 pm
iamded on jan 20 2008 0629 pm said the stuff in the set include a little stand for the owl and a table utilising the new 4x4 round piece in frown with the crystal ball in the middle encasing the yellow gem held on by a 2x2 circle piece in blue why blue im not sure wait isnt it light bley not frown  p although i would much rather have a brown table  more ontopic i love the wizards legs even better than the evil wizards ones the hip piece looks very nice on dark blue legs y
hollisbrick on jan 20 2008 0438 pm said 7 geez i thought 6 was bad x nz7 is worth au6 so its the same price
mister phes on jan 21 2008 1034 pm said nz7 is worth au6 so its the same price thats not the point d
tinypiesrus on jan 21 2008 1229 pm said wait isnt it light bley not frown  p although i would much rather have a brown table  i dont know what frown is but if its a shade of brown then youre right no part of the table is any shade of brown the owls stand is though  i think that shade is called reddish brown on bricklink please see pic
a great review i like redman he is most amusing thanks as for the set i like it very much i love the wizard and owl wub
i do admit the amount of cargo is rediculously small but it still looks good say how much can the plane hold thanks for the review sweet
thanks for the review and pics dr s i am still considering this set what is the instruction manual number
sinner on feb 4 2008 1151 pm said thanks for the review and pics dr s i am still considering this set what is the instruction manual number there are two  hopefully these are the numbers you need 4525919 4525920  dr s
thank you very much for a good and informative review doc sinister y this looks like the best of the bigplanes to me very nice and smoother than the rest  although like youve said what the heckre they transporting diamonds and pearls so much wasted space and the landing gear should really fold in n
i loved the pics in the catalogues but was a bit disappointed by the build and end result my own thoughts cons  as noted the cargo space is really small considering the size of the plane although i can see this is restricted due to playability  without the barrier in the middle the cargo would slide all over the place while the plane was being swooshed  the cargo lift im not sure how else to describe it is very weak and snaps off although it is a clever design i think its badly implemented  there is nothing to hold the cargo pallet to the cargo lift truck so it tends to slide off all over the place as soon as the truck moves  colour issues  i had at least 3 shades of green with the larger plane pieces and noticeable variances even with identical cargo hatch pieces at least one of them also came quite scratched which was a little disappointing  at 7995 aud its 10 more than the passenger plane was with less pieces and figs and no printed pieces whatsoever more  for less methinks pros  lots of nice cargo crate pieces and even the stickers for these are pretty good  landing gear piece adjusts very well to height differentials so the plane doesnt lose its gear as often as the earlier passenger planes  the hinging mechanism works very well to open the cargo holds  opens very smoothly and is not noticeable  id definitely like to see more of this technique  the little vehicles work well chained together and are all good small designs overall  i really like the large planes since 06 but i dont think theyve still quite hit the nail on the head whereas the earlier planes were a little flimsy this one is sturdier but has its own issues the look of the cargo plane is nice and the new landing piece and cargo hatch pieces are really great but some design weaknesses and colour issues detract from the overall product its a shame as with a bit of tweaking this could have been a musthave set
tks drs for your cool review  i admit tht this plane is way better than i imagined  even if i still dislike the new hull the engines and landing gear are really improved and the way to operate the crates work really well  tks for sharing these pics  yoda
hairy ruben on feb 5 2008 0433 pm said really i love the way they look granted they go back to the 70s but so does the 747 or the c130 you cant argue about tastes and colours i guess p dr s  how much did the set cost its 3499 on sh but i got mine as part of a bundle theyd put together  7731 mail van  7732 air mail  7733 truck  forklift  7734 cargo plane all for 6456 dr s
the amount of cargo that huge plane carries 8 green peace would have a field day xd nice review dr s but this set is just too big for my town scale  edited by casewindu 05 february 2008  0954 pm
dr s i was not planning on buying this set after my disappointment with the other large airplane but after looking at this image review i just might buy the green color is really the aspect that makes this airplane stand out i think it looks great thanks for the review
thank for the review doc the only thing i like in this set is the small car so i will not buy this set just for it i really dislike those new planes toooo bbiiiigggg with this size this cargo plane can carry just fiew things what a shame i think that the way tlc has made the wings is not very good like the rest of those big pieces just my thought the positif point of this its that it makes me saved some money d
asuka on feb 5 2008 1243 am said although like youve said what the heckre they transporting diamonds and pearls and nintendo dses hawhaw get it cricket cricket cricket cricket
an excellent review dr sinister y i really like how tlc is using the new crate mold in different sets the transport car is really neat as well as the lifting thingy plus i love the green color wub p
thank you for this review it is a brilliant set i am definitely getting this set once indy is released in new zealand hurry up tlc  pscould i have pic of what indy looks like with an old classic whip
tks for your great review pirnha  piranha on feb 8 2008 0509 am said first off we have our hero indian what the hell why is there a freaking cw anakin head on indy there was a production slip up as instead of indys head i get anakins   i open the box up and there staring me in the face is his ugly face g another production error  at least we know they manufacture licenses sets in the same place d did that happpen to any of you guys  piranha on feb 8 2008 0509 am said cool fig 8 will need to make one like that for keeps will change me from having indy numerous times d  yoda
that is the one of the oddest mistakes i have ever heard of d even so you have to admit that it is good news for you lego will hapily give you the right head if you ask thanks for the review i have this set too wub
supremecommmandergrievous on feb 9 2008 0432 pm said i have noticed that at my local tlc store orlando they have this set in a glass case on displaywith the cw anakin head on indy i did not realize this was such a widespread problem seriously so the persons who made that display are pretty clueless too weird mistake to make by tlc sorry if i did something wrong with  i thought that was the quotebutton   let us know how your indy head adventure turns out darthperson i hope youll get the indy face edited by mr spielbrick 09 february 2008  0546 pm
i got mine today xd i too got an anakin clone wars head although im not really complaining since i already have an indy head from the motorcycle chase set it is really odd that they would pack in such a different looking head though also for those that think the head has no use try placing it under one of the braided new brown dwarf beards it looks pretty nice i think y on the set its wonderful the hieroglyphic stickers are wonderful marion especially her head and hair is wonderful and the anubis statues are nice too theres also lots of nice tan parts such as 20 round 2x2s and 8 1x8 bricks all in all its a great set for the price and i cant wait to get race for the stolen treasure and temple escape now sweet
dammit indy you werent supposed to open the ark i really like this set i only brought it for marion but its a nice set and fun to build
yeah in mine i did not have any problems well except on one of my dark blue round pieces it was a bit damaged but it still worked fine and i got a replacement from lego
thanks for the review stealth hunter y that truck looks better than i expected and its for sure a pretty playable set nice but still too much police mayhem to me i think the new police stationll satisfy all my safety needs 
thanks for the review that truck is actually better than i first thought i am still tossing up getting it as i am getting the police station and where would it park p i quite like the little building though but still i am so confused wacko
i wish i could just get those grey barrels alone the rest of the set doesnt really intreigue me much  thanks for the review
haha your review are so funny and so lego cool
great little set i bought this set only a few years ago misb and i am still very happy about it the hut is simple but very effective as a castaway building on some deserted island the palmleaves are a good addition to any lego collection this set had a nice amount of weapons two for each pirate and two of those weapons are flintlock muskets as opposed to just pistols nice poll as well but you made sure nobody can give this set a 1 which is very nice but probably a little mistake d  i gave it the toprating y
simonwillems on feb 19 2008 0747 pm said nice poll as well but you made sure nobody can give this set a 1 which is very nice but probably a little mistake d  i gave it the toprating y so i have oops i never was very good at maths p
i bought one of these new from bricklink a few months ago as part of my pirate splurge i went on i really enjoyed this set because of the amount of figs in such a small set though pirates were always pretty good about their fig count also the neat little hut is nicely done for its purpose great review btw
imo this is a very simple and small set good to add some part to forbidden island good
well since this topic has resurfaced i would add my 2 cents about my appreciation of this set it was the first and unfortunately the largest pirate set i owned as a kid but i played the wazoo out of it some of the minifigs have lost almost all their face printing after so many play sessions theres just something about the hut that appealed to me more than the cheesy skullface islands we keep gettingprobably that it wa kind of neutral good for my pirates settlers or islanders though the palm leaves were rather fragile and used to break off the studded parts it would be nice to get more of these beach village army builder sets edited by ardelon 21 september 2014  0340 pm
tks for that nice review brainbox i recieved the construction diggers set like this last year gee what a nice parts pack i like that orange lidded set the truck so nice i wont get it though
ricecracker on feb 19 2008 0639 pm said why not they are all very nice i have all six of them especially the helicopter my least anticipated but one of the most detailed thanks for the review brainbox well i shall wait until it goes for 125 on my sh than buy it with a load of other sets plural on feb 19 2008 0725 pm said thanks for the review brainbox sweet these look really nifty i might pick up a couple of these as for the parts im sure they could come in handy for something and so cheap as well i still miss xpods though  do the kids still say nifty these days wacko eurobrickers do thats for sure
brainbox on feb 20 2008 0255 pm said youre welcome guys d sorry that just made me laugh i did some research and reread tyour review i will pick this up this weekend quote yeah so do i they really were a neat idea i had all the xpods they were awesome i haven collected all of these though
thanks for these fantastic review its the first time i take a good look at these sets there is a good chance ill buy the dwarfs mine defender especially for that price
the tower raid has the best price per piece ratio in the whole 2008 line thanks for the review 
thanks for these great reviews sweet the dwarfs mine defender looks interesting the figs though are wub the only thing missing is a weapon for the dwarf and some shields the battering ram and tower are awesome 8 the troll king with new torso helmet and body armor is simply amazing i like how the troll is handcuffed d the tower shows nice detail except for the poor brig  i love that gold crystal the battering ram is a thing of beauty 30 for the tower and ram and 10 for the defender are very well priced i still want the battle wheel more though damn exclusives   p
i got myself today 3 dwarfs mine defender and i have to say that sets does suck big time the plastic rubber band doesnt do squat and 3 wheels i really not enough i only built 2 of those and changed the front of it with 4 wheels and no plastic rubber band and i changed the 2x2 dark bley plate its still looks good but the crappy rubber band system is really not well thought off anyhow my orc army is growing  yoda
hello eurobricks my first post yesterday i will buy this two sets im waiting for the packs sorry but my english isnt good
well you didnt say anything wrong yet undead army officer i perfer using the batle wheel to knock down the towers walls not the seige tower
a great reveiw dunamis y  you have only backed up what i thought when the pictures first appeared if you are a lego fan there is no excuse not to buy this set it is a must have i love the mouse hole and the mouse and his cheese wub 
for some silly and quite delusional reason i thought that i had a chance to review this first d but yours is at your house and mine is hopefully winging its way to me  thanks for the review it will help me survive until mine arrives i love this set wub hopefully there will be many more stunning sets like this to come sweet xwingyoda on mar 8 2008 0803 pm said i didnt know green grocer had a rodent infestation  neither did i and i have looked through the instructions at least three times 
runs to lego store in bluewater m
like the set this review also deserves a 1010 ive ordered this set yesterday on sh seeing and reading this review im convinced it will be worth the money so bonaparte is finally entering the city theme 
truly an awesome review thanks dunamis i ordered my two copies one to build one to store in the vault last week cant wait to get this one the attention to detail here is what makes the set great theres nothing to criticize about this set its really the closest thing to perfection that i have seen from tlc the difference between this set and cc is the interior detail and because of that gg now become in my opinion the best set ever released by tlc do the ccggms sets fit well with the 50th anniv town plan my impression is that out of the box at least they dont which is too bad however i dont think it would be hard to mod the town plan so it looks like it belongs in the same town as ccggms these sets to me are what i have always wanted from tlc as an adult i hope they keep up the line and add more elements to this excellent lineup
 amazing great review d u have totalyl convinced me to get this set its so wonderful filled with great details what a waste i cant order it in sh because i am from singapore  i hope it will come to my country so i am able to buy it 
afol sf on mar 8 2008 0629 pm said a very informative review indeed thank you so much for doing so now i know that the price is worth every penny leaving my pocket  what do you guys think is tlc putting up as the next modular set is it asking too much of tlc to produce 1 modular set each quarter 4 times a year i would vote for a bank next
thank you sooo much for this amazing review dunamis i absolutly adore this set and youve review has prompted me to certainetly start saving i have a bit left over form christmas that will come in handy d  i love the little fridge downstairs the fire escape and the mouse hole alot more good ideas that we can all use in creating our own buildings this line is by far my favorite lego line ever yes even beats starwars but only just   hooray for dunamis xd
ive got something i want to share with you a beautiful dream came true 1 the box top back the alternate model is also very well done the pneumatics dump the bucket and open the flap  open you can see a diagram how the pneumatics work just a happy kid playing the plastic inlays  all 2 the parts as you can see 8854 offers a very large variety of different parts loads of technic bricks gears and even plates also note the threaded axle 10 5 large pulleys a big turntable and the 1x20 rack 3 building the mechanism for the outriggers and the rotation of the turntable the turntable the pneumatics are finished the mechanism for the telescope the finished model 4 random shots you can see how the turntable will be rotated thanks for reading erm viewing the pictures please comment if you want to
really cool set this has convinced me that i really want it
great pictures especially the perspective from overhead this is one of my favorite technic models because it packs so many features in a relatively small space and im working on documenting this one in technicopedia right now thanks for the photos eric
thanks for another fun review this set is high on my list of things to buy i love cranes built many and bought many including the classic 8460 from 1995 and the more recent 8421 that threaded axle never stopped intriguing me it was use in so few sets i believe 8851 contained one as well and i still dont know why its better than any other axle congratulations with a near mint copy of this set 
simonwillems on mar 10 2008 0132 pm said that threaded axle never stopped intriguing me it was use in so few sets i believe 8851 contained one as well and i still dont know why its better than any other axle the purpose of the threaded axle is to carry tension regular axles are used primarily for carrying torsion for gears sometimes for compression 8855 landing gear helicopter skids and sometimes just for looks roll cages canopies but used in tension connectors will usually just pop off with the threads and the corresponding nuts this part can be used to squeeze parts together like the pen in the plotter of 8094 or to hold heavy assemblies onto turntables like 8862 and 8851 with the power crane 8854 reviewed here that is the complete list of sets which used this part i wrote about it here httpwwwericalbre1984htmlparts eric
i bought it some years ago for the bmodel and like it so much d
hi this is my third oldschool technic set review i dont want to talk much please enjoy just the pictures 1 the parts 2 building the two axles you can see in the middle are not connected and dont belong to each other the axle on the left side is for the steering on the right side for the engine the darkgray technic gear 16 tooth with clutch allows the connection from the differential gear to the engine trough the axle for the steering the v6engine the winch thats a part you dont see everyday a 1x2 rack it only reappears in 2 sets from 2001 and 2004 the rebel wrecker has been released in 1994 the front double wishbone with antisway barsuspension yeah i got it from technopedia xd  the finished model 3 random shots i really like this picture authoritative isnt it 8 d thanks for viewing the pictures please comment if you want to
thanks for reviewing all these old sets will you be doing any more
the only original stickers are the front headlightpatterns on the 2 red 1x2 bricks the others have been destroyed  must have been the bad decaying sticker quality that breaks when youll remove it  so i printed them i didnt print the flag for only the alternate model needs it although its a neat idea and lordgalewind clickey i keep that in mind one of my 8880 is already dusty enough
ive seen a few cases like this where the box pictures are slightly different from the actual model the airtech claw rig compressor is another one that comes to mind the changes sometimes seem pointless and make you wonder why they bothered p quote the only original stickers are the front headlightpatterns on the 2 red 1x2 bricks the others have been destroyed  must have been the bad decaying sticker quality that breaks when youll remove it  so i printed them i didnt print the flag for only the alternate model needs it although its a neat idea the other stickers on mine have held up pretty well although i didnt try to remove them after i put them on the flag started to break after a year or so and just fell off its axle at one point i taped over it and its holding up well now although its a little frayed along one edge this is actually the earliest set ive seen that uses this crappy sticker material which is unfortunately very common today even other technic sets had good stickers for many years after that
bernddasbrot on mar 10 2008 0556 pm said youve just motivated me to go on a senselesspreliminarydesignerrorshunt man this set is a disaster what were they thinking d p i just remembered one other fun aspect of this set the crane hook can be attached to the underside of the rear bumper to hold it in position while driving along but when things are like this and you try and wind up the cable the winch is strong enough to break the original provided lego rope it worked with my copy d so this set is capable of demolishing itself but still one of the best technicsets i have with all stickers intact im not so sure about that flag though must check on that
wow that first picture is great you must have a very wide angle lens with the capability to focus very close macro the perspective makes the model look huge nice work i think the suspension on this set is my favorite of all technic it has such large travel and is so what word should i use bouncy hey why do you only review sets which are red d eric
blakbird on mar 10 2008 0935 pm said hey why do you only review sets which are red d i exactly thought that today as i made the pics for my signature xd at my school leaving examination i made a model in blender3d and explained to the board of examiners how to build a car and how to animate it it needed a color so i took red because all beautiful and fast cars are red my physics teacher contradicted 
bernddasbrot on mar 10 2008 0141 pm said at my school leaving examination i made a model in blender3d and explained to the board of examiners how to build a car and how to animate it it needed a color so i took red because all beautiful and fast cars are red my physics teacher contradicted  did you use ferrari to prove your point any physics teacher would have to admit that a really fast car approaching the speed of light will always look red as it drives away due to red shift xd on the other hand 8880 looks pretty fast and it is black although i have seen pictures of one that someone built in red yellow might be good too some cars even look fast in green eric
reread your review today great pictures this is a fabulous model got this model a few months ago for just € 25 it is small and has great working parts i love the way the frontsuspension is made epic i only had the lightstickers replaced with transclear bricks btw the gear rack has been used in this years 8048 buggy
i also happened to receive this set this weekend virtually misb the seals on the side of the box were loose however everything inside was untouched this little beast a joy to build and even more so to play with as indicated by eric on the technicopedia page its crammed with functions for a mediumsized set i think i love it even more than my son does
my friend has this set and the alien ships wings are wobbly and overall x he may have built it wrong im not sure i didnt see the build anyways nice review y
cool review makes me want to get the set y
thank you for your nice review vbbn y but it only confirms this theme is not my cup of tea weird aliens strange colors parts stuck together with no idea  i always hated this big wheels  its even worse in orange x saving money for different sets on and that doesnt mean it was a bad review  
vbbn on mar 14 2008 0112 am said holodoc i agree with you and the buety of being a custom parts maker is that i can recolor these  y athos sure buddy they have moving arms legs a real mf the arms and legs are the same just flipped  blech i dont like that at all x steve
well as bad a concept aliensvshumans is for a theme i really do like this set the human rover has nice parts for reuse especially those oldschool space wheels and despite those wobbly wings i really like the alien ship goes from a flying saucerish shape to a spread winged almost raven shape very ominous and cool looking now that alien commander is terrible if i dont buy bionicle minifigs already why would i be interested in that thing kinda wish theyd take the drones from the retiring exoforce theme and do them in green theyd make nice alien robot things
i dont own the 8296 but what i can see from the pictures i would say that 8296 is very similar to 8829 the only things that are different ist that 8296 is studless and features a steering wheel for the seat but 8829 has got bigger wheels  it also would have been nice if the wheels from 8296 could have the same tread
what store did you find this at xo great review
lt veers on mar 23 2008 0139 am said what store did you find this at xo great review i found all the april released speed racers sets in the shop in legoland i was going to post a review tuesday of this set but i can see im too late now i cross my fingers for the fierce creatures set doesnt get taken as well i would like to comment on the review but the pictures are too big  it simply takes too long to load regarding that new resize function i can see it does nearest neighbor rescaling doesnt it resize to less than 640x480 i thought that was the standard for forum post pictures edited by lasse d 23 march 2008  1255 am
thanks for the picture packed review d i love snake oilers car its so orange wub wub and sleek and smooth and sexy xd thanks again peace
hmm very interesting thanks for the review generaltarful y both cars although pretty wide look still very sleek and fast especially from the side and solid too but the front of the mach 5 without the stickers i don´t know from some angles it looks good and a little bad from some other 8 sticker mayhem again but very useful parts nevertheless btw what was the price and hinckley do you have a brother or is this just the start of a new career p
thanks for the review i think ill certainly get these sets they look very nice and have nice minfigs i love racing as long as minifigs could sit in them the fact that there are so much stickers make me think this is an model building theme like when you build plastic cars with all those tiny pieces and a load of stickers but that sshaped thingy does already exist doesnt it edited by matn 23 march 2008  1140 am

nice but not my cuppa
as i said elsewhere i couldnt see this reviewed anywhere so here you are to start with a couple of box shots the contents and the parts laid out the instructions this is what was left over from the build and heres the kit complete build time about ten seconds if you pick your nose whilst you are doing it d i love the little robot it reminds me of that weird machine in the first wallace and gromit adventure in fact give it some skis and you are away oh and it has a metal detector thingy which i might have to borrow for a future episode of grunts im not sure if i have any alreadywho knows cost  £249 value for money erm no knock a quid off and id say yes dr s
i want that set so badly i went to a lego store last weekend and they only had the fire and police ones  i want it for the metal detector serious whackin instrument  
nice review the set doesnt seem as good as the crystal hawk and there colouring mistake with gun is just well bad and not the kind of thing i expect tlc to do something that stupid edited by pencoin 03 june 2008  0451 pm
as i mentioned elsewhere i couldnt see a review for this and though its only small lets strive for completion heres the box the contents the parts leftover bits and the set not much to it i know and not much of a review but there you goquite a lot of stuff with the copper though dr s
big or small we all love our legos and for that i thank you for the review i would have had liked to see your opinions though about the price the playability or anything else youd care to share about it and perhaps how it fits with your collection ive always been hesitant about getting this set because to me i feel like i have it all already but im missing that dog radar gun and 50 mph sign

when i went to blue water they have dogs in the pick a brick wall so i have plenty  yes i think i have everything here thats why i havent baught this the fireman or the construction worker they need to bring out something unique
thanks for the review it looks beautiful my father was a backhoe driver so understandably i used to drool over this set in the catalogs i never did get it though as lego was so expensive in australia then i had around 2000 pieces and i thought i had loads d anyway last year i bought 8455 which i love it works great with a compressor i made too sweet i wish mine had a real cab though  do you have 8455 as well id love to see how they compare side by side it looks bigger than 8455 but i dont own any of the big old chuncky tires so i find it so hard to tell by the way i have been reading all of your reviews but i have been a bit busy of late so i havent had time to comment i hope you have more planned any chance of a supercar one
thanks sweet
slyowl on mar 24 2008 0753 pm said thanks sweet glad to see that i could help cp5670 said i guess you can try to make linear actuators out of them could you explain your thoughts please you know my english skills 
bernddasbrot on mar 24 2008 0539 pm said could you explain your thoughts please you know my english skills  i was thinking you could somehow attach a 16tooth dark gray gear the one that spins freely around axles to the nut which would make the axle move in and out when the gear turned and convert the gears rotary motion to linear motion in a fairly compact package although there are other ways of doing the same thing that dont use such rare parts and the 2008 technic sets will come with prebuilt linear actuators anyway
blakbird on mar 25 2008 0642 pm said wow thats a long exposure i would think you would get way too much light and overexpose the image the aperture must have been tiny for the aperture i dont know what ive used but my room was already very darkend as i tool the photos it was actually serendipity  blakbird said cool i am also planning to write about the combine on technicopedia i will but ill need some time i really shoud do a few things for university thats also the reason why i succeded in so many other things   blakbird said you dont own 8480 that is unacceptable it is imperative that you put a mortgage on your house immediately to get it not again sing just kidding my parents will xd  blakbird said while the assembly you have drawn would work as a linear actuator i would not recommend it the torsional stiffness and strength of an axle are proportional to the polar moment of inertia a section property most of the stiffness comes from the outside of the cross shaped axle but in the threaded axle you lose all the stiffness of the outer area because it is not continuous this means you only get stiffness and strength from the small core i think the threaded axle would bend and break very easily if subjected to much torque the toothed 10l axle doesnt look very robust youre right on brickshelf i once saw another version using a worm gear and a halfbush being moved along another axle edited by bernddasbrot 28 march 2008  0512 pm
a great review i only have new sets so looking at old ones like this is great i would suggest multiple pictures blended together afterwards instead of the long exposure pictures bernddasbrot on mar 23 2008 1132 pm said now you can recognize the backhoes real shape only with a little violence it’s possible to lift the bonnet  through the pneumatic pump arent you supposed to fit the bonnet over the pump and then attach it to the main frame  front

very good review these sets are a lot better than i expected and for 20 i might have to pick up both my family and i are going to orlando this summer hopefully ill pick these and some other sets up at the lego store in downtown disney d
as promised and with only a single day of delay is my review of the 2008 set 4994 creator fierce creatures this small set is the same size and price range as last years 4939 cool cars reviewed by prateek and dillthepill the box general info you get 193 pieces vs 206 for cool cars which is quite a lot but most of them are small there are a lot of hinges and some good slopes and wings the building instructions contains three models but no further ideas for inspiration primary model spider the first model is a big spider which shares some similarities to the secondary model of 4895 power in the design the legs each have 3 joints where the ones in the middle have stud joints to be moved sideways while the rest use hinges for all joints there are 8 of them and it does get a little tedious with all the repetitive building in this relatively small model i like the design of the face with a lot of eyes and a big and ugly mouth but the real gem is the xpattern on the opisthosoma made using doubleinverted slopes it is poseable and i think it looks more fierce when inverted secondary model snake the face of the snake is nicely detailed with a splitting tongue and a mouth than can move a little there is a problem with the construction it uses stacked hinges for some of the joints which are hard to pull apart without stressing the pieces tertiary model fly im not completely sure what this insect is i will say its a fly although the tail and head are too pointy this is a neat little thing conclusion primary model 8 it is a good design but lacks some sturdiness in the legs they fall off a little too easily secondary models 6 they are pretty good when you look at the bricks that are available but they dont wow you in any way and they suffer from the same issues as the primary model regarding sturdiness alternate models 3 it is hard to come up with alternate models with so many small pieces and plates that are only 1 stud wide the colors might make you want to build a spyrius space ship playability 8 the models have many movable joints and you can put quite a scare into your minifigs when their town gets attacked by these creatures unless some en forces are there to protect them price 6 creator sets are known for their great price to bricks ratio but this set doesnt quite measure up to sets like cool cars pieces 7 the pieces arent great by themselves but who doesnt need a fist full of hinges slopes and basic plates in standard colors i dont think this is a musthave set like the big rig was last year the pieces are great and it has a nice primary model but the set lacks a bit when it comes to the usual strong creator qualities like alternate models and price brickshelf gallery edited by whitefang 23 may 2009  0630 pm indexed
thank you for your detailed review lasse d y the only problem about this set is that most of the people here will regard this as a pure parts pack xd oooh  i just found out about the red teeth  cool i want that wub
thank you for review very good army builder i see
excellent review y getting a better chance to look at this set actually makes me interested in it i was in my dark ages throughout the islander days though i have built up a small force of them 10 from ebay buys but no actual sets if this is really as reasonable as you say there i may just have to pick one up soon oddly i do own the baseplates to this set having also picked them up in a lot on ebay so i might be able to recreate it manually but i think id rather pick one up whole it looks like a great mix of parts and makes a decent looking display piece thanks again for the fine review y
its a great set and one i have yet to add to my collection despite my large number of islander extras enchanted island aside from having so alluring a name was good value for money in that you only needed this one set and you had a good representation of the islanders both in the size of the set and the number of minifigs the flipping rope bridge and the river give it a great rainforest retreat sort of feeling and one is inclined to think of this set as more inland than directly coastal for me whilst the islanders were never seen in the same light or popularity as pirates and imperials they were an obvious and colourful addition that to me added a whole new depth to the pirate system and one was now able to play a 3 or 4 way war adding a greater political element to the sets enchanted island is probably the 3rd most appealing of the large land bases for me after port royal and eldorado fortress good review and glad to see the set recognised
wow that is one great review you made sly i gave it a four only thing i dont like is the raised baseplate it does get you a lot of figs two ships and some nice assecories great set
great review i think this set looks great i really like the islanders and that statue is really nice it comes with a lot of nice leaves and i like all of the secret compartments and the like thanks for the nice review
i was just going into my dark ages when lego began the islander themes so ive never really cared for them but this review actually made me want this set real bad i guess this is what reviews are for then  good job on the review
hello eldiano although the review is fine and you have memories related to that set please have in mind that the post you were replying to was in fact some 7 years old this is what we call bumping of old topics and it shouldnt be done you might want to take a look at our faq posting tips and etiquette edited by phred 06 april 2015  0347 am by phred read next post please
eldiano thank you for posting about your desire to have this set i do own the set and i do recommend it to others if they somehow find a used one the bricks are kind of sparse but the the bricks it does come with are really nice i love the figs and the base plates are by far my favorite made by tlg captain braunsfeld i suggest that you read through the link that covers topic bumping more clearly i apologize for the confusion eldiano i do believe that i have found a way to remove the confusion of posting in old topics soon among the pirate staff and to the other members of eb please stay tuned sinner on 18 july 2010  0316 am said 3 lego reviews dont date thus if you have something relevant to say then feel free to post in a topic but if its more than a few months old please make sure its good and if its been a few years it better be really good for example if you liked the review or set and want to say so you probably shouldnt if youve got an answer to a question such as does anyone have pictures of the alternate model then by all means post what you shouldnt do is ask questions to the original poster heshe may not even visit eb any more
how comes the monkey stays yellow but not the people 
i will most likely get all the speed racer sets as it was one of my favorite moviesthe animated one i just loved the decked up and tricked out cars  great review and red tux  xd
looks like a great ole set to me the cars seem abit overly slopey to me though ill probably pass on this but as a note i especially like the black and yellow cars horizontal wheel covering things nice 
sorry to bump such an old thread but i´ve just discovered this set is on sale at amazonde  for a mere 25 euros i am tempted not because i like the set or the models but because of the parts as most of you might know i´m especially into exoforce so would you recommend to get this set just for the parts are they a good choice to combine with efsets would anyone of you be interested in obtaining the fleshieparts of the minifigs from me as i totally don´t need those
speed racer is the action filmand he has formula 1 car but he is intersted in art of the race
front on apr 6 2008 0519 pm said btw boxes are expensive so at a given price point its a choise between more bricks or nicer boxes i have no doubt what most people would chose yeah its certainly understandable why they did it but bad for box hoarders like me p
great review while i admit i wasnt into technic at the time this came out i was a mere child give me a break d i can see now why it was featured so much from the booklets to display stands at toy stores and at my local lego center when it was still around this thing was everywhere with your review i can now truly appreciate all the details of the set i got to admit i can see the appeal now that comparison shot you took is amazing i love not only just how it included the little details such as the stabilizers but also looks incredibly fun to play around with great set and an even greater review

set ref 7624 name jungle duel number of minifigs 3 number of pieces 78 price 1190€ it’s the smaller set from the last indy movie “the kingdom of the crystal skull” here we go a general view of the set we have a tent some food  a chicken leg is always welcome a fireplace the things with all the swords a bench with a broken table 3 ants a map printed tile and other accessories don’t make that girl hungry or yyyyaaaaaaaahhhhhhh ho no our diner a giant ant has gone away those giant ants are made in a smooth plastic in dark red and trans black colour and here a closer view on the two new hairpieces the new girl hairpiece is really cute and i’m a bit disappointed by the new man hairpiece…those hair lake some volume… but i’m really happy to see that tlc has made some new moulds for hairpieces it’s the good part of the theatre lines so it’s a really interesting set because you’ve got a lot of useful pieces for a city mocers with the two new hairpieces without spending a lot of money edited by imperialshadows 01 june 2008  1159 am updated statstitle
the rancor on apr 15 2008 1011 pm said im pretty sure those ants are actually spiders i thought they were spiders before but when i saw them mentioned as ants i realised that they are definately ants being a big ant fan i recognise that they are not spiders  they look like ants too and they could be lifesize to some larger species yay ants and new hairpieces and accessories
the new man hair looks like a wig
thanks for this review alex54 this looks like a great set i love the new hair molds and faces plus al those extra pieces are fantastic batbrick away
i have no idea why they dont use that female hair piece on trixie in speed racer it would be perfect greta review
i love this set thanks for the reveiw probably the only indy 4 set ill get
great set ill definitely get it is there any sign of flesh on the soldiers like at the collars
nice little review here alex i like your idea to make the aquatic car into one for a geologist i really like the little details in this set such as the little petrol can and the propeller at the back of the car a must buy in my view thanks again
quote set ref 7625 name river chase i swear it is supposed to have stickers on the side of the car boat oil canister and windscreen i like this set looks brill
musthave
alex54 on apr 15 2008 1017 pm said i plan to use the outpost for my forest section and the amphibious vehicle is always a nice touch of originality in a layout yes you can use all those military things without creating an army in a layout just put the violent parts out and you’ve got nice things like a biologist car in the case of the amphibious vehicle or just put it up on blocks next to a trailer and youve got a nice trailertrash section of town steve
my favorite part of this is prob the amphibious vehicle looks really neat nice to see another different torso for marion
hmm im debating whether i should get this setgreat reveiw btw i love that dark green croc
shoc on apr 15 2008 1031 pm said is that a laptop its on does it come with the set yes its a laptop and it was in the set when i opened it i understood why this little box was so heavy asus is my official sponsor so i have to show the logo i have to add that i dont have put on the stickers
great review alex after seeing these pics im really looking forward to getting this set i really like how lego has designed the gas tank thats just so good finally a different shade of green for the croc its about time and more than welcome the vehicle looks good and a fun build though im not that fond of that commie tree
good
darthperson8 on apr 15 2008 0712 pm said what are those bricks with the guns attached supposed to be great review and set btw some people have obliquely mentioned this in their responses to the setreview but to specifically answer your question its supposed to be a jerrycan aka a gasoline petrol container
a very fine review of a really great set thanks alex this set has everything a croc very nice mfs a neat tree trap a cool zodiac and a marvelous and very detailed amphibious car in a beautiful color scheme the only thing i´m not colpletely sure is the design of that jerrycan thanks for the right word and the interesting link kingboy  although the use of the revolver´s pretty clever indeed and fits well too it´s still clearly well a revolver very unusual and interesting for an official tlc design
this set looks good about the jerry cans i like how they give me more pistols this may be the only indy set i get from this batch ill just have to deal with the fleshie heads exchange them for yellow like stealth hunter said this will be good for army building silent help
im glad they change the torso form the prototype
set ref 7626 name jungle cutter number of minifigs 4 number of pieces unknown price 3999€ a general view of the set we’ve got 5 giant ants two russian soldiers a general indy of course 3 trees a small entrance of a cave and the debroussaillor vehicle i don’t know the english name of it… you can’t enter into the cave because there is a spider web with its spider…unless… unless you know how the mechanism works and the spider web go up… and reveals a case with diamonds and accessories a closer view on the mechanism which is simple but works well and you can also see the difference or maybe the same size of a spider and a giant ant and i’ve always thought that those spiders were very big compared to the minifigs so those ants are really giant poor small frog the three trees with the entrance make a nice jungle layout don’t speak too loud you will wake up the soldier… don’t worry for him he will be waken up by the vehicle before being eaten by those giant ants a front view making the vehicle really menacing a back view push the red part from the back and there are two parts that fall down from the vehicle i don’t know why… the movie will clarify this i think… and here you can see how the two big circular blades turn when you push the vehicle… simple but effective run indy run this set is really nice the playability of the different elements is great the colour scheme is nice too i like those dark green tree parts the vehicle is really impressive without being too big and its very well details in general the designers of the indy sets have made a really nice works with a lot of efforts in all those details everywhere i’ve got some project for this set to integrate it in my city i’m a city mocer and not an indy fan so i don’t have bought the temple the bigger set of the series because it has nothing special for me in term of part selections or in the design in relation with the town theme and because my supermarket doesn’t have it yet so we are waiting for a member to review it and make the part 4…
this one is my favorite from the bunch thanks for the time spent in making a review
great review again alex  same question in case you didnt se it in my reply to the other set where did you get those new sets  i really love that set  its called jungle cutter the trees are really cool and make a great adition to it imo that temple entrance or monument is really cool  those bionicle parts do make fantastic vegetation  i totally forgot about that green frog  thats cool  those are so cute  5 more ants is great  the vehicle look really sharp ah ah ah 2 more commies yeay  that officer is really freaky actually  could have been a high rank under pol pots regime in the s21 yeay looks more asian than russian imo now its time for my grips  same bloody rant about indy   i havent read the instructions before but once again there are so many parts in crap colours that need to be changed look at all the crap red and yellow in there  i will need to look for those parts before buying the set like i always do  mod while building on  i am really soimpressed with that indy line  i sincerely hope it will have a long and healthy life 
trooperdavinfelth on apr 16 2008 0230 pm said responses to the yodameisters review of alex54s review of the jungle cutter are in red whats that funky name trooperdavinfelth on apr 16 2008 0230 pm said you mean the spiny dk green things that hang from the holes around the secret entrance they were in the indy temple escape yep indeed and i have that set if i remember correctly the first line to use it as vegetation is aqua raiders tiger shark attack 7773 trooperdavinfelth on apr 16 2008 0230 pm said any chance we could see the rpg why its just a flick fire missile in a wrench ill use my brickarms rgp which is way better ok so i just finished reviewing the instructions and look at the parts you need to just change the horrendous colours  damn its really getting worse and worse
looks great
what a marvelous diversity of plant parts very nice mfs and a cool and detailed harvester that conventionalized cave with its neat opening feature´s also very well done thanks for that fine review of a pretty cool set alex
this is the 3rd review that i had read its very tempting to fly over and get those sets from there because i may need to wait for some months before it arrived it seemed we will have a new small little creature to add into the ranks these red ants is cute and of course looks nasty too haha i love those trees foilage and plants very very much it can be used for my moc and is good for any green project related expansion i love it about the vehicle i find it abit wierd it seemed too big in the setup hehe but still i love this set mainly i will get it for the green parts
yay go dragon masters i have to agree with iamded i do like the black knights sets better for their design  betrayal  however the dragon knights are just awesome cause they have dragons this is a nice set with some awesome minifigs and a nice overall design i wish i had it go masters
great classic dragon den i love the old green dragons very much there were my fave i love these theme very much after the black knights era this is a very very good set i wished i can have this too
a very neat set with charming mfs and a great classic dragon a good use of burps and a really nice tree indeed thanks for the review agentrick57
the wizard somehow controls the dragons i think like for example the wizard of the new castle line does with the undead skeletons but i think it isnt sure that the dragon masters wizard is evil as it is still unclear which factions of the older castle series are good or bad
phoinix on 16 april 2008  0906 pm said this was the last castle set i got before my dark age really liked it although the big rock parts looked really bad  i am kind of used to them now unfortunately i lost the little wand and i never understood who is good and who is bad does the wizard own the dragon well they dont seem to be enemies but isnt the dragon supposed to be evil i always liked the burps i dont know why maybe because they were dark grey and dark grey pieces seemed a bit hard to come by at the time i always assumed that the dragon was sort of the mascot of the dragon masters the wizard was there to keep him under control so he wouldnt turn on them i always figured that the wizard was working with the dragon master king and they were fighting against the royal knights the dudes with the lion faces on their torsos or whatever they were called i like this set a lot i think the castle theme declined after the dragon masters and royal knights themes were discontinued the new knights never really took the cake its funny but it seems to me anyways that when the lego minifigs lost their regular smilesmirk faces whether they were masked by a beard or not thats when lego began to declinea bit the dragon masters had their vicious faces and all but they still had that smilesmirk underneath their rough exteriors the new knights look a littleless confident
the 8291 dirt bike comes from a long line of technic bikes and i think its the best ever it looks great and its fun to ride around in the house i hoped to find a figure the right size for it but none of mine would fit unlike a lot of technic models it looks good from all angles considering the size of the model it has a complicated way of connecting the engine to the wheel the rear shocks are just the right stiffness and they have a good amount of travel i thought these shocks were new i need to get out more functions shocks two front one stiffer one in the rear drivetrain 2 piston engine linked to the rear wheel via gears and a chainlink steering yes it does stand retractable for the price size and subject what else could be added 1010 parts considering that it has three shocks and a 40 chainlinks its a great set for parts some hard to use large parts are included but they are not overused the usage of the green does limit part usage somewhat though and ill be struggling to find a use for those wheels for anything other than a motorbike 810 price at 3999 aud for 248 parts it isnt the best value set the us price is 2500 which is somewhat better it does have some more complicated parts however 710 looks lego seems to be moving away from the seethough look for technic sets and this is a good example of it im not a big fan of fairings but i think they work great in this set as a fuel tank 810 fudge this set was great for me as i have never had a technic bike however for those that want this for just parts or have other bikes it could be a hard sell the alternate model a chopper is a complete rebuild which i didnt make and its great that lego have been including these most of the time lately 710 overall recommended 810
thanks for the great review sinner i like the technic bikes i wonder how it would look if you replaced the gear on the back wheel with a smaller one
simonwillems on may 17 2008 0630 pm said how did i manage to miss this review i must have overlooked it somehow you must have been ignoring me its been in my signature for weeks simonwillems on may 17 2008 0630 pm said it looks a lot like an upgraded version of one of the first bikes lego made namely the 8838 shock cycle i also believe the back gearwheel is somewhat oversized it looks better with the smaller one you attached yes it does seem to be a remake the shock cycle even has a dangly chain like my modded version as a set id prefer the old one due to the four indentical springs
sinner on may 18 2008 0518 am said you must have been ignoring me its been in my signature for weeks this is when shame kicks in
i wasnt very interested in this set at first it seemed to be just a nice looking truck with a small motor but when i found out it had a transmission i changed my mind here is the transmission it allows the single motor to be used for two functions this system has been around for a while and lego seem to be using it more and more the transmission driving ring alone the red circle goes for 515 usd on bricklink and you also need the catch and clutch gear so i have been buying sets that have them instead i now have enough parts to make a supercar gearbox i bet a new supercar comes out next year now this is the gear that rotates the arm note the colour of the 24 tooth gear it seems to be a new gear trend a lot of work has been put into this truck looking real personally i think they went too far as the truck seems to have been designed for a tilting cab but its disabled to prevent breaking the front bottom of the transmission the bottom shaft lifts the arm note that there are more dark grey gears the motor fits in very well also the bottom of the arm i was surprised by the usage of a 12 tooth bevel to link with the 36 tooth double bevel as i had never seen that done before as you can see there is no room for any drive train standard steering for a recent technic truck there is a handofgod at the cab top that links via two knob wheels it looks good from the back you can also see the white clutch that connects the transmission to the motor to avoid burnouts it goes decently high and can go a bit higher if you use the crane arm compared to last years fire truck if i didnt buy the fire truck for half price i would have been annoyed that lego brought out what is almost a motorised version of the same set functions cherry picker arm motorised rotate and lift that links to a motor via a transmission and antiburnout clutch steering rack and pinion controlled via a handofgod linked by knob wheels doors open and close good functionality that works well but i wish they made the cab lift and im a bit sick of the lame fairing door trick 710 parts motor battery box transmission clutch practical wheels only two fairings compact turntable this is a great parts set 1010 price at 9999 aud for 726 parts its ok value when you consider what you are getting the us price is 6000 which is better but still not great i bought mine for 80 aud which was good however and i suspect that the price is designed for easy sale810 looks id buy this for the looks alone 910 fudge the functions work well and i llked it more than i thought i would oddly mine seemed to be missing a axle pin with friction but since it includes extra parts for the alternate model i didnt mind using one of my spares on the subject of the alternate model it is a dump truck which is made out to be a total rebuild but it isnt it could have easily been done like super street sensation was but lego have probably determined that instructions like that confuse people 810 overall recommended 810
thank you for that fine review of a pretty cool and nice set with a very good amount of functionality and um playability for sure
thanks for the review i think i am going to get this set for its many technic pieces i could really use those for a rig im going to build
the figs look great the natives and the skeleton conquistador are my favorite figures in the set the set itself is very good the interior sort of reminds me of an older style lego set for some reason it could be just me but it has a classic feel this will a great set to add to my list great review so far anyway i only saw the back of the box edited by general zen 01 may 2008  0217 am
looks great i cantt wait until i can get my hands on this and the other new ij sets this is turning out to be a really good theme im really liking the crystal skulls and i also think the baseplate looks very nice those natives look fantastic in my opinion thanks for the great review edited by erdbeereis1 01 may 2008  0253 am
thanks for the reveiw it was a enjoyable and good one i really like this set too bad its beyond my price range i guess ill just get the smaler set what suprised me is that there is no giant ants im guessing you live in aus where did you get this set from
great indepth review svelte i love your cat  
i was going to review this on monday but my camera ran out of batteries anyways great review as i have the set built its a really fantastic set the waterfall is a reall cool sticker and the flick fire missiles are quite interesting another point of interest there are seven of the new flick fire missiles overall if anyone cares
nice review and your cat looks exactly like ours shame yoda aint around to review anymore though maiq runs off to the nearest tavern to drink away all thoughts of parson yoda yoda i dont know how to get drunk off soda but its possible me
great review thanks as i thought amazon did send out my preordered sets not until yesterday evening so i should receive them hopefully on monday or tuesday cant wait for them btw i wonder whats up with all these sticker leftovers in the indy setsthis hasnt been the case in any other set with stickers right edited by metalandi 03 may 2008  0156 pm
a very nice review of a very lovely indy set indeed thanks wilhelm screamer but you need for sure a better lighting for taking your pictures
while i truely fell in love one more time with the older lego city sets i thought why not make a review of one of the in my opinion greatest city sets of all time lets not talk too much here we go set nr 6395 name victory lap racetrack number of minifigs 13  number of pieces unknown release year 1988 starting with the beautiful old legoland box front back with some cool alternative models inside we continue with the great minifigs which are not less than 13 i dont think there is any city set with more figures is there civilians race crew  assistant personnel drivers all heres a overview of the whole set the rescue rig dont exactly know how to call it with trailer the score board  traffic lights which would be one of the details i love the most about this set the next sweet detail the camera  cameraman of course we have a doc if there is some kind of accident the pit stop boxes i love the small toolholder with the axle and wheel behind it the control room high above the racetrack ready to go that was it all in allall i can say is if you see this set anywhere on ebay ore somewhere else get it
ahhhh back in the days when shell was the racing fuel of choice before that octan company came to town bought off the old shell execs and ran them out of town on a rail but i digress i always liked the look of the set but at the time could not work out where i would be able to fit it into my town
thank you for the nice review metalandi and thank you for the nice story and selfpromotion simon willems the racewaytracks were always nice dioramas in the catalogues of the eighties
i can remember when i saw this set in lego catalogues looking at it dreamin to have it like so many other sets and this one is still a dream i really like the design of this set it looks really complete with some nice details there are no lost place the strairs withe the foot bridge add a lot to it imo looking at the pics ive got a question  is the rescue rig trailer one piece or is it brick build
hello all i dont believe there has been a review of this set yet so i wanted to take this opportunity up for review today is 8160 cruncher block and racer x as part of batbrick and iamded reviews here is the box i have to say i love the art on it its very colourful and makes the truck look a lot less crap than it does on the box plus you have to love the missile launching action bit right am i right why are you all staring at me and here is the back pretty generic but shows some nice details and so forth oh dear in turning around the box have i killed myself and iamded okey dokey up first is the best part of the entire set the minifigs racer x is wonderful though coming with a boring bruce wayne face but it is cruncher block his lady driver taejo that really shine look at those awesome suits the cool faces taejo has a ripped shirt now up is the first building part of the set with me and iamded looking rather slick in xs car while im not a big fan of yellow it is very nice and slopes in an underused colour is better than no slopes at all front view the new windshields are fantastic while a very cool car it is rather silly of tlc to give us the exact same one we got in the smaller set i didnt get the smaller set with this car so im still happy but it is a bad marketing move sorry iamded i know its your birthday butvroom now for the second part of the build and my favourite the front of the truck annoyingly enough this part opens up to shoot a pointless rubber projectile to do this you open the roof a nice detail btw and pull back the mechanism here thus blowing the front part open and launching itwell not far really the wheels and covers are pretty cool and the front is nicely designed the red looks good and the rear vision mirrors are a great touch and now for the most disappointing part  step three the trailer note  clicky joint piece not part of set just used to hold it up thats right almost the entire thing is open even the filled in side has holes id certainly be cared to be back there one bumpy hill and back you go i didnt put the lame computer stickers on and the control area is pretty lame in general not to mention taejo who is depicted on the boxart as standing at the desk would most likely just be sucked out the back at those speeds there are some pluses too though like the ridiculously awesome minifig paintings ill be using for wayne manor also note the control on crunchers desk that when turned turns the gun at the bottom its an alright feature here is an example ive shot iamded on his birthday what its a love ray havent you seen the care bears and though im not a massive fan of stickers this is just too cool the little aquarium is very simple but very clever using a printed piece between two clear windows to create the illusion of a tank it looks much better in real life trust me and here is a side view to better explain now to connect the two is a good thing i like the way a simple technic piece assumes the job oh and behold my hand the completed truck which while a mixed bag still doesnt look too bad i guess now the completed set which despite its unbelievable large flaws still looks cool warning the kickass iamded and batbrick figures do not come with this set more pics here httpwwwbrickshelycgii3147324 all in all minifigs 55  racer x is beautiful cruncher block and the driver too and taejo has a ripped shirt damn design 25  pretty poor considering the best part is available in a cheaper set and only the front part of the truck looks cool but still not truly awful build 35  despite having a bad trailer it was a fun build and sometimes you need something that doesnt take ages to make price 25  overpriced easily but rogue shadow is worse fun 35  the mere concept of such an open truck kept me playing with this baby for hours total 1525 not as bad as it would seem overall im really glad i bought it as the minifigs are fantastic and the paintings and fish tank are cool its fun stupid and downright ridiculous but while not a great set by any means certainly isnt as bad in the brick as it looks in photos until next time batbrick away edited by batbrick 13 june 2008  1220 pm
ill be passing on this set thanks for the review anyway is everyone supposed to be bald in the film it looks weird
batbrick thanks for the sweet review you give me great insights into this set hehe i agreed that racer x is nice but i believe we can get it in the other set for a much lower price for me the trailer which does not have a cover is bugging me alot thats why i holding my reservations against this set at most i will consider the other 2 smaller sets for collection purpose nevertheless batbrick great job
thanks for the review my wife wanted me to buy this for the fishtank and i came close untimately this set didnt offer many good part to me so i bought the smaller set with the same car the trailer is just too insubstantial
thank you for the nice review
i really like this set my favorite parts are the minifigs and xs car vrooom
i enjoyed the review some cool fleshie heads and parts but it does seem a bit lamer even than i imagined from the box the airy truck is rather slyly disguised on the box art i would like to get it if it is ever on sale 50 off would be nice  speed racer lego doesnt seem to be selling too well in local shops here
hi all newly arrived today dont you just love shop at home thought id give it a quick review see more details over at my site the tumbler jokers ice cream suprise
the batman minifig have a detailed and cool torso thanks for the review brickbitz edited by darkrebellion 16 may 2008  0731 pm
nice review brickbitz i actually think this kit is really very nice for the size true you only get three figures but it seems thats a norm in most batman sets besides everything else is great the tumbler looks like an amazing build  they really nailed this tank of a ride and the ice cream truck plus this set does seem to have some neat pieces in it trans green popsicles and lime hubcaps anyone i think this far beats the rest of the batman lineup this year which seems quite disapointing overall edited by grevious 16 may 2008  0812 pm
ronan nissen on may 16 2008 1005 pm said oh wait is that torso dark grey or light grey its definitely dark grey
trooperdavinfelth on may 16 2008 1111 pm said although i know you dont take many pictures in your reviewsimho  but can we see a little more about the tumbler ill get some set up tomorrow in better light to be honest there isnt a lot to see most of it is just basic technic blocks underneath with all the slopes built up on top
nice review i really cant believe that it is out already i love that new batman suit and the tumbler have they made the posicles before this is sure a must have
the tumbler is massive ill struggle to fit it into the cave but never mind the figs are nice the tumbler is pretty accurate or at least it will be after ive moded it and jokers tainted ice cream van is so very joker thanks for the review btw
excellent review dunamis this set looks great the designers really though the kit out it seems the internal organs have got to be my favorite part but everything is good now all we need is a ucs obiwan with a laser pistol to finish off grievous in a totally anticlimatic way
hey dunamis think you can get a straighton shot of the face the red pieces inside the eye sockets are topped with transgreenishyellow studs which make his face look eerily alive and very close to his screen appearance its a nice little detail that seems to not show through on pictures ive seen of the set the legs are a little wobbly im scared that hell be leaning too far forward in about 5 years
dunamis on may 17 2008 0458 am said any silly me in my first set of photos above i never folded in his ribcage you guys gotta call me out on these things you forgot to add the stickers to the chest plates too jeremy
dunamis on may 16 2008 0701 pm said two parts technic and one part human one part kaleesh actually
legoscum on may 17 2008 0403 pm said you forgot to add the stickers to the chest plates too jeremy yeah i know i mentioned it in the review that i completely blew past the other two stickers if you look closely you can see that the big grievous nameplate sticker is offcenter as well me and stickers dont get along
great review very detailed indeed
nice review i hope to get this set for my birthday
hi all again another one of todays special deliveries i think personally this set is great mars mission is really finding its feet 7646 etx alien infiltrator
thanks for the review that makes me wanting this set even more
thanks for the review brickbitz i dont normally come into the space forum but this set it tempting me on the basis of you review i think i might aquire one at some point
damn i was just about to post a review on this heres the infiltrator with the nice shiny holographic stickers attachment2232marsmistortinyjpg edited by the rancor 18 may 2008  1259 pm
the rancor on may 18 2008 0138 pm said damn i was just about to post a review on this why not multiple reviews´re doing no harm and it´s always interesting to see reviews with a perhaps different point of view too
lol your sig is awesome the little power suit is well done i would like to see articulation some how jammed into the little legs though and we all now exoforce 4 finger hands would look great on his arms edited by rayskull 18 may 2008  0451 pm
thanks for the review nice little set and its around 2000
my first impression upon seeing this set was no thanks but now im warming up to it still ill skip it if it interferes with my hypersonic operations aircraft fund p
thanks for the excellent review oky judging by this set the line is going to be promising i really like the figs and im glad to see that robot arm is actually a new arm mold awesome can a minifig hand fit in the end or just the chainsaw attachment could it fit an exoforce robot claw theres a lot of detail in the torsos and i like that the agents suit is like a motocross uniform i love that the snowmobile has a working tread copmike ras and i tried to build a snowmobile with working treads but we ended up using chainsaw blades in the end great work oky
this is much much much more promising than the 2008 batman set for 1000 the vehicle looks like someone took time to design it but the batman one looks like  lego dear lego where is the quality for batman i really like the new cyborg arm and the propellers on that thing   it is a really promising line although i would get rid of all those bionicle pieces
this set looks wicked thanks very much for the sweet review oky wan the pics are perfect great quality and the perfect size well done this sets got everything a new hairpiece tank treads a gem well i could go on but you can all see everything from the great pics thanks again oky this is one set ill definately be getting peace
oky wan thanks for this wonderful review i really have mixed feelings towards agents set haha but i love the agent minifigure the doublesided face is great and i love the sunglass look its nice that they made use of mutts hairpiece which is personally my fave hairpiece at the moment the jetpack is neat making use of the additional secure backing onto the minifig is really very smart
nice first review oky wan  i´d say this is better than we first thought the minifigs looks cool and the overall look is ok and the excaustpipe is a new peace also i think agents on copmike
is there any chance u could post pics of the comic and the box i love legos box art and instruction art
thanks for a very good review agent line seems better all the time looking forward in seeing review on mission 2 gold chase and new pictures of the jet really soon
they are already on the shelfs thats kinda weird since there arent even the instructions online yet
thank you
thanks for the review do i see a little indy hint on that map oh and btw the map looks like it actually is printed am i right
looks good and ill bet that jaw and wire could be used for lots of mocs is this the only agents set that contains the wire while im here i got the third mission would anyone like a review of that faramir
not many words this time but as they say a picture is worth a thousand words  and your pictures are lovely once again agents is turning out to be a cooler and cooler theme with each new review this set looks like an awesome parts pack and i love the bike btw anyone else notice the possibly accidental reference to alpha team agent charge is back it looks edited by grevious 21 may 2008  0905 pm
wow great review for a really great looking set the pieces like the minifigs and crocs are very nice but that map is reeaally cool for an aztecmayainca fan like me i will definately buy this set when it is available in england grevious on may 21 2008 1004 pm said btw anyone else notice the possibly accidental reference to alpha team agent charge is back it looks yeah i thought that then i thought nah he looks different but i remember that the characters in alpha team did change their looks a lot throughout the years being spies and that edited by shoc 26 may 2008  1037 am
great little set nice to have a small building instead of all vehicles plant pieces and dark green crocs always welcome good parts selection for the price thanks for the review cant wait till we can get our hands on these
like all the others except the truck this set is great love the figs and the green crocidiles
great looking set i’m determined to get all the agent sets this summer comments swamp towerthe barbed wire is cool but it seems like it’s only for looks bikecool looking but doesn’t seem to have any controls cybercrocswow haven’t seen any of these pieces for a while and in dark green awesome agent chargesweet head definitely cool break jawhe looks like the result of some animal testing on humans gone horribly wrong i hope they come out near me soon
sirnadroj on may 21 2008 0836 pm said agent charge looks like indy with roid rage sirnadroj on may 21 2008 0836 pm said treasure map nice map is it a sticker or printed steve
why do all of the reviews that we have for agents sets have the agents getting hurt is this a new trend plus unibrow man doesnt have a unibrow his eyebrows are really close together and bushy
very nice review riddler
thanks for an interesting review theriddler the set´s cheap and very useful to get two fantastic mfs a great mr freeze and a very cool new batman but i have to say that these two small vehicles just look plain ugly imho without any inspiration nor orginality sorry tlc but you can for sure do better than that and even with less pieces
nice review thanks i really like those little gokart thingies theyve got a fantastic mario kart look to them
thanks for the review ill probably get one copy of this set mr freeze and his cart look neat i dont like the huge wing on the back of batmans buggy so ill probably mod that out
quote but i have to say that these two small vehicles just look plain ugly imho without any inspiration nor orginality indead the only reason to get this set is if you couldnt afford the batcave back in 2006 and want a mr freeze fig for a cheap price and anyone who did get that kit really have no reason whatsoever to get this wait did i forget something oh yeah  thanks for the review riddler edited by grevious 22 may 2008  1154 pm
thanks for the review for such a high price that we need to fork out compared to a total pieces of 76 its is very expensive to pay for such poor design but then i will still considered to get them as what sinner had said this is a very good way to get mr freeze without getting the batcave and it so happened that i do not have the batcave too i believed that is the cheapest set among the four so for the minifigs only this set is recommended other than that i am sorry
thanks for the review theriddler this is a neat little set a bit overpriced in my opinion but for a new suited batman and a mr freeze fig in a set other than one of the most expensive batsets released its worth my money peace
wowie im glad you like it maby il do the tumbler also but soon the batcycle and the scuba also come
neat little set i do like the parts a number of hard to find bits all in one pack depending on how much it costs in usd ill have to consider it and while the buggy designs kinda suck im a little happy to see them its been years since tlc made any small go kart style vehicles i guess tiny turbos have been overshadowing that market
the pics as promised extra part
in actuality i think that this may be my favorite batman set of all time i know i know  its a small set with crappy tiny vehicles so it probably sucks for the fan who likes to display sets but look at the mocing side and you see this set has a ton of potential new batman fig well mainly the torso but it looks nice sleek and armored a definite plus whether youre a mocist or batfan mr freeze because nobody bought the batcave when they should haveand by nobody i mean me plus i love that head cheapest way to amass the lightning piece the other sets that have it are lolhueg well not really but i dont have 50 to toss around on a little skeleton tower and its a great piece two little blue gems i may be alone on this but those are my favorite parts the gems and thats my favorite color for them 3 3 3 several other useful parts including a o piece in black some lightmedium blue bits from mr freezes kart the oddly placed grappling hook and some cheap wheels now i dont know about you guys but this is as close to a batman battlepack as were going to get lol  im buying at least three maybe more once i get my summer job  oh and the fact that the us price is only 10 helps a little but this year you guys cant complain  you got practically every set first especially the new castle tt trexxen
looks cool one of the best in this line cant wait for review
deinonychus on may 23 2008 1012 pm said pics and thoughts tomorrow i picked up this set earlier in the week and was quite pleased with it in fact i have missions 15 and am happy with all of them  this series is much better than the old alpha team ever was i look forward to reading your thoughts on it i will say 2 things about it now though 1my set came with defective instructions in 2 places pages are missing and duplicates of other pages repeated for instance the car instructions are missing steps 1621 fortunately i was able to make out what pieces went where in the missing steps by studying the illustration in step 22 i hope you have better luck with your instructions 2this set contains the best lego sound brick ever its just begging to be incorporated into my arkham asylum
mr mandalorian on may 24 2008 1158 am said what is a sound brick ditto maybe its like the exoforce lightup brick only with sound instead of light that would kick innapropriate word deleted
great review deino man that car is just so beautiful and the helicopter is nice too unfortunately this seems pretty pricy and i hardly think ill be getting it any time soon what with my limited budget and all still its great to see how well agents is shaping up
thanks for the review deino i love going back through the old agents thread just to see how wrong we were about these awesome sets i actually really like the gate those portcullis pieces people may know i always find nice uses for and i really really really want that awesome sound brick the figs are a bit disappointing in numbers but agent chase is very cool generic henchman are great and spy clops is one of my favourite minifigs ever the helicopter is wonderful too i love that it is customised for spy clops to winch him down the colours as usual for these sets are fantastic the dark blue orange and chrome silver the car is the best though i love all the functions how does the ejector seat work though batbrick away
thanks for the awesome review deinonychus this really is a sweet set a bit expensive a set for me as i only get the cheaper noncastle sets which is a shame because i love that head it would be great for some more cyborg troops the car is awesome i didnt expect it to have that many silver parts thats fantastic heaps of play features too that ejector seat mechanism sounds interesting thanks again for the sweet review peace
deinonychus on may 23 2008 0912 pm said the rear has two cones sticking out id like to think theyre smoke nozzles or oilslick sprayers according to page 14 of my brickmaster magazine the left cone is for smoke screen and the right cone is for oil slick
wow great review thanks this set looks absolutely great but im afraid of the price oh weel ill just get the 2 smaller ones im really liking this theme well done tlg
esjpg 4794k 110 downloads the ejector seat a long technic axle runs the length of the front of the car it comes in to the seat area here and nests into the gray joint which is attached to the small gray technic beam the beam is attached to the ejector seat bottom white 3x2 plate with a technic pin the seat in turn is attached to the side of the car with a technic pin the result is when the axle is pushed forward the gray joint and beam tilt the seat and eject a minifig after about 20 shots the minifig only went outside of the car 3 timesthe rest of the time he just bounced around the inside of the car so they get an a for effort but an f for execution
thanks for your great review it looks very nice indeed the gate have very interesting mechanism the car looks very slick and cool it looks like those typical kind of james bond car this review gives me very good insights
great review thanks for sharing
hello all eurobricks members i will present to you a very short review on the recent castle battlepacks this time i will be reviewing skeleton battlepack and i hope everyone of you do enjoy viewing it this was a request that put up by hollisbrick in the castle thread initally i thought it was a very simple set to do a review however for the love of castle i decided to whip this up for every castle fan out there this is an image of how the skeleton battlepacks look like i have bought 12 last packs of these in total so far but none of the crown battlepacks yet there were snapped much faster that i imagined do pardon me for the poor lightning today is a bad weather its hard to get natural light the skeleton gang for a single battlepack like this with an attractive reasonable price you obtained a series of 5 skeleton minifigs with tons and tons of useful castle accessories to me its a very very great buy and its a must to stock up for my army building some addons however i was not very satisfied with my skeleton armies standards therefore i decided to make some slight modifications with some additional castle accessories that is stocked in my castle warehouse after the makeover ok this is what i called a real skeleton army this is mainly my opnion and it have to be aligned with my standards i felt this improved battlepack gives a punch to the exisitng battlepack the two soliders on the right is able to align with the rest of my castle chess sets armies while the one on the left it gives me a great archer back up with the quiver and helmet attached to him the ones on the center especially the armored guard which equipped with the black nose cone helmet is my fave it is able to illustrate the elite among the rest of the guards with its armor and helmet which was featured in my castle deep forest expansion moc promotion on in addition the one which was hastly done with a modify mace it looks rather simple in time to come i will change it and gives a better equipment and look these are the remains i can use the axe for my dwarf in my dwarf mine defender in that set there is no weapon for my dwarf and i have to get it from other sets the rest of the accessories makes a very good stock up for future upgrading overall 910 this is not a playset it is mainly bought for its abilty to mass recurit any armies and is a main love for all castle army builders such as me this set mainly have no major faults and i love it so much although i have done some slight modifciations but this set is a must for me to buy more and more meanwhile i will need to wait for the next shipment hope everyone have enjoying viewing this simple review of mine edited by whitefang 25 may 2008  1252 pm
thanks whitefang castle battle packs simply wonderful finally a dream came true well done tlc
sdpirate on may 26 2008 1040 am said no offence make this 799 can too expensive to be coming with only a few figures 20 earns you the same amount of figs plus a catapult barricade two horses and a jousting divider are you refering to these following sets both these sets adds up to 1800 cad and the skeleton pack have the same price of 1800 cad prices quoted from sh i understand that 7009 and 7090 offers more pieces horses and same amount of minifigs compared to a typical battlepack imo i feel that all 3 sets are all army building sets 7009 offer small catapult 3 minifigs a skeleton white horse 7090 offer a joust divider weapon rack good accessories 2 minifigs a horse with barding and a skeleton black horse these sets have different purpose for me buying multiples of 7009 is to build its catapult white skeleton calvaries while 7090 is to build on crown calvaries and black skeleton calvaries however battlepacks have a different agenda it offered some castle accessories that is not available commonly for a castle army builder like myself castle accessories are always in demand the black robe silver armor silver shortaxe are not very common castle accessories it can be used as a good stock up too i am not saying this battlepack is an one way solution to solve everything thats why different sets are released to target on different purposes
whitefang although i realize that the battle packs are great specifically for building armies and castle accessories which is why its such a shame that i wont be able to buy these things  while sdpirates sets are more for a catapult calvary whatever the fact to the matter is with the battle pack you get 5 minifigs with lots of accessories while with the sets that sdpirate showed us you get 5 minifigs with an okay amount of accessories 3 horses including two skeleton ones a ballista a weapons rack and a jousting barricade you cannot say that the battle pack contains the same amount of stuff that the other two sets have and therefore should be priced the same it just seems that lego is ripping off canadian army builders to me if the battle pack contained a small catapult or wall so that it contained about the same amount of stuff that the other sets had it would be fair it seems stupid that you will only get minifigs from one set while you can get about the same amount of minifigs plus a bunch of other stuff from two other equally priced sets that’s why to me these battle packs are a rip off because of what they contain imho the battle packs seem to be only worth about 10 dollars
thanks for the review whitefang your additions look great i like your mace much better than the use of a small technic cog your looks much sturdier and that helmet looks really great on skellie soldiers i never thought to use that before very cool indeed peace
sorry to be going a little off topic here but personally i have just bought 40 crowny battle packs for the only reason that i am running out of space to store the left over blocks about 500 of my crownies came from sets mentioned above on sale which would have been cheaper than the battle packs thanks for the review whitefang but i dont think i will be buy any skeleton battle packs that army is large enough
thebrickster on may 28 2008 0121 pm said for those of you who buy so many of this and the other battle pack with crownies what do you do with all of them is this simply to create a largescale army or do you plan to build large castle scenes with all the figs id love to see some pictures on the share your castle army thread i am a army builder and hope one day to make large scale castle battle scenes time is a huge factor at the moment i have to work so hard to pay for all thislol there is a queens birthday holiday coming up on the 9th of june here in australia thats the deadline i have given myself you will definately see my army in the share your castle army thread thats the beauty of the battle packs the figures come armed
i dont think these new skeletons do it for me but thanks for a good review
ive always wanted to see this set closeup voltio thanks for sharing the image review this is the only jungle adventurers set i dont have and its got some great unique pieces esp those leaf brick pieces whats great is theyre not stickers this is a really a nice review of a neat set with the extra little humor you shared thanks again for taking the time to photograph and share over eb
im gonna start searching ebay
great review i just barly missed the jungle series growing up with half a year of jungle and mainly orient expedition and dino island i like egypt more but this set despite the 4x4 palm tree is practically perfect i love the detail and vibrant colours gotta say ive got a thing for pippin reed myself by the way what does vhtf mean edited by sdpirate 28 may 2008  0106 am
vhtf very hard to find to answer some earlier replies no there are no stickers in this set while some adventurers sets of the era had stickers the 5956 zeppelin had tons all of the interesting mesoamerican designs from this set are printed also simonwillems was correct my mechanic is missing his hat which should be a black kepi theyre extremely expensive on bl though proving once again that this set has some awesome parts so i ordered a replacement from lego its in the mail and should come soon
the printed pieces are the real gems of this set beyond them there isnt much to this set though the boat hull is nice the model itself isnt all that great the new akator temple is definately a superior model at least in piece count but those printed pieces are hard to resist steve
athos on may 28 2008 0747 pm said the printed pieces are the real gems of this set beyond them there isnt much to this set though the boat hull is nice the model itself isnt all that great the new akator temple is definately a superior model at least in piece count but those printed pieces are hard to resist steve i have to agree too few pieces for such a high price but amazing figs too and a nice baseplate despite a 4 palm tree you get more palm tree leaves for mocs plus i think a monkey and that sweet achu figure
i just rebuilt this entire set today and the nostalgia was totally worth taking bits and pieces from a few of my own mocs only now did i realize how rare some of those pieces are and im rather thankful that i have all of the printed pieces and achu the only pieces i am missing is a transparent orange headlight 3 out of 4 black minifigure hammer light gray chainreplaced it with a dark gray chain and one whole minifigure which is the mechanic guy i still have both the instructions and the box and both are in appalling conditions kudos to the pre2000s lego sets like this one love em
great review voltio i never actually owned this set but my friend does he gave me some of the peices but he burnt the base dont know why
i recommend this lil set its a nice small set and the vehicle does roll well im sure many young builders would love it
donneyboy on nov 27 2008 0840 pm said i might buy a second one of that set and build it in the bag i just wanna prove that it is possible i bought 4 myself its like having a little beach fleet
wow i was skeptical of this coast guard line though getting to see some detailed pictures of this set i really want to get get it alas i have not the money to get it and it isnt available in my town oh well maybe i can catch it on a sale at some point good review
great reveiw this is definatly one of the cg sets im geting i cant wait to get my hands on this set
great review 5150 lego the new camera was well worth it you´ve got everything well done i´m looking forward to your next review meschepers on may 27 2008 0622 am said wow i was skeptical of this coast guard line though getting to see some detailed pictures of this set i really want to get get it same here maybe in two days i can see it in real
great review 5150 although you might want to resize your pictures before posting them so they dont take forever to load quote wow i was skeptical of this coast guard line i was actually the complete opposite ever since i saw the first pictures i fell in love with the whole line the helicopter looks to be one of the two best in the line right up with the 4wd and jetski great job tlc and i do hope you have something equally as great planned for next year
very nice job on the review 5150 i definitly like this set much better now that i have seen good pics of it i am definitly picking this up as soon as i can again great review  model on
thank you for that fine review of a really excellent set 5150 lego i never saw a little juniorization done that good before
nice review the helicopter reminds a sikorsky chopperisnt it
oky wan kenobi on may 30 2008 0919 pm said but i have some questions about the grey new parts in the life raft are they 1x1 like their counterparts with the clips or 1x2 and can they be held by a minifig by the handle  btw which jedi has an orange eta 2 i guess it should work with mfs hmm i think it´s count citrus
thanks for the review this set looks great and i really wish i had the money to buy the entire line but unfortunately i dont i love the way tlc used the wing parts to the jedi interceptor for the life raft  very well thought of anyhow great review
what an outstanding copter i love it the orange looks fantastic this is probably legos best copter to date thanks for sharing the review i would definately recommend that you downsize your pictures a bit though

great review theriddiler is that a new batman torso edited by oli212lego 28 may 2008  1213 pm
this looks like the best of the new bat sets it was also in the movie dont know why they didnt make it sooner
thanks for the nice review theriddler a neat and funny ice cream truck and a pretty detailed yet perhaps a little big tumbler an overall cool set for sure
the stickers ruin the tumbler but the truck is very good if it was cheaper id get it
i am gonna have to pick this up what a grand representation of the tumbler and it would be my first joker minifigure my lego batlife is looking up tnr
looks like a nice set thanks for the review i cant get over how enormous the tumbler is they should have made it smaller the price too i fthey did that and threw in a dark knight joker and henchman i would totally buy it enjoy your new set darthperson
thanks for the review theriddler i am going to see if this set is at meijer and i will buy it if it is and i am reviewing the harley truck right now and i will post a review later
sinner on may 28 2008 0235 pm said care to explain why the mcm has a pure weight of parts that i find hard to quantify but love it is just so dense when you build it full of nice surprises no technique required and a wonderful stearing mechanism that i rank as more important than the suspension of the mars version this thing was meant to crush anyway who needs suspension i also like the way you never felt that the mtrons deserved a base after building this it was that good the colour scheme was perfect its space and i like it enough said great review btw god bless nathan naturally youre entitled to your inferior opinion
thanks for those wonderful pictures and congrats i think buying this on ebay was a good decision i have no mtron sets at all but i like the mcm very much its just a wonderfully big set with many nice detials lots of playing possibilities i wish i had it too
i love the design of the front canopy of this set but i always felt that they could have done more with the rest of the model this set is good candidate for customization though there is quite a bit on unused space inside especially in the middle section i want to try putting a technicstyle engine into mine at some point along with the necessary gearing i got my mcm brand new off ebay some years ago for a pretty good price but the box was very worn out and the big transneon panel which floats freely inside the box was a bit damaged as for the hosejetpack things i always assumed that they were either welding torches or flamethrowers take your pick quote kinda sad to think that with tlcs recent ban on magnets in their products first time ive heard of that what are they going to do for the train couplings
fluyt on may 28 2008 0156 pm said since when is that the new train couplings have magnets only with a special casing youre right i should have clarified  its the old loose magnets that apparently are being discontinued not all magnets altogether as you noted the new train couplings still have magnets but they appear to be permanently attached to a fairly large housing which i guess will prevent kids from eating them but the old mtron round magnet pieces are presumably discontinued
thanks for that fine review of a really classic and impressive mtron set inertia tohst on may 28 2008 0455 pm said the mm armored drilling unit has a more technic base giving it a less solid appearance  yeah it´s pretty sad some of these new sets just look very cool at the outside but appear to be hollow and blank at the inside especially with the annoying use of studless technic beams to mod these sets often means to change the whole inner frame leaving us with a bunch of imho not really very useful parts it´s not a very honorable marketing strategy to produce set designs that´re aimed to look impressive and cool on the box art but´re pretty useless in their inner structures of course i don´t want to offend some technic lovers and although i always was more the system kind of guy why can´t they just use some technic beams with studs at least i grew up with just imagine with pictures of alternative models on the box and i don´t think it´s that easy especially for younger kids to mod some of these terrific blownup sets like it once was with sets like this one here implosion off
this super set contains many of the city sets you can get for your mini city hospital the smallest set is the 7902 car with a doctor i thought it looked a bit too slow here is a car you can build with the same bricks the instruction manual for the ambulance does contain a picture of an alternate model but it is actually quite hard to build something significantly different this sets lacks some snotbricks so i had to be a little more creative and came up with this ambulance it is more a hearse than an ambulance the helicopter has a lot of slopes so i built a speed boat for those special emergencies unlike the first two sets i used far from all the bricks in this this set does really have some great parts the brickshelf gallery with some more pictures is anyone up to the challenge and build some alternate models of the last set in the super pack  the hospital
brilliant a huge amount of creativity there to do what you did with such limited piece counts is exceptional theyre at least as good as most of the alternate models lego show on sets
why
what a showman guess you have to get in before someone else does the review looking forward to the review
i scream clone on may 29 2008 0100 am said guess you have to get in before someone else does the review you got it more then a few times ive gotten halfway through the whole photo editing and writing process only to see someone else post something before im fully done so ive learned to call dibs
darn i was going to review this set i gues my review will be second
reviewhurry quick youve got us on the edge of our seats with suspense
thanks deino btw i told my psychiatrist to send you the bill
the 08 batman sets look like a step up from the somewhat lackluster 07 sets this looks like a very fun set with a whimsical sense of style very fitting with harley quinns character the price isnt great but i guess you gotta pay for that batman logo on the downside  i am so over the good buy vehicle vs bad guy vehicle concept i really wish tlc would get over this you see it throughout the product line  batman castle mission to mars etc
thanks for the review great set definitely the first of the batman sets ill be getting i love the truck and the batbike isnt as bad as i thought it was a win for me batbrick away
this set looks really fun the figs are sweet cant wait to see that jester in the flesh of course the jester im talking about is the castle one but that doesnt mean harley isnt a sweet fig thanks for that awesome review deinonychus peace
brickadier general on may 29 2008 0727 pm said hi all so i was at the walmart yesterday and had the munchies and was looking for something to eat somewhere along the line i stopped caring about food and decided to browse the toy department to see what they had legowise thank you very much for that neat review brickadier general  i´m glad that you changed your mind a review of a burger wouldn´t be half that interesting for sure it´s just a mediocre set to me but of course it´s always cool to get important mfs in less pricy sets i like the penguin´s sub from the batcave more just because they did a fine job on resembling a penguin without using a sticker robins craft looks fairly nice but the most useful parts of the whole set for me personally would be those indeed very neat green engines
thanks  why isnt this set on sh who wants the second riddle
looks like a cool set but the hairpiece for robin is vary disapointing i would be so glad is they used the regular hair you see all the time i hope lego will not make a habit of using that hairpiece on other figures
axle on may 30 2008 0330 pm said the only problem i see with the boxart is that the penguin is drowning is not he just received underwater breathing superpowers and and oh well  speaking seriously great review btw  thanks  one question the teeth are printed on the sticker arent they  and are not on the box  good day gentlemen 
set 8635  agents  mobile command center pieces 1154 price us8999 those dedicated agents theyve fought chainsawarmed villains battled radiocontrolled cyborg crocs chased pallets of badlystored golden loot and wrestled killer sharks with vicious toothy grins finally theyve caught the notorious dr inferno and imprisoned him in their cavernous mobile command center but dr inferno wont go down without a fight can the agents stop the evil dr disco inferno fleeing will spy clops laser gun burn through the door in time or will dr inferno simply use the lovely agent traces enormous ponytail as an escape ladder to freedom more importantly will there be a riot in the streets of lego city as afols go apopletic at the thought of a 12 wide truck roaring through their ordered town layouts stay tuned part 1 the box instructions parts as the largest of the agents sets so far the box is easily the biggest trainee agents examine the following three pics and see if you notice anything odd box front box back box middle spot it thats right the printed cardboard which has supposed to be the bottom half of the fold out middle section is on the back slicing the ultralarge set image which would form the foldout in half  the way the cardboard is printed as one piece before its folded i think this would be very hard to do accidentally so suspect a major stuffup somewhere along the production line i bought this set off bricklink so would be very interested if anyone in the states who has seen these boxes actually on the shelves can tell me if this is common or rare basically i want to know if i should be annoyed that the bricklink seller didnt list this in the set description or are they all like this the instructions come in 4 booklets the parts list comes in at 5 pages which is a lot even at halfsize pages  large images of the parts inventory are in this folderwhen moderated for anyone interested heres also some cute agentstype artwork at the end of one of the books instructions show piece callouts and are divided into sections according to numbered bags as youd expect for a set with 1100 parts this baby comes with a lot of bags its a treasure trove of dark blue as well as the obvious large slopes and wall panels which make up the body and the roof there is a wealth of smaller navy blue pieces as well  small 1x1 bricks 2x2 bricks 1x1 plates 2x2 tiles heaps of 2x plates some slopes 22x cheese pieces basically anyone wanting a lot of dark blue should think about this set the roof panels alone for example could provide a dark blue sea for a modernised pirate moc 2 dsss dreaded sticker sheets quelle surprise  stickers the grey parts of the stickers here are metallic silver ink which is a nice touch actually as sticker sheets go theyre not too bad fairly subtle for the most part and the navy blue actually matches the bricks themselves however after looking at the sticker sheets i thought i was missing something what about the pieces used for the projection screens showing dr inferno and the sharks  why werent they on the sticker sheets there must be another one frantically i checked and rechecked the box and flipped through all the instruction manuals to find the elusive 3rd sheet where was it ten minutes later i noticed something which had honestly never occured to me  there were actual printed pieces in this set so obvious and yet so unthinkable its horrifying how years and years of exoforce and speed racer set releases can mentally condition peoples thought processes tut tut lego what have you reduced us to here they are folks  actual printed pieces yes i do believe this news deserves the caps i also noticed this nifty modification of the usual 2x3 cupboard  you can now fit drawers in it very clever this may have been around in belville sets for years for all i know but its new to me the drawers slide in and out very well and the top one sits on slight indentations in the middle of the cupboard part 2 the figs our trusty agents  charge chase trace and fuse high powered agents dont have time for names of more than one syllable  thats why the bad guys always lose  chase and fuse have the mutt hair in black and dark orange the lovely agent trace has an exquisite new hairpiece in dark brown perfect for rapunzel themed mocs as you can see her ponytail is loooong makes it hard to sit down the poor girl i feel sorry for all these female figs with such intricate hairstyles that they can never relax in an ordinary lego chair however at least she has two breasts unlike the recent harley quinn fig compensation indeed seriously though its great that theres a separate torso print for the female character and this attention to detail is typical of the set as a whole three of the agents have reversable heads  nice touch with the headsets and i like the id cards on their pants obviously the agents security system is based on some kind of crotch measuring device this would make sense considering the conspicuous bulges in the pants of dr infernos men see the other agents set reviews the villains  spy clops dr inferno gold tooth dr infernos hair in all its glory this is a great piece although the orange colouring is a little rough on the front its so 3d it deserves a back and side view and indeed eb thread all of its own as mentioned elsewhere this is different plastic to the normal minifig hair but it doesnt quite feel as soft as the exoforce hair it doesnt fall off as much anyway the figs get 1010 from me awesome hairpieces in great colours for the agents and a sleek navy blue neon green uniform the villains faces are great and they are all very distinctive the attention to detail is outstanding and its great to see a lego inhouse theme with characters as memorable and cool as figs from the licensed themes  part 3 the build the build is divided into three stages  the small vehicles the front of the truck and the massive command center section a small vehicles first up all the small vehicles we have a small flyer 2 buggies jet ski and a speed boat  all in glorious navy blue with little bits of silver detailing top view these vehicles are all simple small and welldesigned probably the weakest is the flyer only because the cockpit looks a little large in fact the small flyer is probably the weakest element of 8365 overall which tells you how good the set itself is in various threads here this set has been heavily criticised for being way out of proportion theres a reason for that as we shall come to however the existence of these small sets should appease some people with the new coast guard sets for example all of these save the flyer wouldnt look out of place on a city beach with a little modding heres an example  agents beach party spongebob couldnt help but crash the villains only have one small vehicle but theyve been wellserved in the smaller sets and this one is a unique and clever design i love the triangular shape and the simple but clever technique of making the arch slopes meet up around the propellers its sort of insectile in black and orange and looks very different from the usual assortment of helicopters etc b truck front this thing is a beast seriously look at it its chunky and mean looking you dont want to mess with this baby the build is really nice like a lot of star wars vehicles its all based on technic beams pinned together unlike a lot of mars mission sets underneath isnt all technic beams with some plates slapped on like a facade the majority is a lot of plates and bricks which all fit together solidly you can see from the detailing of cheese grater slopes and silver pieces on the front how effort has been made to give this vehicle a distinct feel different to other lego sets sure the silver slope mirrors might be a bit too much for some but this baby is all about attitude you can imagine it roaring down the road en route to dr infernos diabolical lair after all these sets are agents sets  nobody said they were secret agents c  command center  whole assembly heres a view of the whole thing assembled  inside and cool details to follow at the end its kind of hard to show here as it is extreeeeemely long this is indeed a big set the build for the trailer part of the command center is fun and very satisfying yes there are large pieces but there is also a huge amount of detail it is also solid as a rock i remember being annoyed building the big ferrari truck a few years ago  everytime you looked at it an 8 x 16 plate fell off the mobile command center is solid  even with the hinged roof and special features it is not delicate at all kudos to the designers again as it is mainly a brick build rather than a technic one i also like how the command center part connects to the cabin  its not a special piece at all just a technic axle going through two circle plates but it works and its solid please note ive been selective about which stickers ive applied during the build top view the rear heres an example of why i like the build a the designers have enough sense to put a ladder so a minifig can climb up to the interior when the command center is open b notice that although the ladder clips at the top there is an extra clip there in the middle purely to hold it in place so it doesnt flap around and holds firm i dont know if most designers would even think to put a ladder there let alone go the extra mile and put a mechanism to hold it in place pure class oh and notice the greebly detail stuff to the right there too the other side this is probably the other weak part of the build  the bricky gaps at the top where the hinge to open the roof sits its a little gappy but the set is so big you dont really notice d and now for the fun stuff  inside and neat details ok so weve built the thing its big its blue the top of the trailer itself would make a good warehouse moc for a harbour layout but what about inside is it any good what about all those small vehicles from the start of the review where do they go well im glad you asked because the solution is superb the small flyer folds slightly and slides into place here lift off the roof and youre away the large buggy and the speedboat go under here the jetski slides out of the rear here attached to its own little platform and the small buggy goes inside the main cabin theres even a crane so you can lift it down so now we know why this set is so large to fit everything in its amazing that this functionality doesnt affect the aesthetics of the set as a whole but we still havent finished on the details the front section has a very easytoswingopen roof section and missiles theres also a command section underneath the bit where the flyer lifts out and now for the interior i have to say i really like this space not only is it packed with great stuff theres also enough room for minifigs to move around i hate bases where the figs only have about 2 studs to actually stand and walk aquabase invasion is a nice set for example but the actual functional space inside the base is teensy claustrophobia you know within a week theyd be fighting to toss each other out of the airlock no such problems for these suave agents who have plenty of legroom and the ability to launch missiles from their ceiling the whole of the interior zooming in moving from left to right first off the medicine cabinet looks like someones been leaving secret mission dossiers lying around the projector area for mission briefings dr inferno recently changed his hair colour from purple to orange it seems why are all these minifigs so obsessed with their hair the projector folds down when the trailer is open push the button and the light glows on now dr infernos hair is orange again this is one of my favourite parts of the set it works a charm the batteries for these lightbricks can also be replaced  instructions are in the manual agent charge considers sharkfin soup for dinner did i mention these projection panels are printed the detail is very fine too the tool section laptops sit in the middle compartment you get some flippers yellow scuba tank and various implements im so impressed that the helmet is pearl silver with a different coloured visor too  theres so much variation in the parts in this set you dont get the sense the designers are using the same thing over and over to save money it all feels luxe and topoftheline just like the command center itself two laptops  yay the aforementioned rooftop missiles the dr inferno cage nasty electric shocks bzzt you can see my reviewing skills are burning out now  sentences truncated another example of detail  nowhere else in the set is a 1x1 transgreen tile used  they could have used a 1x1 trans green cheese wedge piece as there are others in the set but they didnt how does dr i get out flick that lever on the right hand exterior and the door pops open spy clops the loyal minion awaits his master on the other side and there we have it take a bow guys theres a lot of spare parts a suspicious amount of dark blue small slopes but i checked the instructions and didnt see anything missing i have to say i do like the new policy since speed racer i think of including these small slopes as extras part 4 overall rating if youve made it this far youve got more stamina than dr infernos army of cyborg animals themselves as i said earlier this set has drawn criticism for the size of the truck however large vehicles do exist  i grew up in a wheat farming area and as a kid the size of the lorries that thundered past carrying grain was probably intimidating to me as this monstrous espionage machine is to the good citizens of lego city on top of that it does contain a plethora of 4wide vehicles inside  criticism of this set on the basis of size to me also seems misguided as this is basically a playset  and it is a very good one to boot as you can probably tell i love it to pieces and wouldnt hesitate to recommend it to anyone whether for parts or for play value check out the parts list in this folderwhen moderated and you can see just how many excellent pieces it contains a lightup brick a flood of navy blue metallic silver bricks  were spoiled 8635 is also an enjoyable build with fantastic figs and topoftheline detailing in a year when ive found city a bit disappointing after the run of great sets in 20062007 the agents line has been one of the surprise hits for me and i cant wait to see what the designers come up with next edited by sveltecorps 02 june 2008  1246 am
man i was hoping to be the first to review ordered from tru 2 days ago oh well this set looks sweet cant wait for your review
you know i like many had doubts about these sets when they were first mentioned but ive decided i want the whole line now this set is the créme de la créme just beautifully stunning that is a great review sveltecorps you have gone into fantastic detail and description of all the elements really it is this review that has persuaded me to buy this set i blame you the minifigs are great the vehicles are better and the truck and interior is awesome the few minor draw backs are far outweighed by the attention to detail and the many unique and cool elements used in this set and printed pieces that is even better great job you have obviously put a tremendous effort in making this review and i for one definitely appreciate it i am looking forward to these sets being available in new zealand
wow great review of what seems to be a great set i love that ponytail this looks to be a must have set it probably wont stay together for long though thanks very much i fixed the header for you thats two you owe me the other is for making me think that this set was in australia 
sveltecorps a fanastic review of this biggest agents set at first i was not very keen to have this set however after reading your review you have make me swing up and down its simply fabulous thanks for your hard work i am sure its not easy to do this review i love that female minifig she looks awfully sweet especially with her new hair great job
omg thank you thank you thank you you made my day so that means dr infernos hair isnt rubber but one question is it like that weird funny soft plastic like the ants from indy 4 please answer
wonderful review  one of the best ive ever seen on this site man we thought this might be the weakest set in the line but it turns out it may be the strongest everything about this set  from the color scheme to all the details to the minifigures to the piece selection  is just wonderful i think this set has finally confirmed it agents is everything alpha team wasnt and is how they should have done a spy theme from the start kudos to tlc for finally getting it right  and i sure hope theres a second year
wow excellent review thanks that set sure looks fantastic its incredible how much features theyve managed to pack in while keeping it roomy im really impressed by the quality of the design tlc is sure getting back on track with great design ow 2008 is going to be expensive
wowi cant believe i thought this line was falseoh crapsweet i need to get this
another great review im looking forward to getting this set sometime soon i wasnt aware of the power function aspect similar i suppose to the old technic sets which had an additional instructions for those with the relevant motors i knew those dinos i got at clearance would come in useful nice to see the recent bulldozer treads appearing in black grey seemed a slightly unusual colour choice
these new sets are just totally offthewall radical d its the little details like the scoops on the blades and the alternate alien energy source lego didnt even have to include those but they did that show lego are really getting back into their groove this year the ability to add power functions is just so cool as well im going to pickup the creator monster dino set for the electronics when the sales hit as svelte has suggested a very entertaining review just like the agents mobile command center one d
thank you for that fine review sveltecorps that´s a pretty cool set much more solid than the armoured drilling unit with a nice little transporter and some for sure pretty interesting additional power functions a very smart idea indeed did i miss something or is there really only one and probably improved shooting device and there´re even some levers to control the vehicles wow a matured marsmission on indeed now let´s get rid of these poor utilized jellies and we´re right on the way
asuka on jun 4 2008 0926 am said did i miss something or is there really only one and probably improved shooting device no you didnt miss anything theres only one and its the less obtrusive new piece the range is pretty poor though 
well i guess its nice that theyre making the story background a little more clear with that jelly plugged into the power cable hmmh both jellies and crystals can be used as power sources think theres a connection both of them are transparent and greenish maybe jellies hatch from crystals like eggs or need them as food or something important like that yay for evil humans
excellent review loving this set i mean come on its a flipping tank awesomeness is written all over this  from all those blades and scoops at the front to the mini rover and yes you can even turn it into a motorized battle tank reminds me of the old technic days when they advertised in the manuals how to hook up the kits with separately sold motors another day another review of an awesome set yes this is sure tlcs year
mr mandalorian on jun 4 2008 0119 am said and then we have this thing what is it defense laser communications array satellite tv that certainly feels like an homage to the deep freeze defender which itself feels like an homage to the galaxy commander is there some way to centre one of the cockpit units without massive de and re construction
spacefan on jun 4 2008 0556 pm said anyhow this is my first post to the forum and hope my welcome wont wear out here anytime soon having a name like that is a good start
i dont understand why theres so much negativity this is actually my favorite of the new mm sets the finished look is very sleek and not very gappy at all the deployable landing pad is great and itll make it easy to put on a shelf without taking too much room lots of greebles although i will concede that its just begging to be modded still though im definitely buying this one  it has a really great look to it
two more questions 1  how stable is the entire craft when balanced on the platform is there a chance that it will just collapse 2  what are the total wingspan height and depth measurements of the model
hm needs more firepower
spacefan on jun 4 2008 0238 pm said aside from the factory star justice set elements of which i loathe do tell im being curious not confrontational 
great review mr boba fett i really like this set a lot some of the features may not be as good as i hoped they would but overall this looks to be a really nice set im so happy that the giant spacecrafts are finally back quote ive noticed a trend that the larger sets have plenty of parts potential but when assembled the model is not more than the sum of the parts eagle base certainly didnt seem worth the asking price at least this is one large model on a positive note the lame aero tubes darts and martian carrier pods have disappeared hm actually i dont see the comparison eagle base looked terible to me right from the start so it was no suprise when it ended up being the weakest kit in the first year this big ship on the other hand looked great as soon as i saw it and still looks good
batbrick on jun 4 2008 0804 pm said hate to admit it but i enjoy staudies humour more than i enjoy shadows each to his own level of intellect
ah ha ha a wonderful review stauder very funny indeed the cheese bit made me laugh stupid aliens very good once again i hope to see more reviews in future quick go buy the other impulse sets i could do with another review of them peace
hello all eurobricks members i will be presenting my first review on one of the harry potters set firstly i must emphasize that i am not a very big harry potter fan or owned many harry potter sets for this review i will be highlighting what is the beauty of this small little set and the reasons to own multiple sets of it comments and critics are strongly welcomed this set is featured in the harry potter movie prisoner of azkaban this set is orignally released in 2004 align with the harry potters movie this was actually one of the movie scene where buckbeak the griffin is appeared in the movie the group of students are supposed to be having up close and personal with him however draco decided to disturb our lovely buckbeak enough of this movie synopsis i am sure fans of harry potter will know this better box art featured minifigcreature background scene the scene is a simple garden which had a very good mixture of spare parts for your mocs building on its own there is nothing outstanding about this set except for the griffin you can buy multiple sets for the griffin alone and for draco minifig well you dont need lots of draco but for castle lovers black cap are exceptionally useful at least from my view now i will point out the following why this sets is so great for other reasons hidden cover note that this is the only mechanism which you can find in this set it looks rather simple but quite useful there are some little things hide in it too greens foilage and brown parts needless to say much it offer 3 foilage a green plant 3 brown slopes 2 ideal bricks and 1x1 brown brick for building a tree great for jungle building forest building and etc i am sure there are many builders will look out for these interesting parts it comes with a wizard book owl 2 printed tiles with a spider and stone prints on it the far right seriously i dont find any good use for it can any eb members enlighten me on that gray thing on the right grey parts it comes with a good 10 x 4 green plate useful for adding as a platform some more grey slopes for your mocs there you have it draco encounter with buckbeak comparing with deep forest ambush as you may remembered recently there was an impulse set competition one of my entries which is under the history theme the deep forest ambush was firstly inspired by this set and made an improvement out of it look at the improved tree compared with the orignal summary review playability 410 not much to play with except swooshing around the griffin design 510 too simple and its defintely not related with the movie scene parts 1010 great for parts explained by the review a great deal of green and brown parts price 910 an inexpensive set based on the 2004 pricing overall 710 a must have for all harry potter fans and collectors whom needs a great use of green and brown parts hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine more pictures can be found in my brickshelf when moderated let the potter magic begans edited by whitefang 09 june 2008  0245 pm
i own about 6 copies of this set
i see a lot of good reviews on this site but this one is superb good job tom
im looking forward to getting this set as well the hippogriff will become the valiant steed to my princess minifig for her comic adventures im really annoyed that the harry potter sets were released during my dark age i so wouldve wanted all of them
great review as always batbrick  i always enjoy reading them because they really make my day  i hope that we shall see more and more good day gentlemen 
i got this set in 2006 in a byrnes world of wonder toy shop i dont remember how much but it was a deal the box was all battered but it had everything good review batbrick
brainbox on jun 14 2008 0714 am said thanks for the review even if it is a number of years late i picked this up whn it came out and thought it was a rather cool set besides the catapult plenty of cool pieces and the baseplate has found a use in the batcave although i think my dad managed to spill some beer on it at one point that was awful to clean off not late just delayed beer and i though playdoh was bad brainbox on jun 14 2008 0714 am said i wasnt expecting that there i was casually scrolling down when i stumbled onto a picture of me had to be done and it fitted your character didnt it adam on jun 14 2008 0740 am said where is my soap over there mack on jun 14 2008 1055 am said btw as adam mentioned i believe you owe me a bar of soap for reading your review  see above grevious on jun 15 2008 0330 am said great review the hippy and the story at the end were hilarious i think this was easily the best of the spiderman 2 sets youre right though  it wasnt movie acurate as the actual movie dock was far shabbier and more trashed than this ah well i guess tlc couldnt do everything thanks grevious it is a great set the hippy is awesome it was hard to take him apart iamded on jun 15 2008 0846 am said wait dragonators not caring that hes being held by doc ock what are you doing a very nice finish to the interview now i really want this set the story at the end was neat except for spidey dieing  but my favourite part was the exploding dragonator nothing personal mate it just looks cool when people are thrown into fusion reactors yes i agree exploding dragonators are always hilarious maybe i should pm him that pic as for dragonator not caring it was late and i was getting careless batbrick away
great review and what are the stands that you used they look much better than the white bricks that i use
thanks for the review ive always liked that one but havent had a chance to get it now im sold or the set will be sold to me 
nice review but i have to correct something for you valentin on jun 15 2008 0953 am said one thing is that theres no known release of the vwing starfighter by hasbro nor the other wellknown brands the other thing is that being a star wars vehicle collector i would really loved to see a replica toy of the vwing this quote is wrong  heres a link to the hasbro vwing photo archive over on rebelscumcom
imo this set is the best sw set of 2006 its cheap and sturdy for me its 9810
skipper 24 on jun 15 2008 0802 pm said why have you uploaded this twice what do you mean twice the tie interceptor is one of the best ties that have been made so far though youre pushing it when doing a review that has already been done by a precious member of this site fine review for a great set kimt
why didnt you open the bags
now now dont judge people who do this there have been bigger sets that were done in the bag to each his own 
ahhh bag building that takes me back i suspect that if i didnt do my bag building topic my eb life would have turned out very differently for the negative nancies i suggest you try it i bought a set just so i could and i found it fun not fun enough to do it again though thanks for the interesting review
adiksalego on jun 17 2008 1002 am said now now dont judge people who do this there have been bigger sets that were done in the bag to each his own  you make it sound like i did something deeply socially deviating like being an adult playing with lego but back on topic open the bags if they were meant to be opened why did lego close them in the first place bag building is not for everybody some might become very frustrated with it and let their anger out on the set by lining it up on a mini golf course
nice review i have the original atat and i like it a lot considered buying this one but it being motorized made me not also i think a set this size could really come with some more snowies benny
kimt on jun 19 2008 0342 pm said great review indexing it as i write this how come you think the ctt is the atats predecessor do you mean the motorized atat or atats in general i think this is a great set and i am very fond of mine its one of the few sw sets of mine that is on parade at all times most are packed away in the attic kimt btw its not alone the older version of the atat is keeping it company the body looks exactly like it
as far as i know the atat was a invention by general veers himself benny
vadersson on jun 19 2008 0157 pm said as far as i know the atat was a invention by general veers himself benny i doubt that the atat was used in the clone wars
vader had a red pole because i think it makes him look bigger and in the films i doubt it is but i think his saber might be bigger
thanks for the review eh honestly i though this was awful ever since i first saw the pictures to me an incomplete grey ball doesnt really work as a special ucs kit for the sole reason that its boring extremely so now the new death star playset is a whole different story they should have done that in the first place edited by grevious 24 june 2008  0912 pm
even though i never liked ucs i absolutley hate this one sure its great on display but the build looks extremley boring to me just stacking plate after plate and as you said its going to break a little if you touch it the only intersting part for me is the firing laser although i do have to say the proce isnt too bad i still wouldt buy it and no minifigs so thanks for the review but ill pass on this one the new minifig scale ds looks awesome though and this might have hyped some up who are buying the new ds
great review kimt  i like this set even if i don´t own it because it looks simple fantastic to display i just have one question the mini executor can be moved around the death star ii or its attached to that place thanks for the review 
darkrebellion on jun 25 2008 1239 am said great review kimt  i like this set even if i don´t own it because it looks simple fantastic to display i just have one question the mini executor can be moved around the death star ii or its attached to that place thanks for the review  its attached to the ds and cannot move as such though there is 4 spots where it can be attached to the ds reading your comments on this set i can see why tlg has been forced to put it on sale on the us sh i dont agree that the isd is better  imho theyre exactly them same  big and grey this is a question of personal liking  which is the coolest ds or isd not comparative id still call this an ok ucs when looking at it individually but there sure is a lot other ucs sets that would get a better score than 510 kimt
great concise review kimt though its not for me you held my interest all the way through thanks isc
i also dont feel this is a very good set but is that old grey in which case it would be a nice part pack dr brick
thanks for the review kimt honestly like the others have said i dont find any appeal in ucs sets especially this one its just a big incomplete grey ball
wow what a letdown i recently picked up this set and i looked up this review to see what i was getting into not good news the silver lining is that it was a damaged box deal at brickworld so it only cost me 100 half off the already lowered price so it was definatley worth it as a parts pack if nothing else its the last unopenedunbuilt large kit in my collection so even if it is repetetive i am going to build it anyway it is likely however that i may substitute pieces to do away with the colored interior ive already determined that after it sits on display for a while i want to do a zepplin as an alternate build looking at the parts list it looks like its the perfect set for such an undertaking
dang so much negativity on a such spectacular set this baby provides an amazing backdrop to any lego inspired star wars diorama and lets face it lego tends to be a rectangular brick and somehow we now have a sphere guys its a ucs it accurately depicts the on screen icon and put plain and simple is a wonderful sculptural piece of work in its own right i agree with kimt in that the removal of the laser and super star destroyer gives it more authenticity but to call it a gray golf ball or ignore its inherent accuracy is simply to miss the point it proved to be the best build to share with someone be it family or friend due to its repeated sections and impressive finish its a clever build and to criticize it for lack of playability or i suspect for many its absence of minifigs is just absurd and possibly why lego has not released a proper ucs in nearly two years i reckon many out there would love a ucs tyderium imperial walker or slave 1 with a spectacular piece count be it minifig scale or just darn impressive in its own right sadly for those who love these sculptural masterpieces were stuck with simple toys with play features and cute minifigs clever in their own right but lacking the clout and purity of the old ucs line lets hope some diversity of product is just around the corner else 10179 was the last of the truly brave financial gambles of the star wars line
i decided to reread this review because i just got this set today i dont really have a concern over the design or repeating build process because owning this set was never an option for me as i collect ucs sets but i am surprised to see an almost total lack of positive posts i really hope that i enjoy this build

i bricklinked it too back in the day it was an interesting build  just thought building the unfinished hemisphere was kind of tedious
hey thanks for all the feedback guys ill try to do the sith infiltrator this weekend
nice review i bought a couple of these for parts the only thing i dont like about the ship itself not the lego version it does fine is why is the grand droid general flying around in in a small fighter like this i prefer the battlefront interpretation witch uses it as a bomber anyway great review york
thanks again you guys dont worry the sith infiltrator review will be up this week my computer has viruses but now i got firefox complete with spell check so i should be able to go on the internet ok from now on
great review i would get the set but im saving for the clone wars sets
its all good buti know you expected a but  its a rat
thanks for the review bearing in mind that the whole point of this set is to get a cheap troll warrior i actually quite like it the cart isnt brilliant but for 13 pieces its not that bad the troll fig is great as always and i guess the rats are always nice to get not so much in real life though the sets that contain the trolls have a fairly solid number each i mean tower raid has three but nevertheless i think i may have to pick up a few of these whitefang on jul 2 2008 0249 pm said in addition the flick missile really works use a little bit of force from your finger and flick it the missile will fly well it certainly does not impress me at all with such playing feature the trolls hands are going to get quite sore then arent they
trooperdavinfelth on jul 2 2008 0315 pm said its all good buti know you expected a but  its a rat or maybe a very large mouse
its a good review but you forgot another thing the troll needs a shiled like they used to in the 2007 castle line the sets always had shields for the minifigs and it could be better if it was 300 instead of 350 but yes it is a good impulse great army builder
very good nice to see how its all played out nice review
ah sweet thanks for the review whitefang i hope this set shows up in nz soon i cant wait to get my hands on it troll warrior on peace
whitefang on jul 3 2008 0406 am said i thought by calling it as a mouse it will be a little much friendly unlike calling it a rat why is mouse friendlier than rat
guys thanks for your kind comments it seemed most of us here love this impulse set mainly to build army guess i am a little bit too critic in my review i was expecting a little bit more nevertheless i intend to buy multiple sets of this and build on my orc armies and split them into different battalions this is indeed one of the better ways to acquire orcs wilhelm screamer on jul 3 2008 1130 am said i got two of these in the mail today and was so eager to do a review of it thanks for saving me the work opps i was eager to do a review as well when i bought these sets i hope you enjoyed reading this comprehensive review nikola bathory on jul 3 2008 0408 pm said hey your review is great as usual as for the set itself  well its an impulse set after all  small and cheap nothing special well the rat is special hehe for me the rat is the most interesting in the set cause i dont have a rat i dont have a troll warrior either but im not very interested give the new theme a chance i feel tlg have made an effort to revive certain elements that are present in past castle themes although it is not as good as the past but it is certainly better than the recent castle themes shoc on jul 4 2008 0100 am said why is mouse friendlier than rat well mouse sounded more friendly because it can associate with tom and jerry but calling it a rat equal calling it a pest its just a matter of putting it in different terms thats all edit instead of posting another post to explain why i used mouse i will write it here tom and jerry is reflected as a cartoon children associate jerry as a mouse since its supposed to be heartwarming and make us laugh in real life there are many different pets we raised one of the possible pets we considered is a mouse mouse are supposed to be shy and friendly creatures that live in harmony while rats lived in packs hunt food in the dark and is widely regarded as a pest in this review i am trying to illustrate rat and associate it with mouse by presenting it in a much friendly approach there is no right or wrong answer its just making use of different words to represent how i feel towards a particular thing edited by whitefang 04 july 2008  0808 am
this is a nice way of building up orc armies but i do wish it was designed like the knight impulse set there you have a minifig enough weapons and armor for two figs and a weapons rack made out of basic pieces add a generic fig from your collection and you have two knights and the pieces from the rack can be easily used in mocs the pieces that make up the siege weapon in the orc impulse are not as easy to use in other creations id rather have seen a orcish weapons rack different from the knights rack but like it using basic elements with a second helmet another weapon the orc armor and a shield to put on it still although not as good as the knight impulse its a nice little set whitefang on jul 4 2008 0343 am said tom and jerry is reflected as a cartoon children associate jerry as a mouse since its supposed to be heartwarming and make us laugh in real life there are many different pets we raised one of the possible pets we considered is a mouse mouse are supposed to be shy and friendly creatures that live in harmony while rats lived in packs hunt food in the dark and is widely regarded as a pest where i come from people keep both as pets however if either are found in the house uninvited they are considered pests and if you look at the chinese zodiac rats are very well thought of and are symbols of prosperity the brick mouse rat
thank you for the review the set is nice i didnt need the flickfire missiles and would have rather a orctrol shield instead but i think i will pick one up
glad you guys like the review brainbox on jul 3 2008 0619 pm said looking at this is making me want to build one of the favourite sets of my childhood 6649 street sweeper might do that today actually cheap good pieces despite the lack of a bin lid thats just inviting disaster isnt it nice fig and one of those blue brushes which ive always loved but never managed to use the 6649 looks lovely and i hope you managed to restore it indeed a bin without a lid is inviting trouble
thank you for the nice review this set looks good i have too many of the blue sweepthings but the fig is nice and i didnt have this face so i will pick up one some day
thanks for the review poor little minifig this guy has to haul the heavy machine all the way from the depot onto the littered streets to locate some trash but when he has finally found some and switches on the machine everything will be launched towards his pants no wonder hes looking sad a nice set though and inventive too when it comes to streetsweepers i remember getting the first of its kind on my birthday in 1991
excellent review i like how the new coast guard sets blare out new when you see them
thank you for the nice review the set is nice the pieces are nice and the grey helmet is great for an additional star wars rebel technician
one of the better impulse sets imo
glad you enjoyed viewing the review xenologer on jul 3 2008 0112 pm said the hawk it seems to me lacks a cockpit theres not even a seat to keep the pilot from falling off perhaps it theyd redesigned it to be a backpack jetpack sort of unit using similar pieces itd at least make some sense these are some of the improvements which we can do it ourselves to mod it better i think these are great suggestions otherwise we can add in a white air tank to be included onto the minifig xenologer on jul 3 2008 0112 pm said based on the other mm impluses can we assume this goes for 35usd at that price it seems to me that the astro fighter at 5usd was already a superior impluse set guess id buy one on clearance for the minifig in sh crystal hawk is priced at usd 350 i bought mine at a much expensive price when you compared it with usd i never bought the astro fighter i am supposed that it comes with a little bit more parts and an additional alien fig with it
once again another outstanding review by sveltecorps i am not a very big fan of agents but this theme defintely offer plenty of useful parts this volcano base is simply fanastic for parts usage especially in doing up landscaping with mountains by making use of the brown burps i must admit that the exterior looks real cool but the interior looks rather empty these orange slopes certainly make a great illustration of the larva which gives the agents a hard time to infiltrate within its compound to save his comrade i am quite sure this set will defintely attracts lots of kids to coax their parents to buy it since the bright colors will defintely caught their attention with all those hitech sleek weaponary i am sure this is the next big thing for kids out there well i am not sure if this theme works for me as well but this set defintely works well for landscaping project
thanks for another great review i definitely like this set sure the interior might be a bit bare but i think that the outside of the base with all of the great lava and rocks more than makes up for it it is a bit weird that on the one side there is nothing on the inside but thats easy to fix anyone know when this will be out in the us thanks again for the fantastic review
thanks for the review sveltecorps i have yet to purchase an agent set but i think that will change shortly i am not a big fan of the stickers but the huge laser gun the unique minifig design and beaucoup transorange pieces have me sold
this will be a wonderful set for a mustafar moc
woo rock raiders only the best theme ever thats right possibly even better than castle 07 cheers for the review metalandi hopefully you can inspire others to see the greatness of rock raiders too i love how everything was so simple yet so effective it was loads of fun to play with and build the alternate models when i was younger as well and probably still is  do you plan of doing any other reviews or do you have any other sets rapid rider is another great small one adding a bit of diversity with a waterbased vehicle and you get the bandit minifig or you could get the rock raiders set and get all of our spelunking friends dont make me name them all  or if you want a slightly bigger set loader dozer could be the way to go axles a pretty cool minifig too and you get a rock monster sorry if the last comments were detracting from your review dont think i didnt like it becuase it was great i really hope you can do more oh and yes my torso does come from a female fig peace
unfortunately i dont have any other sets yet i think i got one of the bigger vehicles back in the time but i dont have any sets from this time anymore but i certainly plan to get the loader dozer andor the chrome crusher soon i found an ebay auction where somebody is selling the sets 4940 4950 and 4970 new  sealed hopefully i have luck with that its only at 4 euros right now but its still running 6 days httpcgiebaydewtaitih005
great review  man this brings me back i still have like 5 of those rock monsters in response to your statement rock raiders does belong in this forum being everything space related 1 its on an alien planet 2 in the computer games start and in the story yes there was a computer gamemy cousin has it they are in a space ship 3 there are huge alien rock monsters trying to kill them
rock raiders was one of my favorite lego themes ever
sinner on jul 20 2008 0456 pm said i consider rock raiders space too i also consider many of the diver themes space as well me too the rock raiders are very scifi with the best lego space storyline the aquazonies would be inner space rather than outer space though but they look very spacey edited by shoc 20 july 2008  0745 pm
ill be honest  i dont like this ship at all its one of my least favourite ships in the pt and i have to yet buy either one of those sets i also found it funny that this set was meant to be a walmart exclusive yet never appeared on the shelves at my walmart anyhow thanks for the review
nice review jim i think i would only buy this for darth maul though you definitely showcased all the cool features really well
trudop561 on jul 11 2008 0630 am said i got this set last year and i think you made a mistake when you have remove a piece to access the probe droids and equipment you just have to slide the entire main part and i have a question is this equipped with the new flickfire missiles that dont fall off yes i realized the first part  as for the flickfire missiles the do fall off very easily
thanks for reviewi hope svelt corps still reviews it  slime is pretty cool i knew about the torse for a while but its no less cool now
thanks for the review its great to see detailed pictures of slime face the set looks good but not as good as some of the others in this line great review
i feel like a n00b asking but what is the usd price i didnt see a price in the review
aside from the price i love this set when i saw the prelim pics of agetns i did not like the theme but all the sets are starting to look more attractive now i can see the cool features and details as for this set i really like the badguy boat for some reason and the submarine looks good  i love the dark blue colour
i forgot to comment on this review great job rezourceman like sveltecorps said your pics really show off the set and what there is to it i just ordered this and the volcano base off sh and i cant wait for them to come so ill comment on these reviews i forgot about i love the inferno boat as you say in your review it looks very heavy duty and ready to take on the agents the sub i quite like from the look of it though there is the problem of too little space i will try and correct that the dark blue is especially good and i love slime face his torso is very cool sveltecorps on jul 11 2008 0914 am said i cant say this is my favourite agents set the boat is a little oddly proportioned and the sub although retro looking has practically no interior and would be difficult to customise to put more in unlike say the clever job batbrick did with the penguin sub in his review wow thanks for that little mention is it impossible or just very hard to mod sveltecorps on jul 11 2008 0914 am said i do agree with you about slime face  he has a fantastic torso with all the slime dripping down which is a bit obscured by the air tank its really encouraging that in the last 2 missions weve had great extra villains added in the only thing i would add about the octopus is that the glow in the dark plastic is mixed in unevenly with the aqua blue so it doesnt glow in the dark evenly  its kind of like the mars mission jellies in that respect though much cooler the octopus sounds great thanks for that is he meant to be on any side im guessing hes a mutant inferno creature about slime face is his head much different to the joker bombs i know he has slime marks on his head are they very apparent thanks again for the review batbrick away
sveltecorps on jul 19 2008 1020 am said nothing is impossible to mod probably the easiest part to change would be the front where the missiles are and the treasure chest slides out  you could make a sizeable compartment there however the middle section is so narrow and the end fins are just that  fins  that it might be harder to expand without changing the shape of the sub youll find out soon when yours arrives thanks for that info i will definitely try anyway when i get the set see if i cant loosen up a few dark blue bricks at the same time sveltecorps on jul 19 2008 1020 am said its not really clear but since all the other mutants are evil or at least controlled by dr inferno its probably a safe bet the squid is too slime faces head is different to the joker bombs  different eyes and teeth although the smile is similar i guess and the slime marks are much more apparent in the flesh or abs although they dont photograph that way joker bomb face below for contrast ah thanks for that info i see that they are more different than i thought now i hope the slime looks good when i get him batbrick away
inertia on jul 21 2008 1229 pm said wow thanks for the review that is one awesome set i think we need some new agents theres so many inferno minifigures now maybe next year theres only 2 infernos out of 8 sets which is pretty good theres way more agent chases and break jaws i agree though next year hopefully well have some new figs
great review i just thought id comment saying thanks because if i hadnt found this review id of never made an account on eurobricks
thanks for the review this is one of my favorite space sets of all time i even had 2 of them back in the days my only complain about this set was that i found that the wheels where too small  i had some trouble passing the rover over the little cratersmountains of the space plates
thanks for another informative review of the best lego theme ever and not in attempt to hijack your thread but to add to it heres a pic of my blacktron 1 version of this beautiful set the 6927 has to rate as one of the best 5 classic space sets ever along with 918 6970 and 928
dovchenko on jul 10 2008 0824 pm said no more of your great reviews why a good review right here got into the thick of the set without becoming boring with an absence of pictures or not having enough text ive exhausted my collection of classic space sets id love to keep them going but just one more set you can check out this index for a complete listing and links to each of the reviews thanks for the feedbback mutex on jul 10 2008 0937 pm said this is one of my favorite space sets of all time i even had 2 of them back in the days my only complain about this set was that i found that the wheels where too small  i had some trouble passing the rover over the little cratersmountains of the space plates it is a gem in the classic space collection the playability is great i agree with you as i never thought this was much of an allterrain vehicle with the wheel construction the bottom of the vehicle would always touch the bottom of nonsmooth surfaces the wheels do need to be bigger but i still like them cp5670 on jul 10 2008 1043 pm said i got this set off ebay a while ago and one of them was broken in shipping even though the set was otherwise in display model condition and the other one broke off while i was building the set i replaced them with the newer variety great buy on this one what did it cost you hewman on jul 10 2008 1111 pm said not in attempt to hijack your thread but to add to it heres a pic of my blacktron 1 version of this beautiful set thats excellent i love the alternate color scheme great job here whitefang on jul 11 2008 1211 am said however there is one thing i dont understand about this design why is the driver seat has a wide back with no cover behind and the command center has no door at the back i understand that these space guys are always carrying their helmet around for oxygen supply i wonder if there is a better answer to it yes the extra space was probably for the oxygen tanks on the figs it makes taking them off a lot easier as for the labcontrol center i never had an issue with it being open i think this was just for playability one could always pretend that some sort of invisible force ray closed the side when activated great comments i love hearing what others think of these classics
great review allterrain vehicle was one of my two favorite lego sets ever i have to include a shot of the back of the box because i love the ideas lego provided for this set hewman on jul 11 2008 0111 am said very nice blacktronthemed 6927 cp5670 on jul 11 2008 0139 pm said i just modified mine to make everything fully enclosed i love your modified 6927 with the enclosed front 2 weeks ago i modified my allterrain vehicle as well in a similar way but just slightly more modified from the original i call it 6927c allterrain vehicle improved class a few clues for anyone to easily build this themselves also a much more extensive modificationmoc that i call 6927w allterrain warrior quote 6927w allterrain warrior i wanted to make a combat variant of 6927 so i used the 6927c improved class as the starting point and went from there i added a completely new forwardcab close to the ground for a groundobserver to monitor the terrain i added even larger wheels allowing this variant to truly be all terrain besides what good is it having a combat vehicle if it gets stuck in the middle of a firefight the 6927w has a five man crew a driver a gunner who also serves as overallcommander a terrain observer in the very front in the lab are the weapons systems officer and computertech specialist the allterrain warrior vehicle portion is armed with lasers and blaster cannons with options for other weapons there are shortrange nuclear rockets on the lab guided by the rader control the lab now has blastproof shutters on the windows protecting the crew from rocket blast additional protection can be added to the lab ifneedbe such as more extensive blastshielding allinall the allterrain warrior is a beast of a machine two 6927s can protect an entire convoy of standard 6927 or 6927c these are my very first attempts at modification and doing a moc of classic space lego edited by parallaxscroll 29 august 2009  0303 am
wow that brings back memories i have that model too in storage somewhere the pictures are great i will definitely be checking out more of your reviews
thanks for the review looks like a great set im surprised that spongebobs bandage has a full body headprint so kudos to lego for that
i ordered the set via sh and it cost 3499€ in germany 3799€ in belgium and 50 in australia it looks like it´s a exclusive set but without the 2limited edition sticker on the package in the usa it´s not aviable now i think it costs as much as the rocket ride 30  mrs pegleg he has the same short pants like in the other sets
the fish doctor is supposed to have a new torso
awesome light blue train doors yummy it is quite strange that spongbob has become the best source for train parts the baby blue doors the orange round windows 
the official name for this lego set is the emergency room i have all the other spongebob sets including three krusty krabs two bikini bottoms as well as one of everything else  now all i need to do is wait until next month to buy this set if i find it at my local toys r us that spongebob minifig looks cute
im not a huge fan of spongebob but this set i might want also have maybe i can combine it with the city hospital
thanks navy trooper fenson for the review  good one  i really like that sb is printed i will need to get this one when i go to the us in two weeks copmike
nice review nft i´m not that much into spongebob but these two pieces just for themselves are interesting to get container cupboard 4532 and cupboard drawer 4536 the latter not being sold for the last 6 years both together are an excellent way to create detailed interiors 6 of those for me please
yay its good to see your kids get to build some stuff too sinner  all through the review i was thinking this was a present  but who actually put it together so im glad the last pic cleared things up as for the set  it looks much bigger than i expected  i think it does make a good sized dollhouse there are a stack of nice pieces in there  cupboards oven transblue 2x5 bricks all the accessories plants flowers food the lightup brick the pink roof slopes  but not enough to justify the aud129 retail price maybe on sale id pick it up and resell the belville figs but david jones hasnt even had a regular 20 off lego sale for the whole of this year that ive seen i think the playful puppy set is a horrendous ripoff for aud20 though i agree with the baby catapult  the range is terrible lego just isnt trying any more is it at least theyve moved on from throwing cats off three storey buildings 2 questions though 1 was it a fun build 2 are those large figs anatomically correct under their froufrou finery if not what the hell are they doing in the second pic whilst baby sylvia explores the oven
great review and i note something like a bucket in the dog set shame its not blue as for the fire place piece i love it and i want one ever since finding it on mlcad i love the bbq it looks so good you know i might even buy this it it was not so pink now as for the kiddies in ovens make sure they are not over cooked they can be stringy  and as for the couple up stairs now we at least know what you do with your mini figs when no one is looking lego sets in public places  just following your name sake i guess and i must say lego shame shame that catapult needs reviwing hardly even make a dent in a castle wall regards cpt pb
a nice review with a nice touch of sinner which made me laugh the playfull puppy set has saussages i think i would buy a playfull puppy it has nice pieces and the puppy can also be used for minifigs as a big dog why havent they not made a saussagesseller for city maybe in the future there are already more chickenlegs in minifigs sets
shoc on jul 12 2008 1220 pm said a bucket in disguise as a watering can bucket pale same thing its can be called a watering pale
aw sinners playing with toys again great review the set is good for parts it appears and that bedroom scene isinteresting
sveltecorps on jul 12 2008 0319 pm said 2 questions though 1 was it a fun build 2 are those large figs anatomically correct under their froufrou finery if not what the hell are they doing in the second pic whilst baby sylvia explores the oven it was sort of fun but it really is just a lot of big pieces the kitchen stove is smart though as for the figs yes i forgot to add pictures of the happy couple here they are hinckley on jul 12 2008 0327 pm said when your daughter outgrows it will you turn it into a belleville star wars moc please thank you in advance it could be a while ask me again in three years wout on jul 13 2008 0358 am said why havent they not made a saussagesseller for city maybe in the future there are already more chickenlegs in minifigs sets i agree theres a good chance of me borrowing certain parts in the future whitefang on jul 13 2008 0707 pm said sinner you are a very nice dad i like how parents buy educational toys for their children to expand their imaginations instead of sitting in a couch playing video games and etc thanks but i must confess she does play with our ps3 too vbbn on jul 15 2008 1130 am said aw sinners playing with toys again when did i stop elishelrot on jul 15 2008 0554 pm said thanks for your report and the pics my sister wants this set but shes already got the last house and she doesnt play very often with it but the new one looks very good too im still undecided on if it was a smart buy she played with it a lot this week but last week she ignored it and i had to fix it twice
im confused the finale of big brother australia was last week so why only now are we seeing pictures of housemates brigette and ben performing a striptease and where is rory in his signature gstring very odd
i recognize the clock it came with my old airport set 6392 back in 85 in fact according to peeron it mostly came out in train stations link belville looks horrible to me too barbieish and does not look lego at all would prefer they went with paradisa instead
paanjang16 on jun 17 2009 1125 pm said belville looks horrible to me too barbieish and does not look lego at all i think that is the idea so that means you wouldnt think much of scala then
nice review i got over the gun problem with the shockie since the rebel in the ywing doesnt need one i wish i could have gotten more of these but ill know for next time
nice review jimbutcher  this set is for many reasons awesome but unfortunately i just buy one now i am planning on buying one more in my walmart there are like three in stock but with a high price of 1999 each so maybe just one and will keep it misb

hello all eurobricks members and town lovers this is my first classic town review for today i will be featuring the 6641 4wheelin truck which is produced in 1987 for some younger members in eb you might not have encounter such a baby roaming down the streets horning at others with its big massive truck considering this is a 1987 set such a vehicle size is considered big in those days name 4wheelin truck theme lego system  town year 1987 pieces 80 minifigs 1 price usd650 an image of a 6641 4wheelin truck hello everyone why the name 4wheelin truck it is because this truck is equipped with 4 heavy duty wheels which is considered big among other small vehicles in classic town please take note most of the vehicles that are produced in classic town era are 4studs wide this truck is no exception meet the driver and his truck this truck has a very good combinations of different colors that are common for most town vehicles it made used of blue white and red as its primary combinations i find that this combinations is quite soothing to its eyes especially the blue bricks in addition the minifig torso is superb the driver must be a great fan of this vehicle i realised most truck drivers in the classic town era wear this most of the time i wonder if its some kind of an organization front view there is 2 red doors coupled with the truck to enable the driver to get in properly this vehicle is considered big in the 1980s however if you compared it with the current city vehicles this truck certainly will not outsize the current designs please take note of the wheels the wheels are pretty different i dont remember seeing these wheels in many other vehicles maybe some members can help me on this most of the classic town vehicles have a window frame on top which is known as a sunroof in this set this feature is also included furthermore the vehicle frame has a simple mechanism which all town lovers love it is to lift it up and place their driver in and out the seat most importantly you do not have to take off the entire window frame just to put in the driver different angles of the 4wheelin truck snot technique back 20 years ago lego had been experimenting with snot technique you can see that the back looks very neat without the studs in addition it can be quite useful to place a minifig on top of it or throw some baggage for some quick getaway summary review playability 810 great addition to your town collection design 8510 very good design i love 4studs truck at least it is able to occupy one side of the lane price 910 an inexpensive set based on the 1987 pricing overall 8510 a must have for all classic town lovers we have been complaining for more wider range of vehicle i gave it a 4 based on my review score card what about yours hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine pictures can be found in my brickshelf when moderated edited by whitefang 13 july 2008  1208 pm
glad you guys liked this review bernddasbrot on jul 13 2008 0733 pm said great review of a lovely set thank you sadly i dont see my 6641 really often because it is kind of in the back of my shelf but i might get it and swoosh it  a few times imho i think 6675 is a little bit more aggressive cool please make more swoosh it around i will prefer to use it to vrooom it around on my road baseplates bernddasbrot thanks for reminding me of the 6675 i will need to find it and restore it first meanwhile watch out for more upcoming classic town reviews
whitefang on jul 13 2008 1125 am said the wheels are pretty different i dont remember seeing these wheels in many other vehicles maybe some members can help me on this first of all another great review thanks for doing these as for the wheels these were primarily technic wheels but did find their way into some other models in white i can only find a handful of minifig sets that they are included with theres half a dozen space sets but apart from the 4wheelin truck the only other town set appears to be the 6524 blizzard blazer tractor with snow plough the wheels were also in a train set called 4549 road  rail hauler where they were the wheels on a big forklift cheers rog
love this set nice review also i had the set in my hands a few times but never bought it though i drooled at it i remember i guess i didnt get pocket money at that time it was not that common around europe in the 80s i guess so better to say that no one bought it for me a few years later i got the safari truck which is also really sweet i like the colors of this model and the detail of it the minifig is really classic made only for this set appears in some later train sets as well and shows the exact image of the truck on the shirt including the motor piece one of the most detailed and loveliest little sets from a sweet era of legoland city ps voted o for outstanding edited by zzz 14 july 2008  0950 am
hmmm i probably would not have bought this as a kid in 1987 unless i had money to spare or the shop had no other set from space or castle the two other big lines in 1987 and no better set in the town section i think its a great parts pack but the model itself does not look very attractive i never really liked those wheels honestly theyre from the basic sets mostly and they work pretty well in those but im just not a fan the roof on the other hand was very popular and the blue modified bricks at the front were quite rare in those days but generally speaking this was not the star of 1987 gave it a 3
dear afol friends due to leakage of production plant in our country one member of our lego club had bought a new promo set until now he placed only photo of the box later on promissed to make a review heavenly god i wanna one at all costs most were found here edited by sinner 17 july 2008  1247 am put photos in

whitefang on jul 14 2008 1123 am said hinckley is it ok for me to share a picture or two on the vestas exhibition that happened few months ago in singapore dont worry its not anything related directly to the vestas promo wind power plant eris this a test are you working for tlg now im being watched you know theyre outside my window so no not if the set appears in the pictures and if theyre just of the convention post them in community
bagh i missed it all i know is that theres a cottage and van time for brickshelf no doubt theyve been taken down to edit awsome just found the brcikshelf pics edited by skipper 24 14 july 2008  0605 pm
whats so great about the cottage i do agree that the generator and van are teh pwnzorz edit by hinckley we prefer the use of real words here please familiarize yourself with the member guidelines thank you
filefolders on jul 14 2008 0729 pm said whats so great about the cottage i do agree that the generator and van are teh pwnzorz i think the great thing about the cottage is its very reminiscent of classic holiday home type houses that lego used to make like this one from the late 80s which a lot of people me included believe lego need to make more of
i now found pics too thats absolutely  after 10188 town plan this is the best city set ever i really like the neat landscape with the little hill there are a bench and some flowers on it too  and this brilliant cottage  great idea with that power function that the wind mill turns and then enable the lights of the cottage  concerning the city theme i must say in the last time tlg comes up with one great surprise after the other does anyone know where and when itll be available this year i think  otherwise there wouldnt be already pics would they and how much itll cost i think about 70 euros what do you think i only hope that itll be available in germany too otherwise i would be really if i am not able to get it since it is a must for every city and environment fan klausdieter edited by klausdieter 14 july 2008  0649 pm

you just bring memorys back i never had one of the space port sets but i know that as a little boy i visited my toy store and kept on looking to the boxes on bl those sets cost too much for what ist worth today really tlc should bring this theme back space port on
i got this set for christmas and you gave me the feeling for wanting to build it again thanks for the review
the spinning machine is a centerfuge not sure of the spelling  i remember wanting this set because my friend had the larger station with full rocket seeing this makes me want it again
thank you very much for the review now i remember i got mission control when i was only 5 and built it with the help of my older sister i loved it so much i never rebuilt it but now i just have to space simulation was one i never got but looks to be a great set
stop calling them manga guards people that sounds silly its magna guards sorry but i just hate mangas edited by oky wan kenobi 20 july 2008  1128 pm
the figs theyre possibly the best part of the entire set all in all nice new head although the glasses limit its usability i am in love with the head on that fig its perfect for any number of figures  a good scarred hero face has always been on my want list im turning him into my viking warlord after i post this review again a new head great stubbly beard thing going on my secondfavorite head of the lot great for warriors especially with helms the torsos are fantastic for special forces figures if anyones planning to do something like that not too fond of the lime green on there but its still extremely usable this is actually a really cool machine gun i like it i think this would be a good point to note that all designs you see  outside the figures and dinos  are stickers that means a crapload of stickers if you cant stand stickers at all in a set dont buy this
mr legobildur on jul 24 2005 0935 pm said as unexpected as it was this was very helpful  two questions though 1 is the front green rubber missle a traditional launchable missle or does it have another firing mechanism 2 concerning the guns on the side are they fixed in one postition or does it have any functions 3 why did you decide to buy this set just curious 1 oh i overlooked that didnt i in response its an upsidedown launcher so the switch is on the underside so no no special mechanism 2 the gatling guns can be raised but not turned 3 i found it in toys r us and was after a few of the figs but after seeing the box up close and personal decided what the heck its a good break from vikings d
great review jay  tks a lot  i am not that of the big fan of the copter due to its proportions  but i admit its really asome looking better as i expected od the best are those mfs  they are truly awsome  i wiil but some of the smaller sets just for the figs hehe too bad that my favorite  your second best  dont come in the smallers sets   are you going to review the other sets as well  that could be cool 
that looks like a really great set although i dont think id have anywhere to put it i dont think ill ever be able to get the set anyway since it doesnt come out over here
hmmmm     interesting its a shame though because i really like the guns any idea when it should come to europe edit ive just scene the official dino attack site which says theyre coming to europe in october
photos are not available but basically it is guns chains ropes crates
wow i think this is the first time im the first to have a new set at least here and review it got it 2 days ago thanks to a fast shipping from sh this time and i found time now to review it now enough of the babbling lets let the facts and pictures speak which actually turned out pretty well this time set nr 4210 name coast guard platform number of minifigs 4 number of pieces 469 release year 2008 a few shots of the box first 2 books of instructions we got here first one for the helicopter second one for the rest and the platform itself a general overview of the platform from above the 4 minifigs 3 rescue guys and one oil rig worker  the pilot seems not very happy that he has to work in the middle of nowhere at sea right beside the entry of the tower we have the diving equipment holder next the guy can jump in this little speedboat and another guy brings it down to water with the crane if somebody is rescued from the air he arrives here and is brought to the tower with the little moving platform than runs on rails down under we got a buoy and several life belts and extinguishers with the lift somebody who is rescued by the boat can be brought up i think it would been better if they would have made a mechanism there to bring it up but its okay a few floors higher the sea is being observated and watched on the ground level we have the medical stationwarmup room the helicopter as standalone all in all for me this is besides the police station the city set of this year its got great features and looks fantastic and also has many useful pieces you cant do anything wrong with buying it 1010 for me thats all for now hope you liked my review edit oh damn i forgot to write review in the topic title can a mod please add this thanks
excellent review metalandi its always great to see early pictures of new sets this set really reminds me of an oil rig and could probably be easily modified as one if one wanted an alternate model the two components that i like most are the boat crane and the control room but other sections are pretty slick as well are those printed pieces in the control room or stickers im really starting to gain an appreciation for these new coast guard sets theyve come a long way over the years 575 coast guard station released 1978 i picked up the control boat  tower 7739 a few weeks ago but havent opened it yet in any case thanks for taking the time to review this set and share it over eb
i it i dont think im gonna buy it but i loved the review nice oil rig worker he looks so rough undersigned mowo
thanks for the great review im loving this set a lot  it looks well designed and the helicopter is awesome plus i love the new worker figure with the beard quote i agree this is a great set  one of the best of the cg line for sure way better than the boat set with the tower on the bionicle baseplate i wouldnt say that at all  true this base is bigger but the other set was well designed as well  plus the included boat is wonderful
i think it looks good on the real set i thought the darker glass might be good on the ground level so the rescued guy has it nice and dark in there
nice review this is just the crown jewel for the coast guard theme i love the layout of its platform it looks real neat to have it placed it in the midst of the deep blue sea awaiting of any emergency rescue sometimes i feel that this set can used it to merge with my aqua raiders sets i thought of using it as a land base for the raiders to dock in their stuff before submerge into the ocean ok its just a wierd idea of mine just feel that aqua raiders and coast guard can work hand in hand since they are naval expertise it seemed i cant view all the pictures somehow nevertheless i can still view some of it quite well i love the command center the amount of computer printed pieces simply make me smile with the monitor keyboard radar screen and etc the helicopter is cute too however i pity the victim that is loaded at the back it seemed a little bit too dangerous in addition this set seemed to have quite alot of stickers which can be quite discouraging i do hope to see this set soon so far i quite like the current coast guard sets
darthlegois on jul 19 2008 0631 am said and its only 80 ausd do they sell this set in brickandmortar stores in australia
darthlegois on jul 19 2008 0609 pm said i have no idea what a brick  motar store is sorry i mean physical retail stores toysrus etc as opposed to online stores like shophome can you walk into a shop in brisbane and buy this set off the shelf if so ill get my wife to buy me one when she visits the land down under next month edited by tenorikuma 19 july 2008  1027 am
great review metalandi thanks for posting it with a number of pictures the only question is why lego decided to produce so many sets i want to buy in one year
thanks i own this set it was a good time as tlg released a lot of little buildings just look through the 63xxsetnumbers
wow old thread just for the record so long as it is here paramedics are advanced ambulance technicians unlike standard emts they are trained for advanced cardiac life support they can push drugs defibrillate place a breathing tube etc in the 1980s when the set was made it was quite common for paramedics to respond to calls in fly cars or special response units they would join up with ambulances at the scenes that required their skills if you ever watched the old american tv show emergency johnny gage and squad 51 were one of these response units they were mostly phased out in the 90s in favor of simply putting the paramedics and als gear in the ambulances
cool review ive always loved these hard looking tyres i never understood why they dont make them anymore they looked way more offroadish
this is one of my favorite town vehicles from the old time and for one specific reason the truck is on the guys shirt it didnt matter that the color was wrong or the hook was missing i thought it was awesome beyond imagination for some reason thanks for the review whitefang
i rate this a 5 one of my last sets before my dark age suspension wheels are superb and are rare the minifig although smiling really looks tough because of the tanktop oh did i say im giving it a 5
4 stars the suspension wheel holder totally rocks yeah though the slope brick 45 2x3 x 1 13 double disappoints me a little btw the 6350 pizza to go van looks soooo cute thanks for the review and keeeeep them coming
thanks for all of your encouraging comments i am glad most of you love to view our classic reviews do stay out for more upcoming exciting classic town reviews i appericiate greatly by all of your words there are many outstanding reviews from brickster as well especially those classic vintage lego sets that i had never seen before except browsing it in brickset therefore i will encourage eb members to take some time off to view these truly wonderful classic reviews trust me it shall be an eye opening experience for each and everyone of you whom had never seen classic town in such an up close personal experience before lasse d on jul 19 2008 1222 am said this is one of my favorite town vehicles from the old time and for one specific reason the truck is on the guys shirt it didnt matter that the color was wrong or the hook was missing i thought it was awesome beyond imagination for some reason the torso is just lovely i felt the 6641 4 wheelin truck is almost identical with the torso except for the front color combination click onto the picture for an instant review bernddasbrot on jul 19 2008 0247 am said btw the 6350 pizza to go van looks soooo cute yes that cute pizza van appeared for a reason
45 ive had this set since i was young never understood why a tow truck needed to be an offroader maybe it was used to tow the other offroad vehicles the suspension made the truck too tall to tow some cars so i often took the hook out and use the truck as just an great offroad truck like 6672 which also had the suspension wheels other tow truck sets better filled their roles better but that doesnt diminish this set at all whitefang on jul 18 2008 0919 am said i think it looks really out of proportion no for 25odd years this vehicle was perfectly proportioned with all others in the towncity line its all these new 6 and 8 and 20 wide vehicles that are ignoring convention and making it look out of proportion granted speed racer sets are more of their own line but 6660 is smaller than most of the cars produced in the last few years
nice its like an alternative to the shell petrol company sets we had over here in the uk or did you have them to edited by skipper 24 19 july 2008  0421 pm
i much prefer the shell version of that station which had the full awning over the roadway and the special road plate with the extra lane to pull into to fill er up
i love this set its nice and simple maybe its because i build this set by myself by ordering all parts and buildinginstruction and i made one extra tanktransporter

brickster you need your own sticky review section i love looking at all of these old sets as i have said before you take me back to a much simpler time thank you and on to the set i love this gas station lego really needs to look to its past on some of these sets for the time the level of detail is great i wish i still had this one in one piece as well
okay guys i have built the set so lets review set name 7649 mt201 ultra drill walker price 6999 pieces 759 bought from tor r us in michigan us the box first we have the front it shows the set its functuns and the limited edition sign the box is huge about the size of the dino attack chopper set or the mars mission base nowadays most set that are 5000 or more have a flap displaying the sets functions opening theflap on this box reveals a gigantic picture of the set and the back the bags numbered next the manuals they have piece call outs page numbers etc there are 2 manuals with this set sticker sheets they actually arent all that bad random manual image build first we open bag 1 this will build the alien craft and the minifigures now here we have some interesting parts a green spine from exoforce and a black rim for the set container stacker next we start the build on the alien craft it is pretty sturbdy but has no cockpit for the alien the alien stickers are really cool they are rainbowish and has a silver back next come the build on the wings and the finished craft it is pretty good and has a nice sleek design however i think i will use the large ship for the commander out this year to fight the driller instead next is bag 2 which builds the rover and astro ship first is the ship it starts off with doctor infernos colors it builds up very nice and the detail is absolutley amazing next the roof is built it has some speed racer slopes the hinge piee now has a hole through it sorry for the blurry pic more is added then comes the bottom piece the detail is very nice and the hinge piece has a use later on then you build the crates each one holds two crystals added to the ship also a pic of the finished ship here we start the rover it sports anice detail the orange studs get coveded by the grill to look more like an engine the detail in this thing is pretty good it has a gun and shovel here is how it fits into the ship it slides in and is secured thanks to the hinge okay so next we open the number 3 bag which builds the body here are some interesting pieces then we start the build it begins nice and study i just love these stickers with the bulldogs on them more of the build with the stickers added next we add in the front part the detail is again outstanding with the turntable added it can move down as well the next step is to build the water tank it utilizes the bionicle boostersbig white things and added to the walker then we build that drill it uses a lot of rims and such with the gears added the front part uses a lot of those new droideka 3prong things and bionicle eyes the drill can spin thanks to the gears and added to the vehical next is the cockpit it has a nice space for the astros bckpack added the final stage is the legs thank god they arent like striking venoms they are all the same however see those two rubber parts those keep it in place when on surfaces like glass next come the large part of the legs these are similar to the assault tigers legs the final result is very sturdy thanks too notice the amazing classic space sticker so we finally come down to this the final result is amazing it is sturdy and has great detail it is very realistic and when the ship is removed the drill goes down and the turret is aimed up hope you all enjoyed the review
i cant wait that thing looks amazing also the new lego idol episode i told you about a few weeks ago is up edited by cyclone titan 19 july 2008  0602 pm

iamded on jul 20 2008 1236 am said anyway i dont normally like it when people make a topic to say theyll review a set soon but ill let you off since this is one of the few mars mission sets i really like and im glad to know somebody has the set and will be reviewing it peace this practice annoys me as well  especially since i built this set last night and considered making it my first review until i saw this thread i dont want to step on any toes so ill let the original poster go ahead with the full review in short to tide everyone over this set is fantastic i really like the alien ship and the main drilling unitbreak away ship is an awesome unit with tons of play value highly recommended edited by clubninja 20 july 2008  0341 pm
is it seriously this set was a mustbuy for me in the first place but now that i see it in so much detail its just perfect even the alien ship is better than usual i love the scooter that flies out of the escape pod the backpacks bulldog stickers and water tank d ill be getting this one space fans unite
ok minus ten for the placeholder but plus about ten million for the review this set is just amazing its really earned its colors and im sure no classic space fan can complain even snefroe  i didnt know it had the tilting function for the drill sh is so pathetic with its pictures and they really missed this amazing function the detachable ship is so cute its almost classic space in its design major thumbs up to tlc hell make it a hug even

grevious on jul 20 2008 1243 pm said wonderful review id die if i had to upload that many pictures man this is it the pinacle of mars missions second and final year man this baby is flawless there are so many indications that the designers took care in designing this kit  like the space for the pilots backpack the compartment for the mini flier the sturdy leg design  etc etc etc kudos to tlc for making mars mission go out with a bang i have high hopes that whereever the space theme goes next year tlc will make it worth the wait thanks and yes it took me half an hour just to resize them and an hour to upload them to brickshelf algernon on jul 20 2008 0109 pm said is it seriously this set was a mustbuy for me in the first place but now that i see it in so much detail its just perfect even the alien ship is better than usual i love the scooter that flies out of the escape pod the backpacks bulldog stickers and water tank d ill be getting this one space fans unite ah very good and the detail is truley a part in this set the water tank is actualy pretty nice sinner on jul 20 2008 0729 pm said nice review i really want this set but i love most mars mission sets so it shouldnt be a surprise its great to see a good driller at last i feel the same way we have been considering closing topics like this in vbbns defense he was fast thanks mr mandalorian on jul 20 2008 0817 pm said ok minus ten for the placeholder but plus about ten million for the review this set is just amazing its really earned its colors and im sure no classic space fan can complain even snefroe  i didnt know it had the tilting function for the drill sh is so pathetic with its pictures and they really missed this amazing function the detachable ship is so cute its almost classic space in its design major thumbs up to tlc hell make it a hug even lol thanks i just wanted to claim my place for the review however from the looks of it only me and another member have this set sinner on jul 21 2008 0252 am said i agree i told him that if nothing more exciting turned up i would and thus i have thanks cardinal brick on jul 21 2008 0255 am said excellent review its a great set i really love the look of the little ship would it be possible to get some walking pictures of the walker thanks and sure i shall have them up tonight holodoc on jul 21 2008 0308 am said wooha i thought i never would see a nice mars mission set but this walker ist the best proof i was wrong it really looks good and i love the bricks used to make the shape the airtank is cool and for once i have to say even the stickers are looking good man did i really say that normally i hate stickers nice review some pictures would have gotten better with macro on but as it seems to be time to forgive i won´t point on that any longer thank you very much vbbn thanks and i keep forgetting to put on macro i really need to gloriusshadow on jul 21 2008 0548 am said holy brick i just love the water tank and those legs are soooo cool i dont think i have enough cash to buy after the star wars releaseyikes thanks vbbnfor a super review welcome few things build time 30 hours and my favorite stickers of the set
looks like a great set i may consider making this the first mars mission set i buy nice review also but quote lol thanks i just wanted to claim my place for the review personally i dont think you had a place to claim somebody else could have also gotten this set and had a proper review ready before yours but felt it was wrong to post because you had posted a placeholder  clubninja in this case i think placeholders should be banned and if you are not ready to post a full review you should not post anything simple really either that or what is the policy on here regarding more than one review of a set being posted  then you could have both posted reviews and it wont really matter i guess just my 2 cents worth thanks for the review though
iamded yes it seems the dragon is used as such in the picture of the alternate model but i guess bad and evil knights also wanna have some fun sometimes you are right with the green plate on the second floor it does look a bit disturbing but that can
metalandi on jul 20 2008 1223 pm said i actually got one set left i would like to review but im off tomorrow to italy until thursday so i wont be able to do it until then you wont be off till tomorrow thats still a day away theres still time no but still ill be looking forward to the review when you get back peace
i have this set and ilike it 6097 have many usefull parts greate review
metalandi thanks for doing this fright knights review by opening up a misb set which you have bought recently i am very sure the feeling is very nice especially touching the bricks which is preserved for 11 years sealed in bags i am quite fond of the fright knights theme unfortunately this theme was released during my dark age i never really bought sets from fright knights instead i bought plenty of minifigs to build an army if i could turn back time or find another misb set with a reasonable price i am very sure i will get it my soldiers need a castle to stay in i will be looking forward to your next review keep up the good job
wow what a cool castle and set in general i had no idea that this set existed long dark ages thanks to you metalandi for such a great review the figures look really nice and the set is full of lots of little trinkets  details traps etc i have already had a look on ebay for this set looks like a great set for parts too i give the review 455 evil witches cheers isc
good review  the photo from above shows off the scale of the castle much better than the box photo i was one of those who always thought this set looked lame ever since first seeing it in the catalogue a couple of my siblings had smaller bat lordfright knight sets and enjoyed the accessories and style of the minifigs etc so last year having not only ended my dark ages but done so for some of the rest of my family i got this set off ebay for my sister for christmas i of course had to build it to make sure all parts were there before leaving ebay feedback and ending the transaction first impressions were of how much brick there was to the set as well as really useful large structural elements and to be honest while perhaps a bit childish theres no doubt the style of the minifigs is kinda cute and useful for customs it was really enjoyable building this set and the scale is impressive when built empty spaces notwithstanding but hey lego has always had buildings with no back etc  just use your imagination and enjoy the access to playspace offered the traps etc are neat and more like the kind of action features modern sets come with i for one am in favour of these for kids they are fun and i think for builders they give ideas cause they are often done with minimal parts or impact on the set design anyways needless to say my sister loved the set indeed shes currently rebuilding it for the second time if i see it as cheap again i will pick up one for myself i got the first one at €30 incl postage i believe
i got a couple of the small sets from this line when it came out recently i acquired several more from bricklink because i just really love the way they look this theme really had good intentions but the execution was flawed i hope one day lego returns to a darker tone but maybe next time it could be more castlevania inspired that would really turn some heads plus vampires and gothic aesthetics are really popular now it will probably have run its course by the time lego would be able to develop a theme around them though
i am a proud owner of this set this is one of the best fire stations ever what amazes me is what the designers made with only 368 pieces you get a very nice looking building in good size a good baseplate 2 cars 4 minifigs accessories and great alternative ideas in the back of the box like the fire boat or helicopter this is a great example of lego design
thanks everyone for the comments its great to see that you enjoy these classic reviews esp this set panda9001100 on jul 20 2008 0310 pm said i made a little modification excellent youve also got some other very nice sets there like that awesome monorail you should share a review rupi on jul 20 2008 0425 pm said i am a proud owner of this set its great to hear that some of you have this classic fire station it really is a nice set with great vehicles and accessories i also think the overall design is excellent
holodoc on jul 21 2008 0716 am said i gave it a 4 there is always room for improvement like the helipad mentioned so it can´t be a 5 in my opinion take off you rose coloured glasses youre a tough reviewer
thebrickster on jul 21 2008 0320 pm said youre a tough reviewer darthlegois on jul 22 2008 0854 am said i voted 3 its realy not that great but its ok and you call me a tough reviewer
carrera124 on 05 august 2012  0735 pm said great review great set nice look great features very playable please dont bump old topics unless you have something substantial to add for our policy on topic bumping see the eb faq thanks
this brings back a lot of memories as i used to have that set when i was a kid great review
good but i like the heli of set 6571 better another 4 from me
well its ok but its not great voted 3 seems the classic town hater has voted a 1 again will the madness ever stop
thats a great reviewpoll whitefang i gave this set a 5 its simply  the only thing which i miss are the respirators for the firemen since they already own air tanks but otherwise this set is brilliant i like it much more than the new one from 2007 since its not that big and juniorized klausdieter
guys thanks for all your great comments nikola bathory on jul 22 2008 0657 pm said it offers very good playability and this ladder is so long you can have so much fun with it yes the extended length of the ladder provides great playability klausdieter on jul 25 2008 0301 am said i like it much more than the new one from 2007 since its not that big and juniorized thanks kd i owned the 2007 fire engine as well as this set was not restored back then and i needed a fire engine very badly i managed to restored it somehow and i compared it with the 2007 the older design is still the best osakana on jul 25 2008 0403 am said great set i found only one major fail  this  the hands of robot arms gets easly broken yes this is an interesting finding i remembered when i was a child that robot arms always come out of its own when i fiddle with it i was so annoyed by it and i just kept it there whenever i deployed it for rescue missions grevious on jul 26 2008 0200 am said however i honestly wouldnt consider it the best firetruck ever i actually like the one from 2005 even better  becasue like most of the city vehicles it adds the needed bulk big engines like fire trucks need many of the older kits while awesome were honestly a little too skinny imo grevious i appericate your honest comments and given me your insight towards this set and state a comparison as well i agreed with you that fire engines need to be big and sturdy on the other hand it can be nice to have the fire engine to look slim as well to cut through the traffic easily i am not against with the newer sets it just that part of the reasons which reflected in the review had fufill the basic key factors of a typical fire engine in addition it was my alltime favourite under the firefighting theme

yorkiejim on jul 21 2008 0707 pm said this should be front paiged the pictures dont seem big enough and its not much of a reviewno offence its small pictures and a rating we need criticisms improvements and thoughts people also you spelt paige wrong its page
can i see a closeup from that bacta tank
skyotic on jul 21 2008 0718 pm said can i see a closeup from that bacta tank also could we see a closeup of the inside or the gunship and cockpit inside meaning the the back view rooms compartments thanks
it looks like a really good set and like it is a lot larger than the old one thanks for the review
thank you that was what i guessed  but i didnt see any detailed pictures of 10195 do we have the instructins or something now is that how dropship lifts the walker 
i dont think we have instuctions yet but on topic i have an atte in the mail on the way so i should have a review of it in the next week or so jifel
cagri on mar 10 2009 0610 pm said sorry for reanimating this topic there is a technic brick in the mid section of this set does anyone know the function of that  yup this is the one right
exactly kim thats what i meant i pondered and wondered that for a long time  i decided to ask here when a friend wondered the same thing i hope it fits with the new droship it would be really cool and its also great that tlg knows what theyll be prodcuing a year later

okay if this were the first review of the set id understand your want to reserve a thread for your review but seriously there are already reviews out there couldnt you have just waited at least until you had actually built the thing or even better until the review was actually done sorry if im being to harsh but im quite sick of these blablabla set review  will be up soon its getting quite annoying peace
thank you oky wan and apologies to the rest of you guys i guess i was rushing a bit and didnt think this through it was wrong of me to reserve a review if someone does an indepth review before me someone please close this topic otherwise i guess i will do it again many apologies for opening this topic before i actually had a review bad example from me very sorry
i wonder if the only way to have a functioning openclose cockpit is with superglue
dovchenko on jul 29 2008 0104 am said good but you said that you thought that cody was orange but he turned out to be orange heh i caught that too on topic nice review jimbutcher cant wait to get my hands on one dsr
i really like the new gunship different enough from the old one to be better but similar enough that they dont look totally weird together really like the new minifigs didnt think i would like the new clone troopers at all the accessories are fine i would never use them on the regular clones but to each their own

courleciel on jul 29 2008 1116 pm said whats this thing on the clone at right  thats the flashlight  watch the clone wars trailer and ull know  theres a scene where the clones enter a dark cave with a metal door like jabbas palace in the movies
ah yeah sorry  of course  i see thanks
whitefang on jul 29 2008 1254 pm said jimbutcher finally i had seen something that is worth reading and viewing imho this is your best star wars review i had ever read most importantly it is a complete review which has substance you have my thanks keep up the good job wow that means a ton whitefang thanks a bunch and i agree you should try to get this one asap you wont regret it i personally dont think its overpriced the new molds give it a higher price considering 1 old mold   is worth 10 cents
hey everyone my wife took me to legoland for my birthday just last week we had a fantastic time and it gave me the chance to pick up some of the new castle sets and battlepacks i was really impressed by the sets i bought and decided to do my first review let battle commence set name tower raid set number 7037 price gbp £1999 pieces 364 the models heres a shot of the complete set the set is made up of two models the crown knights tower and the orcs siege tower lets start with the crown knights tower a knight readies himself for battle my favourite model from the set the wicked orcs siege tower please note that for the purposes of display i mounted the orcs banner onto a small cone set on the top platform of the siege tower this doesnt come with the set but saves any orcs having to hold onto it all he time there are other areas it can be placed without using extra parts features both models look great and have excellent features the set as a whole has great playability and seems to have been concieved with a storyline the crown knights have a captured orc within the walls of their tower so the orc army has been sent out to recover him or are they merely after the gold the knights keep horded away the orcs siege tower has a powerful ram  springloaded by the simple arrangement of an elastic band  so pulling it back sends it flying out the front knocking down the wall on the side of the knights tower and releasing the captive orc the floor panels inside the prison are laid over a lip on the inside of the collapsible wall so fall in when theyre not supported theres a string at the rear for extending the boarding ramp and letting a fearsome orc warrior charge across flickfire action the battle heats up as the orcs close in the minifigures the crown knights i really like the crown knights theyre metallic helmets look great and they come with nice accessories the archer has a double printed head with a frightened look on the other side too im not surprised id be frightened when staring over the ramparts at these the orcs these guys really do look the part worthy advesaries to the crown knights the details are superb the printed elements weapons and helmets all set the orcs aside on the battlefield the set comes with a great new molded armour neckpiece too the mighty orc leader looks wicked in his full battlegear overview theres so much to this set its hard not to be impressed the orcs siege engine is a thing of beauty or terror and would look great on any battlefield the crown knights tower although basic looks good and has great playability im a big fan of the new castle knights and fantasy minifigures and the inclusion of five of them is just enough for this set and as a booster to any army at £1999 in the uk this set is well worth the money for content and quality id highly recommmend this set as a musthave purchase for anyone a final shot of the siege tower with a host of orcs ready for battle i hope you enjoyed my review ill be posting my next one for 7040 dwarves mine defender soon
excellent review and your pictures are very good i look forward to seeing more review i really like this set i got it some time ago and keep meaning to post some pictures of it going up against some of the older castles
very nice review pedro you beat me to it there was a review done about january but i wanted to have a go just havent opened the box yet great pics and well demonstrated action elements too i rate this as one of the coolest castle sets just for its playability and 5 figures this will def add to my orc army and i may purchase more of this set if they dont release a orc bp keep up the good work

i scream clone on jul 29 2008 0639 pm said i dont suppose you have seen the troll impulse in aus yet nah got it in singapore when i was on a business trip got like 10 of the things now theyre 650 sing
thanks for the review from this set i prefer the crown knights tower  its a very goodlooking structure
whitefang on jul 30 2008 1256 am said pedro for your first review you have amaze me with your photo session and the strucutre of your review i am very impressed by your high quality pictures you have done an excellent job i completely agree this is an amazing review  bits of humor great photography and detailed descriptionsphotos based upon this review ive placed an order for this set along with some convincing from amazons 20 sale  the only drawbacks in this set that i can see concerns the tower with it being 1 small compared to the seige tower and 2 missing a few walls however this is also the joy of lego as one can simply purchase a few bricks and build their own walls andor expand the towers size or even attach it to a castle of course this increases the price of the set but considering how cheap bricks are on bricklink tower raid is still a very good value i hope you continue doing reviews pedro
i have one of these and must say that this is the best castle set in the theme and the most useful parts pack for its size yet
nice short review although a little hard to read i agree that this set is a really great one
i really liked this set its cheap and comes with a good supply of flesh heads and the new hair mold i love the tent too id give it a 1010
the only indy set i considered worth purchasing so far great source of various parts  plus you gotta love spalkos hair edited by dreamweb 01 august 2008  0955 pm
a great price point for a nice bunch of figs and accesories pity about the fleshies though god bless nathan
i picked this up last weekend mainly also for parts it came with two mutt heads instead of a irena head  but anyway its a nice little 10 setwe need more sets like this that include these myriads of detail parts

 that was a weird race anyway i love the look of both sets but ill have to go for the dino attack quad for a couple of reasons it is postapoc which i love features tan and dark red colours which are far more useful than yellow you get more bang for your buck with the dino set you get a little dino sure you can hate it but better than not having one right and the fig has much more useful pieces and a better face thanks for the face off thebrickster batbrick away
ive got to go with the town one since you have to stand on the dino one steve
i like the dino thingy because of the pieces and the dino is a lot of fun on its own i know thats akward
dino attack quad for me no this isnt because i own it and not the other one but because i think just about everything is better in it  the design is better the colors are cooler and it has a better figure i dont like the figure in the coast guard quad at all  but since it was from world city im not suprised i also kinda like the dino actually its flexible and fits in with the previous dinos a lot better than the cruddy bigger ones with bright red yellow and green highlights
ooooooh this is a very hard choicei like this new coast guard theme but i loved dino attackthe dino attack set has a weird looking gunbut imo the coast guard set lookscleaner if you get what i meanthe little dinolizard thing is practically worthless thats why i have a bin full of those little guysi want to keep liking dino attack i just cantso i know your like just get to the point already so i guess i have to go with coast guard thebrickster on aug 3 2008 0941 am said i did not know that europe had a different quad or at least one without the bazooka interesting that the gun was removed from the european sets or added to the us sets i sort of like the chain i also notice a big difference in the boxart destroyed city to prehistoric volcano i wonder if the story was different as well thanks for sharing a good picture  well it does look like the dino quad has the upper hand almost double the votes wow i would have so much wanted the european one more than the us one i mean that bazooka or as they called it a sonic screamer looks very silly
i know it would really go well with the rgs but it is not enough for £50 ill wait for the sales at christmas
nice review  for portugal it costs 60€ i also consider it oversized it shold be the third of that size portugal and spain may have good prices but 90€ for the v19 must be a tippo
im really mad this isnt even out in the us i want this set really bad
one question do the top panels on the rotating rocket assembly mounted in the skids pop off regularly when you flip them back and forth the ones on the version i built from the instructions posted online seem to eject with the slightest provocation
must buy now totally sweet not available in canada yet well designed and cheap for clone wars im going to mod it so that it looks like the imperial version
christian thanks for this outstanding review i have been waiting for this moment for someone to do up an excellent review like this republic fighter tank is my 2nd favourite set in my clone wars list the 2 clone troopers could be easily add up to your rgs since it offer only more trooper however i felt that this set is quite overpriced in fact all clone war sets are very expensive the fighter tank has a very great color combination of red and white to represent the republic the wheels below is the most impressive feature which enable the hovering feel the hatch is a neat feature as well however i noticed there is a rubber band within the control panel may i know what is it for i really enjoy viewing this review you had given the insight which will eventually determined whether to get it any sooner or later pr0visorak on aug 2 2008 0535 pm said this set costs a s100 in singaporei went to hng kong too see lego and the shops there are more expensive by a few dollarshoweveri went to australia before and everything there is the same price but when there is a sale it becomes very cheap hello pr0visorak you are from singapore as well welcome to eurobricks i hope you will do an introduction to the rest of the members in this forum in singapore it cost sgd10000 in fact that was the promotional price therefore there is no further discount for it
i personally think this is a great set but a little pricey i wish it was available in the us though
good review i would get this set but sadly they dont have it anymore i wish they did to get those sweet figs the battle droid colors are sweet the only set with geonosians
great review man doi wish i had those red droids im using the dell xps1 and holy crap is it clear those pics were beautiful
thanks for the review skipper this is one of my favourite sets i really like the colour scheme and the geonosians are awesome keep up the good work kimt
i always thought this looked liek a cool set with lots of nice and sadly unique pieces unfortunately the only attack of the clones sets i got were the jedi starfighter and yoda vs dooku amazing sets but i would love to have owned them all id never really looked into this set very much so thanks for the review
this is actually one of my favorite star wars sets awesome rare pieces and excellent construction geo figs are a plus too best of all its nice and cheap
7263 tie fighter review parts 159 figs 2 price £2000 not sure my 2nd review today this set came out about the same time as the rots sets and included the first minifig to have a lul 1 box  manual this is the front of the box it has a try me slot for the lul vader a close up of the try me slot luckily i got mine form argos so no little kids have been playing around with it the manual cover im not quite sure why it has a pic of the figs on the front but it doesnt deface it so i dont mind random manual shot rots set preview at the back of the manual 2 general set and figs the contents of the set  the minifigs a normal tie pilot and the first ever lul fig dv also my only lul fig no helmets tie pilot torso the lul is made of 3 parts lighted up the led for the blade 3 the tie fighter just a pic of it cockpit with controls tie pilot sitting in the cockpit by the way the hinge brick is the wrong color it is supposed to be grey the cockpit shut i wonder why tlc never printed those cockpit glass things correctly jet out the back top plate has some nice printing 5 overall build 510 very repetitivewell the ships symmetrical minifigs 410 1 tie pilot which is okay but a lul vader he cant even fit in the ship design 610 strong but the wings are all wobbly if that makes sense i dont like the blue either parts 610 lots of blue grills thingys not much else but it got 6 because of the wings plates price 510 could have been more expensive at least it had 2 figs playability 110 cant do much as a stand alone set overall 410 there just isnt enough here it could at least have a better color scheme and instead of dv it could come with a stormie like the old one did
thanks for the review i actually like the older tie better since it had a stand for the tie not really a fan of the lu figs either no matter  a tie is a tie and this is a must have fighter for any lego sw fan out there never can get enough ties except the tie advanced or vaders tiethey dont rock kimt
thanks for the review ill definately get this set sooner or later imo the tiny turbos are awesome i actually bought nearly every set so far built the models added the stickers and packed them away in ziplock bags in the attic sadly i dont have display room for them yet a fine set carwise dump the slammers and buildings into the spare bag and keep the cars kimt tiny turbos on
looks like a pretty good set with a some nice colors the spider is probably the best model in my opinion but i mean look at the wasp kinda weak it you ask me nice review 
thanks for the review this is another good sw set a true classic i especially like the colourscheme of this set the rebel gun is crappy though but overall the set rocks kimt
great review i bought this set when it came out but sold it a couple years later for some extra cash i have no regrets selling this one as i was never really impressed with it different story for the 4483 atat  oh how i wish i still had that one the snowspeeder was alright just didnt have any sort of wow factor to it the best part of the set is probably the rebel trooper looking at the last photo in your review looks like youre about to have a major battle in your hallway apart from the snowspeeder  motorized atat i see the arc170 fighter grievouss starfighter and is that a podracer i see  and what is the set with the treads its not star wars but looks like a pretty cool set maybe a mission mars vehicle
this is one of my favorite sw sets it is a good size to the hoth base and the atat
7255 general greivous wheel bike chase review parts 111 figs 2 price £1000 the first set to include gg 1 general set and minifigs not manual because i dont have it the contents of the box after being built both minifigs the set includes 5 lightsabers my own design gg ggs cape on the outside ggs cape on the inside 2 the wheel bike front view standing on legs side view gg cant hold the controls because of his arms roller mode the legs are a bit to chunky so to roll it has to be tilted forward 3 boga the lizard grey tip to the tail the front back and saddle split in to three sections 4 overall build 410 there isnt really much to build minifigs 910 it comes with gg with the special cape and obiwan in rots gear which is hard to find i think design 510 not really to scale but otherwise okay apart from boga which just looks like any old dinosaur also the controls on the wheel bike arent really right parts 610 comes with some dark green bricks and lots of rods  the guns on the wheel bike the boga feet are also nice price 810 £10 for 2 figs isnt bad it could have a few more parts though playability 1010 you can easily recreate the movie scenes with this set overall 710 it would be better if the bike and boga were more to scale and more accurate as well as the set having more parts
kimt on aug 3 2008 0322 pm said not one of my favourite sw sets kinda boring and the set is poorly designed imho we do get the general but thats not nearly enough thanks for the reivew and fine pics kimt gg has a capea custom cape what more do you want
thanks again skipper for producing yet another review to go into the index i like this slave1 but sadly i must admit that i like the really old version better boba fetts slave1 that is even though is grossly undersized i think its better than this one belonging to his father jango kimt
i have all three of the slave i ships and i agree with kimtalthough it is a very small compact ship the first slave i boba fett is still the sturdiest the newest slave i boba fett is not bad and is of much better construction than this slave i from jango fett even though i like the size and scale of the jango slave i and the newest boba fett slave iwhen you pick that very first one up it had the feeling ofyou can throw me against the wall drop me off the roof of your house or let 4 two year olds play with meim not gonna break at least thatss my opinion good review
thanks for the review it looks like an interesting set even if not as good as bobas skipper 24 on aug 3 2008 0811 pm said i never got the original boba fetts slave 1 i wish they would make one to scale with the minifigures i would be so cool you mean it would be so cool i agree that it would be if they made a large minifig scale version like with the ucs millenium falcon i would probably try to buy that edited by shoc 03 august 2008  0831 pm
nice review i will say i like the latest slave i the best as it is longer than jangos i havent seen the first one so i cant really comment
that was indeed a set that never appealed to me its build was just plain wrong and awful i only bought it because i found it on clearance at around 15€ and they had 4 of them if i had known better then id have bought all 4 seeing how much that jango fett minifig is worth now  but i ended up heavily modifying it in its propoions and now it looks ok next to the new slave one which is the best one of its 3 incarnations i think
okay i have fixed that pic thanks oky wan i have modified this but then yesterday i built it back to its original state to review it
yep those decals are suffering i am going to apply some new ones now with proper paper
a very nicely done review i remember getting this slave i  it was my first large star wars set
this set looks liek a good buy for 4 wish it was still around but like you said it needs accessories
this little set really makes my point small playable inspiration to build the set into a few other models great set i wish i had it my town is going to need more vehicles i really miss main model instructions with alternate build ideas
good set but its flimsy as sin but that may have been my rush job building it mine got shoved off a bed oh and i lost my light up mace  propably somewhere within the blue bin o doom™ aka the brick bucket™ or blocknull™  edited by maiq the liar 04 august 2008  1015 pm
the kid on aug 4 2008 0820 am said i got the original version of this set with the luls mace windu figure when tlc released the nonluls version i managed to swap  they sent me the new version and a clone trooper iirc and i mailed them back the old version this was a great set the suspension worked great and it rolled magnificently nice review with good photos but again your price is a little off £6999 is the rrp unless the price you paid was £80 tk that was a great idea i never even thought to send it back and get the new one with the other clone and the non lul windu
6701 space minifigures review set 6701 set name space minifigures released 1983 pieces 36 including minifigs minifigs 6 brickshelf gallery peeroncom bricklink bricksetcom introcomment as i reignited my love for classic space a few years ago i decided to start hunting sets i didnt have this small one fell into my lap very cheap with box and minifigs in great condition so now ive resized the pics and done the review and no i am not envious of this forumreallyim not the box the box is pretty neat it has a very comfortable size compared to modern boxes and the back of it shows what you get i like the way they tlg split the minifigs and arranged everything neatly front rear sadly the box has seen better days but its age taken into consideration i think its just fine the figs a fine collection of red white and yellow space figs some great accesories to go as well not much more to say except this was a great armybuilderset a true must have for most classic space fans the verdict its kinda hard rating this set since its a minifig supplemental set no design or colourscheme to comment on it has a lot of playability since figs will always come in handy when buildingplaying with your space sets kimt
thanks for the review kimt i gave this above average i believe i had this one but it was so long ago im still a bit freaked out by the yellow ones when i emerged from my dark ages i kept thinking gee i miss the people packs but now that i have over 500 minifigures i dont feel that way anymore even so i wish they would rerelease some of the classic old ones
i voted above average as well but back in 1983 i would have probably gone much lower sadly i wasnt as interested in minifigs at the time i appreciated the ones i had but i really just wanted ships or bases and would have gladly passed this by for something with one or two figures and a small moon rover i skipped all of the classic minifig sets space castle and town it was only upon coming out of my dark ages that i went minifig crazy for me this is above average because of the accessories without them its an average set with a small brick built droid or a rover it would be outstanding that said id buy at least 10 copies now though id rather have a 4 figure set with one of each colour including blue i never had blue back then i think castle lured me away thanks for an interesting review it gives me a chance to further explore why i changed from shipset to minifig fan and bore all of eb with it
he does have a cape a cap and a bandana around his head thats not the same as being bare as when born edit oh yeah hes also got red gloves on as well btw what does this have to do with the 6701 space minifigures review
good set nice accesories and a good source of yellow figs which seem to be rather rare kdog on aug 7 2008 1227 am said wearing a cape hat and bandanna and nothing else makes it creepier its nude man when he flys his butt whistles dont turn your back on him anyone who spends time on the internet should get the reference i am lucky enough to own both shows on dvd p staudie edited by stauder 07 august 2008  0316 pm
7674 v19 torrent number of pieces 471 number of minifigs 1 price £4999 the v19 torrent starfighter was an assault fighter with exceptional speed and maneuverability used by the galactic republic during the clone warsit was a predecessor of the alpha3 nimbusclass vwing starfighter in terms of purpose and usage it first appeared in the genndy tartakovsky€™s clone wars 2d series basics box front the box art shows the torrent flying above tatooine with the new blue and white €œclone wars€ style packaging box back the back shows some of the features of the set including the lifting mechanism and adverts for 7679 republic gunship 7675 atte and the 7673 magnaguard starfighter inside the box there are 2 instruction books a very small dss and 9 bags that are not numbered bags instruction books random manual shot parts list book one is mainly the construction of the body and one of the engines book 2 is the other engine and the wings for better pics of the manual look on legos website sticker sheet a very small sticker sheet is included which includes 2 republic insignias and a nose sticker minifigure one minifigure is included a clone pilot the whole omg only one minifigure in this set and its not movie accurate i hate you tlc11one2 has been beaten to death so please dont make this review turn into that and to be honest i dont care because its an awesome figure tlc have made the effort to print the life support device onto the chest plate so props to them he has the clone head like the rest of the clones have in the cw releases there are no extra clone bits apart from a long blaster thats not included here interestingother pieces printed piece rareunusual pieces there are 2 pistons included as well as 2 weird looking technic pieces that serve as the landing gear during the build which might explain why the set is quite expensive it musnt have been cheap to manufacture them the build it starts off relatively simple the first 16 steps is getting the basic shape of the cockpit and the mechanism to make the middle wing move up and down after that the next few steps are getting the landing gearwing folding device done its actually the same thing so when the wings move into attack mode the landing gear retracts this is then locked into place by the white beams that form the basic shape of the fuselage up to step 46 is the fuselage as well as fitting the hydraulics this is what it looks like when the fuselage is complete the cockpit is not air tight theres is quite a big gap top bottom the final few steps of book 1 is the construction of one of the engines here it is attatched  the yellow bar is not permanent its used to keep the white bit at the top from moving downwards the steps are repeated in the second book so that both engines are now in on to the wings first one attatched the middle one is attached now and finally the last one it is now finished the pieces that are left so youre probably wondering how does it enter attack mode well can you see this bar push that bar to the center and pick it up the hydraulics move the central wing downwards as well as the side wings to enter attack mode the outer wings have flickfire missiles on them they obviously dont work but it increases the playability of the set the cockpit opens in a similar way to general greviouss starfighter released last year using a sliding mechanism for other pics see here  https25photobuckeviewstart20 and ill be taking other requests for pics maybe a video of it switching between modes build 710 very symmetrical build the mechanism to move the wings might annoy some people minifigs 510 1 fig in a £50 set however it is a starfighter design 910 very accurate to the source material lego have really made the effort to make the movement feature work parts 810 lots of technic white and dark red pieces price 710 could be slightly cheaper playability 6510 need to buy some enemy sets to get the most of it flick fires dont work comments requests questions and criticisms welcome edited by kimt 04 august 2008  0648 pm indexed and poll added
thanks for the review ive added it to the index and added a poll in which members can vote their opinion on this set i think this is a very good set i like the colours and the very playable feature that allows the wings to lock in attack formation now all i need is to buy this baby edit i gave it an above average rating since its well designed looks sturdy and fits the sw theme sets perfectly
the v19 was my first tcw set i buyed it when i was visiting my father i just wanted to build it there and i do so but how do you will get sthbig like this with in the train so i had to destroy him when i was still home again i had to build it 3 times because the mechanic dont works i only can say that the v19 is one of the best tcw sets thanks to you for the review simonjedi  i just wanted to make one in german but now i neednt to make it
the ability for it to fold in and out of attack position has wowed me this is my top priority now thanks for making up my mind
hydraulic wings i am very impressed and am now considering getting this set purely because of this funciton i am just curious as to know why are there sand green parts on the bottom of the v19 is it visible when the model is completed i am also pleased to see tlc giving us a printed cockpit computer this time around

i built mine today as soon as i tried to put it in attack position the thingy rotates the wrong way and it falls apart what a waste of 55
rayman on nov 29 2008 1016 pm said yes i believe that the yellow technic is only used for the building however i didnt find it neccessary what a strange step its to hold the wing connectors in the the same place while the wing is being attached
daxflame680 on nov 30 2008 0203 am said i built mine today as soon as i tried to put it in attack position the thingy rotates the wrong way and it falls apart what a waste of 55 no not a waste this is one of the best if not the best 2008 star wars set all you need to do is build it correctly
i voted outstanding this is simply an amazingly good looking train and comes with indeed 11 minifigs i sold this one because i need a budget to build my ship but i kept one because i love it not bad for a first review ruben
thanks for the edit hinckley its my first poll and review and i wasnt quite sure if i got it right maiq the liar on aug 5 2008 1220 am said but seriously why is there a civilian train stop in a cave did 1 too many people get lost playing zork yeah i also wondered why the included timetable includes not only real life cities instead of brick ones even more so since the train track just goes round d
oh ruben you lucky so and so this set is one of the most beautful i have ever seen splendid looking build and 11 figures all the same faces like but still you get that old woman pigtail head piece which is just great i thought you meant the monorail set when you told me about this but guess i was wrong dont laugh ive been away from lego for quite some time and for 80 euros it was a real bargain from a great friend really nice review hope this sets brings you years of joy
cool review i actually have two of these i got one for christmas when it was rereleased in 2003 and another one in a charity shop a few months later for €5 i love the minifigs even if they all have smileys and having two sets of them can really fill up a town
im not normally that big into trains but this set has a real coolness factor that sets it apart from most of the others the color scheme is the same one that amtrak and many local subway systems use i picked it up along with the club car expansion when they were rereleased in 2001 i have made various modifications to mine rearranging the car layouts and adding a second train motor into the rearmost car along with another set of lights so that both ends light up as you said it would be great to have an 8stud version of this so you could fit in two rows of seats side by side that might make a nice mod project at some point
ahh the good old train theme how i wish tlg would make such great trains today now that the quality of city sets has improved so much that really brings back memories even if i didnt have this one but a cargo train that came out about the same time period maybe plus a few years i dont have any trains myself at the moment mostly because im afraid i havent got enough space to put in on display with all the rails and stuff
really nice train i always wished tlg would have made the passenger ir train longer and maybe used some of the nice features of this train i still love that faucet piece
my favourite favourite favourite old set its too bad i was born 2 years after its release i would have had a major interest in classic town i might actually get this one on bricklink not that itll go for a good price ill only buy if it does you see an outstanding a highly useful and wellmade set that really just stands out from its counterparts edit nevermind edited by dovchenko 16 august 2008  1025 am

6804 surface rover review set 6804 set name surface rover released 1984 pieces 16 minifigs 1 white classic space minifig brickshelf gallery peeroncom bricklink bricksetcom introcomment i have to keep my fondness for space going and since im no fan of the still new life on mars mars mission theme ive decided to give you another review of a small classic space set more to come in the following days the box unfortunately i havent got the box for this set but peeroncom was kindly enough to support me with a proper pic and as usual this is a small easily brought home sized box oddly tlg doesnt add the flip on top anymore i remember standing in toystores pulling 6 or more sets down from the hanger before accesing the one i wanted it gave buying lego sets that threasure hunting touch snaps out of his daydreaming a small box with a picture of what you get ive got no rear pic so i cant tell if tlg did the same as on the 6701 set split up the inventory the fig one single white classic space minifig this is the worst one in my opinion i never liked those white guys and they get easily damaged by the sun nah give me a red or yellow instead later blue or black the surface rover both i am the lucky owner of two of them yes this is a small showoff  side though small i still think this is a neat little set compared to the modern impulse sets this is high competable i like the simplicity of the small classic space sets and this is no exception the sr is made from very usable bricks that can easily be used for making shipbasecraft mocs rear as you can see one of them has been used for surface exploration for many years it could do with some replacements but i havent had the time yet the verdict a fine little classic set not much more than that it holds some useful bricks and worked fine as an impulse back then the classic childrens birthday presents during the early 80s i got quite a few space and town sets back then remember to vote your opinion on this set i gave it average for the bricks the price back then and as an all in all conclusion kimt
nice review kimt on aug 5 2008 0716 am said the fig one single white classic space minifig this is the worst one in my opinion i never liked those white guys and they get easily damaged by the sun nah give me a red or yellow instead later blue or black even though they get damaged by the sun easily theyre my favorite kind 
outback amazon crossing gday mates another fine review from the legolands desert down under this set makes for an excellent addition to your jungles deserts outbacks or other wild and untamed places set  6490 theme outback year released 1997 piece count 117 minifigs 1 list price 15 usd starting with an image of the box one can conclude that this doesnt look like the amazon at all but rather the outback on the back of the box are some great alternate models including a creative idea for a crocodile zoo scene the instructions have the same images on the front and back the set comes with one outback fig a man dressed in green with a bright red cap  i call him the crocodile hunter also included in this set is a crocodile some bones a skull backpack pan and a few extra trans round 1x1s the tools are pictured on the truck now heres a great desertrugged terrain truck ready for some 4wheeln fun i love the liftable top windowsun roof and the windshield i like the use of these colored trans blue pieces that contrast against the yellow rather than hide like regular clear pieces the truck has a few hooksclips to attach a pick rifle antena and camera also attached is a wateroil can and an extra tire that just rests in the back section the front end of the truck has a great winch and hook to help the truck out of hard places working suspension helps the vehicle travel on rough terrain the truck is just half the fun this set also offers a nice bridgecreek bed for the truck to drive across i like the use of six fenceladder pieces for the bridge the two in the center have double open sides heres the left side and the right side with a single burp as a mountainhill i really like the use of the tan and brown baseplates representing desert and water the complete set as the crocodile hunter tries to climb back into the truck after attaching the winch final thoughts ive always liked this little set it offers a great amount of playability with the wonderful little 4stud wide truck and bridge scene a few years ago playmobil offered a desert racing theme and had this set as my favorite of the collection desert racing and adventures through dry creeks and rough terrain make for a great theme hope you enjoy this review and consider picking up an outback set or two if you can still buy at a reasonable price happy outbacking the complete outback theme 6444 outback airstrip 6487 mountain rescue 6490 amazon crossing 6550 outback desert racer 6553 crisis news crew edit i dedicate this review to the memory of steve irwin 1962  2006 tribute
thanks for this review if youd only know what memories you brought back i think i remember this set better than any other i had when i was a child some time after i got it i decided to disassemble it and combine it with the jeep from 6552 rocky river retreat it came out pretty good though as it became the main attraction point of my town beeing the car of my favourite minifig back then and and and looong story  i kept it assembled that way from this day on until earlier this year when i finally disassembled it because i needed the parts edited by metalandi 06 august 2008  0357 am
great review brickster why exactly did the outback adventure etc themes never quite catch onjust a thought what a great set i wish i had it but in 1997 i was just back from my whirl wind trips around the world and had drifted away from lego i dont know why but i will say this i love the actual suspension that came with this set and the trains sets i have been trying to buy up as much of it as i can and now i see i need to add one more set to the i need to get that
oh i loved this set when i was young i think i got it for my birthday and it was one of my favourite sets at the time funnily enough i was thinking about it the other day and how i really should build it again thanks for the nostalgic review
ok this is the big one the controversial one the one everyone either hates or defends what do i think read on the figs bandana man masked dude dude with shades good figures i miss scarface comes with his torso though which is my favorite the one with the ammo strap across the chest one figure short of the figuretoprice value but we can deal with that the dino the dino its the one that comes with the chopper in green any questions the tank and so it begins i think it looks a lot better in person than on the box the left side good time to mention that the treads run pretty easily and this is a very playable set right side keep an eye on that flap in the center  and we have a folding ladder the back probably the weakest point of the set apart from the dino the turret turned and tilted the mechanism works extremely well and the gun seems to work better than others for some reason or maybe it just seems that way the front of the cockpit im at a loss trying to figure out how those tiny windshields defend them against 40foot mutant tyrannosaurus rexes with radioactive breath laser eyes and what have you anyway another one of those neat steering wheels some viking horns and some stickered control panels oh yeah this set has a good amount of stickers probably around 20ish the back of the cockpit i love the little gun it turns 360 degrees and tilts up oh yeah and those green barrels theyve been using are awesome i can think of tons of uses for them the verdict 7610 playability 9410 pieces 7510 figures 8810 dino 310 value 410 the main downfall of this set is the price i would easily pay 30 for this no questions asked but 40 was a hard sell for me  i gave in merely to see what i would think of it and also to help you guys find out the same this is a great display set and a great play set the pieces are good  lots of nice blay beams used in the construction but the price people thats the killer pick this up only if you have everything else or you find it on clearance and thus ends my dino attack review series hope you enjoyed them until next time bloody jay
bloody jay on aug 5 2005 0115 pm said the back of the cockpit i love the little gun it turns 360 degrees and tilts up oh yeah and those green barrels theyve been using are awesome i can think of tons of uses for them what uses might these be
dinobot wrote quote youre luckythey sell those for 60 heream i getting ripped off only if you think you are this set isnt too bad in the playability factor its not that great though a better cockpit and some more armour to this treaded monster is needed thanks for another great review bloody jay and i agree that this set isnt worth the price though the ark 170 is still my least favorite badly priced set graynar
nice review cobra thanks for sharing i think arctic was one of those neat themes that never really took off i like these little polybag sets as they make great startersintroduction sets for themes or serve as a nice supplement or addon to an existing collection ive always liked the thick green hood piece used in the arctic theme and have thought about using it in a sw hoth scene in any case nice review ive got an arctic set that i built recently and will share a review soon
nice review agentrick30 is a good price but tlc think thats €40 so ill have to pass btw i thought this ship was supposed to hold many droids like in sw battlefront oh well its good for show edited by skinny boy 09 august 2008  0931 pm

vbbn on aug 7 2008 0924 pm said what my st came up as the first post it also says you started the topic i cant wait to get this set i was planning on getting it soon but i spent my last money for now on the on sale  v19 torrent the other day in need of a paycheck edited by faramir 08 august 2008  0345 am
agentrick57 on aug 8 2008 0350 am said im confused about that too whats up with that thanks for the review the pics areacceptable perhaps you could redo them in sunlight and with a different background than a carpet ill add this to the index soon and i agree at that pirce this set is definately an ok buy
this is a great set its too pricey though if it was 10 or so cheaper id get it
nice review crudi wish i took this gunship instead of the lego indiana jones game edited by general magma 10 january 2009  0958 pm
im definitely getting this soon a good value for money a cool set and another part to my clone wars collection
i got this yesterday on sale only 5500 yen60 american and was a little disappointed id avoided it but all the new sets are at least a month away here it looks a little weird in photo and the actual build is worse just a flat little disc with a cockpit only special points for the color which will probably just look better with those 2009 sets
general magma on dec 30 2008 0351 pm said crudi wish i took this gunship instead of the lego indiana jones game i take that there back im getting two of those gunships for 2519 each on a sale at sh edited by general magma 10 january 2009  1000 pm
thanks for the review pmj  i like the play value in this set even if i don´t own it  the way the orbs are put into the rocket is awesome and i really like it but at the end the set have some lack of detail 
darkrebellion on aug 12 2008 1217 pm said i like this ship even if it looks so bulky but i need to buy first other sets so maybe this beast will be landing in my collection the next year or this one if i am lucky  i can just ask for something can you post a pic of all your clone wars sets together with this one all the sets in one pic not many pics with this an each set  please  i think a lot of people feel the same way  there was so much good stuff to get in the first wave that this is probably a backburner set for a lot of people and some are probably waiting to see the movie to see how prominently it features i will try and take a pic with some other cw sets i dont have all of them though and some need to be reassembled as i built them on holiday and then had to pack them away i do think this line of sets has been the best sw lego wave released though all of the recent releases have been amazing in their own way
thanks for the review now i thinnk i will buy this set btw i really like what you did to the back i might do the same to mine
i read the visual guide recently and learned a bit more about the twilight i wont get into spoilers but it seems that the ship becomes a sort of endearing family van for the characters which is neat big bulky uncool but it gets you from one place to another if it factors into more than just the 90 minute film i may pick this up it seems that theres room for a lot of personality in this ship once you see the film it is a corellian freighter smuggling spice for the hutts thats cool right
oh no anakin has gone over to the green side of the force well i guess someone had to review the clunkadunk eventually and you did a good job at it svelte corps i liked the punchline with the ahsokahairpiece swapping the ugha warrior upgrade is an interesting way of creating male togrutas and ahsoka looks even hotter with infernos hair matteo kenobi on aug 11 2008 0930 pm said if i am really impressed with it in the film i suppose that would change things but i will have to see  i wouldnt count on it spoiler after its first flight the twilight will crash and burn wookieepedia says so and you can see it in one of the trailers so i guess the twilight will stay mostly unbought poor clunkadunk
sveltecorps on aug 12 2008 0219 am said hmm dior i can smell it now the ship doesnt look too swooshable but then again more than the heavy rgs i really like that review svelte corps so much detail unfortunately i would only get this if it was a very low price like in a sale
thanks for yet another awesome review quote seems like tlc has done a pretty accurate representation of the ship the real fault for the ships messy design has to go to lucasfilm not tlc my guess is lucasfilm is trying to recapture that what a piece of junk magic of the millennium falcon i guess well have to wait to see the movie to see if they succeeded or not this sums up my opinion exactly i can easily admit that the design of the kit is spot on  but unfortunately the actual design of the ship in the new movie is garbage actually despite the millennium falcons odd design i really think its a pretty appealing ship  and its really cool i cant say the same for the twilight though
joebot on aug 12 2008 0417 pm said seems like tlc has done a pretty accurate representation of the ship the real fault for the ships messy design has to go to lucasfilm not tlc my guess is lucasfilm is trying to recapture that what a piece of junk magic of the millennium falcon i guess well have to wait to see the movie to see if they succeeded or not the idea of a space mobile home reminds me of the winnebago from spaceballs great review informative entertaining and opinionated so many people shy away from stating an actual opinion in their review for fear of offending anyone whats the point of making a review if you dont state what you think about it nice its 99  £52 but our price is £8090 that ugha warrior looks like man friday from robinson crusoe edit also i am going to use that wing technique for ww2 mocs its perfect edited by joey lock 12 august 2008  1100 pm
thanks for the review i for one will get this set i collect and therefore i need it i vision something like this a i buy the set b i built the set c pics for my bs account d set taken apart sad but true its not much but super for parts i agree from what your review showed me that this set is a little too much technic a thing thats been invading our beloved brick built sets in the past years i really have no need for a retractable front or functioning landing gear what i need is a kickass ship with neat design and cool interior the twilight does not offer that look at the size of that thing
oky wan kenobi on aug 12 2008 0152 am said oh no anakin has gone over to the green side of the force not the green side looks like a good source of grey panels and a cool headpiece nothing more
having plenty of time on my hands this summer i did some reviews yes im aware this has already been done but ill just do it once more no harm there set 5615 set title the knight price 299 euro  349 usd pieces 21 yes a whole 21 bricks release 2007 the box a neat little box that has a great size for dropping into your shopping cart for once tlg didnt shove the bricks into an oversized cardboard box  the knight this is a great minifig though he looks a little unsatisfiedmight be because his head isnt put on all the way a great army builder fig the only thing that i find a little annoying is that the collar isnt completely rounded it looks too much like an animation and lefthand work the weapon rack yes thumbs up for this plate mail sword shield and jousting helmet plus the spear and open helmet on the fig so many great additions to put into use bring it on pesky skeleton army the all in all verdict a great set a little too expensive compared to the crossbow attack in which one gets 2 knights and a skeleton plus bricks for 549 euro  599 usd but still a great army builder set and the 7090 set does not have the same knight fig kimt
this is an awesome set in my opinion i scraped my crossbows for mocing recently but the set is still an amazing army builder for the price for the sw battlepacks which have 4 minifigs and a cheap vehicle you get 4 knights  this is 2 sets to equal the price of a bp  2 skellys and 2 skelly horses plus 4 crossbows 4 good wheels and some other good dark blue and brown pieces for my ever expanding castle town great buy
blueandwhite on aug 13 2008 0549 am said a quick question about the poll are we voting on the quality of the set or the quality of the review later the quality of the set feel free to comment on the review andor set also
this set is a great little bundle the kitted out knight skellie knight weapons and the few bricks for the fence and weapon rack the castle 07 barding here is very nice indeed the colour scheme of the new castle guys is great imo the light blue and blue work nicely together and against the grey background i dont really like the pearl grey helmet  it would be nicer in metallic silver like the visor i think interesting comment re the skellie helmet  i guess black normal knights helmet with visor would be quite nice for him i got this set as part of the complete castle collection from sh however i have extras of all the smaller sets and skeleton tower except i dont have another one of this set its on my list of sets to buy unfortunately it wasnt on sh for ireland when i was making later orders  quite an odd omission also last year castle 07 was exclusive to argos uk catalogue retailer who only had three sets not the joust i should see if the local toy store has it now though as they did stock some 07 castle in addition to 08 at the start of the year i think small sets like this should be well stocked in shops for a year or two  it surely doesnt do their sales much good to be so sporadically available sorry turned into a bit of a ramble anyways the point is that this set is good enough id pick up another the cobra that sucks about customs i try to keep my orders to within the €23 dutyfree limit for here in ireland if your imports are waylaid you pay 20 import duty 21 sales tax and a postage fee for the diversion to customs nasty edited by brickzone 13 august 2008  1115 am
you know what i think this set has charm lots of it im not a big fan of castle having very few sets all of them spanning different nationsarmies but i couldnt resist this set and while not obvious at first it really is backwards compatible with every castle set with a horse in it nonetheless i think this set is great its simple cheap and has charm thats good enough for me plus it has that fantastic grinning knight and the black skeleton horse those just made it better
perhaps he meant the pearl light grey lance which is not that common
brickzone on aug 14 2008 0742 pm said perhaps he meant the pearl light grey lance which is not that common could be its not that uncommon its in several sets now red is uncommon
first things first the knights helm does have a spot for a plume now i really like this set and it was the first one i dug into when i got my collection in the mail it has a great selection of equipment for good or evil figures and the barding for the horse is outstanding my only wish was for one of the long chrome swords for the knights i think the new knights with the tall shield and chrome sword look excellent on foot and on horseback it would definitely be neat to revisit this set with another human knight instead of the skeleton make that change and add a lady to joust for and itd be bang on
nice set what a great find this is one thing i think the tlg has forgotten about the creator houses are nice but they are not really geared toward a town them no mini figs cars etc these sets were and that adds so much to a town layout it cant be overlooked i really like this i may have to start my ebay searching thanks hinckley
great review and great set i just wanted to comment on the beauty of the car included in this set it gets no better than a fourwide car and hinged roof with sunroof
great review id give this set an 8 at the least its just a tad too simple for my liking but other than that it looks great while im a 4 wide car man i actually think this car looks rather horrendous the main body seems way too low in comparison with the windows the rare parts however do make up for it hinckley on aug 13 2008 1123 pm said yes yes in the states horrifying and deplorable violence is fine but drinking and swearing sends kids directly to hell somehow i feel like watching south park now  that was such a good episode
well technically it is 4 wide
its a nice house but perhaps a little sparsh on detail just a few more pieces for additional furniture would have been nice like the car though
shoc on aug 13 2008 0628 pm said they didnt want to encourage the drinking of alcohol in america but were fine encouraging it in other places maybe thats why my country has such a big problem with binge drinking or maybe not of course who said it had to be wine in the first place i often drink sprite from wine glasses so i feel fancy
thanks for the wonderful review this is really a beautiful set  i love the old lego houses from the 80s and 90s  they were always very quaint and well designed actually i like the old car designs too but only for their nostalgic value in reality they are very unrealistic and look more like go carts that said not all four wide cars are silly looking  the 4wide cars in these city sets are awesome and fit in with the modern city style great
i just bought this its truly a wonderful set and i love the houses from that era as well very charming great review
has anyone noticed the dwarf in one of the completed shots nice set alot better than the new city setslooks at an army of firefighters that have no fires to put out and the police officer army edited by indianajones 21 april 2010  1206 pm

cpt pegleg blockbeard on aug 14 2008 0329 pm said over all a nice set i am a little confused by the dynamite though perhaps an easy way to go fishing hilarious i bet she threw out the penicillin and flare gun to make room for the axe and dynamite in her survival kit who wouldnt maybe shes a lost escapee
good set i laughed at the dynamite but not as much as that axe not many trees on the rapids looks like shes got more than dynamite to cause havoc in the harbour
thanks for this review thebrickster i also have this set and think its one of the best helicopters tlg made in the 90s its quite big and has got place for 2 minifigs in the cockpit i also like the fact that theres a victim included in form of the xtreme diver which also is a theme i always loved as a kid do you have any other resq sets left to review it would be an honour for me to also do a review of one or more sets which are left but unfortunately i got not much time at the moment
metalandi on aug 15 2008 0716 am said do you have any other resq sets left to review it would be an honour for me to also do a review of one or more sets which are left thanks metalandi this and the emergency evac set are the only req sets i have i would encourage you to share a review as you have done some very nice reviews
thanks for the review brickster i do own this set in its original form the only drawback that i have noted previously is the lack of rotors and the cobraesq of the copter body i wish it had a larger fuselage but i still have it and i still like it despite my criticismwhich i am sure is in my eyes only thanks again brickster i wish i had bought some of the other res q sets but of course i only bought three
metalandi on aug 24 2008 0417 pm said what exactly makes you feel this set isnt realistic since the question was asked 1 tiny rotors 2 dual cockpits only seen on a few military copters 3 stretcher extends beyone edges of fuselage when inside the vehicle 4 extra long canopy really only seen on military helicopters and military design 5 black colorscheme for rescue vehicle the the stretcher minifig designs and rescue logo are the only things about this copter that really suggest that it is a civilian rescue aircraft its a toy set with alot of play value but i agree with karto that these kind of desgins really turned me off to alot of the town and city sets of the 90s on the positive side the new city sets with thier realistic nonfuturistic designs have really tempted me to buy more vehicles
it took quite some time but now im finally continuing with city reviews this one beeing about a really good set of the resq theme and also one of my favourites of this theme it brings a lot of playability and an incredible amount of useful pieces even with only 145 bricks in complete set nr 6451 name river response number of minifigs 3 number of pieces 145 release year 1998 price 20 usd back then when it was new unfortunately i havent got the box of this set anymore but the instructions are still there in good condition we get 3 resq minifigs in this set from which i really love the detailed torsos a shot of the complete set with both the boat and the little car off board the before mentioned car is really really little but it still got enough space to transport 2 minifigs a closeup of the rubber dinghy the speed boat as standalone as already said before this set brings a big count of equipment and accesoires with it which is really good for a set this size in the middle section of the boat there is enough space for a minifig to sit in and put on his diving equipment and last but not least a shot from the whole set wirh everything attached at the front section you can see a wench which also adds a lot to the set when i got this set back in the day i was really happy about it and for sure spent a lot of tie playing with it because of its great features as the wench in the front of the boat or the car the boat can transport i hope you like my little review stay tuned for more in the next days edit i forgot the poll can sombody add it please i dont know how to do or if it is possible to do that myself edited by metalandi 15 august 2008  0359 pm
this set was my first set ever from the resq series and i loved it entirely ofcourse i modded it slightly here and there after hours and hours of fun and excitement it has great play value even for a set in this size
if you still have all the parts try to rebuild it youll see that its a great feeling
6004 crossbow cart review because i may start collecting castle here is a review of one of my few castle sets please note i hurriedly put his together meaning some parts are the wrong color look out for them this review will also be done in my star wars review style the lighting is also particularly bad in the pics on with the review parts 20 figs 1 price  1overview and fig the whole set the fright knights knight the disemboweled knight the head printing is just longer then the helmet visor 2 the cart the cart has 3 crossbows and 2 norman type shields the carts advanced defense and weapons systems all the parts from the cart forgot to add the fig in 3extras  overall here are all my castle figs remember i dont collect castle yet  oh yeah i forgot to put one of the old skellies and a ghost on there could a castle fan tell me if any of these minifigs are rare i have no idea because i dont collect castle build 610 pretty standard for a impulse minifigs 710 nice minifig with lots of accessories design 810 this set made way for some of the new castle carts of similar size parts 1010 3 crossbows 2 shields arrow quiver and spear as well as cool minifg in a 20 piece set price 1010 well i dont know but lego was cheaper in 97 so it gets 10 playability 55 pretty much standard for a impulse set overall 810 good parts and price as well as minifig scores this set an 8 thanks for reading
very nicely done  this cart is a striking resemblance to the crossbow cart we got in 2007
nice review i agree with thok it’s quite similar to the more recent crossbow attack though this one has the added benefit of two shields this set would i fleet be more useful to army builders than most of the modern castle sets even though many people don’t like frightknights
quote even though many people don’t like frightknights i dont really like fright knights either i just happened to have this set
looks great and the figures up there are old and kinda rare i dont really like fright knights though so i probably wont get this set
thanks for the review ive added it to the index im not a fan of this theme but i have to say that this is a neat little set that does hold some good things figs and weapons are always welcome and one can never have to many wheels so i rate this average
i gave it above average it was a nice set and included some nice pieces but it is only an impulse set after all edited by newright 19 august 2008  0106 pm
this is really an ideal small set in spite of its size it has nearly everything • three minifigs • a vehicle • a building • numerous minifig accessories • numerous rare and useful parts • nice model design especially for the time period too bad outback came out during my dark years
this is probably my alltime favorite lego set it was originally given to me for my birthday by a close friend of mine back in the release year of 1997 the cargo plane was by far my favorite vehicle ever unfortunately someone stole the plane from me when our families went on vacation and the rest of the set was given to my cousins oldest son when i was no longer interested in my lego collection now that im back into lego i use that buildings construction for various projects especially as a dr inferno lookout shack using parts from extra mission 3 swamp raid the shack compliments the original set greatly edited by skorpius47 19 august 2008  0144 am
thanks for the review kimt oldies reviewsold sets  are always appreciated i feel this set isnt that great 1 yoda he is by far the best part of the set although is his weapon blue 2lord tyrannus pretty nice i feel the middle part of his torso is a bit bland but that isnt a problem i wish they would make a fleshie one too 3 speeder bike i always hated this design the back looks terrible to me way too bulky in my opinion it jusnt give me the image that its the same as the movie the lightsaber is amazing why is it only in this set 4yodalifter what that is terrible but at least it has some nicely colored parts a fine set but not the best imo
nice review i realy like this set two nice minifigs in an affordable set and i do like the speeder but that lift thing is strange but now at least i know what it is thanks for letting me know
i missed this setbut i reallly like the yoda and count dookui especially like count dookus lightsaberone thing thoughis it me oris yodas lightsaber blue in the picture edited by pr0visorak 20 august 2008  1221 pm
i was very lucky to get this set and i love it i dont have it built cause i bought it for parts but it was fun while it lasted 
great review kimt at that time it was still in my dark age and i hated myself not to get this set earlier this is quite inexpensive and you are able to get two greatest characters especially count dooku the minifigs are excellent especially the unique design of count dookus lightsaber i have no problem with the speedbike as it looks quite alright to me as for the elevation of yodas jump adds some playabilty but that does not work well for me nevertheless the main attractive factor is count dooku and i have to rate it a 5 i never own a yoda except for the magnet version
i know we have another review of this set but since i just got it i thought i would share my comments on it set name droid gunship platform number 7678 pieces 329 price 2999 before we begin i will say that i like having a droid gunship but i still hope we get a maf hmp droid gunship maf droid gunship on to the review here we have the box it is really shiny and smooth and fits the sets size okay it has a clean bright look and is truley outstanding the back of the box which has the features of the set as well as the other three cw sets the contents the siticker sheet no to bad and the stickers have clear backs which is always nice instructions here we have the figstwo new droids and one older armed droid for the cockpit and the extra parts the build starts with the flat base pretty simple the bottom the side lasers next is the head it starts pretty soild the side buble laser turrets loveing the detail on the ship the lid and eyes the finished cockpit cozy interior would have had more room if it were the maf though the front landing gear simple and effective the back landing gear the rockets the clips are annoying but it make the rockets work so i guess it was nessecary mounted on the bottom not very secure but thats why they are meant to be dropped on the clones the finished ship  let me say that the droid gunship is a nice set indeed final rating 86 hope you enjoyed the review please if you have a ny questions pic requests etc then by all means ask best regards vbbn
thanks for the cool review vbbn  i think this set is really cool and very neat detailed to be a small set  also thanks for the clear pics  edited by darkrebellion 18 august 2008  1030 pm

cloneme on aug 28 2008 0511 am said i dont know what it is about this set but i love it i cant get enough of it it looks amazing nice review youve said it all thats exactly how i feel about it ive not got a single clue as to what this thing is or why but the colours and the design are awesome might be a little smallanyways im getting it
this was the first rock raiders set i got i really like it and i think i got all of them except the huge cargo airlift thing i remember these sets coming out and getting the big base for christmas though they are all destroyed now sadly  nice review
thanks for the review rock raiders was one of the last new themes i knew as a kid before my dark ages came unfortunately i never managed to get any sets from it beside a few months ago the 4910 the hover scout which i review a while ago wish i can get some of the bigger sets in the future
i do like the set although i dont own it i do remember lusting after it when i was a kid though mainly because of the female minifig and the colors its a bit simplistic but comes with a few great parts you also did a great job on describing the set and the pictures give the full impression of the appearance for the review i just have to point out a few things to give you constructive criticism first of all its chef not chief entirely different professions and secondly the scale you give in the poll isnt very even above average jumps to outstanding which is a too big of a gap in my opinion you shouldve used good or great in between them but these are only minor faults this is a good review anyway
i rate it a full 5 too and i wish lego would make a set like this in 2010 a town needs pizza edit dont always trust peeron sometimes they miss some pieces and sometimes they just cant count them edited by the cobra 24 august 2008  1141 am
a very good set indeed we have at least 3 of them but we like them all
got this one as well not much surprises in such a small set but the fastfood pizza idea is pretty cool as far as i know only the small mcdonalds promo and this set are related to foodrestaurant thing until the cafe corner that is but since i have a classic lego city i cant miss this set
one of my greatest lacks in my towni can remember going to the store to buy this one and ending up with another set pirates at home p thank you for the review it might put me on track in finding this set on the web and purchasing it to correct my childish change of mind so long ago 
excellent job and one of the best sets in history if you ask me 55 all the way this is what we need more of whitefang on aug 24 2008 0522 am said devoted pizzeria staff on the left we will have the pizza boy whom is wearing the regular blue dungarees and its white cap i wonder who is that boy on the middle we will have the pizza girl she looks like any typical sweet girl in town that the boys will look at she is wearing a suntop strapless on her she reminded me of one person though i think her name is called alice taking a careful look i wonder if imperialshadows is the pizza boy back then without that black patch on its left eye on another note this minifigure was my favourite female minifigures are very uncommon back then i am glad i have this figure adding to my town population hmmm he does look a little familiar and i definitely recognise the lovely alice now stop staring at her sandy on aug 24 2008 0633 am said its chef not chief entirely different professions actually salvatore as i like to call the chef was in the navy where he reached the rank of chief a nickname he holds to this day so both work in this case whitefang on aug 24 2008 0912 am said flyut if you need decals for the stickers that are featured in this set hang around here until imperialshadows drop by to give you a little surprise if he is free surprise free im not even close to free im rather expensive but i do have a surprise for everyone i think youll be interested in the companion article to this fine review my first set restoration project again great job whitefang excellent review and tlg this is a star amongst your sets think about that when youre designing new ones seriously
great review i really like this set and plan on getting it on bricklink it would certainly add something to my collection
this set is great and so is this review i really like seeing reviews of classic sets like this and hope to see more in the future the chef in this set is the base for my sigfig in fact the classic sets have a totally different feel to them than the newer sets they look more human great review
i remember having this set when it was originally released a good few years back but i dont think i have it anymore i remember i thought it was really awesome though i thought the oven and pizza storage in the back of the car were the greatest parts the little sink on the inside was cool too didnt realise they had made a legends set out of it id love to own this set again but misb examples on bricklink go for an extortionate amount of money ah well se la vie
nice review i have this set and i like it alot its a master peice
i just built this set in mlcad as a requestfor a fellow eurobricks member somehow i missed out on this set completely when it came out i was really suprised how long it took to build virtually despite its size this set is packed with details minifigs vehicles and tools thanks for all the pictures gif xml 6479 emergency response center edited by missouribb63 31 december 2009  0932 am
there are very few late 90s or early 00s sets worth ever having and i wish i had this one with its futuristic look and yes that tow truck too oh yeah heaps of equipment  its not over junorised there is still plenty of building in it thanks and have a happy new year metalandi 
hi everyone this is my first review on lego sets here hope you guys like it and i would like to apologise for the bad quality pictures hope you guys dont mind first i will start with the box art box art i guess this is the first time that lego star wars sets use white and blue colour for their box i like the new colour scheme a nice blend though heres the front the back not to waste space on the box lego do some advertisement to attract us to buy more sets grinthe more the side at the top side there is this minifigs scale picture it is great as we get to know the real size of a minifigs contents the contents consist of a sticker sheet instruction book and 8 packet of bricks the packer are not numbered but it is ok as there is not much pieces instruction book and random page as usual the instruction book have brick checklist other sets pictures and tutorial on how you should assemble your set i mean the very first page sticker sheet there is not much sticker sheet and is a great news that the republic logo on the round plate is printed unlike republic gunship anyway i didnt apply the stickers the commander gear this is a new thing to minifigs as well well is like batman accessories they pack it in one small packet however you only get one commander gear pack in this set anyway i didnt use them the minifigs well we get the the new minifigs the ugly face clone new printed torso and new mold of helmet however i not really like the new head stud i prefer a black one or at least the one like jango fett black colour with face the helmet everything is printed no holes at the visor there but there are hole on the both side this new helmet mold also made the headgear turn 360 degree freely without helmet with helmet you can see the flesh tone at the hole beside the blasters  short blasters were given instead of long one is great at least they give us two blasters instead of one the tank here is the pics of the tank it was not badly design nor nicely design but it looks great if you didnt saw the beneath or under the tank view from front view from side view from back whats beneath under it was 4 wheels to make it move fluently it is made by the thread supporter like the one we fet from tie crawler or battank the functions well firstly you can open up the hood i guess to see the engine secondly the side cannon that can move upwards the thing is quite tight see random instruction page and there is barrier to block the cannon from going downwards the cockpit well the cockpit is small and the space is limited the monitor stuff is printed brick and is another great news you have to remove the piece pic below to reveal the cockpit and put your clone to pilot it popup gunner mechanism well the backdoor have a thing to attack to the seat of the gunner the top hatch is very loose so it there is a clone as a gunner and you open the back door the clone will popup and automatically open the hatch on top this is how the top looks like without a clone there is this movable cannon upwards left and right and a little keyboard thing with it but the cannon fall off quite easily the flick launching missile mechanism the mechanism is on both side and you need to turn the thing inwards to reveal the flick fire mechanism below are the pic of how it is turned you can keep you blaster at the front of the side there are place for you to store them it close nicely completion this is how it looks like extra parts there quite a number of them overall this set is not bad the price is quite expensive but you will like it the popup mechanism is something new to me but this set have more function and 2 clone trooper with a pack of commander gear pros 2x clone troopers high playability nice design cons a little expensive sticker sheet cannon on top falls off quite easy edited by kimt 27 august 2008  1216 pm
wow this is one great review fantastic pictures this looks like one cool set with heaps of neat functions a shame it doesnt include exclusive figures like ahsoka and captain rex in the atte or plo koon and asajj ventress in the gunship but you cant have everything so again thanks for this sweet review peace
nice review i hope i can get this set as well as agents city  other sw stuff and nice pics i didnt think they were bad i thought they were pretty good
wow this ship is really big judging from the size of its hull wondering where can i keep it when ive bought it 
but does this mean that they add to the piece count is it a super secret clever way to make the piece count seem bigger than it is hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm  addition ive built it review up later tonite but heres this to wet your appetite
its a shame it only comes with two figs it would be great for my ancient middleeast project
yoda601 on aug 17 2005 0253 pm said its a shame it only comes with two figs it would be great for my ancient middleeast project if you ever get a moment id love some pics of that ive been tooling around with something along those lines in my ever expanding fantasy setting akkh
very nice review of a set that ive been dying to get but my friendly neighborhood lego store never seems to have in stock the yellow seat is most definitely not a new piece i had two of those in my old beta1 command base almost 30 years ago
metalandi on aug 27 2008 0326 pm said thanksfor this review i also got this set recently and im very happy about it i live the design of these new trucks and the forklift is also great not to forget the good amount of cargo btw i think the mysterious cargo only are normal fuel barrels thanks normail fuel would be in those octan barrels
great review i dig this set it could have only been better if it had been a 6wide version of the old 6367 semitruck still i ask whats so special about the special edition
kimt on aug 27 2008 0500 pm said hmmgood question lets hope our reviewer can help us out here and i can the set is exclusive to lego brand retail stores lego sh and toys r us only
that´s really a sweet and charming little technic set thanks for that fine review
the ywing is the work horse of the rebel alliance it’s well armed and heavily armoured but you’ll need it because you’ll be moving like a sleepy hut – general rieekan set name ywing starfighter set number 7658 number of pieces 454 figures2 released 2007 list price £3999 lets us begin with the box the front shows it in all it’s swooshing glory httptdyorgukimages765802jpg the back shows some of the many features of the set and also others you might like to buy in the star wars range after opening the box we find a single instruction booklet now we come to an important aspect of any star wars set the figure here we’re provided with an anomalous rebel pilot and his faithful r5 droid the pilot comes with the fairly standard lego star wars nonhero helmet printing what’s he going to do with the blaster taken on the entire empire one of the more interesting parts is the assembly of the engine which if like me you don’t pay enough attention to the instructions when building you can end up getting wrong the key detail i got wrong just before fitting the last engine if we look carefully on the side we can see a missile launcher i didn’t think torpedoes or concussion missiles were fired from there but i may be wrong after fitting the engine the models looks like this in all it’s glory manning one of the alliance’s fighters not so ready to take on the empire was he so overall we have a well designed model which is in my opinion far superior to the original we were offered with darth vader way back when lego star wars was new this ywing is sleek and looks great in my opinion the firing missiles are also a great touch the rating system figures 510 for the same price the last xwing had far more figures parts 610 swooshability 9510 design 910 price 310 grand total 32550 not to shabby conclusion so finally the answers to the questions you’ve no doubt want to know is the set worth the price i’ll be frank £3999 is too much for this set despite this i currently have a squadron of three ywings the reasons is this set has been on sale a number of times at £30 it’s certainly worth the money lego recently placed them online with a price of £20 this i think was a great price for the set and well work picking one or more up if you wanted to start your own rebellion
a wonderful set and a really charming design well detailed and pretty smooth at the same time perhaps that small gap at the cockpit´s an a little weak point but we can always mod a little thanks for that very neat review cardinal brick
great review the ywing is an awesome starfighter and the detail in this set is superb funnily enough i was just swooshing mine today edited by pedro 27 august 2008  0825 pm
pedro on aug 27 2008 0923 pm said great review the ywing is an awesome starfighter and the detail in this set is superb funnily enough i was just swooshing mine today you mean swooshing as in swooshing for real or just plain swooshing
stauder on aug 27 2008 0845 pm said he doesnt know the story but those pics of you swooshing it naked sure are halarious the one in the park is extra good you should see peoples faces i mean they are jelaous of your ywing yoda has my email p hehe staudie haha i was making a joke and here comes stauder with his clearly insane lies for the truth go here now can we get back on topic or a you just dying to become sarlac food
stauder on aug 27 2008 0945 pm said he doesnt know the story but those pics of you swooshing it naked sure are halarious the one in the park is extra good you should see peoples faces i mean they are jelaous of your ywing yoda has my email p hehe actually i had read of the naked swooshing before but alas my ywing swooshing was in my workplace where its generally accepted that you keep your clothes very much on its a completely different story when im at home though
kimt on aug 28 2008 0908 pm said youve got to be kidding the ilc is bulky and doesnt even come close to the design superiority of the ywing its smooth its beautiful and its awesomely designed by the designers at lego its got greebles man i was not talking about the looks of course the rebels have got to have nicer looking ships
csiquet on aug 29 2008 0206 am said i was not talking about the looks of course the rebels have got to have nicer looking ships dont aregue with him when it comes to ywings he offerd to swoosh one in the nude stauder
is it worth the money since the new ywing comes out next year
i think it is a fair to ask questions here with the expectation of a new ywing in the coming year i came here to look at the review even though it is a few years old no images to go with the review bummer id like to see a more friendly tolerance on dated threads being bumped
etav8r on 19 september 2011  0316 am said is that a threat is it fair to ban someone on the forum because they revived an old thread and made inquiries thought this was a forum to discuss lego and that is what he was prompting i dont really care why he was banned but this isnt the only time ive seen this type of behavior and discourse here on eb not a threat at all  i was simply pointing out that yodalikespie made the mistake of inquiring about the new ywing before we had any information on it to my understanding its not so much the fact that he bumped the thread as the fact that he bumped it for no good reason im not certain where the moderators stand on this issue but i feel that yodalikespies question would have been better received had he posed it after a substantial amount of information had been gathered on 9495  as ive said there simply isnt much one can go off of at this point to determine its value relative to 7658
and lo it came from the east denmark the set which had been foretold the cheap army builder and there was much rejoicing amongst the castle fans the cardinal then asked was all the rejoicing justified… set name the knight set number 5615 number of pieces 21 figures1 released 2008 list price £200 lets us begin with the box the front shows us are knight and his rack of arms the back shows us two sets from the castle range moving inside the box now the contents of the box it doesn’t look like much the instructions to help you through the build now the reason you probably bought the set well at least why i did the knight this features the new torso for 2008 and is the height of fashion this brings the number of printed torsos from the crown knights to three which allows for a greater variety in building your armies a new fashion sensation and all the must have accessories for this season with a more heavily armoured look he’s ready for anything the rest of the set is a weapons rack i assume that once you’ve got a few of these set you’ll probably like me give up building them and part them out but anyway here are some pictures of what the rest of the elements are spent on a long and complex build begins after 360 hour finally it’s finished sadly five minfigs were hurt in the construction of this rack now the money shot where we can see it all come together it looks great even the rack doesn’t look to bad sadly are hero wasn’t ready for other themes just yet in total we have a good army builder which castle fans have wanted however there remains a question in my mind as to if this set is good enough on it’s own without any other castle sets i can’t see it being to much fun so it’s not a good present the rating system figures 910 great new fashion for this season  parts 810 shield sword spear helmet and armour what more could i want well two shields fun fun fun 310 sadly it’s rather dull on it’s own i can’t think or to much else to do design 710 yes it’s the army builder i’ve wanted design well apart from that pirate one price 910 at £200 what more can i say grand total 3650 let down by being to small to stand alone conclusion so let’s answer the question is it the army all castle fans have wanted well yes and no is the answer while it is a great set and at the now reduced uk price of £200 amazing value i still think it’s inferior compared with the army building capability of cross bow attack i much prefer army building both factions at once
thanks for sharing this review with us ill add it to the index one of my favourite impulse sets along with the troll warrior or is that orc warrior
do we really need more construction works legoland is just one huge building site theme city set name mini digger set number 7246 number of pieces 36 figures1 released 2005 list price 350 usd 7426 peeroncom 7246 bricklink catalog diving right in let get some photos of the box the digger at work the back just has more of the same not to inspiring once we open the box we find two poly bags and some instructions the total contents of the box well minus the air instruction booklet short and simple now the single minfig of the set nothing new of special that i can see …got a job working construction for the johnstown company moving onto the digger itself it’s one of those builds where all you really need is a quick glance at the instructions and off you go side view of the finished product alternative view it doesn’t look to bad now lets add our construction worker looks rather good though the lifting action isn’t smooth it’s nothing special it’s not the greatest construction set that lego have ever produced but i think it is worth the money the arm action really does bug me though the rating system figures 510 just another construction peon parts 410 nothing novel and i dislike the new digger arm system fun fun fun 710 i think the playability is high and you can get a good load of bricks in the bucket design 610 not the best designed digger but not the worst price 710 a reasonable price for what you get grand total 2950 still halfway decent but nothing to write home about conclusion this set is yet another in a long line of lego digger and to be honest it’s not the best in my opinion i still hold nostalgic memories for 6504 which i still think is a great digger from my point of view the set sits to high off the ground and make me wonder how the worker gets in i really don’t like the digging arm action it will never be smooth and while it poses better i just think it’s inferior despite this i still think it’s not a bad set i’d just like it to be so much more
i voted average i think this is the least attractive among the 2008 exoforce sets i saved my money to buy some of the 2006 mechas
best impulse set so far thanks for sharing your thoughts and yes someone should look into that rodent issue ill add this to the index within long
wow i like this set but have no money to get it guess i need to be fast and get it before it was sold out
nice review makes me want 3 honestly and comgratz on becoming a teacher in the reviewers academy
nikola bathory on aug 28 2008 1147 pm said wait a second a troll isnt that an orc i thought that this is a troll those are giant trolls the regular sized green guys such as is included with this set are trolls yes they look like orcs but lego calls them trolls
nice review i never new trolls had fireworks at least thats what it looks like to me maybe i shall build a trollish fireworks company fireworks on
that’s the problem i couldn’t quite tell what it’s a bit of a problem in a reviewer maybe a hose to clip to the fire hydrant i don’t know
brick built robot surely we€™re getting near classic space now theme space mission mars set name minirobot set number 5616 number of pieces 24 figures1 released 2008 list price £250 gbp 350 usd 299 euro 5616 peeroncom 5616 bricklink catalog 5616 shop at home let look at the box first space man approaching the robot from behind i€™m not sure you can still buy the base easily anymore the contents of the box the contents of the box it€™s rather white fairly standard mission mars spaceman he€™s got printing front and back but sadly no air tank how does he breath as has been pointed out he does have a printed tank but id rather a physical one note the megaphone is in flashlight mode not weapon mode that€™s important the robot itself feels a bit clumsy the metal detector is never going to touch the ground and it feel a bit wide i don€™t like the look of him something in the eyes the reason why so we can have a box to put crystals in both together and ready to explore new worlds etc sadly the robot was homicidal remember in space no one can hear you scream it€™s not a bad impulse set and if it marks the return of brick built robots to space then it€™s a good thing i just feel the robot could have been better built the rating system figures 610 not to bad but nothing wonderful parts 610 lots of white and not much orange but where€™s the air tank fun fun fun 610 probably the best impulse set as a stand alon toy lots to do with a robot and his human boss design 510 the robot feels clumsily put together i think it needs work price 810 can€™t fault the impulse price grand total 3150 not well designed but does have more play value than other impulse sets conclusion i was surprised that mission mars got impulse sets as it didn€™t seem to sell as well as other lines last year however i think this is a fairly good set it has more playability than other sets and does come with a metal detector been a while since i€™ve seen one though i could be wrong sadly the robot isn€™t as good as it could be edited by sinner 01 september 2008  0130 am
cardinal brick on aug 28 2008 0636 pm said fairly standard mission mars spaceman he’s got printing front and back but sadly no air tank how does he breath parts 610 lots of white and not much orange but where’s the air tank as you said he has printing on the back if you look closley you wil lsee a tank printed on his back with oxygen written on it stauder
cool i also like the sticker on the back of jokers ice cream truck that says i love gotham
i love this set indy is what got me back into lego
welcome to another sunny day in legovilletoday we will be joining the mailman on his daily route delivering the days mail when i first saw this set i immiediately liked iti think tlg should make more of these everyday life type sets such as delivering mail going to the grocery store things like that anyway enough blabbering on to the review 7731 mail van set name 7731 mail van year 2008 theme city pieces 66 price 799 pounds 499 euros 595 price per piece about 12 cents well start with the box shots the box is an interesting shape that i have never seen before very rectangular the box art is pretty nice the back shows the mailman delivering some mail the picture on the front is the same as on the box random manual shot the manual does not have the piece call outs but on a small set like this i dont feel its needed parts list decent selection of parts i really like the mail pieces image at the back of the manual showing all of the cargo sets together in a little scene i like it when the manuals have images like these because its nice to see all of the sets together all of the parts spread out the parts in this set are pretty good unfortunatly the car base is one large piece however we do get 2 printed mail pieces which are always nice our trusty mailman this torso i think is very nice the little envelope is a nice touch extra parts not much to say here the finished set i really like the design of the van it looks very smooth and somehow looks very lego to me the colors are my favorite part the red and yellow look nice together a nice mailbox however i wish the letter on the front was printed the front of the van is nice i think the textured brick on the front gives it a different look on the front which is nice the back of the van the doors open to store mail although it doesnt have much room i like that they included this feature delivery the mail bricks slide right into the hole at the front this adds nice playability the vans all loaded up we are ready to deliver  parts 710 pretty good piece selection but for 8 should have included a few more playability810 its fun to deliver the mail to all of your towns residents design 910 the design is very nice except i feel that some of the stickered parts could have been printed overall 2430 after a long hard day of delivering mail theres nothing like enjoying a nice pizza and letting your hair out why do they make us wear those silly hats anyway this is a nice set that i can definitely recommend and i think tlg should certainly release a post office to go with this and the air mail set i really like these everyday life sets rather than always fighting crime or putting out fires those guys have normal lives too brickshelf folder httpwwwbrickshelrycgif338718
legoman132 on aug 29 2008 0335 pm said this set is nice it looks like a dhl van funny thats what i thought when i first saw the pics good review btw oh and i keep meaning to get this set but keep forgeting
good review thanks for the mail van while it certainly adds interaction and fun to a lego town it alone lacks details and playability and thus not a good set especailly taking its price into consideration its value is pretty much just like if not less than some impulse sets in my opinion
its a good set but i think the first sticker shouldnt say 7731
nice review i like this little set some how it reminds me now of postman pat in dutch pieter post an english childrens tv series about a postman in a little village somewhere in yorkshire aah sweet memories i would rather have seen a postoffice released with some women minifigs instead of the green post bigplane but maybe in a couple of years
welcome to another sunny day in lego city the sun is shining the birds are singing minifigs are drowning wait what the coast guard rushes to the scene and deploys the coast guard 4wd  jet scooter to save the poor minifig from drowning lets take a look at the coast guards buggy 7737 coast guard 4wd  jet scooter set info set name 7737 coast guard 4wd  jet scooter theme citycoast guard released 2008 price 999 usd995 eur799 gbp pieces 130 minifigs 1 price per piece about 8 cents now the review the box here is the front it shows a nice image of the buggy on the beach with the ocean in the background the back the back shows some of the features in the set such as the extra equipment manual the picture on the manual is the same as on the box as usual the parts the set has great colors i love how the orange blue and white look together the part selection is quite good but unfortunately uses the large car base coast guard minifig this is a great fig the torso print is very nice and matches the buggys colors well new tire mold here are the new tires they look very good inmanual shot color separation is not a problem here and since it is a small set the piece call out is not a necessity extra parts it is always nice to get extra cheese slopes the finished set the design of the trailer and jetski is great the jetski is very smooth looking and the color scheme is fantastic the sticker on the roof is nice but its actually too big for the piece the corners of the sticker flap where the piece curves jetski closeup here you can see how it attaches to the trailer i didnt add the sticker that goes on the front which is a little sign that says bb03 or something attaching the trailer this is where the trailer connects to the main car it attaches simply with a ball joint car front view the license plate is a nice sticker and the top lights look nice say cheese driver the back the back is very similar to the front it has the same sticker the equipment rack a very welcome addition to the set it adds quite a bit of playability the orange fins are great all decked out he looks pretty spiffy in his diving suit doesnt he brickshelf folder the ratings price 1010 you cant get much more in here for 10 parts 910 nice selection and great colors the big car base is a bit annoying design 910 the jetski is a prime example of something with a small amount of pieces that still looks amazing playability 910 you can drive the car go diving and jetski across the bay minifig 710 the one it comes with is great but it could have come with one more perhaps a citizen of some sort build 810 simple but looks great overall 4250 lego sh brickset peeron bricklink even in the face of danger this member of the coast guard always has a smile on his face summary simply put for 10 you have to buy this set it is one of the better sets in this price range you can buy and one of the best small city sets the colors are great the design is great and the fig is great i dont normally think small sets are worth heavy praise but this one definitely deserves it thanks and happy building
erdbeereis1 on sep 2 2008 0915 pm said i meant the piece call outs during the build that show which pieces you need for that step oh cardinal brick on sep 2 2008 0905 pm said one question though do you think the jet ski is as good as previous ones i have to agree that the jetski is an awesome little piece of design apart from the handle bars it has a really cool orange piece on the front a piece ive never seen before  the 4x3 wheelarch sort of thing cheers rog
i agree that this is a very good looking set i just finished building mine yesterday and i love it but here is one suggestion trim the large sticker that goes on the roof of the vehicle by cutting along the angles at the front of the sticker if you use it as it is it will extend beyond the flat surface of the roof and will overlap the lower sections past experience with stickers has suggested that this sticker will lift at the front corners lego stickers are probably the best that there are but sometimes modifications must be made now i want that large coast guard helicopter 7738
great review of a great set one question how does the robotarmpiece connect to the jetski
the coast guard sets are very eye catching the color scheme is making me want to pick up the entire line although the offshore platform hasnt been released stateside yet ive had my eye on this particular set for a few weeks now and is near the top of my to buy list with instructions provided on legocom i build a dr infero version of the jet ski to replace the one used in mission 2 swamp raid its a very sturdy design bulky enough to make it feel like a real vehicle great review too thankyou for the closer look at the set
erdbeereis1 on sep 3 2008 0436 pm said it gets placed on top of this piece i thought so so thanks for confirming
erdbeereis1 ive had a quick look your review and i must say its quite superb im dead tired so im going to take a nap but ill be back later to read it more thoroughly
i had to vote outstanding on this set because it simply is great minifigs a cool head sculpture and a nice little boat means unlimited playability great review though man
what a wonderful review with smart showing the right parts and clear pictures fantastic job erdbeereis1 this set is interesting for several reasons first of all it contains a large amount of very useful minifigs not many sets of this size contain so much figs secondly the throne itself can be easily combined with the other islander sets or even with other pirate and nonpirate sets im going to see if i can get this one for a reasonable price on ebay
17 for an old set is good i may hunt for it on ebay 
well for some weird reason i missed this before so i tell you now very good review as we are used of you erdbeereis1 i like all the islander sets and own quite a few myself for people that dont own any of the islander sets yet the 6262 king kahukas throne is a great way to start lots of minifigs and accessories
swman on aug 29 2008 0835 pm said i do not like the fact that the clones have pure white legs it looks weird to me it was also weird that they included shock troopers but it was probably a way to get people to buy it this set also seems like one of those that was kind of thrown in with a mix of other sets like the tie crawler i never picked it up and with the new clone wars sets out i wont me too i dont like the the shock to have white legs because i am very fussy and i dont mix them i also expect other clone to be in this set but it came with 2 shocks i buy it because i like the walker vehicle
baby on aug 29 2008 1254 pm said has anyone noticed the boxart includes the 3rd leg both in the lowerd position as well as the raised one stauder
stauder on aug 29 2008 0845 am said has anyone noticed the boxart includes the 3rd leg both in the lowerd position as well as the raised one stauder i believe thats to show off the functions of the set nice review you carefully explained every detail and i think that ill buy this set now im glad lego decided to make two seats in the interior and they did a very nice job on the third leg looking good both up and down i think i will switch the hips of the shock troopers into black like the other shock troopers
swman on aug 29 2008 0835 pm said i do not like the fact that the clones have pure white legs it looks weird to me it was also weird that they included shock troopers but it was probably a way to get people to buy it this set also seems like one of those that was kind of thrown in with a mix of other sets like the tie crawler i never picked it up and with the new clone wars sets out i wont i just found out atap appear in kashykk battle they should have given us kashykk trooper damn tlg so this vehicle is in the original trilogy
i could have gotten this set if i wanted to but it seemed like a waste of money to me i dont like the shock troopers helmets that much i feel they should have printed visors instead of cut out ones like they have in my opinion it would make it look a lot better the at ap itself sounds like it has a lot of holes in its cockpit which drags the set down and make it seem like they havent exactly put a lot of effort into it great review
valentin nice review i was thinking of doing this review and realised there were 3 reviews being done for this lovely set i must admit this is an amazing set after buying it in tru for sgd4990 15 discount i like the comparison of both spider droid even though one is not lego thanks for doing this lovely review its enjoyable to read
thanks keke imagine the horror that gripe my heart to see the discounted price on the sgs toys r us flyer about a month after its release into retail anyway looking forward to your other reviews too
thanks for the review i love this impulse set i bought two of them so i could make a wizard and his apprentice i didnt have an owl either so an extra is pretty cool and i like the trans globe piece batbrick away
to be honest i am going to give this set a 1 that is my lowest rating i will ever give to a set in eurobricks in fact this is the only impulse set which i do not have it at all after looking at your wonderful review i am going to give it a 2 and actually consider it to buy at least one to complete the entire impulse set series i dont really like the design and the alien at all in fact i prefer the mars mission astronaunt more than the aliens i dont really like the set but i like your review
i already dont liked the aliens but if the fighter was better i would already bought him now i will maybe buy one of it just for the 2 limegreen pieces
impluse sets are made good by using parts well and minifigs this has either i give a low score i really dislike the alien figs worst lego fig ever
you you got it mint in sealed box it indeed is a nice set i am not into space but nevertheless this set is a good addition if you need to get your space environment a little bit more crowded lego however is planning to release a minifig set again next year city and of course the advent calendars are also quite nice to get some figs with accessories
cardinal brick on aug 30 2008 0623 pm said the question is what could you do with this set i mean it’s just spacemen in a line what could you do the possibilities are endless 1 you can stand them in a line 2 stand them in a circle 3 stand them in a square 4 sit them all down 5 sit some of them down and leave some standing up adult supervision may be necessary for tfols attempting this one 6 take them all apart and scatter the pieces like some kind of huge space mine has gone off 7 yeah ok thats probably enough for now seriously i love all the sets of minifigs from all the different themes and this is a great one i always wanted them when i was a kid but never did my focus always was on town sets petrol stations and police sets please stand up and there was never enough pocket money left over for space sigh you are so lucky to have this great set thanks for sharing cheers rog
fantastic review this is one of the classic minifigs pack which is so great for gathering massive number of minifigs i miss those days where they sell 5 minifigs together in a set thanks for this lovely review
great review i agree that this set is underrated the hailfire is supposed to be a little taller than two battle droids so scalewise its nice the dwarf spider droid is amazing in my opinion i just wish it wasnt brown it makes me feel like its on geonosis we never saw a grey varient of the hailfire so its fine with me that its brown
this is a must have set for aotc fans and i really love the hailfire droid but it costs like 80 or more now that its discontinued
massmanufactured and designed to withstand extreme amounts of punishment its an iron drone and its marching on its sentry set data 7711 sentry year 2006 theme exoforce subtheme robots pieces 74 4 extra  both counting hinge control stick and its base as two separate pieces price euro 7 circa misb including sh on ebay rrp was euro 5 circa  5 usd probably 5 ukp building time 2025 minutes 10 minutes building the rest of the time placing stickers more info brickset  peeron being 2006 my last dark year i wasnt a big exoforce fan but they were ok i tought 2007 models were better and still think 2008 models are the best that basically means 1 its a shame that there will be no more of this line and 2 this is my first 2006 model yet i bought in in july 2008 ok lets do this one box front box was battered due to italian post theyll do their best to give lego boxes a war outlook closeup the japanese katakana read tokushu butai  special military forces box back amazing alternate model some like it more than the original design box content a small but capable sticker sheet two bags and instructions sticker sheet and theyre numbered random instructions page connecting legs to the body instructions page  sticker detail thats why theyre numbered instructions page  parts inventory does anybody check if theyre all there before building surely not me loose pieces nothing rare i think small techinc parts come in different colours as usual you often dont see them when the model is complete but sometimes you do the iron drone strong and durable and much better looking than those crappy mm jelly aliens building starts the open cockpit  front and rear view left leg  front and rear view right leg is built of the same pieces left arm  with laser cannon the cannon  great use of the hollow studs with the plant tree palm top right arm  with twin missiles complete model  front view complete model  side view and rear view rating and review parts and building nothing new but both models are ok instead of waiting the last page of the manual youd better put the stickers in place while building looking at the box youd tell stickers background is trans purple it actually is trans clear excpet for the yellow and black stripes  warning hazard try not to put your fingerprints on the sticky side consider using tweezers posability both legs and both arms feature three joints and thats good so that the weight doesnt have the sentry falling down final model smaller compared to 2007 claw crusher and 2008 batlle arachnoid but cheaper and surely worth the money the minifig is just another iron drone not much to say final rating 355 edited by sinner 01 september 2008  0222 am

thank you very much for this review thebrickster i voted both times for outstanding because i really the arctic theme i only bought the ice sailor but otherwise no sets because of money and place reasons and because i already collect four themes city older castle western and star wars old triology but a comeback of the arctic theme  perhaps as addition to a winter sports and winter rescue theme would be very welcome i really all sets  the little and the big ones in my opinion they all were very well designed not too big vehicles not too little and not minimalitic great minifigs and very nice and lovely details and accessory klausdieter
thanks very much for this great review thebrickster i love the arctic subtheme but unfortunately i never got my hands on any of the sets since this theme had its time during my dark ages this one is a really neat little set with a great amount of accesoires especially these snow shoes and the backpack which i love
wasnt there some years back a film based on aliens in the arctic cant remember the name and i think it was really old but there certainly was going on something with strange creatures and a polar base

2872 witch and fireplace review theme fright knights parts 18 figs 1 price unknown bricklink 500 year 1997 brickset peeron brickshelf bricklink ever wanted to turn into a animal wanted to curse your enemy or just wanted to be rich beyond your wildest dreams you should go visit the witch and her fireplace she can brew you up a potion for any occasion or purpose so head down to see the witch right now although this set is from the fright knights theme it can easily fit in with any other castle theme due to the lack of specialised fright knight parts and printings the set comes with no astounding parts but looks like the source for our good magician impulse set from the current castle theme i think i got this as a promo set official pic the box art for the set has the standard fright knight background and lego system logo followed by the set number down the left hand side of the box a cat is attempting a head stand also i think this box display the contents of the set in an attractive set up as usual 1 the whole set minifigs and all here is the witch on the torso there is a spider amulet which is a little hard to make out due to the low res of the image the witches wand is the same as the bellville fairy wands except in trans red like a lightsaber blade although it is completely useful as a lightsaber as you have probably noticed the witch has no legs instead she has a slope brick with the dress pattern printed on witch get it witchwhich looks better than asajj ventress from the new clone wars sets in my opinon for this anyway the fairysaber new word duel this is the old run down fireplace of the witch at the base there are two smouldering coals instead of fire witch its not funny any more is it doesnt make that much sense seeming as it is a fireplace the little triangular brick on top doesnt really do anything i also accidentally put the wrong one on while building it should be a sloping brick here are the coals the old trans orange studs are less translucent than the new ones i like how they have places them above the main baseplate on a 1x2 plate so they are in line with the rest of the fire place other wise it would look wrong here is everything else i havent covered yet the crystal ball the pets and the magical potion vial the crystal ball is identical to the one included with the good wizard impulse form the current castle theme i like the molds for the cat and the bat although if the cat had some yellow printing for the eyes like the white cat had black for the eyes it would be much better i think the trans green tube things are a little uncommon but im not worried about that 2 overall build 610 extremely puzzling and difficult do not attempt alone  its pretty simple but seeming as it has a load of stuff you can move around it is good minifigs 910 i really like the witch and it couldnt have really come with anyone else also it came with the wand which is really good too design 810 it should have come with some fire and maybe some more orange bricks to put at the base parts 810 the minifigure isnt bad nor are the animals or the trans green part price 1010 i am guessing this was pretty good seeming as i think i got this as a promo i gave it 10 because it was free playability 710 as wth all impulse sets there isnt much here but at least it comes with some animals to have a fight with or give the witch rabies overall 810 if it came with some more stuff for the fire place and the cat was more detailed it would have scored higher but because this set can easily be intergrated with other castle sets it got a mighty 8 3 mini comic  hocus pocus magic shocus turn my pets into dinosaurs not to catchy is it poof oh know i think i might drink my magical potion glug glug glug oh my
you already know how i feel about the review as for the set im not entirely sure its a fine witch but youve already gotten her in the witchs windship and a few other sets i vote average on this a good minifig though one does not have the need for more than one witch and some fine additional parts
yay another fright knights review odd comic at the end skipper 24 on sep 1 2008 0705 pm said ever wanted to turn into a animal wanted to curse your enemy or just wanted to be rich beyond your wildest dreams you should go visit the witch and her fireplace she can brew you up a potion for any occasion or purpose so head down to see the witch right now sounds like a song or nursery rhyme somehow anyway to the review it is a great review such a small set but youve summed it up well this is one of the few unpromo fright knight sets i didnt get sadly not sadly because of willa the witch i have about four of her but the special cat and the other bits one can never have too many lego bats i voted the set outstanding i think it is for its size kimt on sep 1 2008 0816 pm said you already know how i feel about the review good or bad feelings edited by shoc 02 september 2008  1145 am
thanks for the cool review as for the set a witch a bat and a black cat thats more than enough for such a small set
thanks for the review skipper ive added it to the review index
for some strange reason this is my favorite lego castle set
i voted average think the minifig and black cat are great
huzzah the king has declared a royal tournament pitting the brave knight in his shining armour against the feared skeleton warrior and his shadow horse the jousting arena is set up so let the joust begin 7009 the final joust set info set name 7009 the final joust theme castle released 2007 price usd 799gbp 599eur 795 pieces62 minifigs 2 figs 2 horses price per piece about 13 cents let the games begin box shots the front has an image of the knight and skeleton jousting with lightning in the background the back show the two now fighting with an ax and ball and chain i dont really like the box image as i think the background looks too dark manual the front has the same picture as on the box on the back some of the other 2007 castle sets are displayed this is better than the usual sweepstakes image that we get the pieces nothing really special here but you at least get a good assortment of weapons shields i always like lego shields and these are no exception the patterns are great minifigs first the horses these are great the knights horses coverings are really nice now the minifigs the knight and skeleton both have nice armor the torsos are plain black for the skeleton and bley for the knight the finished product in the middle is the jousting barrier which is simple but serves its purpose on the left we have the weapon rack which is good it would have been nice if tlg had included a rack for the skeleton as well though extra parts only two extra white parts here you can use them if your knights horse wants to retire and look like a normal horse again oh that has to hurt it seems that the skellie has won this round poor knight brickshelf folder now for the ratings price 710 not a very good price per piece ratio however at least 2 figs and 2 horses are included parts 710 the shields and log bricks are nice but most of the others are nothing spectacular design 810 relatively well designed but a bit boring playability 810 you can joust with it and thats about all build 810 short and easy overall 3850 brickset lego sh peeron bricklink strike it seems that the horses have rebelled against their riders summary this set although not amazing is still a very solid set the minifigs are great and so are the horses but the rest of the set kind of feels like an afterthought even with its negative aspects i still recommend it especially if you are a castle fan thanks and happy building ps if you want to see how i made this set a bit more fun check out this click
nice review i can tell that you put some effort into it the moc is a nice design your reviews are getting better and better
review of 7670 hailfire droid and spider droid updated theme sw episode ii  clone wars parts 249  figs figs 4 price £2000 2000 ‚2599 year 2008 i think many people were deterred from this set because of the low piece count and a high price for it although it does come with 4 minfigures 1 overall set and figs official box pic this indicates it is a geonosis set from the background but it is no different from any other set same old brown separatist ships the whole set some red tan droids would have been nice like in the geonosian fighter set all the minifigs the super battle droid body is slightly different to the one in the bp it looks more grainy and silver i doubt this has any relevance for it being a geonosis set but i like them better how they were in the bps the super battle droid body dwarfing the commander droids body i think that the new commander droids body is better than the old one with just the yellow strip even though it is less accurate new twisted battle droid arm each droid has one of these i dont really like having droids with these new guns i think the older guns suited them much better 2 hailfire droid hailfire droid by itself it is certainly smaller than the original seeming as this is the main part of the set i was hoping it would be bigger but i dont mind it being this small too much wheels and rockets can fold outwards and inwards the wheels which spin round two large clear discs and made from loads of these tiny links this is probably the best way to make the wheels on this small scale the only other alternatives i can think of are using the tracks from the wookiee attack set or catterpilla tracks both of which wouldnt look right one of the missile pods these use the new flickfire missiles which dont fall out are an excellent idea they should have come with the purple cones like on the magna guards staffs instead of red though because in the film the missiles are purple one of the new flickfire missiles that dont drop out when the model is tilted forward i dont know what the holes in them are for though the 3 eyes are made up of 2 trans red cheese bricks for the sides and 1 trans red stud for the centeryou can also see how the missile pods are attached to the side of the body this is the back of the hailfire droid there is a plate with a hole in i have found only one purpose for this the hailfire droid is the commander droids war chariot what do you use the plate for 3 spider droid the spider droid the design has been greatly improved from the wookiee attack set not only is it more accurate but also more poseable which is useful when setting up battle scenes the ball joint provides the place to put the antenna which isnt long enough but the dome form the old set looks more like the droid form star wars episode ii the eyes are made of a telephone piece with 2 trans red studs on in the original it had orange studs the eyes can be seen in action 2 pics down i told you it was a telephone 1 of 4 identical legs these are very easy to adjust into what ever position you want and are much better than the originals but a word of warning never pull them apart as i did they become very loose when put back together so i put some blue tack in the holes 4overall build 710 a little to repetitive for my liking minifigs 810 4 figs for £20 isnt too bad plus they come with new guns design 910 both vehicles are very well designed but the hailfires small size let the set down parts 810 comes with lots of useful maybe not  brown track links price710 not too bad with 4 figs and loads of little brown links playability 610 not to much on its own overall 710 if it came with some clones and tan red droids it would be better afetr jar jar wiped out a small droid patrold he realized he was being watched mesa in big dodo this time
this was an exellent review keep them coming ras
thanks for the review this set never got me so i didnt get it i also dont like the droidheadonly thing and i havent bought any set like that i planned to buy this on sale but it never happend
great review of a neat way to bulk up your castle guards and their associated weapons and shields i hope we continue to see sets like this in the future they have to be a good money maker for tlg and they always please the fans francis marion on sep 2 2008 1039 am said they should have given him a horse  with that lovely new barding nobody would complain about the price then even if it was 15
ive been thinking about buying this i havent bought any castle sets since kk2 plus i really need that scared face
the cobra on sep 2 2008 1133 am said  why are the figures already built are todays kids so dumb lets go back to those old minifig packs probably to reduce the sizecomplexity of the package thus saving tlc money i dont see it being a big deal as customization is always an option concerning the set not much to say other than it does what its suppose to do build up ones army of knights the variance of faces and accessories are great i especially love the chrome sword the price isnt bad either since the package comes with five nice figs and some great equipment edited by dj2005 03 september 2008  0646 am
after reading your review i might buy me one of these at first i thought it was quite useless but i must admit that your review kinda changes my mind on this bp ive added it to the index
great review i still dont plan on getting this set i want to get more important stuff like the new medieval market edited by lego12 07 october 2008  1219 am
good set but i would have about 4 by now if it came with handcuffs though the roadsign is good
tanks for the review erdbeereis1 but i dont really need to buy this set since theyre are always loads of police sets and its not as if i need anymore cops although stud makes it tempting
set name the knight set number 5615 theme castle pieces 21 minifigs 1 released 2008 price 199 eur 349 usd 349 cdn legoshopcom description a knightly herovillains beware because here comes the knight with his shining armor and weapons hes ready to defend the castle against any foe includes knight minifigure with armor shield and weapons peeron inventory bricklink inventory brickshelf gallery now to the review the box the box is fairly standard and illustrates the set well the back the back of the box is just an advertisement the instructions the instructions are simplistic basic and short the back of the instructions the back of the instructions show the other impulse sets as well as a few others the weapon rack this nifty little weapon rack holds the sword the shield as well as a different style helmet and armour plate the minifigure the minifigure is of the standard castle variety with the basic torso and helmet and a slight scowl on his face accessoriesweapons the set comes with a shield a spear and a swordi particularly like the pattern on the shield different configurations with the extra pieces of equipment i mentioned earlier itis possible to turn your figure into something totally different the entire set this picture shows the weapon rack and the knight ready to ward off skeleton invaders overall build 910 the build is simplistic and suitable for all ages design 710 there really isnt much to judge in this category playability 810 with another minifig plenty of exciting battles can be made minifigs 910 with plenty of customisation options you can turn this one minifig into almost anything price 1010 this set is well worth the price tag overall4350 conclusion i really enjoy these impulse sets for a casual legobuilder who doesnt want to invest top dollar in lego they are perfect and for the hardcore fan you could easily buy 5 or 6 of these to boost your army this is the best impulse set of the first wave and i highly reccomend that you pick this set up soon before they are all gone edited by kimt 08 september 2008  0803 pm
one of the best sets from the new castle theme we havent seen a carriage in a long long time and it looks so spooky and sceary lots of minifigs new skeleton horses 3 this was the first set i got from the new castle theme outstanding
this was my first set from the new line so im rather partial to it im glad to see it get such high praise its quite the lovely little halloweeny set i wonder if thebrickster could modify this for his ww grave stone mocs hint hint hintedy hint hint  edited by pirates forever 13 june 2009  0202 am
im a little late in the coming okay a lot  but regardless id applaud you for another fantastic and insightful review erdbeereis out of all the castle sets this one remains one of my favorites i got it for christmas in 2007 before i intended to spend much money on the new castle theme that changed once i managed to get the kings castle siege for a very good price its really a wonderful set all around  the design accomplishes the spooky undead feel very well and it contains a good piece selection and a phenomenal amount of minifigs seriously this set is almost unrivaled in modern lego in the final area  im still amazed at how many minifigures tlc put in the kit i also appreciate that the carriage has a far more realistic horse arangement  after all the sillyness of the onehorse pulled siege engines in kk its good to finally see a carriage pulled by multiple horses again all in all an excellent set and well worth 20 imo
great review erdbeereis1 this really is a fantasic set lets hope lego makes more sets like these with 5 minifigs4 horses at a price of 1999  actually its about rm200 here and its not even pricetopiece count anyways amazing review ad if i could get more castle sets this year i might even join the reviewers academy
great review erdbeereis this is a cool set pics are great love that shot of the lightsabers well done commanderfox
thanks for the great review this is one of my favorite city kits from 2007 i think its a lot better than the cement mixer from the classic town theme  and it has some cool pieces too
a great review of a very good set i must echo kimt though i seem to be doing it an awful lot it would be improved by the addition of one more fig to the set as it’s the same price band as last years catapult
nice review i just recently purchased it for our future son and had to break into to it to get a first hand account of the merchandise i am not that big into the castle themebeing a citytown person myself but i must say that this set is awsome
this set pulled me out of my dark ages thanks lego
you chose the perfect set for your first poll simon no question this set is one of the alltimebeauties i rated outstanding of course i never hat the chance to get a complete copy of this set but i do own the engine and quite a bunch of monorail tracks your very detailed review made me think of getting the whole set some day thank you very much for this i never realized there were so many details included to this set the snackbar and the telephone cell and all the other nice things really strange for a nineties set which often lacked details the only thing that comes to my mind right now is that the engine looks quite blocky if the set was released today tlc would use more of those parts which make a better design imo and it would fit better to the curved walls of the stations as well wishful thinkinghow much would i love to see the monorail system back again wishful thinking i had to lough when reading your comment on the minifig seats dont you own many of those i dont know where to put mine
best set ever i got my copy years ago from a guy on the old rectoyslego newsgroup anybody here still remember that newsgroup i traded him a guarded inn a black falcons fortress and a couple other small castle sets for it no regrets on that trade it is hard to incorporate a monorail into a town especially if you have a bunch of trains too i ended up making my entire monorail system elevated theres just no easy way to make a monorail  road crossing i also gave up on having it run in a loop instead it runs back and forth between two endpoints
who was the one who rated it above average
this remains the definitive city set in my eyes i never managed to get one but from the instructions it seems to be perfect in just about every way i got the two space monorails a while ago but the much higher prices on this one have kept it out my reach this set is a lot bigger than either of those though i always liked the monorail system a bit better than the trains because you could easily incorporate height into the tracks and spread them out in all three dimensions quote edit and bricklink is wrong giving 1991 as the release date youre right it was 1990 it was apparently released in 1990 in europe and 1991 in north america going by some us and german catalogs i have from that time period edited by cp5670 06 september 2008  0606 am
thanks for the in depth review of a set miles out of my price range it was great to see more of this legend than the miniature square in my magazine god bless nathan
section8 on sep 6 2008 1006 pm said i thought it was out of my price range too then i realized that i had probably spent enough since coming out of my dark ages to buy a misb 6399 so i bought it and i am going to cut back on buying other sets for the next year or so to offset the one big purchase those glimpses of the 2009 sets havent made me regret the cutback that must be one of the biggest expenses legolike buying an misb 6399 congratulations with the purchase though it is a lot of money for one set
gasp blasphemy someone voted this set below average brings out hunting rifle ahem back on topic i remember wanting this set badly for years and i still want it just no as much because its expensive and as this review proves takes up a lot of room ive already got my trains to think about and i wont be getting this set anytime soon i also have a faint memory of this set being featured in one of legos advertisements more specifically someone narrowly missing it hitches a ride races the monorail to the airport and catches the plane i am yet to find it on the net as old lego adverts are hard to come by especially the european ones now to more important matters starts hunting edited by freddie 07 september 2008  1003 pm
i know this is not the advertisement movie but if you want to see the airport shuttle moving click here freddie on sep 7 2008 1102 pm said now to more important matters starts hunting now to more important matters helps hunting
what an amazing set and a truly wonderful review thanks simonwillems for the work you spend on this

inhabitants it seems to always stay that way however the older afols amongst us have experienced totally different situations rubbish everywhere smelly and dirty looking pavements minifigs that were losing their standard grin that is why lego came out with this magnificent truck back in 1987 before that people needed to put there garbage in bags or maybe barrels from that year on every miniman and miniwoman is happily using a trash bin the minifig civil servants never seem to become tired and the garbage truck comes every other day to collect the rubbish and keep the city clean the secret behind the clean lego city and the always happy standard grin of our minifolks are the antilitter warriors that use their powerful machines and handy tools to just get the job done so if you dont own a garbage truck better try to get one before your standard grins also fade and your streets become as dirty as naples where the garbage collectors recently had a strike for quite some time an overview of the set including instructions actually one is included in the set unfortunately i afraid we dont have any boxes of this set left another image of the lego items in the set it shows the truck two civil servants to perform the waste collection duties two garbage bins and a broom and shovel the two chaps that always seem to smile even when the litter that they collect really stinks the accessories that accompany the set a broom and a shovel to help cleaning up in case a dustbin tips over a very nice feature of the set is that the elevator at the back can be lifted in more or less the same way that real garbage trucks do as you can see here the dustbin is emptied through a red train window it seems to be that the hinges of my version will need some revision panels inside the back of the truck maximize waste capacity for this 4 stud wide truck it is nice that the designers added this simple red round brick on a clip presumably it should depict cylinders to let the back compartment tip for emptying or otherwise it might be gastanks again the complete set it is very complete set but some additions could make it even more playable  garbage eg a green flower bottom or some round plates 1 x 1  a place for the second worker to position himself on when the trucks needs to drive to the dumpsite or an other street and also vertical bars for that second worker to hold himself by this is what the truck will look like when dumping the litter at the recycle plant or dump site the whole back nicely tilts so that all the litter will fall out of the truck a view on the back of the truck quite a small but yet effective opening the front of the truck only one seat for just the driver but i personally prefer that to a 6 wide truck that fills the total width of the streets and has problems with corners of course set 7991 the orange garbage truck of last year is also nice we also own some of those but we never put them in our lego town since they take too much room and the color scheme of 6693 is also more preferable to us the two panels with the printed recycling pattern are a bit worn so we might recreate the recycle logo and put it on a sticker some day playability 810 like i mentioned it is too bad that the set doesnt have any litter however lego also saw that and has put litter in the 6693 set design 910 a really nice truck with two minifigs and very nice details price 10 i was not able to get any price information at bricklink one can still obtain a 2nd hand one for about 25 overall 810 a set that should be entitled a classic in the same list as the pizza restaurants the 7750 and the blacksmith shop that was all the pictures i was allowed to take since it seems that those brave man still have quite some trash cans to empty thanks guys for doing the dirty work so our minifigs stay happy and our streets stay clean peeron lugnet brickset bricklink entries additional notes on the review my brother has always been keen on garbage trucks however when he became aware of this truck it wasnt available in the stores anymore newer sets that had the recycling theme we not that good they didnt have the emptying mechanism so after our dark ages one of the first sets we bought were some of those nice refuse collection trucks although the new orange truck has the desired mechanisms and thankfully is a decent garbage truck we more like 4 wide trucks than 6 studs wide trucks so for the years to come our lego town inhabitants will still be seeing this great truck to control their waste problems
this truck is simply beautiful its on my brickset wanted list i love the colour scheme red and yellow are the right choice for this vehicle the back part of the truck can be opened so it can discharge the rubbish like real garbage trucks youve also mentioned that in your review and i find it a wonderful detail thanks for the review jopiek
great to find this review of a classic set and its far better than any yuk set from 1997 omg what were they thinking  i prefer the six wide for trucks but for the 80s it was perfect and even today still holds its own 
great review and i love the soft yellow effect to the pics imo the most recent garbage truck shouldve used the same piece for lifting the cans into the big bin instead of the droid arms
6206 tie interceptor number of pieces 212 number of minifigs 1 price 1999 usd 1799 eur theme star wars episode vi year released 2006 brickset folder bricklink catalog welcome to my ninth review the boards todays review is the long awaited tie interceptor but does it live up to expectations well lets find out i believe this is the first and only time tlg made this set so lets begin the review the box the box is standard for its time with silver font the background on the front has some planets and the death star ii clarifying that this set is from episode vi overview this set comes with the interceptor model and one fig the interceptor has a very sleek futuristic design with four wings and a ballshaped cockpit the tie interceptor is a stealthy speedy vehicle in the imperial fleet it is used for scouting missions and not meant for attacking due to its weak structure and low arsenal front this version of the tie group is very attractive and coollooking it has an aerodynamic shape giving it looks and speed while not accurate to the movies grey and black colored ties the blue in place of the grey is just fine and does not alter the coolness of the design thankfully there are no stickers in this set cockpit here you can see the ballshaped cockpit be very very careful when opening it its very flimsy and breaks off almost every time fortunately both the windshield and the dish on top are printed and not stickers please dont mind the dust cockpit interior this is the inside of the cockpit it is very roomy airtight and one of the few cockpits in sw sets that are this good it makes up for lack of detail by giving the pilot plenty of room so you should have no trouble there it is also very smooth in the back and where the windshield folds down this is by far the best sw cockpit i have ever seen done by tlg good job the only bad thing is the two tan bricks that clash with the rest of the color wing attachment this is how the wings are attached to the cockpit on each side unfortunately the design on this part is not so good and sometimes the wings break off plus this part is very blocky and there is a big juniorized piece on the base of the wings wings here is what each wing looks like there are three parts on each wing a middle and two fins the wings are very aerodynamic with a diamondlike design note the imperial insignias and the blue tiles lining the wings wing attachments contd here again you see how the middle wing part is attached to the base juniorized piece and the fins attached to the base by hinges the hinges allow the fins to fold in and out a bit but again this is very fragile and the fins often break off gun placements this is an example of four guns on the ship one on the tip of each fin the guns consist of a tile with a tenic tunnel hole on the bottom attached to a technic pin which is attached to a black bar a good design altogether back here you see the rear of the cockpit you can see why the opening mechanism is so flimsy the whole top and front is connected to the body only by a weak hinge system as seen in the picture also note the small transblue dish and the four transred studs minifigure finally here is the single figure that comes in this set a tie pilot it is an all black figure with a life support system decal on the front and a helmet with silver imperial insignias an overall good minifig with a different helmet mold than the stormtrooper or shadowtrooper well i suppose thats about all lets get to the final verdict build 610 a little difficult due the flimsiness of the ship but should only take the average builder no more than 30 minutes playability 710 its fun to fly around   but has no real functions swooshability 710 you can swoosh it around fairly well just be careful not to accidentally break it minifigs 810 a good fig although having only one leaves something more to be desired design 410 very very flimsy with the wings windshield and fins but good for display price 710 i think it was actually 30 usd when i got it but im not sure overall score 65 an average set very delicate so much that you can hardly pick it up but good for display the minifig is okay and having no stickers is good i would recommend this to a hardcore ot fan that wraps it all up please vote your opinion on this set in the poll and ill see you next review edited by jimbutcher 15 september 2008  0310 am
thanks for sharing your thoughts and opinion about this set with us ive added it to the index this is one of my favourite ties and i think tlg did a good job at designing it
name jetport fire squad set no 6440 theme lego system  town year 1991 pieces 84 minifigs 2 price usd 2750 which equals about eur 1926€ and gbp 1557£ introduction one of the sets that especially my cousin likes is this one one time at the dutch legoworld event we had three of those there with flashing lights and loud sirens trying to put out the fire that was caused by the crash of again some lego aircraft we never had this set before our drak ages and the sets probably came from ebay or so in my opinion the newest airport rescue is nice too but in the conclusion i will make some additional remarks about that just imagine what it would be like for your lego town if the pilot of one of your smaller planes just couldnt stop before the end of the runway here you see the disaster that happened some day in our town fortunately all passengers got out safely thanks to our brave fire fighters this magnificent truck was used to help putting out the fierce fire caused by the aviation gas from the small plane the set includes two firefighters in distinguishable airport uniforms in order to be able to safe the passengers and go for a quick intervention our brave firemen have an axe for each of them airtanks and a portable fire extinguisher here you see the truck on the right side the large spout on the roof really makes it a remarkable truck as you can see behind the red door there is space for the airtank of our brave firemen at the right there is also place for the small hand held extinguisher the left side of the truck has a water hose instead for a truck from 1991 there is quite some room inside actually both firemen fit inside unfortunately there is only one seat at the back there are two clips for the axes there you can also find the main switch for the light and sound system as you can see the red flashing lights do their job quite well the sirene is just behind the bar with the flashing lights the main spout just seems to begin emitting water the front of the truck for some reason there are two hidden spouts there as well what their purpose is seems unclear but they look nice kimt suggests that it is for foaming the runway and that is a real option of course this set can be found on peeron lugnet brickset bricklink entries playability 810 very nice set details that are movable and of course the light and sound design 810 nice sets with nice details but could have even been better seat for 2nd fireman missing no oxigen masks and only one airtank price 710 for a light and sound set and two firefighters the price is reasonable i would say overall 810 nice sets some details could even be better too bad that there is only a five to choose from a sticker when you have more than one truck last but not least an overview of the complete set including instructions fire mastered as the dutch firefighters will say when they have completed their job we have also bought the newer airport rescue truck 7891 however we think this 6440 one is much better the light and sound all the nice features and the nice details are much better than the new truck edited by jopiek 11 september 2008  1025 am
i owned it and loved it when i was young  i really miss it
jopiek on sep 8 2008 1224 am said thanks of course for the flattery but do you then from your profession understand what the purpose is of the front spouts that even can be hide since that puzzles me it can be that the lego designers thought it was a nice touch and didnt bothered about the realistic value of such a feature but i dont suppose that that is the case here somehow i had just noticed your reply to be honest with you the aes in my country does not have front spouts in their fire engine i do not remember seeing this feature before it is a possibility that this feature is included in some models or an imaginative addition from our lego designers i will need to check this out kimt on sep 9 2008 0316 pm said perhaps the front sprouses are for foaming the runway that is a logical answer

information name fire control center set no 4953  peeroncom theme lego legoland year 1991 pieces 516 minifigs 4 price usd 8500  gbp unknown  eur unknown bricklink search results brickset lugnet introduction this week i got the flu so since i have to stay home and get better i might as well make a review its one of the most amazing older city sets thus making it a really valuable review this is the story about four handsome firemen living in one of the most amazing city structures out there the 6389 fire control center the box i actually didnt remember the box to be that small borrowed from peeron the four hunky firemen oh jeah what women doesnt like a man in a uniform the manual even the manual is aging but then again its 17 years old review as you all know a city must have some standard civil services like a hospital and a police station a fire house also is a must for any lego city this particular fire house is one of the most amazing sets ever to be released in this cool set you get 4 minifigs all fire fighters two verhicles and a helicopter firefighters have to move around the futuristic fire truck is definately my favourite chiefs car the smallest verhicle of the set its a small allterrain jeep for the fire chief pretty much a standard car in those days a real simple layout and a trunk which holds a small fire hose its lucky to be in this set because it complements the whole thing the car luckily its red and it has de cool signs on the side helicopter another great addition to the whole set is the helicopter again in a basic setup for that kind of verhicle at the time this one has the nice addition of two hoses to put out the fires raging in lego city the chopper no it doesnt really fly really cool fire truck thingy this fire truck is definately the best of the verhicles in this set its actually a futuristic model of fire trucks i havent seen any other fire truck like this i saw a police truck like it though but were talking fire fighters right actually the whole thing han open up to reveal a number of fire fighting appliances such as a hose a computer and a oxygen tank the fire truck click for bigger version the main building actually looks kinda empty when the trucks and chopper are gone however this still is realistic compared to a real fire house also the front has those amazing sliding doors which make this thing really look cool and clean off to fight a fire main structure with the slinding doors pulled down actually those sliding doors are also the hard part of the model since all the bricks must be perfectly aligned or else the doors will stutter but if youre a little familiar with lego then you dont need to worry from the back enough room to play with im going to give my perspectives on each of the sides on the left we have the garage for the bigger fire truck the only real flaw about this set is that this garage isnt long enough for the fire truck this could have been solved by making it two or three studs longer notice the cool sunroof in the middle we have the chiefs office complete with coffee machine a diversity of computers and a tape recorder most likely to tape any incoming calls a lot of details are crammed up in there just like in the rest of the set to the right is the helicopter platform i really like the greyblueyellow of the platform because it doesnt look so red anymore dont get me wrong red is a cool color but not too much red and the helicopter actually fits and stays in place during playtime the baseplate filled up this picture says it all again the four lego hunks are greeting all the ladies the minifigs are from a classic series this happens with more of my lego sets bottom line is that this set is one of the best fire houses lego created verdict the build is pretty easy but takes a while to really see where you are with your building its nice to have a hospital from the same era this create a more uniform look to your city once you completed the model your baseplate is pretty filled up but still has a lot of opportunities playability 1010 cool trucks a chopper and sliding doors nuff said design 910 insanely good design price 1010 couldnt get better than this overall 9610 with a score like that one can only say get one now time to go home the trucks and chopper back on their rightful spots
big supie on sep 7 2008 0946 pm said i think the 6382 fire station is the better one from the 80ies i agree have that 6382 set for about 27 years now but i have always like that one futuristic truck when i was a child so i also still have some feelings for this set as well crazydance nice review after all
this looks like a great set i like the futuristic fire truck that might be what i do with my imperial shuttles glass cockpit
nice classic set are those hoses around the engine pneumatic tubes that technic catalog looks interesting too i have the catalogs for the next several years but not that one quote this is the model at step five the piston is already attached imagine this state on step 5 in modern sets back then lego had challenging instructions not the step madness like today the most extreme example of this was the engine step in the 8865 set which uses over 120 pieces by itself
cp5670 on sep 7 2008 0525 pm said nice classic set are those hoses around the engine pneumatic tubes that technic catalog looks interesting too i have the catalogs for the next several years but not that one the most extreme example of this was the engine step in the 8865 set which uses over 120 pieces by itself the pneumatic tubes are listed seperately under x188 the classic hose is x467 i think theyre just the same with just a single difference the x467 seemed to be already cut in lenght instead of x188 which must be cut in lenght mfg widdi
a nice old classic the driver has a nice hat and torso and the train is well designed except for that thing on the roof
a set from the golden age of lego it brings back a lot childhood memories seeing this review i was 5 and just starting to play with lego around that time i could look for hours the lego catalogs dreaming of sets like this one thanks for this wonderful review
are you going to review the other 12v sets if you have the time
beach cruisers set  6445 theme island xtreme stunts year released 2002 piece count 97 minifigs 2 list price 7 usd during a trip to legoland california in 2002 their big store had a neat little display of some new sets and themes including island xtreme stunts the new theme offered great colors including orange tan and light blue which immediately caught my eye the theme focussed on island fun with some adventure and included some great figs like the brickster i had to buy at least one set choosing truck  stunts trike review coming soon at the time the theme was short lived and many of the sets were on sale at discount toy stores not too long after their initial release i picked up this set 6445 beach cruisers for 333 usd which will be my first of three island xtreme stunt reviews starting with the box a race between the street surfer and skate boarder the back shows some alternate models including a sail boat and jet ski same image on the instructions as the box but the backside shows the island xtreme stunts video game for different platforms the set includes a small decal sheet for the skateboard i love the two figs included within this set one is a hippietype with shades and leafed muscle short and the other pizza boy skateboarder check out the pizza boy on his skateboard two green brackets are included for attaching each fig to the long grey bar using this piece one can make the skateboarder do tricks and flips the street surfer vehicle is pretty nice to the sail is placed on a black bar and lance then attached to the vehicle heres a picture of the vehicle to me it has that old soap box derby look to it  like something kids would create to race down a hill the vehicle doesnt have a steering wheel but rather two levers which i think work well in the cockpit heres the underside the set has three neon orange wheels that attach to technic axle pins to attach to the vehicle lastly the entire set with a few extra pieces final thoughts while island xtreme stunts is not the best citytown subtheme esp for the traditional lego classic town fan it does have some fun sets like this little beach cruiser good figs a skateboard and a very rollable fun word equivalent to swooshable but for vehicles with wheels vehicle you can even blow on the sail to get it to roll across the floor this set is a lot of fun
nice review i got this set not long after my ending of the dark ages it was even then already on slae for just 5 euro i like the figs and the vehicles it were some of my first orange pieces the hippie guy is called  snap lockit and the pizza guy is called  pepper roni i think the legodesigners had a cosy evening with much beer when they thought about the names i think this line was the only line which was made first as computergame and after that as a real line instead of the other computergames based on already existing lines
wout on oct 16 2008 0100 pm said the hippie guy is called  snap lockit and the pizza guy is called  pepper roni i think the legodesigners had a cosy evening with much beer when they thought about the names thanks for that bit of info im not familiar with the computer game or the characters although i may have heard the name pepper roni do you know the island girls name not included in this set though
shoc on sep 9 2008 0555 pm said thanks for the review i loved this theme it had some of the greatest pieces ever arranged in any theme brilliant printed parts and figures and some good colours snap lockitt hippie dude  is a great figure with a cool name i own him from another set but unfortunately not this one it looks like a very good set no stickers and good printed parts too nice review hahaha that made me laugh for some reason i dont know why though i agree with it i have him as well i got him from the orange jetski set
this is a really nice small set i think it fascinates me that those are actual printed parts thats something we dont see too often anymore the figures are very good although i must say i like the name hippie dude better than snap lockitt does anyone know why the brickster has one blue hand thanks for the great review edited by erdbeereis1 09 september 2008  0645 pm
it is not very often that i rate a legoset poor its the first time actually but in this case i had no other option the idea of this set is good and i like the mostly yellow minifig but the design of both the airplane weird windowpiece a propellor that is way too small minimal skies underneath and a strange colourscheme and the hangglider two handlebars on the wings too many colours makes the set mark the essence of legos downfall during those years i really appreciate the fact that you made a review of this set brickster it made me look into the details of 6735 but i am just as sure today as i was back then i will never buy this anyway thanks for the review the quality of the set may be a disapointment your review certainly is not
hello all eurobricks members and town lovers today i will be doing up a review on glade runner set this is a very small set which is slightly bigger than the current impulse set its part of the race theme which involved in land and sea racers back in the early 1990s i just love these orignal race themes which is produced back then name glade runner theme lego system  town  race year 1993 pieces 29 minifigs 1 price usd325 an image of a 6513 glade runner swamp race shall begins this glade runner is pretty nice looking with its sleek sports look well for a glade runner in the water it certainly looks much impressive somehow i felt that the 6513 is aligned with the 6514 trail ranger i always had that perception that both vehicles are brothers and was released under the same year in fact glade runner was released in 1993 based on peeron information i always felt that this set is used for investigators or police to used for tracking or search purposes in the swamp areas instead of using it for a race i will place this set in the jungle somewhere like bricksters jungle settings although it looks too bright for such serious agenda but i think its pretty useful to use it this way they can rent it from the nearby shop and used it to search it kind of reminded me of the movie us marshals which acted by tommy lee jones and wesley snipes meet the ace please pardon his trousers i did not bleach it earlier it was caused overtime without adequate caring to the minfig look at this great article on how to protect your lego the driver wears a green vest with patch pockets on both sides this is my favourite design during that period it comes with a yellow lifevest too as for the 1x4 printed tile with 3 stars shining in front of the runner its a very nice printed tile that can be used for other racing purposes in other sets as well overall design the built is very simple and yet so realistic making use of the aeroplane tailhead to add as the holder for the rotor is smart the white bricks acting as a platform for both sides to hold the driver to sit onto the centre with the steering wheel at the front i am very happy with this design place the glade runner in front of the fan with a reasonable fan speed you will see the rotor runs like a charm different angles of the vehicle close encounter with the swamp sharks coined by brickster see you later to conclude this is a very nice little set that can provide much fun i dont really used it to race in the waters instead i leave it to my imagination and used it for police investigation purposes such as air crash excerise search and rescue operations and etc i think it can provides quite a fun loving experience although the set might not be very appealing to some people but i find it very fun to play around and is one of my favourite sets in the 1990s where i placed it with my 6514 trail ranger together summary review playability 8510 i leave it to your imagnination design 910 very simple yet realistic design price 1010 a very inexpensive set great way to buy such small sets at a low price overall 8510 glade runner is not common in town and city theme its not a must to have it but if you ever come across it do get it i gave it a 4 based on my review score card what about yours hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine comments and critics are strongly welcomed pictures can be found in my brickshelf when moderated
thanks erdbeereis1 for your kind words glad you liked this set just wondering whom has rated poor and below average i will like to know why you voted this way perhaps you could share with me and the rest on your thoughts and views
nice review white fang this really reminds me of an allamerican set with its red white and blue colors and the white stars although i really like the fig with its scruffy bearded face i find the green torso a bit odd for this set i suppose i would expect some sort of redblue racer fig with a whiteblue racing helmet swamp sharks  too funny  you always add a nice addition of humor to your reviews now im going to check out some wonder woman clips on youtube
one of my favourite sets me and couple of buddies got this set back then the fig was so cool sun glasses fast boat
what would we do without the trucks of legoland to clean up our town well i didnt want to find out so i bought this set straight away 7991 recycle truck set info set name 7991 recycle truck released 2007 theme city price usd 1499gbp 1299eur 1495 pieces 206 minifigs 1 review time leading off the box the front shows the recycle man loading up the trash can one thing here is really bizarre on lego sh and everywhere else it says that this set is called recycle truck which makes sense as it has a recycle logo on the truck however on my box it says the set is called garbage truck has this happened to anyone else or is it just me here is the back of the box which shows some of the things you can do with this set the bags with this set you get 3 bags which are numbered and do you see what i see yes thats right the dss is in a bag so it doesnt get bent why tlg doesnt do this more often is beyond me bag 1 the set comes with a very nice selection of pieces a large number of these are orange manual silly me i forgot to take a picture of the front of the manual the picture is the same as on the front of the box the back shows some of the 2007 city sets in a nice little scene and inside minifig here is the friendly garbagerecycle man he looks nice but with the same head as so many other city figs before him come on tlg give us some new heads the sticker sheet the stickers actually are pretty decent as far as stickers go i like the recycle sign after bag 1 this is where we stand after the first bag is built bag  2 the parts contained in the second bag more nice orange pieces here extra parts some nice 1x1 slopes and 1x1 round plates everything built now that everything is built lets check it out the design of the set is very nice and the color scheme looks great when you see it you immediately know what it is the back has a droid arm that acts as a handle to dump the trashrecycling in the truck its simple but works well here you can see the dumping mechanism it works by a sliding technic beam with a stopper on top of the truck you can store the workers cart this works really well i think though that the top of the truck overall looks a bit jumbled up with a few too many different colors the bottom trash dumping time this is a good feature of the set a very well built snot front section this looks fantastic with the grills and number plate sticker someone has left a big mess on the street brickshelf folder ratings price 1010 for 15 this is a very good deal at 206 pieces parts 910 lots of orange design 910 a very well designed set especially the front playability 910 the trash dumper is fun and the added broom and cart make for good play value build 810 simple but stayed interesting overall4550 brickset lego sh bricklink peeron taking out the trash summary this is a great small set for the price with fun features nice colors and good design i would certainly recommend this set no matter what its really called thanks and happy building
nice truck indeed but the yellow one is better i think at least if you put them on a roadplate it seems to me that those road plates are too small for that also it will not empty completely because of that panel well for the rest it is a nice set and a fine review
what a great set and a very nice review erdbeereis i think the only improvement to this set would have been the use of chrome exhaust pipes and front grill i bought this set with a lot of excitement but unfortunately have not put it together yet what are your thoughts on these larger 6stud wide detailed vehicles as opposed to 4stud wide classics heres an image of 6668 recycle truck released in 1992 ps i like the use of taking out sponge bob in your review

that looks like one of those big strange recycle trucks from new york city i like it
i like this set but i cant give it a good grade for playability as the rearmost hinging section is too stiffly hinged so when you open it its likely to break if you hold it just over the shovel and broom my truck thus has that function and with it of course the whole container tipping disabled i also moved the cab a bit forward and the front axle rearward to give the cab the typical garbage truck look as they are often very low slung this also created space behind the cab for some equipment
