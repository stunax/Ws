these are pretty good, but i think they look too much like the standard town roads from that period. i like the black space plates from the early 90s better (6710).
why pay $350 dollars, just download the instructions on buy the pieces off bricklink. this is was i did when i wanted to create the blacktron ii in the futuron colour scheme. also i tend to like both sets of base plates, i bought the black ones myself and they were of great use but there more for creating the idea of a city or space station, something more completely man made. the gray ones give a better look of the roads being laid over bare rock especially when you introduce the plates with the craters. i would love to see a 48*48 baseplate with roads through them which would allow more building space on the side and maybe some craters. also 48*48 baseplates with craters but a few different kinds to create more or a realistic look and less of a repeating pattern. and with all those rocks you have to put everything up on supports, much better looking bases then.
kdog, on jul 8 2008, 09:48 pm, said: that's the problem; the instructions aren't anywhere to be found, not that i've seen. the set does seem to have some rare parts, but i doubt $350 worth. by looking at the pictures used to display this set i've a sneaky suspicion it did not come with instructions but meant for the pictures to be ideas. the whole set was suppose to teach children to use their imagination, giving them instructions would somewhat defeat this while trying to figure how to build things from looking at pictures would be a much better educational experience.
i also love these plates! i build a lot with them (e.g. this ). unfortunately they are not available in bley ...
well what to say? i got this boat late 70s, when we were on our way to italy to spend the holidays there. my parents always needed to keep my quiet during the 3-day trip, and the best way to do that was to buy me a lego set... i got this one in a gas station in germany. as far as i remember italy didn't have lego sets, so a gas station close to the italian border but still in germany or austria was very often their last chance. i often saw large quantities of lego sets in those gas stations though... i remember seeing yellow castle and... the galaxy explorer, standing on a shelf. it would be my birthday 1-3 week(s) later so i always made sure they knew what to buy for me...
nice review, 'mariko'! this set is way past my time. the baseplate is okay (though i hate those dots). the car is pretty cool too...
great review. i never had this set, but it looks nice. i really like the checker pattern near the big window.
great review mariko! this set is way before my time too. i like how lego used to create simple one story houses instead of the really tall house that we see in today's town theme, such as 8403 city house. one story houses such as 345 just look more realistic to my eyes. the simplistic, minimalism vibe that i get with this set is something that is hard to find in today's much more detailed sets (although, trust me, i love love love today's detailed sets). - the brick is epic
image link from brickset i thought i would do a pic review of the 1st lego castle, the yellow castle, #375- released in 1978. first, let me say that this set was truly "ahead of it's time". it introduced new building concepts (such as the hinge and new figs (most were still the armless, faceless mini-figs during this time). this set introduced me to castle which was my first real favorite theme. i enjoyed breaking it out from the garage and building it again. the majority of the pieces are 1x1, 1x2, 1x3, 1x4, 1x6, and 1x8 standard yellow bricks. the set also includes yellow 1x4, 1x6x2, and 1x8x2 arches, yellow 2x2, 2x3, and 2x4 bricks, various grey plates, 1x2 black inverted slopes, red drawbridge pieces, two classic red castle doors, 8 hinges (2 for each corner), and a few other nifty pieces including six red 1x1 windows. a complete inventory is available at peeron: 375 inventory. a view from the front. the drawbridge is 6x8. the front tower stands 12 1/3 bricks high (plenty of room for horses). the drawbridge does work. the string (originally black) is attached to the opposite side between a plate and the arches. the right side of the castle (identical to the left). i've always loved the 2x2x3 sloped bricks (and corner pieces): the back. i love these red doors. a 1x4 brick attached to the other side of the baseplate keeps intruders out. that banner was the original sticker piece. notice the wear. the rear tower, largest of the towers: and backside: two hinges at each of the corners allow the corners to open for playability: before opening: open: lots of arches add to the detail of the inner walls: inner front: this set included 14 figs (how about that for quantity). unfortunately, i peeled off worn stickers from the shields and the breast plates years ago. the blue castle guards and knights are the keepers of the castle. i still think that these helmets are the best lego ever made. they just look good. the black and white knights: and the red knights: i've always prefered to use the black and red guards and flags from the knight's joust set(s): conclusion the yellow castle is truly a classic set and i'm so glad i kept the pieces to this together after all these years. if you have a chance to buy one or even obtain the set instructions, it's worth building and wouldn't be difficult to substitute grey or other colors. i hope you enjoyed this review and feel free to share your comments.
yup that is very very nice..i wish i had been alive back then :d well ill never have a chance to own something like this so this is as close ill get to it! thanks for showing me the greatness....
question for you guys, what's the best way to clean lego? i was noticing that the baseplates and gray plates to this set are very dusty and could use a good cleaning. mild soap water soak? is there a better way?
toothbrush and mild soap - and lots of time gently scrubbing a cleaning. and great review - i love that set *wub* *wub* i'm sorry that you seem to miss the stickers - if you find somewhere to download printable copies of them please let me know *satis* kimt
here's a shot of a custom forestman. these really work well: i'm using just regular sticker paper. how do you stick transparent plastic on top?
wasn't this the first castle lego released?
kieldaman, on 10 july 2011 - 11:43 am, said: rare classic sets are always a priceless part of any lego collection, and it's a good thing you still have this first set of yours luxor (or did you purchase a new one?). excellent review btw, it's always a pleasure getting a closer look at these classic sets which i wouldn't have known to exist had i not seen this review. overall i think it's a really good set at that time, of course judging this one by modern standards won't be fair but at the time i'm pretty sure it was a 'cool' set to have (though less cooler than having the harley davidson set). thanks kiel. i can grant you that's the same old one i got as my first set. i'm very glad to have it lightningtiger, on 10 july 2011 - 12:21 pm, said: thanks for the review 'luxorv', an interesting old set, though i find it hard to imagine a square smoke stack instead of roundish. it truly has that classic lego simplistic build with all studs showing and making do with standard partsm except the few you havepointed out 'luxorv'. a nice flashback 35 years ago....now thats old school anyway brick on everyone ! indeed, this set must be valued in relation to its own time and style. i was considering making an 'updated' version with current parts, but i'm not sure if/when i'll have the time for it. rufus, on 10 july 2011 - 07:09 pm, said: thanks, luxor, for bringing us this excellent tour round an old classic! for its time, this is truly a remarkably detailed and beautiful set, and i think it's amazing how it's still in such good condition after all this time. do you have any more from this era (excepting the harley, of course )? i've created a whole new index to put them in interesting that you had to create a new index for them , but these two are the only ones i have for now. maybe other members will be ble to contribute to it in the future
i voted 'outstanding.' regarding this set, i found mine at a consignment store. it was inside of a larger set from the same time period.
well, it's not exactly a large shuttle, but still a nice set: 442 space shuttle year released: 1979 piece count: 79 minifigs: 1 vehicles: 0 list price: unknown this little classic was my smallest classic space set. believe it or not, i still have the box: here's the back: the instructions are pretty tattered and missing a section. i had to download some from the web: but the ship is again intact, missing only one grey 1x3 plate: i've always liked this computer piece: here's the under side. this set included the small classic jet engines: a close-up of the sloped printed space brick: and the complete set with minifig: this set was a great little space ship that made a nice addition to the blue space theme. as small as it was, it could hold two-three figs (one standing up). i don't even think the mars mission recon drop ship holds three figs. in any case, it was a must-have for blue space fans, and probably only a few bucks back in the day. swoosh!
and again those tears in my eyes. with original box...! i really love those classic space stuff. looks like i need to clean my stuff this summer.
nice!!! 442 is the lowest set number i have seen for any classic space set, so it must been released with the first wave in 1978. its remarkable that a lego spaceship this old and small can seat more figs than the much bigger mx-71 recon dropship of today. anyway, i just want to grab it out of the screen and swoosh it all over the place, lol. tlg, please make these classic space sets again! i promise i'll buy many!
i'm sorry you had to move this topic, white fang. when it was in the reviewers academy, the teachers agreed it belonged in other themes. *shrug* i guess it ended up where it belonged eventually.
outstanding review of a very special set! i actually remember seeing this set on the store shelves of local department stores. can you believe it? fantastic review walter. i really enjoy looking at these vintage sets. this one deserves a blog!
here is the spirit of st louis. just go there (washington) and have a look of this legend : cavannus, on jul 15 2009, 09:40 pm, said: in 1977, trans or yellow slopes existed already, and using them would have made the plane more realistic. i don't think so. there is no 45Â° slope in the original plane design ... and no front cockpit window. quote a third rear wheel would have enhanced playability and design, rather than this ugly black round brick. except that it wouldn't have been the spirit of st louis. this set is a great one and i wish i'd bought it in '77. it is the spirit of the 70ties ...
daoudbazaar, on jul 15 2009, 05:26 pm, said: [...] there is no 45Â° slope in the original plane design ... and no front cockpit window. [...] except that it wouldn't have been the spirit of st louis. oooops, you're completely right, the spirit of st-louis didn't have any front window nor rear wheel. anyway, i think a standard ryan m-1/m-2 plane would have been a better choice. less a legend, but more a flexible plan for multiple uses!
i really like the design, it has an aesthetic value lacking from most official lego planes and follows closely to the real thing (minus the colours), something that can't really be claimed for more recent sets.
483 alpha-1 rocket base year released: 1979 piece count: 170 minifigs: 3 vehicles: 1 (two sections) list price: unknown despite the nuclear non-proliferation treaty of 1968, lego dared design a rocket base complete with a rocket system that may have had nuclear capability in 1979. luckily, the rocket was defective having rather flimsy white bricks that did not stay together well during launch attempts. lego scrapped its wmd program and the result was this classic "blue era" space set known as the alpha-1 rocket base. instructions: on the backside of the instructions, the set is featured with the space command center, space cruiser, and a few vehicle sets: the set includes three figs: and this great rocket fuel tanker: here's the front section complete with computer: and the rocket fuel section: the set has some interesting features including the control section, fuel control, and launch pad: on top of the control section is a nicely design radar/tracking system: here's the open control room: the launch pad and fuel control: the fuel control includes two sink pieces and blue steering wheels: and lego's wmd (weapon of mass destruction), the alpha-1 on the launch pad: here's a shot of the launching mechanism: unfortunately, i have lost one of the blue sink/faucet pieces as well as a black hose: a close-up of the alpha-1 rocket. the white bricks never stayed together well often times coming apart within your hands: the arming and guidance system was nicely designed: a view of the complete set: and another: this is a great set. the base, fuel vehicle, and launch platform offers a great amount of playability. my only complaint is the rocket (as mentioned above). i don't think i ever played with it a sa kid because it always fell apart. share your comments regarding this classic space set.
nice rewiew the set is good too)
apophisv, on jun 20 2007, 10:32 am, said: btw, could you exchange the modules and make pics of that? i'd like to see how the building looks with the flat roof instead of the dutch style one. i?m sure that a could do that. it?s a good idea, i hope you can wait a few days, i?ll do it this weekend and make more pics then. holodoc, on jun 20 2007, 03:22 pm, said: thank you legocastlegirls for your quick review! *y* it?s the first time i realize the back of the market street. the tan bricks are a replacement for some windows i?d guess? i do love that building, especially the top floor with the neat balcony. *wub* of course you are (again) left alone filling the interior. but i just had some food parts ordered at bricklink... x-d i also think that this is a replacement for some windows and i like this idea, because i often see houses with that kind of "windows" holodoc, on jun 20 2007, 03:22 pm, said: one thing i?d like to know: this is an online-exclusive, right? can i order it at a lego-store (k?ln / oberhausen) and get the sum rewarded on my voucher booklet? *sweet* i heard it i don?t know that this is an online-exclusive.. but i know that you can order it at your legostore, and when you get it, you get the stamps for your voucher booklet at your next visit at the legostore. but you have to bring the bill with you. barbossa, on jun 20 2007, 04:10 pm, said: i? am totally agree with snefreo1, the yellow cylinder and the lamppost should be on a level above the tiles. actually i have put a 2x2 plat under the lamppost on my cc, looks much better if you ask me. yeah i also agree with snefrooe and you. i?ve never seen holes at the footpath for some lamps. it is really dangerous for all the nice little minifigs :-) greetings sandra
i also missed your review, but now that i found it i really happy i just ordered the set :) thanks for the pics! peter
woooooooooooow! that's some maquette! say, i wonder if the blackhole stormie will be playable in lswtcs? maquette on!
you're the coolest man i know! thanks for sharing copmike. that thing is awesome.
thank you, interesting indeed. those are quite expensive though, perhaps 60 dollars or more.
so, were you serious about any of the boba fett, luke skywalker, stormtrooper & darth vader ones? because i'd love to see a boba fett and vader one. :-d
mutley777, on dec 2 2009, 07:29 am, said: well it has taken me over 2 years but i have finally bought this maquette! it's a real beauty! just don't ask what it cost! my set of maquettes is finally complete. *snip* wow! mutley that is so beautiful!!!! i've seen these maquettes around before but they are alittle pricey , would love to get afew though! just had alook on ebay and wow they sure are selling for a pretty darn high price! great review copmike, even though it was two years ago. i hope your collection is complete now aswell. commanderfox edited by commanderfox, 01 december 2009 - 06:57 pm.
great reason to review a great thread. your collection is truely something to behold.
wow thats so cool mutley. my favourites are darth vader and luke skywalker because the others seem to have funny looking heads. not so much boba fett but the storm trooper and the blackhole stormtrooper do. it must be their helmets. edited by roncanator, 02 december 2009 - 08:29 am.
i always wanted one of these (*sighs*) i don't think that i'll ever get it though.
well, now that i have some money, a trip to toysrus was obviously in my future, especially since my local tru has much of the summer 2007 lineup. when i got there, almost all the smaller castle sets had been sold out, but there was one left: the one i am now reviewing for both eurobricks and bzpower. ;-) the box: well, for starters, the castle theme boxes are beautiful! the blended clear and stormy skies give a great ?clash of the titans? effect, and the action poses help as well. ;-) the back is equally nice, featuring a photo showing kids how to use the crossbow, and the brave axe wielder taking a swipe at the skeleton (foolish soldier, that won?t work on skellies! see later on in the review to find out why). and of course, we have a small box with the link to the official lego website, where tlc can advertise even more lego sets! :p the contents: after opening the box, a single bag of pieces (with a couple loose ones), the instruction manual and necessary catalog ( :-p ), and a new wider rubber band holder spilt out. the instruction manual is clear as a bell. no color trouble here, folks! also, it?s worth mentioning the nice background with the mountain and king?s castle silhouettes. :-) sorry that there's no picture, but i'll take one if someone wants to see it. ;-) the pieces: for being a 5 dollar set (well, seven in my case. darn your above average prices, tru!), crossbow attack features a lot of nice pieces (as does the entire castle lineup). notable elements include two large brown spoked wheels, two brown modified 1x1?s, a pearl gold slope end, and six dark blue modified 1x1x2/3 slopes! the bulk of the pieces, however, are nothing special. i?ll let the picture do the talking for this. the accessories are by far the best parts in this kit. two different helmets in a beautiful shiny silver are my favorite, but i also really like the scythe (looks good for mocing) and the round shield ( *wub* ), which are both brand new parts. and can anyone not love the classic axe and crossbows? oh, and there?s a black lightsaber too, but that?s rather boring compared to the other parts. :-p the minifigures: can you say, four figures (including the horse)?! that has to be a record for a regular 5 dollar set, at least in the present age of limited figures per set. we?ll start out with the two crown militia: a regular soldier and an archer. both have old faces, but they look spiffy with the shiny helmets and the superb torsos. i?ll name the soldier bravo the stout and the archer angler the precise, for future references. now we come to the skellie. although some people dislike the new skeleton design, i personally prefer it to the old ones, since the arms are now poseable and the face much meaner. the only problem is that the arms hang too low, but it?s not too noticeable when they have weapons in their hands. and last, but not least, here?s the elusive skeleton horse. i for one am very happy that tlc took advantage of that awesome prototype piece and made it into an official mass-production mold. however, the horse is unfortunately one piece, but since regular lego horses are as well, i don?t have a problem with it. i do have a problem with the pose, however. the legs are in quite an odd position, and i wonder why tlc didn?t make the front and back leg poses symmetrical. ah well. the finished set: i have only two pictures here, since this set is so small. first, here?s the completed crossbow. i must say: finally! no more ridiculous horse mounted catapults or crazy fire wheel launchers! now we have realistic siege weapons, including the one included with 7090. plus, it actually launches okay, although not the best. here?s the other main attraction: the completed skeleton rider and horse. i think it?s rather dramatic with that pose and the dark background, don?t you think? ;-) playability: okay, so there?s not much in this set, but a bit of imagination brings plenty of possibilities. to show you what you can do, here?s a little story made only with this set. ;-) overall rating: presentation: 9/10 pieces: 8/10 minifigures: 9/10 finished model: 8/10 playability: 8/10 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ final score: 8.4/10 crossbow attack is a fine introduction into castle, so i recommend it to any lego fan, whether they are a castle nut or just want a cheap change of pace. tlc has a knack with making great small kits these days, and i more than ever support them in their amazing rebound from their dark ages (between 1997 and 2004). ;-) edited by kimt, 10 august 2008 - 01:33 pm.
thanks for this review, and that great little comic! about the skellies though (x-d), you have to admit that besides their long arms making the skellie legs look out of proportion, that they're just made poorly. they're sticking straight out, as opposed to every other fig, which have a slight bend to make them look more natural. also, as i'm sure you've noticed, the pegs are on angles! that makes it impossible for them to hold their weapons straight, and they can't even put their arms over their heads without stressing the plastic some... i mean they're dead. well, at least undead, they're not supposed to be stiff, and personally i like the ragdoll look more, it makes them seem more dead :-p
thanks for the review. that set is high up on my list; how could it not be with a price like that! (i love the added story.)
tks a lot grevious for this !! regarding the set i just love it !! i really oved your comic, it was really well done and hilarious x-d eb spirit on !! vader, on jul 2 2007, 08:28 am, said: still i shall be buying alot of these sets just to increase my army. you don't say mate, i bought like 10 or so so far x-d medieval *yoda*
grim reaper on! the new skellie looks so much more natural with the droid arm *y* !
great review, i love this set.
i've searched high and low accross england to find this...and it's nowhere! i'm too stingy to buy off s@h and so i'll wait my turn. ok, now ot the set: let's say i buy 3, for ?12. that's 6 soldiers, 3 skellies and 3 horses. considering each fig is worth ?1 and horses 75p, that means 25p for the catapult! awesome! there's no lego castle anywhere in england! :-/

thanks for your review ickelpete! *y* nice little movie you made (what?s on tv in the background?) ;-) :-d after reading, i wonder more than before what this dino has to do with creator? *wacko* the complete mechanism is technic, only the "design"-pieces on top are classic-style. i agree with your comment on the colour-selection. :-x is that turquise next to lime? looks like - well, i?m not telling you what i think of right now... ;-) pretty lego set, but not for me. i?m waiting for the first pics of the ferris wheel. or even better, the 8275 technic-bulldozer :'-) *wub* new motors on!
thank you very much for that interesting review, ickelpete. *y* well, the color scheme?s pretty bad and the design of that dino?s a bit to blocky for my liking, but the two alternative models you?ve built?re quiet nice. at least there?re a lot of possibilities coming with that set.... :-)
ugly. as. hell. but an awesome parts pack, worthy of purchase.
i bought this set last night and it is great. my biggest surprise was the wheels that were included; i didn't even know they existed and there aren't even that new. back to the set, he is such a cute dinosaur. :-d since he is so tubby i think he looks like a baby! i suspect my wife wanted him more than me.... my biggest interest in the set was to have more motors and ir parts so i could make an ir car. overall, i highly recomend this set, but as others have said, be warned that the box is very oversized. i wish lego would give up on this whole 1:1 picture thing. *wacko*
i didn't spot this great review earlier. thanks for the effort of posting all those pics and videos, they helped me decide that this set is worth getting.
got this baby via shop@home a little early and i though it was time to post my view of this set : (snefroe you need to get this one ;-) ) sorry for the lack of pics but there are already many pics online of this baby so here it is : best space set since... a way too long time this is my first new space themed set since more than 20 years and i must say that i’m not disappointed at all. i have much to say about this little gem. first, let’s cut it straight about the martians minifigures: they are absolutely rubbish. i can’t imagine how lego could produce such atrocity. this said; let’s move on to the dropship. a real piece of art. reminiscent of the aliens movie dropship. the cockpit is spacious and provides a great field of view, too bad there is no hinges to open it, you must remove the canopy completely to switch pilot. the drilling unit can be attached under the ship with the clever use of a rubber piece. it stays well in place once attached, good point. some people don’t like the inclusion of the 2 containment area for the martians and crystal on both side of the ship but i kind like it, it makes the ship less empty. the 2 wings are complete with air intake, some armaments and 1 standard launcher on the right wing. normally i don’t like launchers but this one is very discrete and well integrated. on the tail section are 2 thrusters that can be rotated and provide thus some “realistic” movements to the ship. one of the last highlight of this ship is the landing gears, or i must say landing dishes. 6 medium sized radar dishes provide and incredible stability to the set. they are quite sturdy and can take a beating. i’m not going to review the alien spaceship in detail since it’s quite uninteresting. i consider it more like a bonus addition to the set than anything else. the look is passable and there are some interesting building techniques in it. that’s all. to end the review, a little pros/cons table. (we all love pros/cons table :-) ) pros: - incredible design - at last a decent space set - modular functions - quite sturdy - beautiful - great value for money cons: - martians are rubbish - no hinges for the canopy - the drilling unit could use some more details. score: 9/10 by the way , i added a nice cool feature on my site , you can download the stickers for some sets that i own. before building i always scan the stickers, we never know it could come handy. check this out on my site (you need to go in the lego lists on the left): [vtx] classic games
great review *sweet* maybe i will buy this one... but not this month... buying lego in billund has left me totally broke :-x :-$
i like the dropship kit and got this. now that i built it i see so many things i can do to tweak it to make it a moc. i think this is a set everyone mm fan should get.
of course, right before i post this i see that ickelpete reviewed this set earlier in the week. sorry for being redundant but it is already written so here ya go: monster dino reviewed by dunamis set 4958 792 pieces $89.95 from lego online store build time 3.5 hours here we go with another offering from the creator line. i?m kind of fond of these sets as they are pretty imaginative and usually have instructions for multiple models. i like the reusability of all the pieces and the varied things you can build. the box: the box that lego shipped this thing in was absolutely huge! when i first got this in the mail, i thought i had won the lottery and they had shipped the ucs falcon early. once i opened the shipping box, i was surprised to see an unusually large creator set box. the box itself is pretty standard creator type box but this one shows off the power functions prominently on the right side of the box. the back of the box shows some of the motorized features as well. opening the box is a matter of breaking two seals. we?re back to the reusable cereal box type tab system for those of you who stay up a night wondering about lego?s next box design. inside the box we have a bunch of sealed bags. immediately the power brick, remote and motors stand out as they are each in individual bags. also, there are three manuals. the manuals: the three manuals are 76, 76 and 56 pages in length. they are laid out well and are pretty standard with all the usual trimmings: - piece call outs for each step - parts inventory at the end of the primary model build - page numbers color separation in these manuals were fine for me. interestingly, the instructions for the primary build took a full manual plus about a quarter of another manual. random manual photos: parts list i?ll explain a bit more below, but it would have been nice to have some written documentation on all the functions of the motors, remote and receiver. such as motor load guidelines and specific explanations of all the remote control functions. it is severely lacking in this area. the pieces: obviously, the pieces we?re most interested in are these new motors and wireless remote control. note that before you fire this bad boy up, you had better byob. since this is prominently a european community, i had better clarify my acronyms. over here across the pond, byob usually means ?bring your own beer?. in this case, it still means bring your own beer (i?m on my second heineken right now) but in addition to numerous bottles of beer you will need a total of nine batteries to get through this set. i kid you not: anyway, there are two motors (a small and a large) each with its own very unique name according to the manual; the smaller one is called ?motor? and the larger one is called ?xl motor?. very creative indeed! the battery box takes six aa batteries and there are two compartments to hold them. here is the first: that seems pretty normal. however, the back side of it holds the other three batteries and it seems to be very poorly designed: note in the photo above where the bottom battery is placed. compare it to the previous photo and you will see the difference. i played around with trying to get that bottom battery out and you better pack a lunch (or byob) because it is no small task! why couldn?t they make this compartment just like the other side? there is a single power cord connector and a three position switch. the middle position turns the power off and the other two positions seem to provide the same functionality in either position as far as i can tell. perhaps a little blurb in the manual would have been nice to clear things up a bit. the remote takes three aaa batteries. it is fairly small and lightweight even with the batteries installed. it has two thumb controls which could be levers if you insert technic bars or even pins. the two controls are color coded and match the plugs on the receiver to control two separate motors. in addition, there is a four position switch which i assume changes the channel. finally, there are two tiny levers that seem to have no function. i?m not sure if they are a trim control or variable speed control. i messed with them and didn?t notice any difference in the motor speed. again, some documentation from the incredibly verbose lego manual would have helped. as far as the rest of the parts, it?s really a mixed bag. there are a lot of varied parts in this set to the point that there is almost one of everything. lots of technic gears, pins, studded beams, studless beams, axles, wheels, etc. also, lots of little 1x1 slopes in various colors, teeth, horns, etc. you can?t really say it is a parts pack because there is not enough of one thing to make it a parts pack. a couple of notes: it seems the quality control issue on the axles has been fixed. i initially reported this back when i reviewed the 8285 about a year ago. all the axles worked fine for me. the color quality control issue is still alive. check out the different shade of red in these two parts: also included is the sound brick. this looks just like the other sound or light-up bricks we have been seeing lately. it does have a load dinosaur ?roar!? sound embedded in it though so hide the younglings if they are a bit on the skittish side. finally, i?ve never seen one of these before (although someone will no doubt rattle off a dozen sets where you can find this part in about 5 seconds): no, i am not referring to the studded beam, i put that in the photo for scale. the build: the build was fun and was fairly straightforward. as i mentioned, there is a lot of technic parts, so if you are not a fan of the technic line you should run, not walk away from this one. there were no gotchas to speak of, but you need to pay careful attention to the placement of the wires that go from the motors to the receiver. they kind of sneak them around a bit so watch closely. otherwise, it was fine. here is what is left over: so far, i have only built the primary model. as seen on the box, there are instructions for two more models. both of the other models seem less complex than the primary model and are likely quicker builds. the dino took me about 3.5 hours which included some time to screw around with the motors. i?m an old school technic fan from way back in the 80?s so i had some familiarity with the old technic motors. obviously, 25+ years has improved some things and these seem much more powerful. the design: if you have built the 4507 prehistoric creatures then some of the design will feel familiar, especially the head and tail. it is almost like they took the dinosaur from that set and figured out how to motorize it. this is not necessarily a bad thing, just a comment. the set does a good job of showing off the features of the new motors and remote. it is nice to see how one motor can perform multiple functions. in this case, the small motor makes both arms move and opens and closes the mouth of the dinosaur. when the mouth is completely open, it pushes the activation switch on the sound brick which emits the ?roar!? sound. pretty cool. the ?xl motor? handles the walking feature of the dinosaur. there is both forward and reverse. forward works really well while the reverse just makes the dinosaur look like he is doing a michael jackson moon walk. (wow, i never thought i would use michael jackson?s name in a lego dinosaur set review!) it is almost like the dinosaur can?t get traction going in reverse. however, as noted previously forward works really well. this guy actually gets going at a pretty good clip. as you might expect, he kind of waddles like a duck since there is no articulation in the knees. it is a bit awkward but it works. the ?xl motor? seems to kick out plenty of power. overall, the design seems to be a mixed bag. the way the tail is attached seems to be an afterthought. the arms look to be too small. however, the walking mechanism and legs/feet are pretty cool as well as the head and mouth. i guess it is a reasonable effort to get people introduced to the parts and we?ll see designs improve as time goes on. here are a few views of our new friend: but what about the at-at??? of course, the real reason you are reading this is that you hope i will have some epiphany on how all this relates to the new walking at-at. judging from the box on the at-at, it looks like we get one motor. i don?t see the remote which is a disappointment as i hope it is not controlled by a switch on the body and you either turn the at-at on or off. if that is the case, the first thing i am doing is scavenging the receiver and remote from this set to add to the at-at. granted, it could be that it comes with a remote but is just not seen on the box. also, the at-at box looks like one of the images shows that the head turns. i sure hope this is controlled separately as it would be really lame to not be able to control this independently from the walking feature. i?m kind of skeptical on the walking feature of the at-at. i suspect it will be rather cumbersome but hopefully i will be pleasantly surprised. needless to say, this is all speculation but those are my initial thoughts based on this set. overall thoughts: it?s an ok set. kind of pricy but i suspect a large part of that is due to the motors and remote. i haven?t built the other two models (they seem less interesting to me) but at least it has some variability. also, you get a ton of different parts which can either be a good thing or bad thing depending on what you are looking for. the dinosaur is average. the color selection is marginal (black and lime green?) and the tail section is just lame. i appreciate it more for the mechanical functions and how the motorized parts work. it does do a good job of waking up my dog who seems pretty irritated by it. it is a nice set to show off to the neighbors or the endless caravan of my wife?s friends that seem to materialize out of nowhere. people are quickly impressed by it and then promptly move along once you start trying to explain how it all works. i?m a bit disappointed that the manual did not explain more about the remote and motor functions. i suspect that there is more than meets the eye and i?ll just have to play around with it to find out. it would be nice if lego had a website that showed all the cool functions of the motors and remotes so we fully understand the capabilities. final rating: 72% build 9/10 (pretty quick and fun. the mechanical part is cool) functionality 6/10 (it is a creator set so you have multiple builds. as far as it being a dinosaur, it?s just ok. motorized parts are cool though.) design 6/10 (partly cloudy. some things are cool, others are lame.) parts 8/10 (new motors and remote are cool. lots of varied parts included but nothing to write home about.) price 7/10 (it is kind of expensive) edited by whitefang, 23 may 2009 - 06:23 pm. indexed
a very nice review, thanks dunamis. *y* i really don?t understand that color scheme, but the new motors?re very interesting. well, that dino is just mediocre to me.... i think that the new technic bulldozer is much more interesting.
great review dunamis i hope you have as much fun with this as i have. one point yes they are new axles they have appeared in a few sets this year.

wow...that set is really something. but i prefer pehistoric power, and triceratops. or are they the same? i can never tell.
awesome reveiw, thanks! i gotta get this one!!! *y* *wub*
ickelpete, on nov 4 2007, 06:41 pm, said: if you really want the power functions the bulldozer is better value as you get two large motors, two small motors and two receivers compared to the one in the dino set alos watch toysrus and argos both have had the bulldozer for ?70-75 in there pre christmas sales usually for a week only i am hopeing they will be on sale soon as i want a second bulldozer to get some more motors. thanks for the tip, but even ?70-75 is too much right now. ?55 was just about affordable, but now my wife's buying for me it's going to cost me zero zilch zip nada nothing which is even sweeter! x-d
i ended up buying both this and the dozer. :-$ i plan on using my dino for a ir car in a month or two...
thanks for the review. cannot wait for the 2015 sets.
flieger, on 24 december 2014 - 03:04 am, said: thanks for the review! i have two questions: - what is the driver standing on, when the hatch is open and he is looking out? - could you show the face of kallus without helmet, please? my only complaint is that the colours of both, kallus's and the drivers's uniforms are wrong. kallus's uniform is way too dark and should be more dark olive than black, and the drivers's uniforms are too bright and should be more greyish compared to what we saw in the series. here are the pics of kallus- his head would be good for a steam-punk character. agent kallus front by whitesidewjw, on flickr agent kallus back by whitesidewjw, on flickr the driver isn't really standing on anything- he is just kind of wedged in there. irispen, on 24 december 2014 - 04:20 am, said: whats behind the printed 4x4 dome? is that 2x4 yellow plate? im planning to replace that. yes there are several yellow accents on this- however, in person it looks really good. edited by whitswj, 24 december 2014 - 02:55 pm.
it's a different helmet. ezra's is an imperial cadet helmet (the same one he wears in "breaking ranks).
thanks for the review and pics. this is a really nice looking walker. one question - how snug are the at-dp drivers sitting in their seats? the cockpit looks good. actually i'm not crazy about the at-dp helmets on the show but i dig the minifigs! good stuff. awesome facial hair for kallus!

a great review of an obviously fantastic set. a must-have for 2015! thanks!
i want more of the story you made! also, ace review.
brilliant review and thanks for plenty of detailed shots of the interior, i may invest in this set but ill have to wait until 2015 star wars is sorted and budget for the arrival of pirates in april!
firstly, great review ++++++ i was really on the fence on this one. this review has greatly changed my view on this modular. a definite buy for me. love the interiors and the whole concept. the more i see it the more i see the little features which put this set apart or at least slightly different from the others. of course great playability for the younger lot and i think a nice building to give any lego city more character and colour...
great review oky! i really love your introduction text. you put a lot of effort in this review, with lots of nice touches. well done for me the set gets 4 out of 5. it's a great set, but there's something preventing me of giving it 5 stars.
wow, that is the best start to a review i have ever seen. great job oky, amazing set, i'll be picking it up this weekend!
can you please take some pictures/explain how the water tower is built? i understand that there are some tank treads bot how exactly? and it is "there can be only one"! edited by yooha, 01 january 2015 - 07:14 pm.
great review! the intro was great, but i'm still not convinced on this one. the height seems too small for comparison with the rest of the modulars. the play features are ok but i wish it would have been taller.

amazing review! very thorough with lots of details
thank you for the amazing and really well-readable review! makes me want to get the set even more!
awesome review, and an awesome set. what are the different shades of blue? i know there's dark and medium blue, but what's the other blue? locutis
thanks very much. i love it *wub* . it needs tweaking, but isn't that half the fun? incidentally, when people were calling it rhino, i thought it was just a reference to captain scarlet. seeing the stickers in the middle made me realise my mistake. buy! buy! buy!
seems like they infuse system sets with more technic bars. must be that technic isn't selling too well and they want to educate ppl how cool technic can be. :-p it's quite apparent when even the small bike needed technic frame.

thanks for that very interesting review, snefroe1. *y* that vehicle looks really nice, with a lot of playability, but too much technic brick construction for my liking. it seems like there?s pretty much space wasted inside of it, some kind of small laboratory or a room for the crew and at least a mining toolshed would?ve been cool.
awesome review, if i pick up any mm sets, it will definately be this one!
please build the alien craft, i'm sure that we would all like a review of that! ^_^'

i wish the wheels would be arranged like the turbo tank, this one looks too movable.
say, i was looking at your pics and then at the instructions and i just realised : haven't you put the stikers on the shield thingies in the middle upside down? i think you did :-d i don't know if i like those new sets, though... i mean they have great shapes and potential, but at the same time, they seem so holey... they're really huge and big but full of empty air and space as well... well, this one not as much, and indeed it is the best looking set of the lot, though... but i don't think i'll go into that line...
i agree iamded, life on mars, while not even that truly great, was far better than this line! >:-( i am hoping the next space line lego does takes place in just that! space! |-/ by the way iamded, i continue to stalk you....... batbrick away! >:-)
two of my daughters are building this as we speak. i agree the design is a lot smaller than i would have liked, but they're loving it. no question the figures are the real draw here. and at 6 and almost five years old they're doimg a good job building so far. at least for the 4-6 range in my house, this set is a home run. thanks for the great review, mostlytechnic!
i managed to get two sets for my twin girls for christmas, and would have to agree with your ratings (the anna and elsa figs are indeed excellent)
vorkosigan, on 09 january 2015 - 12:29 am, said: isn't getting parts in new colors a good thing? it is a shame there is only this one set, i think tlg could make a whole subtheme out of frozen. i do agree that they overuse lavender and magenta, i don't see why every girl set has to have these sort of colors instead of what would be accurate to the source material . sure, new colors are good. but cramming a bunch of oddball ones into a single set where they don't even make sense just seems financially unwise for lego. i'd rather have seen a larger set than light aqua spiral staircase parts. or lavender tiny fences. lego made the stairs in dark purple last year for rapunzel's tower, and those probably would have been ok here. or make them in a more useful color like white.
when i first saw the pictures, i didn't realize that this set had so much color barf going on in it. also, there is a bunch of stuff that does not fit in with the movie, and it is pricey. the minifigures are nice, but no kristoff or sven. i thought about getting this, but this review is pushing me towards no.
well, the good news for you is you're in luck whenever you find sets, since the figs sell for a good bit of money :) right now the bricklink value of the 3 figs is about $30!
mostlytechnic, on 10 january 2015 - 02:02 am, said: i think the trans-glitter blue panels can be icy or snowy just fine. i'm sure that's why they used them for this set. now, if you're looking for realism (like the photos in your sig seem to be), it might be tougher. but i've been thinking about using those big glittery panels to make a waterfall-type scene. the guys over in the historic forum will kill me if my mocs start to glitter i'll take a closer look when i see the set in a shop (and, as i understand, i can sell the minifigs for the price of the set...).
i see the cookie smugglers from the detective's office have already infiltrated other lego themes.......
there is a very simple reason for the flowers and green-leaved trees; you should remember from the movie it was actually summer when elsa set of the eternal winter… the orange flowers do bother me, from a design point of view; i would have liked it better if they were a pink/purple/blue/white color. same goes for the leafy bits; they could have used the pink/purple ones they are gonna use in the elves sets. it would have been fantastic if they had given us white leafy bits (like snow covered branches)! i'm sure loads of us could use those in our mocs! edited by bennemans, 13 january 2015 - 06:14 pm.
great review! i definitely agree, the minidolls are too awesome and are definitely a must-have. i love all the extra pieces from any set, some of them go on my phone case.
i love how the front/hood looks like a lion.
good and helpful review again, whitefang. i probably have no use for a lionish creature with goofy looks...
thanks for this review, i love this set *wub* that batman is great, and i've always loved that awesome scarecrow fig. that new pumpkin is fantastic, i can't wait to get it in the set...how many come with the set? i hope more than two :'-( i love both of those vehicles, this set is a definite buy for me!

out of nowhere this set appeared at my local tru. hadn't been expecting this one for a while, so a nice surprise. *sweet* firstly the box. nice pic on the front. good selection of minifigs. the officer and pilot look cool with their dark blue trousers. a new r2 unit as well. don't remeber this in the film, but great to have one in a new colour. *wub* back of the box shows some of the ship's nifty features. first thing you notice when you open the box, is the awesome selection of bricks. this makes a for a great parts pack. loads of unusual red and dark red pieces. it's so refreshing to see a star wars set that isn't predominantly grey. there are also two instruction booklets. as soon as you open the first booklet you hit an error. why would i want two obi-wans? :-| it's also at this point that you come across a big disappointment. on the box you get a flesh qui-gon. what is actually in the box is an epiii obi-wan. come on lego - why change it? |-/ all the figures look impressive in the flesh despite the big mistake. once i started the build it progressed rapidly. red pieces seem to be a lot easier to find. lots of clever techniques. quite a few technic elements get used at the start. it reminded me of building a technic set from the 80s at times. here is the main body half way through the build. the landing mechanism is a nice touch. its not fully retractable, but still folds away nicely. you find the ship keeps tipping over as you build it despite the feet, as it's only at the end thay it all becomes evenly balanced at both ends. here the feet are extended. you can also see the yellow knob that rotates the radar on top of the ship. landing gear up viewed from the front. here are the radar. a great collection of dishes. they spin easily with little friction. here is the ship at the half way point. the front works well with the top flipping up to squeeze in the pilot. more to come... :-)
7665 review part 2 the second half of the build goes quicker than the first. once you start to add the engines, the ship really begins to take shape. the main body of the ship has a few surprises hidden away under a removable cover. inside you get some retracting guns, a storage box, a little shuttle and space for a droid and figure. here is everything you can fit inside. the guns are concealed behind the side vents. pushing them forward causes the vents to open. closed: and open: the final feature is the passenger area/escape pod. inside is plenty of space for two figures. the pod cleverly attaches by pushing the front section of the ship forward, sliding the pod in, then returning the front. everything locks together and is held securely in place by an elastic band. :-) here's a couple of pictures of the final model. it's not the most beautiful creation ever, but it is an excellent representation of the ship from the film. the angular shape actually suits a lego build well. there's one more useful feature. the whole ship can be safely and comfortably picked up by two ball ended technic pins towards the back end. it balances well at this point and does allow you to swoosh the ship around much more easily. this was the most enjoyable star wars build i've had in a long time. everything progresses nicely with almost no repetitive bits. the ship looks good and is also huge! *sweet* compare it to the 6211 isd and you'll see it's only fractionally smaller. when i first saw pictures of this on the internet i thought it looked ok. once you see it for real it is much more impressive. for ?69.99 in the uk i'm not complaining. it's the best value star wars set of the year so far. to conclude: pieces: 9/10 minifigures: 7/10 (would be a 9 apart from the stupid qui-gon/obi-wan head error) playability: 8/10 originality: 9/10 set design: 8/10 overall: 8.2/10 the box says this is a limited edition set (whatever that means). so if you're planning to get it i'd suggest you grab it at the first opportunity. i'm glad i did! x-d edited by kernow, 22 july 2007 - 10:56 pm.
shakar, on aug 1 2007, 01:34 pm, said: third note: is it just me or did you attach the two black gate pieces too high? shakar no, i think this is correct. the upper plate with clip for the door is a little high, on top of a dark gray 1x1 brick. so if you want the door to operate well you have to place it like that. i just put the clip under that brick, a very easy fix, so my door now is lower which looks better imho, and no sneaky skelly can crawl along under it.... x-d
not sure i like this one much. i like many of the new parts but the boat isn't that great and i would rather get each seperately so i can avoid the whole skeleton army. nice review though!
@ mr tiber: they have them at the toys'r'us in eindhoven. in the new shoppingcentrum west of the bijenkorf. and the bijenkorf is west of the central station.

i thought after the king's royal castle uproar about stickers, lego would have gone back to printed bricks. obviously, it is all about costs these days and not about keeping people happy.

mutley777, on aug 2 2007, 05:00 pm, said: yep! very reasonable *y* not too bad ... might have to pick that up soon then, i will be in tru in southampton over the weekend ;) i think i'll buy the bigger sets here and get the smaller ones in the usa later in the year. the smaller the boxes, the more chance i will have getting them in my suitcase ;) i have to say, i am very glad we are now not getting a 1:1 ratio between the numbers used prices in usa vs uk (e.g. it is not longer ?49.99 = $49.99) :)
nice review mutley *y*! i agree with all your observations, especially stickers versus printed parts |-/! i get some of this and replace the snowspeeders with my v.2?s. hoth on copmike
man the stickers on everything are really starting to irritate me a lot. i'm not sure i like the white 3p0, in a set that is primarily made up of whites. doesn't stand out enough. the snowspeeder looks a lot shorter than previous versions. steve
outstanding review jim, congrats ! love the pictures, so clean and crisp . hope to see many more of your reviews. as for the set, after seeing this review i kind of like it, if i will find it at a decent price, i will get it for sure.
jgw3000, on 12 march 2015 - 05:46 pm, said: jim, great review as always. you convinced me to get this one of these days, although not a to priority. any comments on which functions can be converted to pf and how well they work? actually yes! i am in the midst of making a pf version. i will post a picture of the setup i have so far. this setup is for driving the chassis and it works pretty fine!
great review,i am still undecided whether to get this set or not.
great review. i see now why the b model is so popular. i wonder though, on the car, if instead of the panels for the rear spolier (or wing) if they could have used studded panels and maybe layer them to give the appearance of, ie: a three element rear wing. i won't mention the front lights. if i had the money i would buy it for the b model. h
i think this set will be my next purchase. i love the color scheme and indeed it looks like a nice set. also 1200 parts for eur 100 is not a bad deal. and yes, the looks of the car have really grown on my since the first official pictures appeared. i'm curious how the bright green will work combined with other colors than white. i really hope more sets in the future will use the color (so that more different parts will be available over time). i think i'm the only person on eurobricks who doesn't like the looks of the b model, but i appreciate the extra functionality it offers. besides the set itself, i think this is one of the best reviews i have read in a while. great job on the superb photographs (which i think are essential to a review) and the extensiveness of it all. you really touched every subject, which is great :d
fantastic review jim, from the quality of the review alone it is easy to see how much hard work you have put into it. i'm with you on the instruction manual, i much prefer one quality bound book over umpteen stapled booklets. already have 2 of these sitting in the build queue, one for display model as i'm a fan of this one and one to build the b model then dissemble for parts, so i'm already sold on his set but still very much enjoyed taking the time it deserves to read through the review and ogle at your pro photography.
i was very skeptical of this set because i really thought the redesign degraded the looks of the a-model a lot, but after building it i must say this is an excellent set. good job tlg!
i'm still not a huge fan of the model, but this is one awesome review. the effort and quality can be clearly seen and i hope you continue making reviews like this
ted, have you described your photography setup somewhere? i love the crisp quality of your pictures.
great review. i think it look like a great set, both a and b. however the panels are the only thing i would need, but still a great looking set.
true, but i must say i like the new colour, very 'fresh' looking compared to the rather dullish regular green. can't wait to build mocs with it.
i have been waiting for this set since the pictures for the toy fairs eirlier in the year and i am glad to say i am not disapointed. first the price it is not cheap at ?99.99 but i guess that is typical for a set with this amount of electronics in it.there is no parts count and i have not had time to add up the 2 pages of contents to get a figure. first the box standard flip top with large internal picture and rip to open lid. inside there are no numbered bags in this set which i prefer i like to open all the bags and put all the parts in the box before building. next is a picture on the electronics 2 xlmotors as lego describe them and 2 standard motors. 2 ir receivers and 1 ir transmitter i know these have been discussed before but i really like the thought that has gone into the transmitters/receivers each receiver has 2 outputs to corespond with the 2 controls on transmitter they also have a choice of 4 channels so one transmitter can control up to 8 independant motors by changing the channel switch. the transmitter also has a neat motor direction switch so you can configure the transmitter operation. the set comes with three manuals 1 is the main drive mechanism 2 is the cab and engine and 3 is the attachments front and back. there is also the now standard parts list in the back of the third manual. there is no alternative model instructions despite the pictures of one on the box however there is a reference to the technic website on the back of the box but at the moment the page only has an advert saying the set is to be released on 1st september so i guess i will have to wait untill then to see if the instructions will be online. the build is fairly straight forward the main chassis is studless, the next picture shows the motors mounted into the chassis and the drive for the shovel and claw. it also shows the v6 technic engine. this next picture shows the ir receivers mounted on the back. the battery box slots into the back and can be easily slid out with the removal of two pins which is useful because i can imagine i will need to change the batteries on a regular basis. the next 2 picture are of the completed model overall i was very happy with the finished dozer the functions work really well and as i have the monster dino i have used a second transmitter so i dont have to touch the channel switch, i have included some video on my brickshelf page. unfortunately this set does suffer from some quality issues for example moulding marks on the plates, colour diferences, some of the pins not finished properly, some pins were very stiff and quite hard to push into the holes but the worst issue was an axle that would not turn freely in a hole which just adds extra friction into the system. i am glad to see some studded technic in this set i much prefer sets that use both varieties of technic beam. there are only 2 fairings which is a great improvment over recent sets if tlc had tried to make the bulldozer shovel with fairings this would have been a complete disaster. marks for the set 8/10 for price with the number of motors i expected it to be greater. 9/10 for fun my kids love this type of set that does something when finished. 6/10 for quality tlc really need to work on this one. 8/10 overall i would definately get a second one if i see it in the sales. feel free to post questions but i will be on holiday next week. more pics and videos available here
grand moff viceroy, on aug 3 2007, 01:32 am, said: excellent review, thanks! what is the cost in us? not released in my area. the shovel is obviously my favorite area, it looks detailed and strong. i love the treads, because i need them to move the 4 x 4 barrels on my super-scaled turbolaser turret. very good pics too. what color are the treads? i never had them. they are plastic or rubber? the treads are dark grey i not too good with naming colours. the treads are the same as in the snowmobile set released earlier in the year they are a hard plastic.
ah man...i wanted to review it with mine. oh well. here in the u.s. it cost $150 and has 1355 pieces total. the pins and axles did seem a bit difficult in putting them into place. a problem i have been having is the batterys are done after about 4 hours of play, which i really wish they would last longer :-( . overall it is a stupendous set and it is really nice to see our old friend the studs make a return!
thanks for the review! this looks like a great set, and with four motors, two receivers and a remote control i wouldn't say it is overpriced. it is still a lot of money though..... if my scholarship permits it i will seriously consider buying this set.
thank you very much for that neat review, ickelpete! *y* your pictures?re very interesting and your video?s really good. that set looks very beautiful to me, a formidable new technic set that quickly?ll turn into an everlasting classic for sure. :'-) i?m just a little sorry for those quality problems.... well, i hope that tlc?ll work on that matter and fix it soon. 8-|
hi, many thanks for this review, photos and videos. i can't wait to put the hands on mine, since it is already ordered and should arrive before the end of the month. :'-) could you post a scan or photos, from those last pages in the building instructions where the parts included are listed? thanks edited by conchas, 04 august 2007 - 07:19 pm.
what i really want is for philo or someone to test it's power and such. *sweet* edit the power of the motors that is. its getting late. *sing* edited by eyesonly, 06 august 2007 - 09:12 pm.
thank you ickelpete for that great review. i give you two *y* up. i am not a technic fan, but this set definitly looks *sweet* . i see great potential using this set as a model for a smaller dozer for my town/train layout. i really *wub* the crawler tracks they used. i have been thinking about buying the snowmobile for the tracks. but if possible, i just might buy this set instead. i could definitly use the other parts for moc's. model on!!
lham, on aug 9 2007, 12:00 pm, said: could you please please post the instruction boolets' number codes (located on the back in tiny print)? so that we can download them from lego.com and have a look for ourselves. when i read this i first though you meant set number but this model can't be found there yet and now i realize that you mean something completly different. what is this code you're after?

excellent set, excellent review. a good job as always, sinner.

thanks 'j2g' for another review, one of my favourite parts of the set......the half eaten donut on the dashboard of the police car. brick on review on 'j2g' !
hello everyone. excellent review! english is not my native language, but i want to express my opinion. simpsons house was the first of its kind, and i can say without exaggeration that this is the most impressive set that i'm going (my collection http://brickset.com/sets/ownedby-celeb ). i look at the video from the kwik-e-mart, and is difficult to say how good it is compared with the house. the main disadvantages that i said to myself, is this: build the walls of the large panels, next is access to the roof (gray parts in front of the back door (i think they represent the stairs)) is not on the level with doors on the roof and when you open them, you can see the white block is openly trash, my points of view. boxes on the left of go to the store and powersauce box, i want see make real and not just a cube, f.e. such as in the unreleased star wars set. about minifigures, i fully agree with robert8. two more of the same homer, marge and bart?! personally, i put my set as a scene and all the replays minifigure are inside the house that was not identical characters next and also absolutely terrible bart`s accessory this set is made parking for bikes and it looks very cool. but damn, it is hoped to see the bart or lisa's bike, instead of useless balloons with paint. the walls are made with convex inside panels, why so? can anyone know? have not seen any pictures with such walls in tv show. why did not they turn? i personally really like how realized roof, but my brother says that it is terrible :) garden could do more in the series there were almost jungle i do not know how to be considered here, maybe anyone can express any opinion or idea? i look at the simpsons house, and then look at the photo of this e-mart. i can not understand, in the house we have a garage, two floors, cool floor, a lot of furniture, all the rooms and walls, collected from cubes, many additional accessories. and where is all this detail here? it looks much smaller (maybe even poorer). if they still will release next year comic book store, it will be even less? of course it is difficult to estimate without seeing it live, we have it will be sold only in may. at first sight it does not look so impressive as the house. can certainly the case in the limit on the amount of detail, but why it was impossible to add $ 50 to the cost and make jasper, the more detailed the roof, the walls of the smaller elements, that it was not convex. sad. thanks all for attention. edited by celeb, 13 april 2015 - 05:10 am.
i have sooo mixed feeling about that... i loved the simpsons house (save for the terrible wall in the homer and marge's room), but this so far is inferior in almost every aspect. the walls made of panels is a bummer. i expect a d2c set to be better that this. 60+ stickers? the same thing. same price for less bricks and smaller build then the house. strange coloured bricks on the outside wall (some ugly mix of yellow + tan) panels again with their fronts facing towards the inside of the shop so we and up with those squares all around. the walls are yellow, this was so nice, lost opportunity to make it in some other less common colour. then again the set overall looks is good. the roof is a nice detail. the shop looks actually like a real one, not just an approximation of one. the roof tiles are in dark orange - we got new/rare colour here the car looks interesting to build (just like the pink one from the house) lots of nice references to the show it's the simpsons! definitely a must buy... but for a discounted price. i'll try to find one with maybe damaged box or after-display copy. edited by mestari, 14 april 2015 - 01:15 pm.
one thing that may justify the price: it has 527 different parts (if i counted correctly). i alway heard the more different parts the more difficult the set is to produce. the simpsons house already had an astonishig amount of different pieces, but this one is even more extreme...
it's the level of detail that floors me, a licensed set with the mindset of those great creator sets. i think it displays much better than the simpsons house which, from the outside, is a bit drab
nice review! but i have one question: is the transparent dome of the squishee drink removable?
skalldyr, on 15 april 2015 - 10:53 pm, said: nice review! but i have one question: is the transparent dome of the squishee drink removable? nopers.
did anyone else have a problem with the piano against the wall of the simpsons house? it just kept coming off way too easily and i was getting really frustrated with it sticking out and not fully going on so i had to put the two tiles that hold them one place over away from the wall for it to sit properly without falling out, i think i might put snowball ii behind it since cats love to hide underneath or behind things lol but just curious to know if anyone else was encountering this problem with the previous set.
great review of a classic set. *y*
nice review of a surprisingly interesting set. *y* those windows are great, and no doubt difficult to get. classic coffee maker, simple yet exactly right. that baseplate was in a few other sets, but never with that pattern. would have made a great base for some of the classic 80s houses lego used to treat us to. in tan was part of the adventurers egypt sets. as recently as 2001 it was a base for ogel. versatile plate that hopefully hasn't disappeared completely. parapink is apparently "light pink" on brickshelf, so i guess it's just lighter than normal pink (and stopped appearing in 1995. just so you know, that monkey is drinking too much and likely to fall in the pool ... ;-)

great review of a great set! *wub* i look forward to more!
great review. very funny with "little you" helping with the building. i got the wagon myself, i really like it. what more did you get? morten
nice review about a nice set (i like this wagon, but don't buy it, because of the size, compared to my other wagons...). poor minifig who had to build an entire set! :-d
thank you guys for your nice reply. :'-) i have to add two pics of my freight train showing a bit more clearly what the size matter is about: this is what it looks like when you put the hopper waggon right behind the red car of 4512. it looks a lot better without the red car! i had a lot of fun with this review and i will add another one (look at the 2nd pic ;-) ) the next days. stay tuned!

great review, *y* i have just bought my first 9v motor and you have convinced me, i will buy a least two of this set. :-)
*yoda* comes through again! i love this set... but it just costs too much for australians so i will be giving it a miss. :'-( it is a shame as it has clams in it... 8-|
i like this one better than the other one for parts and such, plus i'm generally a sucker for any different minifig, but yeah, that price is steep. great review though!
maybe mrs puff has a nice toy inside x-d i like this review. the lighthouse part and the school are nice enough for other towns. and the figs are nice, even mrs puffs 2 pieces you can't use for other things. :-) pity that it's 50 dollars/+/- 60 euro. for half price i would think about it.

very nice review *yoda* !! though, i think you should review the "course" because it looks very interesting.
the set, and the other designer sets that came out with it (especially 4888) are incredibly well designed sets. i wish lego would go back to doing sets like these as i loved the multitude of instructions and ideas. the last batch of creator sets had zero ideas, even though i know several were made. :'-( anyway, less whining, more review. the lion is the main model. his mouth doesn't fully close, but it does open more. the head works well from most angles. i love the dark orange bricks; great for rust... he is quite solid, but the joints take the weight well. the neck goes side to side and rotates, but doesn't go up and down. the body is built in two parts and pinned in the middle. with what is left you can make what i think is a hyena, a silly plant moc... ...and what i believe is a vulture. there are also instructions for a few other models including a bat, boar and a snake... which i quite like. he can be built at the same time as... ...this cute little lizard. overall this is a great set with an excellent blend of colours and pieces. i wanted it for steampunk potentials. *sweet* i hope you liked the review. till next time....
thank you for the nice review, sinner! i also bought this set but in combination with 4883 when it was on sale (50% - hurray!) at s@h. i made a short review of 4883 but wasn?t really sure what to tell about 4884. so i?m glad you did that for me. :-d i have different feelings about this set. on the one hand i love the lion. he is really impressive (even my wife -not known for being lego enthusiastic- asked me, if there were more animals of this kind). the lion is - restricted - poseable and the colors used are fantastic. *wub* 3 models can be built simultaneously - that?s great! on the other hand i still don?t know what to do with these rotation joints. *wacko* and the other models are somehow disappointing compared to the lion. i seem to have missed the little lizard. :-$ i put it on my "to do-list". like all the creator sets: great parts pack - but wait until they get on sale! x-d for me - i had a lot more fun with 4883. indeed: roarrrr on! ;-)

lego 75915 pteranodon capture i'm glad to review this nice set; 75915 pteranodon capture name: pteranodon capture set number: 75915 pieces: 174 price: $19.99 minifigs: 2 theme: jurassic world year of release: 2015 links: box the front of the box has the jurassic world logo along with the set number, piece count, etc. its a decent box size for a $20 set. here it is compared to a minifigure. here's the back of the box. it shows all of the features from the set an ad for the video game. the back also shows a small picture with a silhouette of the dinosaurs from the line, along with their set numbers. instruction booklet the booklet shows the same thing as the front of the box, nothing more, nothing less. near the back of the booklet, there is a picture with all of the characters from the sets. the other page shows all the dinosaurs with a mini box that shows the size comparisons. the minifigures the minifigures in this set are simon masrani and an acu. both of them have excellent printing on the front and the back. the gun is the same one from tlm that the ssp used. simon masrani is the only one with a double sided face. his second face shows a scared/worried exp<b></b>ression. he has a zipped up jacket or jumpsuit with a shirt underneath. the acu trooper only has one face which is a scared/worried exp<b></b>ression. i would have a scared exp<b></b>ression too if i was about to get eaten by a dinosaur. he has great detail on his torso and legs. let's take a look at the vest. the vest is the same mold from the ssp in tlm i think. it has the letters acu on the front too. the back is nothing interesting. pteranodon the pteranodon has great printing too. the colors match the ones that the pteranodons from the movie have. the wings, mouth, and head are a rubbery type of plastic and are easily bendable. it uses the same mold from the pteranodon in the 2012 dino line. here's a comparison between the two. spare parts the spare parts aren't many, just a few extras. the helicopter at first the helicopter was 'meh' when i first saw it on the box. now that i've built it, i've got to say that i really like it. its my favorite helicopter of all of the ones i've built. its sturdy and sleek. it's not too bulky either. the first play feature in this set is the net launcher. it works pretty well, not one of my favorite features but it does what it's meant to do. the other play feature is on the other side. its a stud shooter which can be used by a minifigure. you can put it on their hand or you can leave it there and let someone operate it. the shooter can fold up inside the helicopter as well. there are stickers on both sides of the helicopter and they also have the jurassic world logo with dino marks. final verdict value: 9/10 - for $20 this set isn't that bad. the parts count is a little low for a $20 set but the price is probably because of licensing. other than that, it's a great deal, i would've hoped for maybe some bait for the pteranodon but that can easily be fixed. design: 9/10 - i really love the way this helicopter looks, it's sleekness and design is great. the only flaw this has is the huge net launcher, it's too big in my opinion. minifigs: 10/10[/b] - the minifigures are extremely detailed and it even includes an exclusive minifigure. playability: 9/10 - there are many things you can do with this set. the swoosh factor is great and so are the play features. parts: 10/10[/b] - they're useful parts and there isn't many huge specialized pieces in here either. overall: 9/10 - this set is great for fans of jurassic world, it's also a nice parts pack. there's one exclusive minifigure in here too which makes it even better. having a little fun with the set hope you liked my first review here on eurobricks! please leave any suggestions on what to improve, thanks! edited by thelazychicken, 02 may 2015 - 10:19 pm.
nice review! although, that picture of the ad reminded me of how some of the things surrounding jurassic world (lego, that is) seems hastily put together. just look at that the minifig. he is star lord's head and hair, indiana jones' torso with different arms, and city legs. to me, that seems a bit weak, especially for a video game.
nice little review! now i definitely have to check if the toys r us in dortmund has it, too! edited by kcmatze, 03 may 2015 - 01:34 pm.
i'm pleased to see that this is available for purchase, at least in some parts of the world, rather than only being available with the jw game. nice review, i'll going to scope out whether toys r us in sweden is carrying them, although i've never seen polybags in there before.
cheers for putting in the time to create a wonderful review. i am not a huge fan of this set; i like the colour combinations, but it all seems a bit all-too-simple. it can (and will) be nicely modularised, though!
this seems like half of a set compared to the previous bike shop/cafe. as i like many of the elements, i will probably buy a second one and build a mirror image version (making one entirely a toy shop and the other a book store/news stand) and adjust the sidewalks to work with the previous model. then i think they will work well together. i remember a little area in copenhagen that had this sort of architecture. i would hope the subsequent models are better deigned to create more complex alternatives, but these are both good starting points for original or enhanced models.
as a fan of creator houses, i really want to like this set. however, i think that creator houses have long filled a niche that's neglected elsewhere: residential houses. we haven't had a larger residential house since 2013; i'm not sure if these sets have anything to do with that, but it seems like they may be the replacement for larger houses. and i'd much rather have a larger house set than a set like this. i also agree with many others here; something about it just feels incomplete. i think that the various city business buildings we've gotten in recent years (including those in this year's city square--which is much more expensive than this, but also contains much more) make for better buildings at this scale.
thanks andy_0306uk, your very clever strategic decision to serve us with blurry pictures allowed me to glance at this review without ruinating that whole wonderful advent surprise too much.... :-p *y* but although i loved the last year?s one, i think they could do another theme (or perhaps even two calendars), because right now castle?s pretty hot imo.
no girls....again! and no santa? whats up with that? sure there are many nice pieces to give life to every city layout.. i would love something more simple a girl taking her dog for a walk a boy on a bicycle simpler things...not all the workmen again!

phoinix, on sep 13 2007, 03:18 pm, said: no girls....again! and no santa? whats up with that? sure there are many nice pieces to give life to every city layout.. i would love something more simple a girl taking her dog for a walk a boy on a bicycle simpler things...not all the workmen again! i agree, a girl with a dog or a boy with bicycle in a small set would be so nice and strange enough so difficult for tlc. nice review.
9.30 euro is msrp here in denmark. 7 euro would have resulted in a nicer reception from my part, but the strong marked position of lego in its homeland together with the general high prices (because some of us are supposedly rich...) makes the prices less bearable. it is funny you should mention germany. i thought the prices for lego were even higher there! i'm sure i paid more than msrp last time i bought lego from from your country. on the other hand. the last thing i bought was the 5521 model team sea jet from 1993!
i guess that?s what some people refer to as "sarcasm" ;)
nice review but i dont think i'll get this set i dont relly like the look it looks ugly, hmmm anyway...
thanks for the great review. i love the poses. :-d i got this for my kids and they didn't mind it but i think they prefer my sets because they aren't theirs. :-|
this is a really great set! when i first saw it i thought "oh a silly small plane who needs that" and then i got it and i am very happy that i did! this is one of the best designed lego creator sets! and it was designed by the designer of the cafe-corner!!!!
a fine set, a great review and good additional pictures. thanks lasse d and sinner. teamwork on! *y*
thank you sinner for bringing the pictures of the hovercraft. i think it is a really cool model, but the steering wheel doen't work too well. it doesn't turn easilly all the way around and when the craft turns, it doesn't stay stable on the three wheels because the front wheel turns quite alot into the opposite side. now to the third model! this is quite a basic helicopter with the functionality of having the rotors turning. it doesn't use that many of the bricks and doesn't even have a landing gear. i have a question to all of you. as you can see, i prefer to show one or two large pictures and have the rest as clickable thumbnails. most people use only the relatively big (typically 640x480) pictures so that you don't have to follow links. what do you prefer? it is no problem for me to do it the other way, but i would like to know if you have any preferences.

why are the best sets limited editions? >:-(

i just got set number 7721, the new special edition crawler thing in woolworths in croydon, england. apparently it is a woolworths exclusive over here and i didnt expect to see it on shelves for a while yet. pleased to get it, just about to start building it. looks like a very good set. i love the yellow mech.
yeah. i'm really hoping the concept art/doom minifig joke is just that! i picked this set up on whim, mostly because a needed a building to add to a moc, as a parts pack it's not a bad set at all.
i'm glad you were joking about doom. i'm not that big of a fanboy, but i had the need to correct you for some reason. with that said, i bought this set for the minifigures a few years ago. looking back, i don't really care about the figures today like i did in 2013. the building is decent for the size of the set though. thanks for the review.
for those of you who are old enough to remember system shock: next on maury: who's the father? edited by darthbrickus, 15 september 2015 - 05:28 pm.
overall, i wish marvel in particular would have more playsets in its theme (batman has several great ones in the dc theme). but then again, if this is the best playset to date for marvel, maybe it's better just to leave well enough alone. i would definitely like to see them attempt something in the $100+ (us) price range because i think it could be good; marvel needs an equivalent to the arkham asylum set. regarding this set, i saved myself some money and bought the 4 minifigs i needed (all but spidey) on bricklink for less than half the set price. edited by dmarvin, 17 september 2015 - 06:25 pm.
personally, i thought your review was spot on and i very much enjoyed your tone. i'm not usually much of a mini-fig person, but i will admit i bought this set mostly for dr. doom (and considered nova a bonus). growing up, i was a big fan of the fantastic four and an even bigger fan of dr doom. i hope that someday the film rights will revert to marvel and we'll finally get a ff film that respects the original source material and features a dr doom worthy of the name. as for the set itself, i don't have much use for playsets (not that there's anything wrong with them, i think the marvel lego line could use more of them in fact) and i didn't even realize it was linked to a specific show as i've fallen a bit out of touch with the franchise of late. i bought it; i built it; it sat a shelf for a while; i scrapped it for parts. i think most of it wound up as a greenhouse for my winter village set-up. it's not a _bad_ set, but i think you summed things up nicely when you called it mediocre. thanks for the entertaining review.
this set seems to appeal more to the non superhero crowd. it is one of the only marvel sets i bought. mainly because i thought that the building was a nice return to the old style of city sets. i would love to see this sort of backdrop for a more realistic agents theme... i also liked that most of the figs in this set were easier to merge into other (non-super) uses... thanks for the review! god bless, nathan
super-cool! any text on the boxes of these ones? the stormie's left arm seems really long and slightly odd, but that's just because i'm jealous you've got one. :-d shorter than i was expecting though. dr. s.

hello everyone! by now many excited lego star wars fans have started receiving their ucs falcon. some of us here enjoy writing reviews and sharing our thoughts. i mentioned to yoda that i was planning on doing a review of this set but it would likely take me a few weeks (of 1-2 hours per night) to finish building the set. yoda suggested that i do the review as i go so everyone could see the progress of the set. what a great idea! so, here is the first entry. feel free to comment along the way. i will try to post photos and updates every night on the build then wrap up the review when i complete the set. if you have any specific questions or photo requests, please be sure to ask. ucs millennium falcon reviewed by dunamis set 10179 5195 pieces $499.95 from lego shop at home the box: obviously, this is a box like no other. first of all, it comes in its own shipping carton. inside of that, there is a standard lego carton. finally, inside the lego carton, we have the actual millennium falcon box and a nice little letter thanking you for buying the biggest lego set ever. shipping box (naboo set provided for scale) lego carton and letter lego carton the millennium falcon box is really quite nice. there are lots of photos and it does a good job of ?selling? the set. there are 8 individual pieces of tape that keep the lid on the box. the limited first edition comes with a seal on the lower left corner. millennium falcon box (naboo set provided for scale) lifting the lid straight up reveals one compartment of several bags on the right. on the left, we find a thin, square box (like a pizza box) that contains the official certificate of authenticity, two sticker sheets and one enormous manual! under the pizza box, we find two more compartments each filled with several typical lego bags. the box weighs 24 pounds! stickers pizza box pieces in compartments not quite sure what the little 30th anniversary sticker is for yet. the certificate of authenticity is on heavy paper and is suitable for framing. more to come tomorrow. it's late here.
will follow this impatiently ;-) really like the start of the review *y* you always seems to pull it of nicely, in comparission with the exasperating *yoda* x-d :-p build on! play on! on on!
excellent beginning. our numbers are very close, but i haven't the luxury of space to build it, so i'll be enjoying it by proxy through you. enjoy! *y*
xwingyoda, on sep 27 2007, 11:18 am, said: what what what >:-( have you stopped your medication once again x-d no actually i?m out of fly agaric. but now it?s that seasson to go out in the forest and refill the stock of those babys. vikings on!!
wow that box is big but i somehow thought it would be even bigger, still it looks like for once lego are actully using all the space inside and not just a fraction like with other sets. cant wait to see more dunamis.....you lucky megablok ;-)
what a wonderful idea, and how nice from you.... *sweet* and.... go, killer, go!!
thats awesome man! lucky that you got it! i want it so badly... and it has a huge box too! -zots
very expecting indeed. waiting for your kind photo ... :-)
so i see they even do mistakes on these |-/ that beast looks really sturdy !! that is great !! are these yellow parts new ? i am not a technic fan and never saw these before. another question for you: is the instruction book easy to follow, especially regarding the colours. does the black rally stands out comparing to the dark bley and so on ? i sure hope so ;-) can't wait to see moer hehe *yoda*
thanks for the review, and tons of pics! i've been wanting to pick this one up since i saw it. i thought the 4956 creator house was nice, but this model town house is in a completely different league! i also like the alternate models that you can see in the catalogues.
thank you for the review sinner. at first i wanted this set for the 4 blue 1x1 slope tiles, but i can see there is much more into it than that. it sure is a great value compared to what you get in the building bonanzas (no cars and less detail). it was funny to see the little side story in your pictures. would it be hard to modify the cars to fit minifigs better?
a beautiful and humorous review with very fine pics. *y* a fantastic set, full of neat details and in a wonderful color scheme. great for every city builder for sure. i guess we waited for sets like that. we dreamed about them. i?m glad we got them now. :'-) edit: congrats! it seems you?ve got your bucket back.... :-p
i found the use of parts well done by the designers. i made a car and then tried to make a house from a different instruction book. i could not as several pieces were already used in the car. nice to see them using all the parts like that rather than having a lot of "extra" bits. moral of the story: one instruction book at a time. *sweet*
lasse d, on sep 28 2007, 08:03 am, said: it sure is a great value compared to what you get in the building bonanzas (no cars and less detail). i was all for the white house until i saw this set. i still wouldn't mind it though. :-d lasse d, on sep 28 2007, 08:03 am, said: would it be hard to modify the cars to fit minifigs better? the problem with the blue truck is a lack of headroom. however the truck is quite low and i can't see it being too hard to change and still have it looking good. asuka, on sep 28 2007, 08:30 am, said: great for every city builder for sure. i guess we waited for sets like that. we dreamed about them. i?m glad we got them now. :'-) i think lego were really listening with this years creator sets. *wub* with the exception of the ferris wheel. they are all sets that you could buy 10 of and not have too many hard to use parts. asuka, on sep 28 2007, 08:30 am, said: edit: congrats! it seems you?ve got your bucket back.... :-p well, in this reality anyway! x-d who knows what goes on in the "wacker and walrus" world but i do seem to be a tormented soul. :'-(
thank you very much for the review sinner. i definitly *wub* this set. this will make a great addition for us "townies". i thought the size was too small. i plan to make my house fit practically the whole baseplate. plus i will definitly add floors, that looked :-d . i can't believe tlc skimped on the floors.
thanks for the review sinner! i definitely want this set now. the mixed rough and smooth roof bricks would annoy me on a model like the mtt, but here it looks as is if the roof is quite old with some parts being worn and pitted and some parts being replaced with new roof tiles. i quite like the effect. i agree on which is the best vehicle, and if it doesn't fit minifigs, just mod the heck out of it! x-d
sinner. you have convinced me. i bought this set yesterday when it was on sale at international lego weekend in sk?rb?k.
thank you for the nice review. i want this set too with al those tan bricks and black slopes and the cute blue car *wub* i like the old windows more, i hope they don't stop producing them
sinner, thanks for this outstanding review! i am glad that i had read this review in advance, before making my purchase on this set earlier with my girlfriend. we built this set for a total of 3 hours, to complete this beauty, in about 2 hours ago. there are stars circling around my head at this very moment, when i post this reply. i must admit from the bottom of my heart, that this is an wonderful piece of house, that simply shows the beauty of it, with the european kind of houses, where there is a garage. furthermore, there is a lovely blue car. i am seeing stars right now, in the middle of the night, and i must drop a thanks to you personally as well. although it is empty from its interior unlike the 4996 beach house, but this set has the majestic look which simply place a "wow" factor in front of it upon completion. at the moment, we had plans for getting the second set next month, to build the other design as well. hopefully, i will be able to share with you guys, all of my different creators sets, with its alternate designs as well in the near future.
nice pictorial review, i always like this little set ! a little more text would have been nice but that is ok as it is . ps: you should have mentioned in the title that this topic is picture heavy - i was wondering why it was loading so slow on my mobile
hi, you've done well on the pictures! but i agree with freekysch; a little more text would be great. ever thought about joining the reviewer's academy?
thanks for comments. i know about text, i'm trying to write more, but haven't succes in this yet. i thought about joining reviewers academy, but i'm not sure because i have only maimum 4(may be 5) hours each time when i can make review or something that needs some hours.
i actually bought this set last monday as it was reduced to 14.99.....it actually not a bad little set considering the size and part count, has a decent array of functions. its a nice little set....the b model looks just as good so i might buy a second set, as you get the bucket left over and i need that bucket for another set. edited by richard dower, 19 october 2015 - 04:42 pm.
very nice review! i like the amount of pics and that alternate model. i wouldn't have thought of making a ship from those parts, i once made a larger, crownie-ized skellie barrier instead.
thanks for the review grevious! i already have this set, but i loved your comic and that nice alternate model! *y* ttfn! >:-)
great review, this is one of my favorite sets from the new castle line. it's simple and yet so effective, oh and great comic you have there *y*
ah yes, the good ol' catapult attack. nice review, and what a great comic, i loved it. *y* :-d you've inspired me, all i need now is a camera! :-p great job, keep up the good work, and i'm looking forward to more reviews! *y* ~peace edited by iamded, 12 october 2007 - 10:30 am.
nice review, i like this set alot. *y* :-)
i just got this today. it is amazing like my other two castle sets: the joust and the crossbow. i am currently starting to save for 2008 but for christmas i think i want the skeleton carridge and the naboo n-1 fighter.
thanks for a great review first of all. i do like the upgrades and changes made from the original 2009 set, more colours and parts are offcourse available today than back in 2009. it does look like a great set and i would really realy have loved to get it myself if i had the funds. however their are so many other sets thats first priority for me this december and next year, so sadly i might have to pass on this if its not that i can get it redicioulusly cheap at some point. and yeah, we should appreciate that lego does keep sets coming, even if its just upgrades from earlier releases. town is known for a new police and fire station every year, cant see why a new toyshop is so upsetting. once again thanks for a great review. and happy holidays to you as well.
great review. you almost make me want to buy one. i don't know what it is with these sets. on the one hand they are so nicely designed and cute on the other side i never seriously consider buying one. i can't explain what it is that holds me back.
great review! i just built the original, and this one has clear advantages over the original (though i wish lego would stop putting torsos with defined breasts and curves on children). i really like pretty much every change. i won't be getting it, and i'd be lying if i said i'm not a little disappointed. for the first four years, my mother-in-law got me the new winter village set for christmas; after the last two, which didn't really fit thematically in my display, i had hoped for a new one--particularly since my daughter is getting to be around the age where she can play with them. i mention her specifically because i've seen lots of people dismiss those who are a bit disappointed as rabid adults who don't care about kids getting cool sets, and i don't think that's fair. i may have to see how much some of the parts go for on bricklink. the rerelease is better than the original, but not good enough that i'd want to spend $80 to get a set that's nearly identical to one i have. edited by tea weevil, 29 november 2015 - 04:31 pm.

i bought it and i'm very happy with it.
thanks for the review. they definitely improved upon the original, but since i already own the original, i can't justify this set also, unfortunately. it seems to be the trend. but i'm sure there are a lot of first timers out there too that will snatch this up since it is a really lovely building. and the updates make it better for sure.
thanks oky for this fine review. i agreed with your sentiments on the unnecessary rants. i also owned the 2009 version and even though there are minor improvements. there must be a logical reason for its release again but is not entirely the same. i felt is an excellent opportunity for others to acquire this design especially after six years ago. as for myself, i will probably buy this if my spare funds allow me to own this set.
oky, on 02 december 2015 - 12:49 am, said: i'm not mocking anyone. i just think that some people need to calm down a bit and that tlg is getting more hate than they deserve for this set, but that's just my opinion and you're welcome to disagree with it. everyone is entitled to their own opinion, including you and me. and yes, i would love to hear your thoughts on this matter because i would like to have a friendly discussion on this subject. that's cool, and i appreciate that. but, i would recommend avoiding the use of the word "hater" then. that's a perjorative term that's loaded with negative connotation, as i'm sure you're well aware. it's the flipside to me calling you a "mindless fanboy" or a "corporate shill." those aren't terms that invite friendly discussion. they shut down discussion by belitting the other person's opinion, and implying that they lack the maturity or intelligence to think critically. i don't actually care all that much about this set. you just hit on a pet peeve of mine, is all. and it's one that i see spreading throughout eurobricks, which is a shame. the use of terms like "hater," "whiner," or "fanboy" are becoming much too prevalent around here.
review - 42044 - display team jet introduction the smallest of the 2016 sets, is the display team jet. it doesn't seem to have lots of functionality, but maybe the landing gear is retractable. this set kind of reminds me to the 9394 - jet plane, although it's obviously a lot smaller. as you can read in my review of the 42052 - heavy lift helicopter basically anything flying is +1 for me, so let's find out if this set also fits the bill. note: all images can be clicked for hi-res versions. set information number: 42044 title: display team jet theme: technic released: 2016 part count: 113 box weight: 193 gr box dimensions: 15,4 cm x 13,8 cm x 5,9 cm set price (msrp): € 9,99 price per part: € 0,088 links: brickset, bricklink the box being a small set, it obviously comes in a small box. the display team jet is an aerobatics jet, used in air shows. on the box it's flying rather high, but at least it's at a safe distance from the crowd. front side shows the main model, together with a small section indicating you can use digital building instructions to build this model. back side the back side shows the b-model, a stunt plane. and again a reference to the apps for digital building instructions. more on the stunt plane later. content of the box the box contains: 2 instructions booklets (a- and b-model) 1 sticker sheet 3 technic liftarms 2 bags instruction booklets both the instructions for the a- and b-model are included in the box. sticker sheet a lot of stickers for such a small set. apparently no panel is left untouched. liftarms three liftarms unsealed, nothing out of the ordinary for a small set. bags two bags containing the rest of the parts. highlighted parts this section describes the new and/or otherwise interesting parts. yellow 5l axles the 5l axle in yellow has never been released before, so it's one of the new parts for this year. black 7l flex axles for the layman this seems a common part, but the 7l soft axle actually has never been released in black before. combined with the re-release of the 19l soft axle in black, this will open up lots of possibilities. for those of you thinking you've read this text before; you are right, the new drag racer contains these new 7l flex axles too. white panels this small set comes with a whopping 10 panels. great for the ones who like panels. not so great if you think tlg is using too much panels lately. rudder this part, the small bionicle wing, is the same as the one used in last year's 42033 - record breaker. part list this set contains 113 parts, all listed below. the build this is the collection of parts, used to build the jet. it sure looks like we are getting a landing gear. the build is fun, but pretty straightforward. there aren't any special or cool techniques used in this set. it almost took me more time to apply all the stickers than to build the actual model. finished model the finished jet does look cool though. the white and yellow color scheme, combined with the stickers, work really well. i have seen people refer to the plane as being orange, but it's definitely yellow. technic (or lego in general) tends to have some color variation when it comes to yellow. i do concur this is the warmer variant of yellow, but it's not orange. the back of the plane looks nice too, although i am not a big fan of the rudder part. it looks too detailed, compared to the other panels. it's not a big deal though, and maybe it's just me. parts left only three common parts left. features and functions this set has a single feature and that is a retractable landing gear. it's operated by the black 12t double bevel gear near the cockpit. in the following picture you can see the landing gear retracted. this image shows the landing gear when the plane is ready for landing. hopefully the pilot will roll the plane before landing, but you probably know what i mean video here's s short video demonstrating the display team jet. b-model this set also includes the building instructions for the b-model, a stunt plane. the building experience for the stunt plane is more or less the same as for the jet. well, what do you expect when both models are planes with a limited number of parts. for an alternative model the stunt plane looks fine. there's not a lot of functionality in this plane, but it's worth mentioning that the tail wheel allows the plane to roll on a flat surface. the plane also has working propellors. both functions are demonstrated in the video. unfortunately, the landing gear of the stunt plane is not retractable. parts left a couple of extra leftover parts, but it's nice to see that most of the parts have been used in the b-model as well. actually, there's probably an extra yellow technic smooth 1/2 bush left. i just found it on my desk, but it could belong to one of the other sets. video here's a video demonstrating the stunt plane. summary two nice planes for 13 bucks, that's basically what you get. both models look good and the set has some interesting new parts. especially the 7l flex axle will be very popular. it comes with a decent collection of white panel, although they are very common nowadays. both models have limited functionality, but each of them has at least one function to give the model some playability for kids, other than the swooshability that is. okay, it might lack some proper functions, but i still think kids will love this set. i can see kids running around with one of the planes in their hands. all in all i think this set delivers what you'd expect. score let's see how this set flies! remember that the grades are based on it being a small set. obviously a set like this, cannot be compared with a mercedes flagship. 8 design for a small set, the model looks very authentic. 7 building experience no surprises. 7 features just the retractable landing gear. 8 playability it has swooshability, so i see kids running around with this model. 7 parts lots of panels, if you are into that. 8 value for money can't go wrong with these small sets. 7,5 fun for kids more image can be found on my flickr page. thank you for reading. i hope you enjoyed it.
very nice little set, and a lot of those new white small panels. it's a need!
love this model, awesome swooshability, interesting parts, and a nice little model to put on my desk at work :)
good review, as always jim when i first saw this set i thought that it would make a great parts pack for me, as that i have about 20 white pieces in my technic collection (all from 42043) and this set has some really useful ones, all for a cheap price. those 7l flex axles will be extremely useful in my current build i'm doing
set is only interesting for the panels, that's all it is to me
boulderer, on 27 december 2015 - 05:44 pm, said: my favourite of the 2016 sets i've built so far. i'd go so far as to say this is the best "budget" set in years. i would have loved this when i was a kid ... great "swoosh ability" ?????? good to hear that, im gonna check the toy shops in my lunch break tomorrow, see if they got their shipment in yet, if they have, ill definitely buy one of these little sets
i got this little set for xmas and i noticed all the gaps and decided to fix them, so here it is. img_5344 by jj2sam, on flickr first i added some beams to the wings and top to make it less hollow, second i put some navigation lights on it, i made the nose a bit wider and added a control panel, and lastly i changed out the landing gear wheels to more appropriate ones. img_5349 by jj2sam, on flickr more pictures are here
so this set showed up in stores yesterday, and i immediately picked two up. all in all it is a nice set, but it is slightly different from what i was expecting, the plane feels a bit "flat", pointy nose, wide bottom etc.. and while the panels work very well as wings, it feels a bit simplistic to just have single-part wings. the stickers really work for it though. its a cracking set though, nice parts pack, and a nice model as well
got this at the weekend, mainly for the parts, but built it first. agreed with other comments - awesome swooshability.

not sure what people like about this set, i think it's the worst of all 1h2016 sets. odd shape, bland colors, no new parts, and the windscreen isn't even closed. but the reviews are great, indeed. :)

thanks for review, mostlytechnic. not a must have for me, but this set have nice assortment of parts... new turntable, new panels (i like yellow). and if i'll buy two of this sets - i'll get enough wheels for proper 18-wheeler. and rubber connectors, that i almost don't using at all, but want to have more and more) edited by victor imaginator, 06 december 2015 - 02:19 pm.
definately a quirky set, i think i'd have prefered a bucket on the front with a complex lift and tip mechanism, but a grab is different. as for the b model, i may prefer it's functions to the a model, certainly something different we have not seen before.
great review indeed!
the instruction is done. many thanks to martinsch https://www.dropbox....loader.pdf?dl=0
quote and the dumbing-down continues. now they have to show people to compare axle lengths to the 1:1 prints on the page that have always been there. but how does the 1:1 work on the app? might have to look into that... (for the record... i pulled out my phone and tried to find the app in the google store. couldn't find it. so then i went to the lego website shown on the page and it had a link to it. turns out it wasn't showing up because it's tablet only, so google wasn't showing it to me on my phone. i'll try again later with a tablet...) funny thing is that they changed colour of 7l axle to yellow, and on that picture it still is in lbg.
excellent review! i am glad that you did not rush this or the mine loader review. could it be that the fan in the back is like a turbo prop propulsion.... just reaching here. andy d
thank you for the review. i have this one in my pile to build. i wish there was more of the curved blue panels though.
here is a video review via jang to add to the review: i like both a and b so will buy both.
review - 42038 - arctic truck introduction arctic vehicles aren't new to lego. back in 2000 the town theme already had several small orange arctic vehicles. in 2014 tlg again released a number of arctic sets in the city theme (formerly known as town). some of these sets are actually pretty big, containing over 700 parts. looking back in history it seems that arctic sets may have found their origin in the technic theme. although these sets were white instead of orange, they are unmistakenly arctic. the 1986 technic arctic sets contained the infamous technic figures. unfortunately the 2015 arctic truck doesn't contain any technic figures, but nonetheless it's great to see a new arctic vehicle in the technic line, not counting several snow scooters. let's see if the new arctic truck lives up to the expectations. note: all images can be clicked for hi-res versions. set information number: 42038 title: arctic truck theme: technic released: 2015 part count: 1219 box weight: 2110 gr box dimensions: 47,8 cm x 28,0 cm x 7,2 cm set price (msrp): € 79,99 / us$ 84.99 / £ 59.99 price per part: € 0,088 / us$ 0.093 / £ 0.066 links: brickset, bricklink the box the box measures 47,8 cm x 28,0 cm x 7,2 cm and weighs around 1385 grams. the box actually feels pretty heavy which means it's filled properly. this seems to be a trend in the technic theme. slightly smaller boxes can save shelf space for retailers. the front the front of the box shows the main model and in the lower right corner there's a image with the dimension of the model. it's 40cm long and 18cm wide. the back the upper part of the back of the box shows the functions of the main model. the lower left section shows the b-model, which looks very promising (more on that later). the lower right section shows the motorization options for the main model. the crane (partially) and the bed can be motorized. besides motorization some leds can be added as headlights. the side on of the sides shows one of the newer smaller style panels. this is the first time it appears in orange. when you take a look at the sticker you can see that it's not symmetrical. not sure why tlg "cut of" one of the sides of the stickers, since the position of the panel is very suitable for a continuous sticker. content of the box the box is pretty densely packed, which is better than semi-filled boxes. it feels like you actually bought something which matches the box size. the box contains: 2 booklets 1 sticker sheet 8 bags booklets & sticker sheet unfortunately the instructions and sticker sheet haven't been packed with cardboard protection, which results in a curved sticker sheet and slightly bent instructions. in my case this wasn't so bad. at least no real damage. highlighted parts this set proves to be a great parts pack, especially when you might have missed some of the 2014 sets. black link treads usually the link treads come in dark blue grey, but this sets includes 96 black treads, which is great if you'd like to replace the dbg ones in your mocs, or other official sets. undercarriage and suspension several parts are included to build the undercarriage driving the treads. four large tread sprockets and eight small tread sprockets, which are used as return sprockets. also included are four steering portal hubs and four steering portal axles for driving and steering the vehicle. several frames, including two c-shaped pivot frames and two steering ball joints to create an undercarriage much like the 4x4 crawler. the set even includes two h-shaped frames (a.k.a. dog bone frames). new changeover catch parts this year (2015) three new parts have been introduced to improve the changeover catch. more on these parts later. new pin connector another new part for this year (2015) is the "1l round pin connector", which looks like a pin connector, but acts more like a bush. new pins furthermore this sets includes quite a large number of three (relatively) new parts. 17 x pin with pin hole, 14 x 3l pin with 1l axle and 11 x 3l pin with 2l axle, which have been introduced this year (2015). when the new 3l pin with 1l axle was introduced in 2014 it was only a matter of time before the new 3l pin with 2l axle would appear. both new pins are a great addition to the parts portfolio. panels last but not least this sets contains a fair number of orange panels, including the 3x11 panel in orange, which is the first time we've seen this part. part list below is the entire part list for the 913 parts. as usual this part list can be found at the end of the second booklet. the build the build immediately starts with some of the new parts, used to build the compact gearbox in the center of the model. notice the two 20 tooth bevel gears. one would have been enough to drive the 12 tooth bevel gear, so the second seems to be useless. tlg probably used it in the a-model, because they needed it in the b-model, which you can see later. the front and rear suspension are almost identical. the front side also has the 13l gear rack, used for steering. the picture below shows the steering rack on the front suspension in more detail. at this point you have more or less finished the chassis. the gearbox is in place and the majority of the functions has internally been connected to the right gears. the small turntable shows where the crane will be attached later on. at the end of the first booklet, some of the bodywork has been attached to the chassis. the orange-black color scheme never fails to please me. throw in some cool stickers for the extra effect and we have a winner. if you decide to motorize the model, using pf, the top of the cabin can be lifted to accomodate the battery box. the chassis uses lots of orange (and some black) panels to give the model it's distinctive look. the protective black bumber/railing is a nice addition which adds something to the exterior. the dumping bed at the rear can tilt to empty it's load. it's operated by a mini la. the treads, which look very cool in black, are driven by a large tread sprocket and returned by two small tread sprockets. the front and rear sections are identical. building the undercarriages feels a bit repetitive, which is a problem for most tracked vehicles. finished model adding the crane to the model finishes the build. your model should look something like this. when you take a close look at the finished model, you realize this is something else. it's trully a unique vehicle. the color scheme is brilliant and the fact that it's an arctic truck is really neat. it's a welcome change for the technic line to see a vehicle like this. this picture emphasizes that's it's a very cool vehicle. imagine this beast plowing through the snow! as far as i know it's not based on a real life vehicle. if's probably a combination of several vehicles and some imagination. i can be totally wrong though. the rear of the vehicle shows the crane and drum, placed on the tipper bed. from this angle you can see some of the internals of the model, the gearbox behind the cabin for example. the crane can be partially motorized (rotation and base), while the boom is operated manually. what i like a lot is the protective railing around the vehicle. left over parts some leftover parts, nothing noteworthy. features and functions this set has several functions/features: steering driving suspension crane tipping bed steering as you can see in the image below the steering mechanism has quite a bit of negative caster (please correct me if i'm wrong), which causes the treads to rotate a bit upward/downward instead of only to the left and right. driving you mention driving as a feature?! yes i do and let me explain why. normally i would ommit this as a feature and take driving for granted. however, driving this vehicle (on a flat surface) causes it to simply slide over the surface. for other arctic vehicles this would be a plus, but with a tracked vehicle it limits playability. this is one of the main drawbacks of these tread, they simple don't work properly on smooth surfaces. suspension the suspension is working properly. you do need to apply some pressure, but all things considered it's not too bad. crane the crane has four degrees of freedom: base rotation lower boom upper boom hook it does what it's supposed to do. base rotation and lower boom can be motorized and switched using the gearbox, while the upper boom and hook are operated manually. tipping bed the tipping is operated via a mini la. conclusion while the set does offer various functions and features, driving and steering is a serious issue. therefor this set is more likely to be showcased than to be played with. b-model instructions for the b-model are of high quality. looking at the image below, you will see what i mean. here's the finished b-model, a tracked jeep with a communcations device. this alternate model looks so good, it could easily have made it as a main model. one thing that does pop in mind; how would this look with tires?! more on that later. when you are in the artcic region it's imperative to have proper communication channels. since there's no internet backbone, you will need a big antenna of some sort. this b-model actually features a small trailer wagon with a transmitter/receiver. here's more detailed image of the b-model, without trailer wagon. i would buy this model in a heartbeat if it were a main model. simply gorgeous. the side view doesn't give away that this in alternate model. the stickers also work really well in this model. and again, nothing to complain here. the model even has a small crane at the rear, operated by the mini la. here you can see the arctic fleet, comprised of both the a-model and b-model. i bet these two can get some work done!! a bit of a messy picture, but this should give you an impression of the size of both models. leftover parts not too many parts left, which is obviously a good thing. alternate model with tumbler tires just like me, you probably have been wondering how this model would look like with (tumbler) tires. well, here it is. as i imagined it does look great. admittedly, these are not the type of tires we ought to use, but to be honest; i don't really care. again, the negative caster results in quirky steering. the tires are a bit too big, so they hit the chassis when you compress the suspension. while this has absolutely nothing to do with an arctic vehicle, i really love this picture. summary we're almost at the end of my review, so what do i think of this set. let's start with getting the elephant out of the room; this set lacks proper driving and steering. does that make it a bad set?! definitely not! it's a great set, but it lacks some playability when it comes to moving the vehicle. the crane and tipper bed do work properly, so there's still some playability left. does this set look cool? definitely! i think it's one of the coolest (no pun intended) and most original models of recent years. the orange and black color scheme works great and the stickers are well designed. the b-model is of very high quality and some might even prefer it over the a-model. and if you are not interested in either of these models, this set provides you with a variety of great parts! all in all i think this is a great set! maybe not to play with, but it scores high on all other criteria. pros original model great color scheme lots of interesting parts great b-model cons steering and driving don't work too well repetitive build of undercarriages (minor con) score below are my scores based on different categories. 8 design original and good looking model. 7 building experience fun to build, albeit a bit repetitive. 8 features packs quite a few features. 7 playability some features work, some don't. 9 parts comes with interesting parts. 9 value for money two great model in a single set. 8 cool! as a bonus, here's picture of the main model with tumbler tires. why? because we can!
very timely review jim. my wife has just surprised me by giving me this set a few days ago and i have just built the a model two days ago and b model yesterday. i agree with all that you wrote above. i don't have tumbler tires but i have 9398 tires. driving is smooth but steering + suspension will be bad as you said due to negative caster and tires hitting the chassis. anyway, tonight i will destroy the b model and rebuilt this http://www.busterhau...8-c-model.html.
i was supposed to publish it together with the 42039 - 24 hours racer, but it somehow got backlogged. after completing the reviews for the 2016 sets, i felt i needed to finish it (was already 90% done). that c-model looks cool!
i could be wrong but i am 100% sure that i've seen this review before.
great review and pictures as always. its an odd combo, but i agree that the b model looks good with tumbler tires therize, on 14 december 2015 - 09:32 pm, said: i could be wrong but i am 100% sure that i've seen this review before. i believe jim posted the same one in the reviewers academy
until i saw photos of this set i wasn't convinced i wanted it. now after seeing all the combinations (a+b and tumbler tires!) i am definitely buying two copies. i need orange parts and black treads anyway. the only problem i have with this is that it's going to encourage me to buy many copies of the drag racer just to get enough wheels to play with.
lets not forget the c-model made by buster haus. pretty sweet c model..... http://www.eurobrick...opic=106969&hl=

i have the 42038, nice set but i found the tipping of the bed clumsy. it was a pleasure to build and i do like the build with the tumble wheels
once again, excellent review jim! than you for not skipping this small but pretty great set. i also got two of this and i have to say, i really admire the nifty suspension. building a third bodywork for the same suspension system is still on my backlog.

here is the review...for broadside's brig 6259! a set from 1991, with a handsome count of 64 pieces, 3 figures, and a sale price of $8.75! the building(and parrot): we'll start off with the front. it looks like a good solid building to hold those scurvy dogs! we yonder over to the left side: and see a nice open back: and yonder to the plain right side: back to the left, we find the corner, with a nice area to rest your tired soldiers! we see the platform in the corner, a lovely place for soldiers to stand on! it's a bit...skimpy, so watch your step! the middle is blocked by some stones, assuring security! but still open enough to stand in! the jail is cramped, and fits only two people, but we only need one prisoner in this set :-) ! moving up is the watch tower, a place for your soldier stand and stand watch or for silly parots to sit on! here's the front middle part, again those stones blocking the way! figures and accesories: we have a delightful number of a soldier, a sailor, and a scurvy pirate! a lovely parot! and a generous assortment of weapons! that concludes our review. overall: it's a fantastic little set, and great for army and supplies and bricks gathering! i can't find any faults with this set, it's just the neatest little thing you've seen in a port *wub* highly recomended *y* . and to end our review: a comic!
you've done a good job of this review mr imperialscouts! but two things. 1) background far too bright and the set is far too dark, easily rectified with brightness & contrast adjustment. 2) no poll to rate the set out of 5. nonetheless this should be frontpaged on classic-pirates.com!
huzzah! ...and title change as well...the best conquistador out there! :-$
the poll doesn't allow you to select 2 from 1-5. it instead says 1, 3, 3, 4, 5. but besides that, your review i give it a 5 because 1) shows the set in all angles 2) shows the characters 3) comment on the little creature comforts of the set 4) added a comic (playability) 5) showed true enthusiasm *y* *wub*
i'd give a 2, but you put 3 two times. is a nice set but is not really cool. is a worse version of lagoon lock up
well i only know the european price: 89.99 euros i think that's quiet expensive against the 2005 police station (7237): 74.99 euros - rupeeclock
thank you very much for the review, the-force! the new police station looks great! i really like its lovely interior - amazing! by the way: i have a question: are there any beds, tables or/and seats for the prisoners in their cells?
it's mine *wub*! just got my luke today from tru in in merrilville, in... ;-)! so here's some pictures and thoughts: still in the packing with the box pieces out in the fresh air put together, ready for some serious vader vacking >:-)! if you this close you're so dead!! it's yet another lovely maquette *wub*! the only downside is that the lego sw sign doesn't even resemble (ok, i've exagurating a bit :'-)) the ones from the other maquettes! check out this one from the blackhole trooper compared with the luke one: the luke one is has a massproduced look over it with just a printing |-/ , the other has depth & a painting on it. now i'm waiting for the long overdue boba one! here's the other maquettes reviewed: darth vader & stormie blackhole stormie maquettes on copmike
excellent review copmike! i feel as if i've actually seen the maquette up close in real life. x-d i swear i've even touched it. tack for sharing min kompis! *sweet*
awesome! these maquettes are really cool, thanks for the review! *y* ~peace
beautiful...i'm really trying to resist these. any word on who's next after boba fett? a c-3po/r2-d2 pair would probably push me over the edge.
verry cool, love it, what was the price?
copmike, on nov 22 2007, 04:09 pm, said: it's $69.99 + tax :'-(! boba on copmike golly gee, batman! that's too expensive for that, in my view.
thanks to this information. it's interesting for me. :-)
wow i went to my local toysrus and apparently they had some there dont really like them but there neat:)
not my thing, but a very nice review, thanks for sharing it! i was seriously considering this one when it was originally announced as a 6212 copack item at a particularly good price and then everything changed. i do, however, seriously ache to get my hands on one of the more traditionally lego looking 2ft+ vaders they use in the official stores (at least they had one here in orlando). *wub*
while it isn't my style, it looks pretty cool. thanks for sharing! *sweet*
if you have other heads and other lightsaber blades, yes :)

thanks for the review! *sweet* aside from the fact that i like the model, this set has a few new and useful pieces so i will have to get it! *wub*
a wonderful set and, perhaps, as close to classic space as possible. *y* also there?s a great amount of very useful and interesting parts too like these round 'stabilizer' parts with clip.... :'-) there?s a complete different feeling with this new sets compared to the first mm ones.... 8-| beside the a little more realistic aspects of it with the more enclosed cockpit (nearly with some controls.... ;-) ) it?s the overall more solid feeling i guess.... the other sets look pretty neat and fashionable at the surface, but their internal structure is much more hollow and useless with some studless technic beams and such stuff.... very shining, but hard and boring to mod, just aimed for maximal cool looking box art and the rest went down for saving costs.... (beside that already pretty good 7692 dropship that is). the only thing i don?t get with that is why the minirobot?s a one-armed one.... ach, pirates on mars i suppose.... x-d
that head might have been from rock raiders. lovely set, and a good review. jifel
great review, but am i the only one who thinks this is a pretty homely looking vehicle? the small exploration robot is cool, but the large windscreen on the main vehicle reminds me about jack stone! i also think the bases of the vehicle parts are very basic and look almost unfinished with the holes and such. i think i will pass this one, even though the alien has a jet pack and there is the nice mini vehicle.
tks for the great review mm ;-) its always appreciated to have reviews of new set. having said that i really don't see the point of that set and its such money and time wasted imo. i don't like that theme apart the dropship and 6wheeler and that tiny vehicle doesn't do the trick for me. i see it as a really cheap excuse to try and please classic space fan with that horrendous mm graphics and what amazes me is that you guys loke that :-d money saved on !! *yoda*

thanks for posting the picture of this new mm set. when i first saw the mars mission sets i was a little apprehensive about the design and the aliens (they could have at least make movable arms :(), but anyways when i bought the small fighter i was totally hook. my fave set from the line is the mech.
hmm, its actually a nice bit better than i expected, and great review, thanks! but think ill pass on this one. i quite like the alien fighter though, heh. and loved the way you described how he sat in the cockpit.
very cool review, mr. mandalorian! this isn't a bad set, the alien craft is very sleek (if only they'd gone with the old alien body in trans-green...) and the transforming is alright. the tank mode looks sweet. *sweet* ~peace
thanks for a very thorough review. i might think about getting this. i really like the mini alien fighter, and the transformation idea is always a welcome one. both modes look pretty good, despite the some of the odd coloured bricks (which i'd mod out). you know what it reminds me of? some of the futuristic designs in the gerry anderson series.
hmmm, great review for a great set. *y*
lasse d, on nov 26 2007, 04:54 pm, said: i'm not sure it would nose dive when transforming from tank mode. i guess it would pick up speed and transform quickly since it doesn't seem to have any downwards pointing thrusters. the one thing you'd have to make sure of, though, is that it was fairly light and the wheel base had a fairly large surface area (actually, that's two things), so as to make sure it didn't dig into the soil. if that happened, transformation would be harder as the wheels would dig into the ground and drag through the soil. then it'd nose dive.
john cleese, on nov 25 2007, 10:56 pm, said: cool review. i'm actually liking that new missile part as it seems to combine a bar with a pin. but it's a real eyesore if you ask me. a needed solution to those blasted flick missles from falling out while swooshing. *sweet* wonder if the range might have an issue seeing it's held in there but who knows, maybe they now "pop" out with a greater velocity than a mere finger flick? i had resorted to technic 1/2 bushings (smooth) to lock in the missile's technic axle (with stud).

sweeeet. *wub* it's nice to finally see a set that's not bipedal or (?) tripedal. quote exo-force is an anomaly in my lego interests. i don't know why i like it so much or why i keep buying it but i do. that would be a problem, wouldn't it? :-p quote the cockpit itself is constructed very well but the canopy seems like an afterthought, closing on to the robot's head and leaving his back and sides completely exposed. i dunno. at least it has a canopy, unlike past sets..
awesome reveiw thanks for the pics!! did the instructions come with a comic?
great review! *y* i am sure to get this set for parts now. his legs dont look very poseable... :-/ thanks hinck! ~vbbn~
another fantastic review, hinckley. i really like this set, i wasn't to keen on it when i first saw the pictures bit having seen the review, i am starting to like it. it seems quite sturdy, and it makes a change from the usual 2 legged mechs. as well as that purple is welcome anywhere, i have such a shortage of that colour! i like the rusty orange colour of the robots, and their back/jet packs are quite cool, and the mini robot looks sweet.
whenever i click on any of the thumbnails, i get an error.
great almost finished review *y* thanks for doing these, since you are probably busy however my favorite part is missing, the comic!! :-d interesting set, however i never liked exoforce but i like the parts wait on! piranha
dark sword ragnarok, on nov 27 2007, 08:08 pm, said: sweet. caant wait for all of these sets to show up in the u.s. uh... he got that in the us.
another great review, hink! looks like a great set. quote the cockpit isn't sealed and is actually aggravatingly unrealistic as it leaves the drivers chest vulnerable to enemy fire. actually the cockpit lacks any controls as seen here where it looks like keiken is simply pounding a counter demanding food. :-d "gimme food! or else my friend up there willl shoot your punk- @$$ into mars!" well, i guess that explains why there are no robot snipers in ef. if there were, well.... wouldn't be much of a story, would there? x-d
darnit, hinckley! >:-( you always make us wait for the comic, which is almost everyones favorite part! >:-( |-/ x-d i just noticed ryos uniform had a camo pattern. with all the orange he has, it's kinda pointless. edited by lt. veers, 28 november 2007 - 04:48 am.
thanks for that good review, hinckley. *y* a really interesting set and a turning point for lego. minirobots instead of shooting crap, pretty cool. i hope the kids?ll like it too. for the design, i love that asymmetrical look of the front part and the sleek guns of the flyer. it?s smart that the gatling gun moves along with the tank, too. the set idea with two vehicles in one?s not new, but very play- able and the treads/big wheel design?s cool. i don?t like the use of studless technic beams, but well, they do their job i guess. and keiken?s cockpit should be easy to improve....
can't wait for the extended review!! ;-)
i think this is probably my least favourite set of next years selection, but i still might get it, partly because of this review (thanks, btw). i quite like the mini-robot, and while there are a few problems (the front cockpit, the exposed axles) i relish the idea of moding them out, and correcting them. and the change back to the original figs is welcome. i didn't really get any of this years sets, only last years. makes it easier from a mocing potential, anyway.
crap! >:-( now i have to spend all my money on this! *wub* *wub* and whats the code? oh well, awesome set, and judt curios, didnt the reviewers used to be bianca and gavin? jifel
8112 battle arachnoid review i've opted to do another set review instead of getting the comics up. i don't want anyone to beat me to the reviews. so, thanks for your patience and enjoy the review. the comics will be up in due time. thanks! :-$
thanks for this new review, hinckley *wub* for me, it was love at fistr sight with this little set :-p it's simple but nice, and way better than shadow crawler for a spider-like mech *y* you sure will be very busy these days, and your characters will get breakdown before they finish filming all the comics x-d luxorv
hinckley, on dec 6 2007, 04:56 am, said: honckly? wow, dude. :-/ well, at least you got the c and the k. of course, the e is missing. it's all right though. eight letter words can be challenging :-p that's always the case for me. although, i have the assault tiger and will start on it next. on the box it looks like it is wearing huge bell bottoms. :-d i want to get the chameleon hunter, i really like the look of it and forgot to pick it up. guess i'll have to go back to tru! :-$ cross your fingers that i find more indy sets! x-d i'll just stick to calling you hink *y* (less letters :-d )
thanks for the review, although i still have no intentions of buying this, it's neat to know what's inside, the build etc... (the etc being the comic ;-) x-d ) it's wierd because i dont know what it is i dont like about this set.
nice review! hmm...i gave it a 4...why? very good bits: -3 epaulettes for 3 gurads! -patterned wall parts -cannon bad bits: -no pirates to fight -title is rather grand for an outpost -top needs battlements, not very low lattices -needs a more substantial base - the wall goes right into the sea! - surely the whole thing would sink... -palm tree is too short ...and the rest is good! :-p you might want to fix the vote option for 5 - it appears to be the title; you can't vote for it... pirate king skelly killer edit: ok, boney, but i gave it a 4! edited by slyowl, 06 december 2007 - 07:32 pm.
bonaparte, on dec 6 2007, 07:29 pm, said: fantastic review! i'll post my views on the set later when i have more time. but i've already fixed the poll. thanks, bonaparte! thank you for the comments people!
you even have the box! splendid review. i also own this one, and i think there's nothing to complain about. (more figs would be appreciated though, a sneaky pirate perhaps) 4 out of 5!
thanks for that nice review, it?s a 5 for me.... just a great little blue coats set, perfect for army and fortress building. *sweet*
i remember buying this set and thinking what an amazing job lego had done. it was my first pirate set and i still have it built. *sweet*
thank you for the comments! *sweet* i wonder who voted "1", surely such a nice set doesn't deserve such a low score!? *wacko*
it's not a bad thing to vote sabre island 1 if someone feels that it's genuinely worth 1 but t'would be interesting to know why.
i gave this one a 5. it's one of the little pirate sets i had during my youth and i loved it for several reasons. first of all, it contains 2 of my favorite minifigs! it can be used as a small independent base or in combination with one of the bigger sets (eldorado or trading posts) as a lookup or outer defense. besides all that, this set just looks beautiful. i love the colors (blue baseplate and the white/yellow tower). one of the best little/medium sized sets ever made by lego!
lord of pies, on dec 6 2007, 07:24 pm, said: the top of the tower is rather plain and simple which in some ways is good, as it keeps the whole set detailed yet not crowded, but i feel a little something should of been added to the top though. perhaps a catapult? steve
lord of pies, on jan 3 2008, 08:51 pm, said: what a wonderful idea.... :-p a pie catapult! although it is a waste of a pie....we have ourselves a dilemma! there's plenty of stale, moldy old, maggot infested grog around eldorado fortress, perhaps that's worth wasting on the scurvy sea-dogs afterall my men have taken to eating only coconuts brought by islander girls in their skimpy undies! x-d
thanx for the compliments :-$ stauder, on dec 9 2007, 01:47 am, said: ...

thank you big pete *wub* this set looks very good, it looks well built and the statues are nice. the ark looks great and the star wars hieroglyphic is classic :-d just a two things: is marion's face double sided? it looks like a calm face on the back of the box. where do the snakes come out? and about the stickers, have you tried putting them on the long bricks above the breakable walls? once again, thanks very much *wub* *y*
great review!! i love this set *wub* (not only because of marion though :-d ) it has the ark that is very cool , sw humor and lots of snakes a very cool set and perhaps my favorite so far *sweet* damn, 3 out 4 indy sets reviewed and isn't even 08 yet x-d p
thanks for the review! it looks awesome, and 10 snakes! is that box the ark though? thanks again! ~peace
outstanding! i can't believe you found one! i'd bet hinckley would be surprised about this.
marion's other face!
thank you for the great review! looks like a very nice set, so many snakes!!

hollisbrick, on dec 15 2007, 11:30 pm, said: could you take a photo of the ark? thanks oh and the inside too pleese *sweet* the ark doesn't have an inside. it's just one brick built box.
thanks for the great review! i'll probably be picking this one up if only for the minifigs (how can you not complete your alfred molina minifig collection?) and the idol piece. tinypiesrus, on dec 15 2007, 10:41 pm, said: oh, i watched this scene a few weeks ago, and the pilot is fishing while waiting for indy to escape. this is correct, and in pure serial film fashion, the pilot is has just hooked a big one just as jones starts yelling for him to get ready to leave ;-) badger
i just noticed another inconsistency between box art and the actual set ... on the box, the biplan has white wing supports (they're just plane windows without glass in them) and yet the set they are dark grey (or is it bley ... can never tell the difference without careful study). add to that ... the outer of the engine at the front is white on the box and black in the set. we don't normally have this many inconsistencies do we ?
this set is so cool... and another must buy! :-$ i'm in trouble next year it seems... the figs are great! *wub* i think the plane is only ok; perhaps they should have made that in a separate set as it needed to be a certain size to fit the figs, but that meant that the tail is way too short. here is a picture of the actual plane so you can see what i mean. (notice the pilot is fishing... ;-) ) the temple is another story; i think lego have done an incredible job with this, fitting in the key parts of this sequence without making an absurdly large model. addtionally, there are many parts in this set that i haven't got so it shouldn't be too hard to justify. x-d thanks for another great review. *sweet* i love the photo of indy running with the idol and the boulder close behind. :-p naith, on dec 16 2007, 10:20 pm, said: lol is it just me or in the earlier concepts of this set we saw a native on the box? i wonder why they removed it :-( *wacko* i recall that too. :-/ edit: yes there was one... big pete, on dec 16 2007, 11:28 pm, said: we don't normally have this many inconsistencies do we ? quite annoying ones too. i think the plane looks better with those being white.
looks like a nice set, i like the tiny turbos and have most of the older individual cars, but i am put off by the ever increasing price of the large sets with lots of extra parts that i'm not really interested in. i wish these were available as individual vehicles as well.
thanks for the review. i will probably miss this set as i have too many workers already! :-d zuloon, on dec 25 2007, 09:55 am, said: in my opinion, it's not even lego-ey. i have a few of this head... it's one of the multipurpose heads, it's even been used as a viking! *wacko*
i tink its better if you resize the pics before uploading to ur brickshelf account. picasa2 is a good tool to resize ur pics. use the "export" function. ;-) anyway, nice review! looks like i will be getting all of the city impulse sets except for the fire fighter one. maybe more of those large bin sets. heh.. thanks for the pics! is it possible if you scan the rest of the sets at the back of the manual? thanks in advance! :-d
thanks for the review. does anyone know if these mini sets are sold at tru?
heres all the parts in assorted baggies, and the horribly messed up instructions. four astronauts and four aliens, with an extra gold visor (yay!) not bad. the base of the horribly unstable alien craft. the wings move up and down, aswell as back and forth, the purpose i know not. next we build the nerf section of the base. basically technic. and the rest of the tube connectors. heres the farthest i got the little missle to go. its fairly dissapointing. good thing i didnt expect much from this portion of the set. heres the start of the command base. more of the main structure, will be adding lots of things to all the little beams. heres a storage container and the surprisingly not flimsy radar. on this side we see the alien elevator. it uses a horribly long technic rod, i have not seen one of this proportion, its like, a foot and a half long. more of the inner base where all the little tubes shall go. all the connected tubes and such. i also encountered a problem. in the instructions it says for the end of the elevator prong to be touching the tube connector where it is shown here, but mine has a 1x space inbetween. no matter. heres the completed base. + my knee. again. onto the spaceship. the bulk of it is just technic supporting beams, with some large slope peices covering it all up. more on that later. the white coverup. the middle section lifts up to store the overly large jetpack. as you see, the storage containers take up most the bulk in the back, and you can see the jetpack on the ground. aswell as the trigger hand hold thing that allows you to swoosh it. look, in the back! lego greebles! despite the large cockpit, it only holds one person, laying down. the wings are really the saving grace - double layered with a nice two toned effect. kitty nudged me this picture so its abit blurry, my apologies :-| extra peices and or peices i have no idea where the hell they go. :-p overall, the set is quite fun i must admit. full price, i probably would not go for it, but i got it for just under 70 dollars. for that price i can confidently say its quite worth it, many useful peices, nice figures (other than the aliens) and the tube things are quite fun to boot, even though i liked the life on mars system more, which i also have. none the less, its very fun to make them shoot around. alright, so its not much of a command base either, and it looks abit bare. but it's still fun, even if you ignore the nerf section. overall i give it a hardy 3.5 out of 5, the openness and epic fail of a missile launcher are hard to get by, but overall, its a dandy set :-d merry christmas *wub*
i don't recall mine having an alignment problem on the tubes... could you perhaps take a closer picture of the area? did yours also have two of the same sticker for the wings of the alien craft?
thanks for the review brickmaster! this set looks nice, i really like the orange (*wub*) and white colour scheme, although the purple of the lom base was very cool too. i only have the lom base, if you have it built could you show a comparison? on an unrelated note, by the time i realised the red and blue hangers on the lom base were for the red and blue mechs, the mechs were no longer in stores. :'-( i was a bit slow, huh? :-p anywho, this is one set i won't be buying, although if the rocket was sold separately i'd get that. :-d thanks again. *y* ~peace
should be here's the completed base and my knee in cordoroys (sp?) great review.
set 7741. the box: back: cool pose on back: the insides: the dss: theres acually a printed piece: the new handcuff piece with sb in the back: the finished product: the inventory: police page: the mail page: is this a new air plane?: the fireman page: the back: a future doctor hair piece?: price: 5/5 play: 5/5 overall: 5/5 i *wub* it!!!!!
lol, "polizei" is german for police.
thanks. iamded you never know.us ;-)
caseyref, on dec 26 2007, 02:02 am, said: i quite like it, but i feel that my lego city is getting over-run with helicopters and planes. also i have got the helicopter from the 7237 police station set, but it is not as good as this plus i'am sooooo dissapointed that the :-x stickers :-x are blue instead of black and green as they will not fit with the sets i have already got :-d nice review thanks if you look at the police picture from the instruction booklet, it looks to me that the 3 sets in the bottom left corner are the bike (7235), patrolcar (7236) and prisoner transport (7245) from 2005, but with new blue stickers?
thank everybody!! sinner, on dec 26 2007, 06:09 am, said: thanks for the review pspguy. i think this is a very nice little chopper... but the biggest reason why i will probably get this is for the handcuffs! :-d are the side windows flush like the old ones or recessed like the new ones are supposed to me? (the look recessed to me. :-/ ) yes, you're right. ;-) what? if your asking how they are but together you snap the window piece into the ho\lder. edit: scrypt, on dec 26 2007, 03:36 am, said: if you look at the police picture from the instruction booklet, it looks to me that the 3 sets in the bottom left corner are the bike (7235), patrolcar (7236) and prisoner transport (7245) from 2005, but with new blue stickers? hey!!! thats copyrighted mister!!! :-p edited by pspguy, 26 december 2007 - 05:21 pm.

pspguy, on dec 26 2007, 12:29 pm, said: you must have a small moniter. that i do my friend, that i do :-d
a nice simple helicopter! i always had thoughts of this, but after the review i'm gonna go get it! (well, not at the moment... x-o )
is it wrong that i got an extra printed control panel with this set? edited by db24, 27 january 2008 - 01:36 am.

freebee, on dec 28 2007, 02:33 pm, said: ouch ;-) hm if my answer was to harsh: sorry axle :-$
i enjoyed seeing this review. nice to get some different angles on the components. sorry to disagree with anyone however, but this was not a great review. i appreciate the effort sandra made but a great review would include more details such as what are stickers and what are printed pieces. a great review points out flaws or limitations as well as what works or is really neat. a great review would have analyzed the price per piece and compared that to other sets/themes. one might look at the recent reviews of the indy sets or the new spongebob sets as examples of really good reviews. the pictures are good but a great review, above all, should provide the reader with some new information, perhaps even answer questions posed in the pre-release discussion thread. i learned nothing new about the set from this review. that said, it was a good review for someone who had not seen the pre-release discussion and she did a good job of showing said person what they could expect in the set.
i see the service station has a full arry of tools, oxy/fuel torch and other goodies. not a bad set, still very pricey :-/
very good review, thanks!!!!!!!! axle, on dec 28 2007, 02:07 pm, said: can you take a picture(s) of all the film posters? sticker sheet pic with 1 megapixel film posters
tks sandra for these sweet pics 8-? this set is a true thing of beauty ;-) i love the vehicles and all the sweet details added to render that gklorious 50's atmosphere ;-) i love thge town hall, its very cleverly built and looks great 8-? my favoprite part of the whole bunch has to be the movie theater wich is superb *wub* i guess its pocorn time :-p ps: @ tedbeard - do tone it down youg man !! if you're not happy with sandra's work, do provide one yourself instead of bitching on how you view a review and on how sandra's post is veryt far from one (according to you !!) *yoda*

kimt, on jan 4 2008, 10:25 am, said: btw: which set would you recommend: market streeet, town plan or cafe corner? just curious. they're pretty expensive and i might only afford one of them. i guess it all depends on what you are after kim. if you want a really great and detailed set i would opt for the cafe corner, but if you want a set that can easilly be included in a city i would opt for town plan. since i can't afford all of them, i will just get town plan, because i lve the feeling of thge set and that theater is superb !! *yoda*
this is a great set, lots of detail and that service station and gaspumps do it for me! *sweet* thanks for the review legocastlegirl! *y*
thanks for the review, mr. mandalorian! this set looks very nice, and it's good to know the nose cone stickers are 2 separate ones, so they don't cross bricks. :-d that camera is working out great for ya'! thanks again! ~peace
this is a brilliant review of a brilliant set! *sweet* thanks a lot! i know this may be a bit much to ask but could take some pics of the whole instruction booklet? please!!! if you can thanks a bunch. but if not do know of a place where i could find the instructions?
ok i thought it might be to much to ask. i will try *vader* 's review. and again thanks for the review *y*
i got that set from my grandma on x-mas. she ordered it early. i really like the presesnts and that blue thing. 3 wheeler? here in america, it's 100$$. ouch. i like the rabbit. whats with the rats in the trees and the cargo train? nice review. edited by ~vbbn~, 04 january 2008 - 01:31 pm.
blah. i wanted one of these at half off but i forgot and missed out. thanks for the review though :-$
i was fortunate enough to get one along with the hobby train. they are the first trains i have ever owned (mainly by virtue of them having been half price). it's a fantastic selection of parts with the holiday train, as well as it really looking the part as a set. i'm happy not to get a motor; as i think the 9v setup would prove expensive, and the ir control system for the rc setup seems a bit poor. i got some "dead" track for with it to have just as a push train for now.
sorry yoda. i think it might of been my problem. :-$ either way i edited my first post. dp8

trudop561, on jan 5 2008, 04:21 pm, said: they released the battle droid commander in 2000 :-| while there was a yellow-marked battle droid officer in the 3343 minifigure pack released in 2000, the battle droid commander from 7670 is different. the new 7670 commander has a torso made of all yellow plastic, whereas the 2000 battle droid commander had a tan torso with yellow printings, and a tan head with yellow printings. so, while we have had a bd commander before, the 7670 commander is "new."
nive review of it yoda.. but i was going to do a review of it.. but now i see this.. i don't want to do it anymore.. :'-( next time.. try to do it with action.. [it is rare that people do that, they only do it with the set and not further..] ;-)

great review very precise. as for the spider droid construction, i have already worked it into a moc: http://www.brickshel...ry.cgi?f=290980 stryker-single gun hydra-seven guns hammer-missile pods. steel...
thanks for the great reveiw *yoda* fantastic pictures (very crisp) i am now going onto bricklink to purchse to because you have reasured me that this is a good set. ashoka~
great review, as we've come to expect from *yoda* *y* nice to see that tlg is finding new and interesting ways to get around the "no minifig only" sets restrictions with hasbro. clearly, this is another army builder with a minimal vehicle as we're becoming accustomed to. heck, even the diminutive hailfire is technically a droid as well, thus making this all minifigs, from a certain point of view. only negative: it is a bit overpriced. i'll have a better feel for that when i get one. treads/links always drive up a price, so it might just be fair. the spiderdroid is a winner, even with the unusual parts assortment. i like it when lego thinks of different ways to use things, i think it promotes the same from us. i'm not sure what i think of the new battledroid commanders, but at least i can make extras easily if i need to, as i bought a bunch of yellow droid bodies off bricklink once, thinking i might want to make some kind of new droid out of them. they were cheap at the time, now i expect the price to go up just because of this potential use. between those and the grey ones, it's good to see more becoming available. hopefully we'll see black and a few other colours produced for some nice customizing possibilities. all in all, a nice little set with a great army building potential, especially on a buy-one-get-one-half-off or better type of sale. until then, i'll grab one or two and be glad to have them.
i got this and a couple of other sets on monday.and to tell you the truth, i was a bit dissapointed.i like the set, i like the parts, but it's definitly not worth it's rrp of $45 nzd, if you ask me i should be more like $35 nzd, but hey, i still like it, i got it for $30 on ebay so i'm not complaining *y* *y*
i haven't spotted these in the us yet. i'm looking forward to finding them. overall, the 2008 line-up is a excellent and it's going to be difficult for me to decide which themes/sets to pursue. there's a lot to choose from.
thanks for the takes on these two sets, yoda. stickers or not, i still think these are charming sets with all the essence and nostalgia of the older sets back in the 80/90's. am i the first one to notice the new doors used in the back of the van. not only is it using the popular new frame, but the old container doors have been redesigned to fit with the new frame as well. pity they're not yellow, though.
great review *yoda* (i find myself saying that line alot :-d ) i love these two little sets *wub* tlc continues the great city line that started in 07 and continues into 08 its also nice to have other sub lines besides fire and police :-| :-p i hope there are many more postal sets, like a post office!!that would be sweet! hope these are mainstream and not those damn exclusives >:-( postal on! p
thanks for the review! i was always going to get these two sets, so you haven't swayed me at all!! x-d i reckon lego could enhance this sub-theme by releasing a post motorbike (with or without a sidecar) and post office. obviouly the office would be the hub of all the activity, while the post bike would take care of the postal run. this would free up the van to take or recieve bulk mail or parcels to or from the airport. it could then also do the parcel deliveries around the city. the office would also serve as the reciever for all the parcels the new goods truck might deliver. just some thoughts, that's all!! *sweet*
i need to do some catching up here :-p matn, on jan 5 2008, 05:16 pm, said: could you tell me how much you payed for them? i think i'm gonna buy them tomorrow if they have it already (or if i don't see any cooler sets). i paid a tad more than the s@h price: i paid 15 for the plane and 8 for the van (sure its a tad more expensive but i didn't want to wait for tru to get them) freddie, on jan 5 2008, 06:10 pm, said: am i the first one to notice the new doors used in the back of the van. not only is it using the popular new frame, but the old container doors have been redesigned to fit with the new frame as well. pity they're not yellow, though. great remark there, i guess i totally missed that one :-$ and i agree that yellow doors would have been better but those dark bley do not look that bad !! mr hobbles, on jan 5 2008, 09:10 pm, said: can you tell me though, the wheels on the van, are they rubber or plastic? they look a bit tacky... rubber off course ;-) they do look a tad tacky but its because they are the thin type (like with the racers) and i am not a fan of those |-/ phoinix, on jan 5 2008, 09:35 pm, said: cant wait for your next one tks ;-) me neither though :-p marvinblue, on jan 6 2008, 03:31 am, said: i reckon lego could enhance this sub-theme by releasing a post motorbike (with or without a sidecar) and post office. obviouly the office would be the hub of all the activity, while the post bike would take care of the postal run. this would free up the van to take or recieve bulk mail or parcels to or from the airport. it could then also do the parcel deliveries around the city. the office would also serve as the reciever for all the parcels the new goods truck might deliver. so true 8-? at one point i was thinking of a impulse set with a yellow bike, postman, post and letters (that would rock !!). i hope tlc adds to this sub theme and keeps that retro feel *wub* a yellow dirtbike with sidecar would be a sweet 5? set !! also a small town feel post office would be so cool: like a 20/30? set ;-) we can be sure of one thing though, this year's advent calendar will have a postamn and small post office ;-) post on !! *yoda*
while the plane does look nice, i don't particularly care for the van. but the van does have some good parts, which is the only reason i would by one: yellow mud guards, the new windshield, and the small door on the rear.
thanks for the great reviews, *yoda*! the car looks great. *y* and the plane is very cool too, and much more suited to a lego town than the large planes. on!(?) x-d ~peace
cool! finally its an entire line i can actually afford to own every set! :-d i can't wait to get my hands on them! if its possible, could you give us the demensions of the box? it would be apprectiated. *y* dp8
thanks for the review, tanotrooper! this is a nice little set, with 2 axes (*wub* >:-)) and some nice parts. cool alternate model too! x-d tanotrooper, on jan 6 2008, 09:07 am, said: 9.3 cm by 9.3 cm by 4.5 cm x-d tt x-o cute! i can't wait to see these impulse sets in stores. *wub* ~peace
thanks for that really nice review dunamis! now it is even more harder for me to wait for this set. i hope my legostore will get it tomorrow!! it is really nice. i?m a really big fan of the creator houses.. but that one is now the best one for me!!! i love the colour of it and of course the windows at the roof. *wub* creator house on!!! greetings sandra
thank you for the nice review with many pictures. *y* :-d i already wanted this set, but the pictures make it i want even much/more.
i didn't know that the other models in this set came with interiors. this changes everything!
thanks for the review. *sweet* this set is on my when-i-see-it-i-buy list! x-d
thanks for the great review! very in depth! *y* *y* those wheel pieces are quite old by the way, i have 1 from some time ago. ~peace
i finally got around to finding this at my local tru. probably going to do an interior soon.
agentrick57, on jan 26 2008, 12:42 pm, said: probably going to do an interior soon. have fun.....its pretty hard theres hardly any room in my house now i will post pics soon. (i was able to fit a small fridge & freezer under the stairs 8-? )
looks like i'll need to buy another one i just started the garage (which is attached to the house) but i ran out of yellow bricks........... :'-( >:-( btw nice moc takuto20 *y* i might have to "steal" your idea and make a third story since its abit tight downstairs to fit everything.......ooo yea and i like your kitchen and the dishwasher :'-) ....... edited by darth_legois_619, 23 march 2008 - 11:00 pm.
ah great review kanal-k1 (and welcome to eb! :-d ), i was waiting for one of this set. not that i was expecting anything good, i won't buy it. i agree with thr playability, it does seem weak. what can you do with it. swoosh it? :-/ big step backwards lego... :-( dr. brick
i think this is one to leave on the shelf with the giant dump truck of 2006 and the hovercraft of 2007!
a big thumbs down for me. this doesn't look like lego at all :-| *n* *n* *n* *n* *n* out of *n* *n* *n* *n* *n*
howly cow! this is *y* *y* *y* for you for making a review so fast! thank you so much. hope it keeps a lot of people from buying. :-| kanal-k1, on jan 16 2008, 09:26 pm, said: when i saw the way, how is this plane made, i was strongly thinking to play money for nothing from dire straits as a music accordant with whole set. :-d lol! :-d , great comment! kanal-k1, on jan 16 2008, 09:26 pm, said: this is my first plane in this scale and for 99% the last one. this will never be my first or last plane and that for 100% :-x 7723 crap plane off!
i have the big passenger plane so i'll be passing on this one. one big juniorised plane is enough for me! if i didn't have the passenger plane though i'd rather get the cargo plane. there's enough police in my city as it is!
i have to agree with almost all of the replies here that this set is the most ugliest looking lego set i have ever seen. if i have never seen this set, and ppl showed it to me, i would have thought it would be some little kid's moc or something (no offence!) huge juniorized pieces, bad color theme (i would say it would look better if the wing is white), no interior and huge dss! i will avoid this set like the plague. i own the entire city line (except for the airport) and planning to get all the city stuff that lego releases. but, this set will ruin my plans coz i will avoid it... unless someone gives it to me for free. haha *wacko* boo lego boo! :-x
what i don't understand is what sort of crime this seaplane is exactly designed to fight that the multitude of other crimefighters in lego city can't handle.
hello and welcome to another redman set review! well, actually, the first redman set review! i'm your host, redman, and today i adorn my medieval outfit to tell you about the impulse set simply titled "the knight". this is a great set, with 14 pieces, 2 of which are spare, and a minifig with 2 weapons, 2 helmets, and some shiny armour. all this is packaged in a tiny box, just short of 10 cm? (or 3? inches?), with a neat little instruction manual that folds up to the size of the weapons rack included in the set. as you can see, this set only costs a measly 7 nzd. (disclaimer: redman not included.) here we see the box, clearly showing what the box holds. on the top we see a 1:1 scale picture of a minifig, for those new to lego, or who have forgotten how big a minifig is i guess. :-/ x-d the instruction manual, showing the nice and easy built, with me for size comparison. :-d (*sorry about the dark image, i had to lean over the light to get a birds eye pic. ;-)*) here we see the 2 different soldiers you can make with the set; a knight, and a guard or standard troop or soldier or whatever you want to call him... (note, each set comes with only 1 minifigure, and additional accessories.) of course you know i'm in the picture just for the sake of it, i'm not really one of the soldiers. x-d the neat little weapons rack, or rather equipment rack, as it holds not only a weapon but a shield (except the ovoid ones), helmet, and armour. nice and easy storage, so your equipment won't get dirty lying around on the ground. :-d one of the spare parts is another of those robot hands, so you can stick that in place of the shield and allow the rack to hold 2 weapons. just thought you'd like to know that. :-$ and here we see the nifty little structure of the thing. it can even support a whole minifig! note the grey stud on the bottom bar is a spare part, i just find it better used there to hold the armour. :-) huh? i don't remember this picture... 8-| it appears i drifted off, and these guys don't look too happy i overtook their weapons equipment rack. :-$ i should go... x-d so, in conclusion this is a great set for army building, at a reasonable price, with nice equipment, and it can be picked up as a little extra with your normal shopping. x-d that's all for today folks! *sweet* [/redman] so, what do you think? should i continue with these redman reviews ? (:-p), or just stop now? x-d comments and criticism welcome! :-$ ~peace
very good reviews, i think that redman is really ok, a very little cute curious fig... sadly he is not in the impulse set... ;-) i wish to see redman still around about your creepy avatar, yes, it look a bit creepy *skull* nausicaakro (this impulse set is storage in 8 copies, with 8 wizard set, 16 city set (2x), 16 mission to mars set... so if you want buy 10 of this (like me) you must find 2 different toy center)
nice review, very detailed. *y* as for the spare parts, mine didn't come with any. both dark grey 1x1 round plates are used on the weapons rack (one for the armour, one for the helmet) and i only got one robot hand for holding weapons.
i like redman, he'd make a good superhero. good review! edit: 200 posts! edited by agentrick57, 19 january 2008 - 05:58 am.
well today i finally got my hands on set 7038, now since the moment i first saw pics of this set i knew it was for me. so lets start with the new troll helmet and torso, these are both great. this troll really stands out as a leader when next to the usual trolls in the dwarf mining set: ok so here's a few shots of the front of the set: now one thing i really like about this set is the way that lego have placed the back wheels higher than the front. this allows the set to really appear to being pulled: here we have a shot at the missiles on the wagon, these are better than some around i have to say. if you look just behind the bottom missile you will see a simple firing device, simply push it down and then let it go to see those missiles fire: the troll flag is moved behind the missiles for firing: one thing that does bother me about this set is the lack of anything on the rear, ok it's easy to fix with a little moc'ing so it's not the end of the world but i would of liked something placed there: now lets move on to the crownie's wagon, this is simple yet good for holding weapons: as for the crown knights themselves, well there the ones from the impulse sets which is great imo: here's a few quick shots of the 2 larger trolls we have so far, i prefer the sand green one. what about you? well that's the end for now, requests for pics and comments are welcome. overall i rate this set as a must for anyone who's a fantasy castle fan, i know i'll be getting more of this set...... as for the new wagon well it's joined up with the other trolls: i do hope the impules crownies i bought today can handle them, oh and yes i did change the knights heads x-d : fantasy war on!! *vader*
awesome review!! i like the turkey leg hanging in front of the troll x-d yea the back looks a little....empty 8-| well overall i enjoyed the review! see ya soon!
looks like an ace set :-$ i may get this just for the sand green troll, even if i'm not a great castle fan, i do want one of them things! *wub* i also love the goblin's new metal flaked helmet, and the same style with the wheels. they look very nice. the chicken leg fishing pole is always fun too :-$
nice review. *sweet* this is a must buy for me since i *wub* the new sand green giant troll! now i just have to wait until it's available in the us :'-( general tarful
thanks for this excellent review vader! it seems you are succumbing to the castle side of the force. i love the new helmet, and the new orc torso is fantastic as well, which is great to see that the troll faction has many ranks too. the troll himself i love, i agree with you in saying i prefer the sand green version. the battle wagon is cool, one of the better wagon designs, and the flag is a great touch which improves it. sadly the back is rather empty, but a few mods'll change that :-) and of course this set includes the infamous chicken pole! one pic request, if you have time vader, could you please post a few pics of the new helmet on its own, and on a human soldier please? batbrick is back! >:-)
some people say they like the shadow knight helmet better, but this one is way better!
this is fantastic, i love the new helmets for the goblins *sweet* i've always loved the chicken leg thing, really screams lego to me! at least how lego used to be :'-( great little bit the goblins are awesome too, and the sand green one should look good next to the tan ones...gives a nice feeling of a real species. in reality not all members of a species are identical, it's great seeing them in different colors. great review x-d
a troll driven by a turkey leg, what a wonderful little detail!!! :-d :-d thanks for the review vader. very clever, using a flag to hide that crazy firing device. i find it rather odd they used blue pins for this. black or gray would've been alot more discrete. about the big trolls, i think using different colours is good. i don't think a troll force would be very organized, so different colours would make the effect complete *y* . as for your troops, looks quite fearsome! definitely compared to my pathetic number of soldiers.. :-$ a nice set, but i would rather get the attack on tower though.. no matter about the price difference.

xwingyoda, on jan 22 2008, 04:26 pm, said: tks for the review mate ;-) now i have to bloody wait long because lego france has this line available in freaking march >:-( pissed *yoda* on !! :-d i love the "new" goblin :-p that helmet is really cool. why on earth tlc didn't include that one in the dwarf mine ? such another idiotic move |-/ anyone keeping track of tlc's stupidity lately ? that would be interesting !! i clearly want a huge goblin army now hehe !! and i totally agree with you mate, the troll lokks better in sand green. the cart itself is pretty lame imo - just a sordid excuse to include yet another annoying shooting crappy device. but for a 21? set its okie i say ;-) need my bad guys on !! *yoda* i believe there is a topic around here somewhere based on bad lego ideas. after getting this new helmet i really wish lego had included it with the mining set, it's bloody annoying having to buy yet more of them from bl :'-( the shooting bit is better than some sets that have had one, at least this one is smartly done and of course it can also be hidden.
thanks for the review of a set i would otherwise probably have passed on. out of curiosity how did you 'know it was for you'? you seem to be building quite a collection. why castle now? was the fantasy element all it took? just curious. thanks again and god bless, nathan
question: what's different with this "special edition"? btw, nice shots!
the forklift is amazing, and nice design of the opening side doors aswell. thanks for the review, i may actually pick this one up ;-)
brickmaster, on jan 19 2008, 12:27 am, said: it's either that or it's a toysrus exclusive set, as my armoured drilling unit box also had special edition on it. special edition mean that it's a store exclusive set. the cargo theme is a tru exclusive, and another example is thr tie crawler is exclusive to target. also, can th doors be opened on either side?
thanks for the review! that forklift is wonderful! *wub* i may have to pick this one up convince dragonator to pick this one up! :-d too bad it can only hold 1 crate. :-/ ~peace
wow, 8-? great review. *y* i usually don't buy city sets but i think i might get this one just for that awsome forklift! *wub* general tarful
i'm curious, for those of you who are not into city sets and want this set for the forklift, what would you use it for?
holodoc, on jan 19 2008, 11:10 am, said: although i really like this set i?m sooo disappointed about the big "on the cabin" brick :-x , that i probably won?t buy it. it's really not bad. it is big, but not a show stopper for me.
thanks for the review. i think the special edition is just for making people intrested and make them want to buy that set or something.
some guy, on jan 19 2008, 11:17 pm, said: i think the special edition is just for making people intrested and make them want to buy that set or something. hmm, that's a thought, but why would they pick this particular set? i would expect they'd do that with a slightly bigger set, like the heavy hauler perhaps. why do you think they'de pick this one?
mr tiber, on jan 19 2008, 02:46 pm, said: hmm, that's a thought, but why would they pick this particular set? i would expect they'd do that with a slightly bigger set, like the heavy hauler perhaps. why do you think they'de pick this one? good question. maybe it's merely a gimick to help push the city sets with all the other competing themes. the cement mixer is a special edition as well.
highlandcattle, on jan 20 2008, 09:15 am, said: this set looks pretty good to me, it is six wide isn't it? that is nice for a truck like this yes, 6-wide. the only problem with these big trucks is how they look on the city roadplates (i've always thought too big), compared to classic city trucks. getting off topic, i'd like to see lego make a car transport truck. i don't think i've ever seen one in lego. it would definately have to be 6-wide, or even larger.
great review! my only grip with this set is you can only fit one pallet in the truck. it should have been the same size as the trailer so you can at least fit 2 pallets. seems like alotof wasted space. if i'm going to transport cargo, i want to use the maximum amount of space aviable!! x-d

good reveiw, i quite like this set and ill buy it as soon as it actually gets in my country |-/ :-| (600th post) edit: $7!!!!! geez i thought $6 was bad :-x edit: who typed megablocks in my post..i didnt,??? edited by hollisbrick, 20 january 2008 - 05:41 am.
yay! another redman review! you are an excellent reviewer iamded redman, your pictures show all the details included in the set and your thoughts bring new light to features and bits i hadn't noticed or thought about before *y* i love this little set, i will get two i reckon, because i want all the wizard bits in a minifig box as well. nice little humorous pic at the end too. one improvement i think could be to include the pics of the back of the box and other side of the instructions anyway. honestly, there isn't much to improve, you are an excellent reviewer :-) redman on! batbrick is back! >:-)
tinypiesrus, on jan 20 2008, 05:05 pm, said: nice review, your camera is much better now. i look forward to more of your reviews :-) i just went to toyworld today and got a wizard and 4 knights :-) and on top of that, they were having a 20% off sale *sweet* i might go back and get some more tommorrow. thanks! 20% off, what a bonus! if only toyworld's sales were nation-wide. :-d i wish i were in wellington, the guy at the toyworld their is really cool, and into lego to! the guy at the martin's toyworld here in rotorua is quite professional, too much so for a toy shop. still, he tells me when they get stock in. anyway, i'm getting off topic in my own thread! x-d ~peace
tinypiesrus, on jan 20 2008, 06:05 am, said: the wizard is pretty good, and comes with some good parts... it would be nicer if he had a torso with printing on it... i agree. in fact, it's a point i've already made on this board. simonwillems, on jan 20 2008, 02:59 pm, said: the only thing that could have been better in my opinion is the wand, i always liked this one... again, a point i agree with and already made on this board. i'm not blaming you guys. ;-) the op in this thread should, at the very least, have linked to the existing thread about this set on this board. |-/ edited by amperzand, 20 january 2008 - 05:01 pm.
yay! more redman! probably going to get one of these and turn it into a carnival attraction.
amperzand, on jan 21 2008, 03:56 am, said: i'm not blaming you guys. ;-) the op in this thread should, at the very least, have linked to the existing thread about this set on this board. |-/ why? its his review, and a very good one at that, i don't see why he needed to link anything. be glad that he was kind enough to take the time to write up this review. now we have two different opinions on a set, which is great, there is no need for him to give credit to you, its his review :-) batbrick is back! >:-)
hollisbrick, on jan 21 2008, 06:31 pm, said: so your saying you did the reveiw?? i thought it was redman x-d ;-) no, that was on behalf of redman. x-d ~peace
a great review, i like redman, he is most amusing! thanks. as for the set, i like it very much, i love the wizard and owl! *wub*
thank you all for your comments! i really appreciate them! *sweet* tinypiesrus, on jan 21 2008, 11:29 pm, said: wait, isn't it light bley, not frown? :-$ :-p although i would much rather have a brown table :-$ right you are! i don't know what redman was thinking. :-p he's fixed it now. ;-) ~peace
sweet plane looks much better than in the catalogs *sweet*
i do admit the amount of cargo is rediculously small, but it still looks good. say, how much can the plane hold? thanks for the review! *sweet*
thanks for the review and pics dr s! i am still considering this set. what is the instruction manual number?
i loved the pics in the catalogues but was a bit disappointed by the build and end result. my own thoughts: cons: - as noted, the cargo space is really small considering the size of the plane, although i can see this is restricted due to playability - without the barrier in the middle, the cargo would slide all over the place while the plane was being swooshed - the cargo 'lift' (i'm not sure how else to describe it) is very weak and snaps off, although it is a clever design i think it's badly implemented - there is nothing to hold the cargo pallet to the cargo lift truck so it tends to slide off all over the place as soon as the truck moves - colour issues - i had at least 3 shades of green with the larger plane pieces and noticeable variances even with identical cargo hatch pieces. at least one of them also came quite scratched, which was a little disappointing - at $79.95 aud it's $10 more than the passenger plane was with less pieces and figs, and no printed pieces whatsoever! more $ for less, methinks. pros: - lots of nice cargo crate pieces and even the stickers for these are pretty good. - landing gear piece adjusts very well to height differentials so the plane doesn't lose its gear as often as the earlier passenger planes - the hinging mechanism works very well to open the cargo holds - opens very smoothly and is not noticeable - i'd definitely like to see more of this technique - the little vehicles work well chained together and are all good small designs overall: - i really like the large planes since 06 but i don't think they've still quite hit the nail on the head. whereas the earlier planes were a little flimsy, this one is sturdier but has its own issues. the look of the cargo plane is nice, and the new landing piece and cargo hatch pieces are really great, but some design weaknesses and colour issues detract from the overall product. it's a shame as with a bit of tweaking this could have been a must-have set.
wow, that's a great review of a great set dr s! *y* as you yourself have already noted, this has the potential to be a fantastic military moc! with a bit of modification you can get the engines to be rounder, or perhaps do away with them completely and replace them with jet engines. *sweet* though i can't think of a system to retract the undercarriage at the top of my head it seems like there's indeeed more than enough potential to do so. it reminds me rather of an ilyushin il-76, one of my favourite cargo planes. :'-)

an excellent review dr. sinister! *y* i really like how tlc is using the new crate mold in different sets! the transport car is really neat as well as the lifting thingy plus i love the green color! *wub* p
wow what a screw up from lego! that one is even more out there than the extra obi wan in the rc. x-d
that is the one of the oddest mistakes i have ever heard of! :-d even so, you have to admit that it is good news for you; lego will hapily give you the right head if you ask. thanks for the review. i have this set too. *wub*
nice review, all the important stuff is there. weird cock-up by tlc to put an ani face on indy... i didn't encounter any mistakes in my four indy sets. great selfmade temple of doom indy fig, piranha! so uhm... has anyone found out yet what the extra hieroglyphic stickers are for?
i have noticed that at my local tlc store (orlando) they have this set in a glass case on display...with the cw anakin head on indy. i did not realize this was such i widespread problem.
thanks for a nice review, piranha. *y* a lovely playset, with a classical egyptian adventurers touch. although i?m not completely sure for the robot arms for the statues.... somehow, a little more details could?ve worked well for that set.... 8-|
i got this set and there weren't any qualms/misprints/mis packagings. hmmm, must be a small problem.
welcome to: my sigfig sgt. joey sh. will lead trough this review of the new city 7743 police surveilance truck. first of all the box: front back the minifigs: 3 police officers and a bad guy now the vehicles: the cute little atv *wub* the main part of the set: the surveilance truck a shot of the interior the trailer back of the trailer the truck back side the little building: front the interior and last but not least: spare parts and not needed stickers that?s it! hope to see you again at the next episode of sgt. joey?s reviews.
thanks for the review, stealth hunter. *y* that truck looks better than i expected, and it?s for sure a pretty playable set. nice, but still too much police mayhem to me. i think the new police station?ll satisfy all my safety needs.... :-)
great review stealth hunter, a bit blurry in places but overall nice shots of the truck. it is much, much better than i expected, but i still won't get it, i have no need for more police. thanks for the great review! batbrick away! >:-)
thanks for the review, that truck is actually better than i first thought! i am still tossing up getting it, as i am getting the police station, and where would it park?! :-p i quite like the little building though, but still... i am so confused *wacko*
it looks to me that the little building is supposed to be like some sort of customs checkpoint between one nation and another or like a toll facility on a highway. i like the little checkpoint but i think that should be part of a separate set and 7743 just having the police mobile command center truck.
great review! keep them coming! i might get this set now. i must have those grey barrels... oh dear... :-d x-d :-p x-d this was a hilaruos review, too. edited by ~vbbn~, 10 february 2008 - 11:21 pm.
thanks everyone, heres part 2: the second instruction booklet includes instructions for both alternate models, which is good, i hate having too many manuals: here she is, the plane: its very nice and well proportioned, but where did iamded get that laser? overview, the landing gear is very sturdy and nice, and the wings are surprisingly good: top view, iamded's head fell into the propellers, i was trying to save him, honest! a view of how the motor on this one works, by pushing the orange button you can make the prop spin. it is well integrated like the chopper, though the prop only spins for about 2 1/2 seconds. still, its a nice feature: the tail is also well made, simple, but lovable. oh, and check out that tank! the prop spinning, agh! is that my hand? final view, there seems to be some sort of explosion here 8-| well i think i got iamded more than me atleast. the second model is also great, though not as good as the chopper. the lack of space to fit something into the cockpit brings it down a bit, but it is a very nice model overall. i recommend it, though unlike the chopper it will be hard to mod into minifig scale. so far so good with 4995, here are the leftover pieces from the model: enjoy! batbrick away! >:-)
lt. veers, on feb 11 2008, 11:55 am, said: great review, batbrick! iamded got what he deserved. x-d x-o :'-( :-p great review, batbrick! this looks like a wonderful set, i love that plane! it doesn't bother me that it's not mini-fig scale, as it looks more for display imo. *wub* looking forward to seeing the final model! *y* ~peace

thank you for your wonderful review! ) i was done very well.... ) i suggest that you will find "two-face's escape" set a very interesting one to build.... it also provides great playability and is not very expensive for what you will get. ) good day to you. )
hi! asuka, on feb 18 2008, 09:25 pm, said: congrats to that nice review.... i like the batcave set, you should also been able to find it at discount.... try epay. i found it there for 38 euro (and picked up two of them). nice price for loads of nifty material.
it is a tie between two face's escape and the batcave... but i would go with the cave... over 1000 pieces, nifty submarine, penguins, alfred, mr freeze, and and and.... it is wonderful...! especially for 38?!! :-) ol' style batman on! (yep, this is a lil' rant on 2008 batman.. :-p )
wow. i remember this set from when i was a kid. i got it for my birthday and opened the package first. sadly, i had to go to school so i had to leave it at home and not build it or play with it until i got home. needless to say that was one of the longest days of school ever. good review, great set.
a very nice review of a pretty and neat little set, thanks lord of pies, guess it´s a 3 for me, with strong tendencies to 4....
this set shows the awesomeness of classic pirate sets. i really have to get me some more! xd great review on a great set!
i'd give the set a 3 1/2 out of 5. it needed 1 more imperial to get a 4. a bigger basplate would have been nice as it appears to hard to fit all the minifigs on the island. thanks for this great review
imo this is a very simple and small set good to add some part to forbidden island. good
laurinator- i don't mind an occassional old review coming back to life for discussion, but it seems you've replied to many old reviews that have been stagnant for years. please try to refrain from "bumping" a lot of old topics as it pushes down new content that should really be the focus of discussion now.
well since this topic has resurfaced, i would add my 2 cents about my appreciation of this set. it was the first and (unfortunately) the largest pirate set i owned as a kid, but i played the wazoo out of it. some of the minifigs have lost almost all their face printing after so many play sessions! theres just something about the hut that appealed to me more than the cheesy skull-face islands we keep getting.probably that it wa kind of neutral, good for my pirates, settlers or islanders. though the palm leaves were rather fragile and used to break off the studded parts. it would be nice to get more of these "beach village army builder" sets. edited by ardelon, 21 september 2014 - 03:40 pm.
hi guys. i picked these up the other day, but it's taken me this long to get round to posting the reviews. so, here we go: tub comparison with a minfig (thanks brainbox): the lighting changes a bit throughout the photographs, as it was going dark outside, so i only really had my desk light, and i kept getting in the way. 4837 mini trains now the box i really like. it's no different to those of last year's sets, but the colour here is simply fantastic, and really seems appropriate for the theme. so this is what you get inside. all the pieces are still inside the bag, the optical illusion was accidental :-d . no pieces of particular outstanding interest, but the dark green cheese slopes are rather nice. look out for those later. 1 2 3 this is the main model, and uses all the pieces in the set (bar these two, which according to the inventory are spares, but as with all my other creator sets, i'm cheating and leaving them in). this is far and away the best model of the three, and evokes the iconic version of a steam train. the green looks superb, but i'm not sure whether that's due to the model itself or the actual colour. moving on, we get to the second model: 1 leftovers (yes, i admit, i was using a piece of paper) this isn't actually a bad model. i don't think it's quite as nice as the previous one, but it's not bad. it's different from the first model as well, which is good. too muich of the same can be a bad thing. finally, we come to the third model: leftovers now... i'll be honest. i don't really know what this is. it's not that good a model compared to the other two. that's all i can say, really. and of course, all the pieces fit into the tub. overall: i have to say, i do like this set, despite the weak third model. the strength of the primary and secondary models make up for any weaknesses in the third, and i can imagine the pieces being fully usuable in building other trains. while the basic idea of these tubs isn't quite as good as the x-pods with regards portability and general 'niceness' they aren't bad. and for a fairly cheap price (?3-4) as well. 4838 mini vehicles this is one of those set boxes that you see because of the ridiculously loud colours. sound marketing scheme if you ask me. i've managed it again. there are pieces outside the bag. or are there? now these i like *y* . 1 2 (i don't know what the clip is for, there isn't one on the other side) 3 4 5 this is the main model of the set, and again all the pieces are used bar these three, the spares. it's quite a nice model, although the car's a bit odd. still, i like the ramps, and the colour scheme reminds me just a little of g1 ultra magnus. hmm, i think that boom arm could do with refixing... 1 2 leftovers this is actually quite nice as well. it's that classic breakdown truck, and the boom arm itself is quite nice, with quite a bit of movement. another solid model. 1 leftovers i'm surprised by the amount of detail here actually. not only have tlc included a spare wheel at the back, but also what looks like a trailer hitch, which all adds to the 'realism.' another nice model to round out a nice set. and in the tub. overall: i'm not sure which of the two i like better. when i bought them, and on the way home, i much preferred the train set. but after building this set, i'm not sure. this is another good set from the year when tlc seems to be giving us so many. there are some good pieces in here too, and while there's nothing unique, they're still good. so, thanks for reading, hope it helped someone, and if there are any requests, i'll see what i can do. that's requests for pics, not songs ;-) . edited by whitefang, 23 may 2009 - 06:56 pm. indexed
you're welcome guys. ~vbbn~, on feb 19 2008, 11:24 pm, said: i like that orange lidded set, the truck. so nice. i won't get it though. :-d sorry, that just made me laugh. plural, on feb 20 2008, 12:25 am, said: i still miss x-pods though. :'-( yeah, so do i. they really were a neat idea. plural, on feb 20 2008, 12:25 am, said: do the kids still say nifty these days? *wacko* i do. but then, that's not very helpful, as i sit in english going through a book, listening to the class find archaic words, thinking "but, i still use those words." :-d
so here it is finally, my first ever review of a lego set..oh wait, it's actually 2 sets. so i don't really know how to do it right, but i'll try the best. (sorry if some pictures are a litte bit dark, but i'm not really into photography and i got bad light here) let's start with the dwarf's mine defender: theme: castle 2008 set name: dwarf's mine defender number: 7040 pieces: 86 price: ?9,99 (eur) first, as always, the box: the back, a few instructions on how the defender works, for those how don't know ;-) : and the instructions: we continue with the minifigs, sorry i forgot to make a closeup of the dwarf: and finally the mine defender itself, i personally think it isn't as bad as maybe some people think. the chain for the catapult is great i think: i kinda love those controls, the mechanism with the rubbe rband actually works pretty well, but only on a not-glossy underground. that's pretty much all of it, it's small but i like it a lot. so let's go on to the tower raid now, which would be my absolute favorite of those new sets. -------------------------------------- theme: castle 2008 set name: tower raid number: 7037 pieces: 364 price: ?29,99 (eur) again, first the box & instructions: we got 2 sets of instructios here, one for the tower and one for the siege tower: the minifigs, we got one archer and one soldier here, both with the torsos of the 2007 sets: now thw orc side, starting with the great leader, with the new armor and the golden helmet (i love those pieces!): closeup of the armor & helmet: then we got another orc-knight: and the prisoner, with handcuffs! the crownie tower looks great overall, though there is something i don't really like about it, but later on that. now the back, and that is what really bothers me, there areno walls on the first floor except the one with the wall-piece and the door, and theprison also is open at the back. the orc easily could jump out there: not sure what these are all about, they really don't add much to the set: enough rant now, let's go on with a pretty sweet detail, the golden crystal on the little table: the wall piece on the first floor you can ram in: and finally the very best thing of this set, the amazing orc siege tower! from the front: the great working ram, you can pull it back very far and it got pretty much power: here we got another sweet detail, the siege "platform" that moves out by pulling a cord in the back of the tower: finally a picture of a bit siege action: if you ram in the lower wallpiece, the brown shelfs of the prison-floor collapse and the prisoned orc is finally free! summary: likes: as i mentioned before, i really think that's the best ever produced siege tower, it's got so mich details and works extremely well, also the overall look of it is magnificant. the destroy-mechanism of the tower is pretty cool too, the brown door is a fine detail too. nothing much to say about the mine defender, i like this little set, and there's nothing really to bother about it. dislikes: the back of the tower. that's really the only thing that's a bit bad imo, they could have put there 2 more walls on the first floor and something to lock the prison easily. final thought: the tower raid for me personally is the best of the 2008 sets so far, it's got great playability and looks simply good. my opinion: buy it!
thank you for the nice review. pity the tower is not designed better, but i still want to buy these 2 sets. if only there were 2 dwarves in the dmdefender.
i got myself today 3 dwarf's mine defender and i have to say that sets does suck big time: the plastic rubber band doesn't do squat, and 3 wheels i really not enough. i only built 2 of those and changed the front of it with 4 wheels and no plastic rubber band and i changed the 2x2 dark bley plate. its still looks good but the crappy rubber band system is really not well thought off. anyhow my orc army is growing >:-) *yoda*
xwingyoda, on mar 1 2008, 06:32 am, said: its still looks good but the crappy rubber band system is really not well thought off. *yoda* i totally agreed with your comments. the rubber system is not effective at all. i bought 2 defenders recently and i found out that when the wheels move, the rubber just stuck there without rotating the blades at the front :-/ i have not really found a solution for mine yet. so far, i only took out the rubber band, placing the blades on the ground, removing of the red technic part on the left side. in this way, when the defender is moving on smooth ground, the blades will move too ;-)
thanks for the great review. *y* the siege tower does look great. i'll have to look out for these sets. edited by zouave, 14 march 2008 - 07:24 pm.
the rancor, on apr 22 2008, 05:54 am, said: i perfer using the batle wheel to knock down the tower's walls, not the seige tower i love all the siege machines the orcs have, they are certainly a much bigger threat than the skellies. batbrick away!
very nice. very nice, indeed. lots of lovely, little details, even at the back. this review hasn't changed my opinion one bit, i'm still looking forward to when i can finally pick up mine at the post office. i'm crossing my fingers that there will be more buildings following after this one. i'm guessing that lego's just testing the waters to see how far afol's are willing to go regarding price vs. details. green grocer is still epic, though.
*runs to lego store in bluewater...* m.
man, these sets are so awesome. incredible work done by the designers there, must have took a long time to get all this ogether. if they weren't too expensive i would go and buy them all 3 right away *wub*
like the set, this review also deserves a 10/10. i've ordered this set yesterday on s@h. seeing and reading this review, i'm convinced it will be worth the money. so, bonaparte is finally entering the city theme !!!
great review, great set. i can't mine until after easter. *weeps*.
wow,, thanks for the nice review! i have the other 2 sets and waiting for this to come to our shores. stupendous design and details! i really like the "hammer-rails" on the roof. cant wait!!! *wub*
o. m. g. i must have that set!! :'-) *y* *wub* i remember you telling me that you were going to do a review of this set, and i was so anxious! i love these reviews! thanks so much! great pictures. *wub* *y* *y* this will dent my wallet. 8-| i am so envious!
a very informative review, indeed. thank you so much for doing so. now i know that the price is worth every penny leaving my pocket. ;-) what do you guys think is tlc putting up as the next modular set? is it asking too much of tlc to produce 1 modular set each quarter (4 times a year)?
a million thanks for this review. this is greater than i thought. i especially like that clock. i'm going to get this set as soon as possible.
:-) amazing!!! great review!!! :-d u have totalyl convinced me to get this set! its so wonderful, filled with great details. what a waste, i can't order it in s@h because i am from singapore :'-( i hope it will come to my country, so i am able to buy it!!! :-)
i?ve got something, i want to share with you. a beautiful dream came true: #1: the box: top: back: the alternate model is also very well done. the pneumatics dump the bucket and open the flap (?). open: you can see a diagram how the pneumatics work. just a happy kid playing. the plastic inlays (?): all: #2: the parts: as you can see, 8854 offers a very large variety of different parts. loads of technic bricks, gears and even plates. also note the threaded axle 10, 5 large pulleys, a big turntable and the 1x20 rack. #3: building: the mechanism for the outriggers and the rotation of the turntable: the turntable: the pneumatics are finished: the mechanism for the telescope: the finished model: #4 random shots: you can see how the turntable will be rotated. thanks for reading- erm? viewing the pictures! please comment if you want to!
cp5670, on mar 10 2008, 05:53 am, said: the old tubes also grip the nozzles much more firmly and if you aren't careful when removing them, it's actually possible to rip off the nozzles completely. x-o i actually noticed that while taking it apart but didn't really pay any attention. i just thought that's because it's an old part. well, thanks for the information!
this was my first technic set, aged 7! still a great one in terms of function density, and a great b-model. in the uk i'm certain it was called the "salvage hoist".
thanks for reviewing all these old sets! will you be doing any more?
this set is really cool. i might actually get it!
ah a good old retro review. those old school days had some pretty impressive sets, with alot more complexity than modern sets. if you have it may i recommend 8880?
the only original stickers are the front headlight-patterns on the 2 red 1x2 bricks. the others have been destroyed - must have been the bad decaying sticker quality that breaks when you'll remove it - so i printed them. i didn't print the flag for only the alternate model needs it, although it's a neat idea...! and lordgalewind: clickey! i keep that in mind. one of my 8880 is already dusty enough!
i've seen a few cases like this where the box pictures are slightly different from the actual model. the airtech claw rig compressor is another one that comes to mind. the changes sometimes seem pointless and make you wonder why they bothered. :-p quote the only original stickers are the front headlight-patterns on the 2 red 1x2 bricks. the others have been destroyed - must have been the bad decaying sticker quality that breaks when you'll remove it - so i printed them. i didn't print the flag for only the alternate model needs it, although it's a neat idea...! the other stickers on mine have held up pretty well, although i didn't try to remove them after i put them on. the flag started to break after a year or so and just fell off its axle at one point. i taped over it and it's holding up well now, although it's a little frayed along one edge. this is actually the earliest set i've seen that uses this crappy sticker material (which is unfortunately very common today). even other technic sets had good stickers for many years after that.
bernddasbrot, on mar 10 2008, 05:56 pm, said: you've just motivated me to go on a "senseless-preliminary-design-errors-hunt"...! man..., this set is a disaster what were they thinking! :-d :-p i just remembered one other fun aspect of this set: the crane hook can be attached to the underside of the rear bumper, to hold it in position while driving along, but when things are like this and you try and wind up the cable the winch is strong enough to break the (original provided lego) rope.... it 'worked' with my copy. :-d so this set is capable of demolishing itself.... but still, one of the best technicsets i have, with all stickers intact. i'm not so sure about that flag though, must check on that.
reread your review today! great pictures! this is a fabulous model. got this model a few months ago for just € 25! it is small and has great working parts. i love the way the front-suspension is made! epic! i only had the light-stickers replaced with trans-clear bricks. btw: the gear rack has been used in this years 8048 buggy!
i read blackbirds technopedia page on this truck the other week, went onto ebay and picked up a misb copy for £25 gbp bargin, great to get old sets unopened, peeling the plastic off of the specialist parts was always cool! love the front suspension
somehow i also managed to get this set in very good condition (including box, instructions and all stickers) for a mere €22 a few months ago. this is indeed a very special set, and was a pleasure to build. the only flaw i noticed was weak support of the rear drivetrain, which was easily corrected with a few extra plates.
junkstylegio, on mar 23 2010, 11:17 pm, said: huh? like where? don't have that much problems with that rear train. (at least if i you don't trow the model down the stairs or something like that...) maybe it's unusual, but this section of the drive train didn't hold that well on my model: this is how it looks now: the parts made redundant were left in the built model, that's why there's that useless 8-tooth gear there :p
thanks for the great review vbbn! *y* i already own 2 of these x-d on your camera there should be a little flower sign, switch to that to go to micro mode ;-) it's a really good first review *y* *sweet*
holodoc: i agree with you. and the buety of being a custom parts maker is that i can recolor these... :-) *y* athos: sure, buddy. they have moving arms, legs, (a real mf!) the arms and legs are the same just flipped. :-) edited by ~vbbn~, 14 march 2008 - 01:12 am.

well, as bad a concept aliensvshumans is for a theme... i really do like this set. the human rover has nice parts for reuse, especially those oldschool space wheels. and despite those wobbly wings, i really like the alien ship. goes from a flying saucer-ish shape to a spread winged almost raven shape, very ominous and cool looking. now that 'alien commander' is terrible... if i don't buy bionicle minifigs already, why would i be interested in that thing? kinda wish they'd take the drones from the retiring exoforce theme and do them in green, they'd make nice alien robot things...
a great review for a great set. *sweet* i too own it and it's still in one piece. ;-) kliq, on mar 13 2008, 05:20 am, said: the only negative for me is the cockpit of the mining unit. not really because it isn't detailed, but because mine is top heavy, and keeps falling forward. it's kinda funny if you think about him driving along and then falling forward...but not funny at all when you're playing. |-/ may i suggest this mod?: http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=2848762
hi! this is my forth (old-school) technic set review! since blakbird pointed out that all my technic reviews are red, i chose a yellow dune blaster for today! just kidding. this set is red as it should be! (don't worry my next reviews will be yellow and black... uhhh forshadowing... ;-) ) i will start with some facts! 277 elements and released in 1994 that's enough. #1: the box: #2: the parts: #3: building instructions and catalogues: wow! no folds, no wear marks - simply: *wub* "was lesen coole kids?" - "klick! das super magazin fuer coole kids!" (how obvious...) #4: building: no differential. i really love the way the 1x8 technic bricks on the sides will be positioned later. fun fact: the engine contains no 2l-technic axle. ...and finished. a real quick build. #5: spare parts: ...for the alternate model. the yellow technic handle should be from 8412. maybe a bonus feature from the seller! #6: random shots: #7: final thoughts: this is my second 8829 and i also noticed that the engine turns very hard. the alternate model is really (sorry to all those of you who like it) crappy. i mean- a nice idea, but not with this wheels! :-| anyway: a really beautiful technic-set! *reminiscing* (this word exists, does it?) thanks for viewing the pictures, i hope you enjoyed it! please comment if you want to! edited by bernddasbrot, 21 march 2008 - 02:09 pm.
i don't own the 8296, but what i can see from the pictures, i would say that 8296 is very similar to 8829. the only things that are different ist that 8296 is studless and features a steering wheel for the seat. but 8829 has got bigger wheels... >:-) it also would have been nice, if the wheels from 8296 could have the same tread.
great set, great review, although the set looks better in yellow. :-d
blakbird, on mar 22 2008, 03:56 pm, said: imho, 8829 is much better than 8296. first, 8829 is a lot bigger. i really like the huge rear balloon tires. they both have rack and pinion steering, and they both have trailing arm rear suspension with a v-2 engine. i think the body on 8829 is a little more well done. for 8296, i think the alternate tractor model is much better. for more comparisons, see technicopedia. eric wow! 8-? thanks for that cool link, blakbird! x-d i agree that 8829's body is better. i especially like 8829's rear spoiler and its angled side beams. :-) -toa of justice
pictures of my restored set 8829 (i was almost 96% complete, and for missing parts i add of my own) the seat is black and not blue (as one was missing in my 8858) the spoiler is different, steering wheel added (not connected to wheels) and some additional items to make it look better) this is how i change the tire orientation the "new" rear spoiler: i still need to "clean" front rims edited by aow, 26 november 2015 - 12:32 pm.
what store did you find this at? x-o great review.
general tarful, please resize those pics. even with the new re-size feature, people are having a tough time reading your review because it takes time for the tool to work. check out the picture resize tutorial here and some other handy tutorials here. thanks.
hmm.... very interesting. thanks for the review, generaltarful. *y* both cars, although pretty wide, look still very sleek and fast. especially from the side. and solid, too.... but the front of the mach 5 without the stickers.... i don´t know. from some angles it looks good, and a little bad from some other.... 8-| sticker mayhem, again, but very useful parts nevertheless. btw, what was the price..? and, hinckley, do you have a brother or is this just the start of a new career? :-p
thanks for the review. *sweet* i love these sets... but buying them will depend on the australian price. just to be a nag, you really need to reduce the picture size. remember that whie the pictures are resized by the forum software, this is done browser side so it isn't as useful as it would seem. the full picture is still loaded, just the same as brickshelf. legofranks, on mar 23 2008, 10:49 am, said: i'm sorry, but your review has only served to further enlighten me that these sets are a pile of cack! absolutely lazy design and the only reason i'd get one is for the windscreen so i can build a proper landspeeder from star wars... m. i'm surprised you feel that way. i think these sets are great and i love how they are no where near as juniorised as i feared.
sinner, on mar 23 2008, 11:55 am, said: yes, i have a few of them. great pieces too! i don't think i've seen them in a set for years though. it's good to see them back. but... 32 stickers? that's more than any of the first wave of ef ever had! still, the set itself is very nice, with some nifty new pieces, and the minifigs are pretty cool too. i may not be familiar with speed racer, but i still may get this. i'll go and see the film as well, to fill in the background (of the set).
generaltarful, on mar 23 2008, 07:24 pm, said: you're welcome hinkley, it wasn't that time consuming. ;-) ... :-d you're actually responding to a quote from sinner. but don't worry, a lot of people mix us up... and thank you for resizing all of the pics! *sweet*
hinckley, on mar 23 2008, 08:36 pm, said: ... :-d you're actually responding to a quote from sinner. but don't worry, a lot of people mix us up... and thank you for resizing all of the pics! *sweet* oops, :-$ sorry, edited. also, you are most welcome hinkley. on another note heres a teaser pic of my next review, set 8159: general tarful edited by generaltarful, 24 march 2008 - 02:19 am.
i definately prefer 8159, in terms of minifigs, and useful parts colors to me :-$ but the cars are all the same basic design. thanks for the review. and i actually love the stickers. this means i won't have to rub off all the print, and if wanted, i can use stickers elsewhere :-$
as i said elsewhere i couldn't see this reviewed anywhere so here you are! to start with, a couple of box shots: the contents and the parts laid out: the instructions: this is what was left over from the build: and here's the kit complete. build time, about ten seconds if you pick your nose whilst you are doing it. :-d i love the little robot, it reminds me of that weird machine in the first wallace and gromit adventure, in fact, give it some skis and you are away. oh, and it has a metal detector thingy which i might have to borrow for a future episode of grunts (i'm not sure if i have any already...who knows...) cost - £2.49. value for money? erm, no, knock a quid off and i'd say yes. dr. s.
pencoin, on jun 3 2008, 12:50 pm, said: nice review the set doesnt seem as good as the crystal hawk and there colouring mistake with gun is just well bad and not the kind of thing i expect tlc to do something that stupid colouring mistake? do tell.
as i mentioned elsewhere, i couldn't see a review for this and though it's only small, let's strive for completion! here's the box: the contents: the parts: leftover bits: and the set: not much to it i know, and not much of a review, but there you go...quite a lot of stuff with the copper though. dr. s.
hi! this is my forth pre-old-school review. as promised: a yellow-set ! my 8862 arrived today, survived the washing machine coaster and actually was real fun to build! #1: information: this set contains 664 parts (only! i thought i’d be far more!) and was released in 1989 in the technic theme. be sure to visit technopediaif you want to know more! #2: building instructions: wow these instructions are used! i'm not used to this after all this sets with unread instruction booklets... the pneumatics page: the last step for the alternate model: #3: the parts: wow! look at all those technic beams, gears, pins...! (a few parts are missing in this photo!) #3: building: the left worm gear is for the outriggers, the right one for turning the “rear boom” the three 12l axles: left one: outriggers, middle one: steering, right one: erm… rear-boom-rotation. the two worm gears in the front part: left one: lifting the bucket, right one: dumping the bucket. the turning-mechanism for the “rear-boom” is finished. once again a toothed 10l axle. the boat weight 2x6x2 is hidden underneath the radiator grill. okay… many hoses and a nice, comfy seat have been added. now you can recognize the backhoes real shape. only with a little violence it’s possible to lift the bonnet (?) through the pneumatic pump. yeah, outriggers. same technique that the 8854 uses. the finished “boom / jib / scoop thing” (=bjst) :-| x-d the finished loader bucket. and to end the building process: the same picture from the introduction. (off-topic: “it is all part of the miracle of nature! - the circle of life!” #4: functionality: this time, i tried something new! i hope you can spot something - if not: technopedia! okay, here we go. #5: random shots: i’ve got way too many pictures this time, so i refer to my brickshelf folder. until it’s moderated you can follow the multilingual links! eins deux three quattro fem zes sédem osiem #6: final thoughts: definitely worth buying! as a child i thought it looks hideous - but today i’ve found out it’s totally fun to build and freaking functional. three things i want to mention though: the bjst can only be slewed (a new word!) if the outriggers are deployed. it is also possible that the bjst will reach the ground (danger of grinding or sticking) even if the outriggers are deployed. the two mechanisms for the loader bucket can actually interlock, and the 14 tooth gears might break / disentangle from the axle. thanks for viewing the pictures, i hope you enjoyed it! please comment if you want to!
ah, what a very fine classic set.... and all these lovely technic beams with studs! *wub* thank you very much for that excellent review, bernd, and you did a fantastic job with all these great pictures! :'-) *y*
thanks for your feedback! i like both, but i would say 8455 is far more than just a studless version! with 10 pneumatic cylinders and 2 pneumatic pumps it's a wonderful set for every pneumatic freak. unfortunately i don't own the 8455 - yet. ;-) sinner said: i hope you have more planned; any chance of a supercar one? i foreshadowed a black review a few days ago... guess which one... x-o x-d
a great review for a great set! it even had the old technic t-pieces and bevels, which i actually prefer to their modern counterparts. cp5670, on mar 24 2008, 08:14 am, said: the turntable on the back doesn't turn very well though, as the weight is all distributed on one side. the screw axle prevents it from popping off but there is still a lot of friction in it. i got mine for £20 in a second hand shop; it said complete, but one of the screw knuts was missing! x-o so it's practically impossible to keep the back arm on with only one |-/ and they're rather rare on bl too |-/
yesterday while building, i accidentaly dropped a axle nut. of course i'm working in a total mess and so it tool some time 'til i found it again. there are ~324 axle nuts on bricklink with an avg price of $0.89. i didn't know of this accessory-set: 5110-2... you can buy it for $40.00 8-?
slyowl, on mar 24 2008, 07:53 pm, said: thanks! *sweet* glad to see that i could help! cp5670 said: i guess you can try to make linear actuators out of them could you explain your thoughts please? you know: my english skills ;-)
by the way, don't forget to build the alternate model of 8862. it is a combine (farm equipment) which is just as good as 8274. i liked it so much that i bought two copies of this set so i could display both. my favorite alternate model (not counting universal sets) is the 8480 submarine. maybe it is time for a white set review? *skull* white is pretty rare. for your blue set, i recommend you review 8462. there are only a couple of green sets, and 8479 is the best. and then of course, 8458 is silver!! i think we all know what the best black set is. and according to your photography, you have lots of them! but don't forget 8868. eric
bernddasbrot, on mar 25 2008, 03:46 am, said: 15 seconds. wow, that's a long exposure. i would think you would get way too much light and overexpose the image. the aperture must have been tiny. quote i will review it too and post it in this topic! cool. i am also planning to write about the combine on technicopedia. combine quote actually i took it from your site! x-d i thought that word sounded familiar! quote unfortunately i don't own 8480 but i think 8824 is also a very good (though small) white set! 8462 rocks as a blue set. i just got it a few weeks ago. let's see... 8462 also is one of the last technic sets i would call old-school. 8479... okay too, but 8458 is imho not. 8868 and the totally mysteriously black set will follow...! you don't own 8480? that is unacceptable. it is imperative that you put a mortgage on your house immediately to get it! *sweet* yes, 8824 is a good white set. i also see from your room photos that you have the 8839 supply ship which has lots of white. this is a really nice set. 8462 is hard to call old school, but at least it uses regular beams. the air tanks are the best part of the set. i wish lego had used them more often, especially on the highly pneumatic sets. the tank makes all the difference on 8459. you are right, 8458 is certainly not old school, but it is a great set with wonderful suspension. it is of the same era as the super street sensation with all of the panels for body contouring. 8868 is technic at its best. there is nothing else like it, especially with the compressor. quote did you had something like this in mind if the toothed 10l axle rotates the axle nuts want to rotate too but they can't because of that 2x4 technic plate. so they'll decide to move along the axle. the 1x6 bricks on each end make sure that the axle won't move in or out. thanks for your feedback! while the assembly you have drawn would work as a linear actuator, i would not recommend it. the torsional stiffness and strength of an axle are proportional to the polar moment of inertia, a section property. most of the stiffness comes from the outside of the cross shaped axle. but in the threaded axle, you lose all the stiffness of the outer area because it is not continuous. this means you only get stiffness and strength from the small core. i think the threaded axle would bend and break very easily if subjected to much torque. eric
i saw ur pocket knife 20 :-d times yay do i win 8-| mm anyway great reveiw can't wait til these come to my stores. btw i don't know which one to get so could you reckomend me one? thanks and great reveiw! *y*
speed racer go! >:-)
thanks for the review general tarful! i only saw the knife 27 times :'-( i like this set, but i probably won't justify the price, the other set has orange ( *wub*) and the mach 5, as well as better fleshie head i reckon. to the batbrick cave! >:-)
generaltarful, on mar 25 2008, 01:43 pm, said: nope. :-p and thanks hollisbrick. they are both really similar so it really depends on which colors you use more in moc-ing, or which characters you like more. my personal choice is 8159 as it has cooler minifigs, except for racer x's recycled head :-|, and the colors are more useful to me. then again if you're like batbrick the only thing that matters is if a set has orange in it. :-p regards, general tarful thanks *y* probably will get this set although the orange..oh the orange peices 8-? haha anyway once again thanks for the reveiw, and meditate on the decision i will *yoda* x-d
thanks for the review. and for giving me directions :-p i think the design of these two cars looks to be better than in the other set. the drivers are positioned lower compared to the windscreen and the design of the front on th red car is really nice. i'm missing details of motors and cars this big could use a working steering mechanism.
a mighty fine review you've created slyowl! *y* after some sleep i shall immerse myself more fully within it.
a great and informative review with very fine pictures, thanks slyowl! *sweet* a wonderful set this is indeed, full of nice details and pretty playable, and a cool subtheme that offers a lot of fantasy and charming characters in a marvelous layout. i really love that little boat with the outrigger, and the neat buildings and sweet landscaping works together very well. tlc got sued for using some names of native sounding origin? now that sounds really strange to me.... such names´re widely spread within novels, movies and such stuff, i didn´t know that there´s some kind of copyright on them.... 8-|
good review, mr. slyowl! and good pics too! i know it probably deserves better but i only give him a 3. i'll be surely the only saying that i don't like this set but i remember i had it for christmas when i was a child and it disappointed me very much because i expected it much larger after seeing it in the lego catalogs. well it's just a little trauma i had :-p lol anyway i must admit it's an interesant set, specially because of the large number of mini-figures and accesories it brings with and the two little "ships" edited by bluebard, 31 march 2008 - 01:13 am.
excellent review of an outstanding set! i love the main image. i want this set so bad!
it's a great set and one i have yet to add to my collection despite my large number of islander extras. enchanted island, aside from having so alluring a name was good value for money in that you only needed this one set and you had a good representation of the islanders both in the size of the set and the number of minifigs. the flipping rope bridge and the river give it a great rainforest retreat sort of feeling and one is inclined to think of this set as more inland than directly coastal for me. whilst the islanders were never seen in the same light or popularity as pirates and imperials they were an obvious and colourful addition that to me added a whole new depth to the pirate system and one was now able to play a 3 or 4 way war adding a greater political element to the sets. enchanted island is probably the 3rd most appealing of the large land bases for me after port royal and eldorado fortress. good review and glad to see the set recognised!
great review! i think this set looks great. i really like the islanders and that statue is really nice. it comes with a lot of nice leaves and i like all of the secret compartments and the like. thanks for the nice review!
everytime i saw this at a toy store i always cried to my parents for one, but never got it, i got the smaller islander sets, but the more i see this now, i don't want it, i could buy it, but naahh, i am hoping lego does an updated version of the islanders with this new pirates line, one can hope right!! xd
eldiano, thank you for posting about your desire to have this set. i do own the set, and i do recommend it to others if they somehow find a used one. the bricks are kind of sparse, but the the bricks it does come with are really nice, i love the figs, and the base plates are by far my favorite made by tlg. captain braunsfeld, i suggest that you read through the link that covers topic bumping more clearly. i apologize for the confusion eldiano. i do believe that i have found a way to remove the confusion of posting in old topics soon among the pirate staff and to the other members of eb, please stay tuned. sinner, on 18 july 2010 - 03:16 am, said: 3. lego reviews don't date. thus if you have something relevant to say then feel free to post in a topic, but if it's more than a few months old please make sure it's good.... and if it's been a few years it better be really good! for example, if you liked the review or set and want to say so you probably shouldn't. if you've got an answer to a question (such as "does anyone have pictures of the alternate model?) then by all means post! what you shouldn't do is ask questions to the original poster; he/she may not even visit eb any more.
here is a preview of my review of speed racer: grand prix race i will try to get a full review up later today pics (when public) sorry about the blur, i am not a great photographer. also if, there are any pictures you would like (that i haven't included), just ask
judging from your pictures there seems to be many interesting torsos and new fleshy heads but i don't think this set is for me. fueling my dismissal of this set is that i saw the trailer for this film at the cinema today and it looked pretty terrible! :-x thanks for taking your time to review this set though ricecracker! ;-) edited by casewindu, 29 march 2008 - 10:18 pm.
how comes the monkey stays yellow but not the people... :'-(
i will most likely get all the speed racer sets as it was one of my favorite movies(the animated one) i just loved the decked up and tricked out cars >:-) great review and red tux = x-d
again, no problem! personally i would have liked a lower price ($96.04 cad with tax *n* ) also my favourite would be the gray and black car!
well...... thanks for your posting, but i couldn´t care less about fleshie minifigs or movie-accurate cars - or the cars at all. this set would really only go into my parts bin. therefore i need to know what parts are in there and if they are "cool" enough to go into an exo-force collectors parts bin.
an opportunity has come up to buy this set for 100 aud. just wondering whether people think it's worth buying? i've heard very little about the speed racer legos
simonwillems, on apr 7 2008, 12:01 am, said: somehow i competely missed your review when you first made it, i saw your pics on brickshelf and wondered about the review... you have managed to review my all time favourite technic set! yeah, somehow i wonderd why only vbbn (thanks!) responded... but i learned from *yoda*s sig: "patience !! for a jedi it is time to eat as well !! eat, eat !! hot !! good food !!" :-d simonwillems said: it was the first large technic set i was given by my parents, when it first came out in 1995. i played for hours with this set, making minifig seats in it (it was so huge there was room for four minifigs to sit next to eachother in front....) i made various applications for it, a bungee-jump system with a large rubber band, and lots of containers to be lifted. the first changes i made included the inverting of the wheels and the disabling of one of the flashlight-steering wheels because they obstructed eachother. by the way, the nob for your winch is yellow instead of black (i know this set by heart, so watch out :-p ). i always liked those nobs. and people think you can't play / moc with technic (at all)...! x-d about the nob: erm yeah. i only found 3 black ones in the box and so i took the yellow one that i got as an extra with 8829. simonwillems said: the alternate model was great fun too, the pump is cleverly hidden and the crane folds up great between the cab and the loading platform. you could easily mod it with a pneumatic claw on the crane, a motor to turn it and a compressor. the only flaw was the loading platform which had no floor (only some axles). another reason for the 8460 as favorite set? it's got a "real" alternate model, not just a different erm- crane. simonwillems said: thanks so much for reviving my memorie concerning this great set! you're welcome, i consider this as my job! ;-) cp5670 said: ...but i keep all of them. there was actually a time when the boxes used to be even stronger. i have an old 8859 set and the outer box is made of a hard, styrofoam material, although they probably stopped using that for environmental reasons. that's the spirit! i got more than hundred boxes... and my 8848 box came with styrofoam too!
great review! while i admit i wasn't into technic at the time this came out (i was a mere child, give me a break! :-d), i can see now why it was featured so much. from the booklets to display stands at toy stores and at my local lego center (when it was still around), this thing was everywhere! with your review, i can now truly appreciate all the details of the set. i got to admit, i can see the appeal now! that comparison shot you took is amazing. i love not only just how it included the little details such as the stabilizers, but also looks incredibly fun to play around with. great set and an even greater review!
thanks guys! @ sinner: i hope you refered to 8285 so my answer will match: 8285 is interesting: main model: american styled truck, alternate model: european styled truck. i don't think tlg produced many european styled truck. edit: i just found a wonderful moc-alternate on brickshelf: 8436 by industrialdesigner. if i got him right, he designed a few offical technic sets for tlg. @ all: promises, promises, promises... hm. and again it's ebay that's blocking me. i want to foreshadow my next review (although it'll take some time to make it): i know, you know. but please act inconspicuous until you'll can act very astonished...! edited by bernddasbrot, 09 april 2008 - 03:25 pm.
set ref: 7624 name: jungle duel number of minifigs: 3 number of pieces: 78 price: 11,90€ it’s the smaller set from the last indy movie, “the kingdom of the crystal skull”. here we go! a general view of the set: we have a tent, some food ( a chicken leg is always welcome!), a fireplace, the things with all the swords, a bench with a broken table, 3 ants, a map (printed tile) and other accessories. don’t make that girl hungry or... yyyyaaaaaaaahhhhhhh! ho no! our diner, a giant ant, has gone away! those giant ants are made in a smooth plastic, in dark red and trans black colour: and here a closer view on the two new hairpieces: the new girl hairpiece is really cute, and i’m a bit disappointed by the new man hairpiece…those hair lake some volume… but i’m really happy to see that tlc has made some new moulds for hairpieces! it’s the good part of the theatre lines! so, it’s a really interesting set because you’ve got a lot of useful pieces for a city mocers, with the two new hairpieces without spending a lot of money! edited by imperialshadows, 01 june 2008 - 11:59 am. updated stats/title
erdbeereis1, on apr 15 2008, 11:25 pm, said: actually they are ants. spiders have 8 legs while ants have only 6 like these. the two thing that look like legs in the front are the antennae. back on topic, i think this set looks great and i can't wait until i can get my hands on it and the other new ij sets. they must be ants, but i'm pretty convinced that what you think are the antennae, are the ants mandibles. a neat little set. front
i have no idea why they dont use that female hair piece on trixie in speed racer. it would be perfect! greta review!
front, on apr 16 2008, 10:15 am, said: they must be ants, but i'm pretty convinced that what you think are the antennae, are the ants mandibles. or not. there are six legs, 2 antennae, and 2 mandible. and they most definately are ants, to those still in doubt. thanks for this great review, alex, this is most definately (well, in my opinion anyway) the best set. lets face it, in motorcycle chase you really only got 2 bikes and 2 crates as the big parts of the set. in this one, which is the same price, you get those ants, a neat tent (hurray!), a [b]printed[/i] map, a chicken leg, a castle sword, ef sword, and pirates sword, a dagger (now in light bley) and a silver frying pan. this set is packed with useful pieces, i'm definately getting this one. and i for one love mutt's hair piece. i sense my sig-fig will soon have a new hair style. thanks again alex for the sweet review! ~peace edited by iamded, 16 april 2008 - 05:07 am.
great review; i will definitely get this, if not only for the hair but the ants, melee weapons, and new faces and torsos!
thanks for that great review! this is a very interesting set filled with nice parts for customisation. somemore, the price is not that steep. i will need to get ready for the second wave!
joey lock, on apr 15 2008, 09:50 pm, said: i swear it is supposed to have stickers on the side of the car, boat, oil canister and windscreen? i expect it does, but alex54 has left them off it, like i do.
wow, this is a fantastic set, i love the dark green croc and other features. marion is good to have again and i love her new torso, and those commies look great as well. thanks for the review alex54. batbrick away!
what are those bricks with the guns attached supposed to be? great review and set btw...
sweet review again, alex! great pictures, i loved the little comic with the croc. you're quite right here too: alex54, on apr 16 2008, 09:17 am, said: yes you can use all those military things without creating an army in a layout: just put the violent parts out, and you’ve got nice things, like a biologist car in the case of the amphibious vehicle! without the gun, that vehicle is a nice little amphibious car with a tent (i assume) strapped to it, some tools, a spare tire... the little tree hut is quite cool, and a nice touch with the box in behind there. i love the design for those gasoline cans too. thanks again, alex! you're lucky to be getting these sets! ~peace
thanks for the review! i really like this little-ish set, quite alot of detail, it reminds me of sets from the late 90's more soviets are always welcome too, and the new torso for marion is nice, as is the new dark green alligator all of the neat little accesories are great too, a cup, shovel, binoculars and of course the cans of gasoline again, thanks for the review, alex
merci beaucoup for the great review alex !! where did you get the sets ? that set is called river chase this is a great set !! i love the amphibious vehicle with all the darj green part !! i agree with you that the the dark green croc is fantastic !! i'm also happy to have a dark bley zodiac and a new marion torso. that "tree hut" is a fun feature where the playability doesn't screw the design !! i really love the commies !! its fun how lego reuses those fleshie heads and i really don't mind at all. so its evil for evil since one of the commie has the zazi face i also love the ptrol cans !! ingenious !! i still have rants on that set: * why oh why another similar indy !! arghhh i can't stand it !! * why oh why the same marion head !! can't wait to have those sets !!
good
darthperson8, on apr 15 2008, 07:12 pm, said: what are those bricks with the guns attached supposed to be? great review and set btw... some people have obliquely mentioned this in their responses to the set/review, but to specifically answer your question, it's supposed to be a jerrycan, a.k.a. a gasoline (petrol) container...
im glad they change the torso form the prototype
set ref: 7626 name: jungle cutter number of minifigs: 4 number of pieces: unknown price: 39,99€ a general view of the set: we’ve got 5 giant ants, two russian soldiers, a general, indy of course, 3 trees, a small entrance of a cave, and the debroussaillor vehicle (i don’t know the english name of it…). you can’t enter into the cave, because there is a spider web with its spider…unless… unless you know how the mechanism works and the spider web go up… and reveals a case with diamonds and accessories. a closer view on the mechanism (which is simple but works well), and you can also see the difference, or maybe the same, size of a spider and a giant ant! and i’ve always thought that those spiders were very big compared to the minifigs! so those ants are really giant! poor small frog! the three trees with the entrance make a nice jungle layout! don’t speak too loud, you will wake up the soldier… don’t worry for him, he will be waken up by the vehicle before being eaten by those giant ants! a front view, making the vehicle really menacing! a back view: push the red part from the back and there are two parts that fall down from the vehicle. i don’t know why… the movie will clarify this i think… and here you can see how the two big circular blades turn when you push the vehicle… simple but effective! run indy, run! this set is really nice. the playability of the different elements is great, the colour scheme is nice too (i like those dark green tree parts!). the vehicle is really impressive without being too big and its very well details! in general the designers of the indy sets have made a really nice works, with a lot of efforts in all those details everywhere! i’ve got some project for this set, to integrate it in my city... i’m a city mocer, and not an indy fan. so i don’t have bought the temple, the bigger set of the series, because it has nothing special for me in term of part selections or in the design, in relation with the town theme, and because my supermarket doesn’t have it yet! so, we are waiting for a member to review it and make the part 4…
great review, thanks for that. i love almost everything about this set. the ants, commies, general (can we please get a shot of his face?), dark green, treads, foliage and other creatures. great stuff, i'll have to get it on sale though. batbrick away!
this is a great set!!!!!! it is probably my favourite indy so so far! great reveiw! although the set is great the price is greater have to get it on sale..
wow in the protype pics i kept thinking this thing looked lame; a boat on treads with saw blades? but this is definetly something i want now. lots of great plant and animal parts. and looks like plenty of wheels with those treads; its just begging to be made into a propor tank.
thanks for the review alex i agree that this is the best set of kotcs sets (although the airplane comes quite close..). although i'm not too fond of the trees, the cave is good, and the jungle cutter is brilliant. plenty of great features, and very detailed, with much of the engine showing and a decent cockpit (if that's the right word..). the general and the two soviets are great too (could we have a close-up pic of them please? ), good to see that neither torso has exposed fleshy skin like the nazis. as said though, it is quite a pricy set, i was expecting it to be just over the price of race for the stolen treasure. great set, thanks again, alex!
xwingyoda, on apr 16 2008, 05:37 am, said: great review again alex !! same question (in case you didn't se it in my reply to the other set): where did you get those new sets ?? i really love that set !! its called jungle cutter the trees are really cool and make a great adition to it imo. that temple entrance or monument is really cool !! those bionicle parts do make fantastic vegetation !! you mean the spiny dk. green things that hang from the holes around the secret entrance? they were in the indy: temple escape. i totally forgot about that green frog !! thats cool , those are so cute !! 5 more ants is great !! the vehicle look really sharp (ah ah ah). 2 more commies yeay !! that officer is really freaky actually !! could have been a high rank under pol pot's regime in the s21... yeay looks more asian than russian imo yeah, tlc's really cranking out the new molds for both food and wildlife! so let's see... if i get all five sets... i get... 11 russians! and six are basic soldiers, although two are duplicates and triplicates. yes, that officer definitely has an italian look to him; those cheekbones are a little too high. now its time for my gripes: * same bloody rant about indy !! * i haven't read the instructions before but once again there are so many parts in crap colours that need to be changed look at all the crap red and yellow in there !! i will need to look for those parts before buying the set like i always do !! mod while building on !! same rant! any chance we could see the rpg? i am really soimpressed with that indy line !! i sincerely hope it will have a long and healthy life !! agreed! responses to the yodameister's review of alex54's review of the jungle cutter are in red. now to my opinion: great review! more reviews on!

looks great
great classic dragon den! i love the old green dragons very much! there were my fave. i love these theme very much after the black knights era. this is a very very good set! i wished i can have this too.
this was the last castle set i got before my dark age.. really liked it although the big rock parts looked really bad ( i am kind of used to them now) unfortunately i lost the little wand.. and i never understood who is "good" and who is "bad" does the wizard own the dragon? well they dont seem to be enemies but isnt the dragon supposed to be evil??
i own this set and i think its a great for a smaller fortress building. there is a good selection of mini figs, the burps do detract somewhat from the set, but they do make it feel as if its in a large cave. the cloth flags that are included are really nice and mine have lasted a long time.
i saw this set at my tru for only $20.00. now i might go get it! thanks sinner for another nice review! quote hoped to find a figure the right size for it, but none of mine would fit. well, just sit your booty down and ride it wourself... ... okay, well, maybe if you have a bionicle lying around or a halo figure.
a very good review, thanks, sinner. that´s really a pretty cool model, very detailed with useful parts too.... hmm, perhaps that one´s gonna get the first technic set i´ll buy, beside that 4481 hailfire droid.... um, thank you, sinner....

thanks for the review! i bought this set when it first came out and it is still in the box. it is stuck in my fairly lengthly backlog but after seeing your review, i'll have to put it to the top of the queue.
thanks for the review! i think i am going to get this set for it's many technic pieces. i could really use those for a rig i'm going to build.
sinner, on apr 22 2008, 08:49 pm, said: i didn't know you liked technic. i look forward to seeing this rig. well, it's mostly from the "mindstorms" robotics side.... honestly, if i bought this, it would be my first technic set ever
set: 7627 - indiana jones - temple of the crystal skull pieces: 929 price: $aud149.99 out of all the indy 4 sets, this one seems to cop the most flak - which may account for the fact that the other 3 were reviewed weeks ago and this one has sat, unloved and alone, waiting for someone to turn their eye upon it (or, y'know, buy it). luckily i'm a sucker for spooky old temples, filled with devilish traps and hidden treasures, hissing fountains and overgrown foliage, creepy skeletons and crumbling stonework, so here it is: indiana jones 7627, temple of the crystal skull. part 1: the figs first off, the figs - 6 humans and 4 skellies (or should that be skullies? ) indy, mutt, irina, and that sneery russian guy that's in the 2 smaller sets. nothing new here. aha! what have we here - two natives. i wonder if hair is a sign of power in this culture, since one guy is completely bald and the other one has the most extraordinarily luxurious black mullet. somehow i doubt the movie will answer this question. back view - as you can see, the scalp tattoos are also popular in this tribe. fashion conscious! (note in the background the paws of the fearsome black jungle panther, ie my cat, curious as to see what the tribe was up to.) also, don't ask me why these guys are carrying axes rather than, say, spears. and what everyone's been waiting for, the skullies - three of 'em and a conquistador skellie - very cute. note the backs of the crystal head have a plume-sized hole - or maybe that's just where they injected the blue brain-plastic. spooky! i love these skulls, i wasn't sold from the initial pics but they have a very creepy smile and the head shape is just... weird. with the large eyes, it's kind of homer simpson-esque. and here we have the token vehicle in the set - a weird little tank thing with treads. kind of looks like a cross between the amphibious boat and a mini-tank. i'm sure there's a military expert around here who can tell us exactly what it is supposed to be. the treads are nice, but the rest of it is a bit thrown together. you can tell they wanted to keep the dark green colour scheme but the budget only allowed them 5 parts to do so . all in all, a mixed bag with the figs. 4 repeats from the cheaper sets which means we have one new native figure and the crystal skullies. there are heaps of the old-skool skele heads scattered around the sets so those that prefer can replace the skullies with ordinary skellies. bizarrely, the top of the box which has the line of 1:1 figs pic (you know what i mean) doesn't have names for any of the characters, whereas all the smaller sets do. part 2: box, parts front of box: back of box: two instruction books: parts. this set has come under criticism for being overpriced - myself included - but the official piece count is 900 plus, which is pretty good considering it also contains the baseplate. 6 big bags and 2 of those 12x12 bricks in dark tan. (note: set does not contain live black jungle panther™) the dss, helpfully comes pre-scrunched thanks to tlc. even in a $aud150 set they can't get that right... sigh. the dark tan baseplate. say what you like, i'm in love. i know some people don't like these, but they were such a staple of castle/ pirates for so many years that i don't consider them a juniorised piece at all. this one, recycled from the 05 police hq and 06 hospital, is much better in design than the king leo's castle one as the different heights and asymmetry make it look much more like a natural piece of ground. perfect for mocs. and it's dark tan - how could anyone not love such a huge slab of dark tan? note this love doesn't extend to applying the stonework stickers which are, frankly, crap. random instructions page: part 3: temple of doom - or just a doomed temple? the complete set, front view. isometricish view: back view: top view: first impressions? it's very dark tan, isn't it? and green. and bright green. and dark green. and dark red. and normal tan. and dark bley. and pearl gold! in fact, it's a bit of a mish-mash of colours. i'm of two minds about this. i kind of prefer the palette to be a bit subtler, but i can see that a playset designed for kids isn't going to sell bucketloads all tastefully done in shades of tan with lashings of dark-green foliage. there's a huge amount of dark red in this set, which is always a welcome colour, but i'm not convinced it quite works with the 2 shades of tan on offer here. on the plus side, there's also a huge amount of dark tan in ordinary 2x2 bricks, tiles, plates and 1x1 and 1x2x3 slopes, which is great for anyone wanting to stock up. let's take a closer look. i'll do this roughly in order of the build itself: a) the big scary face. this is a simple, fun build and very effective at projecting menace at the temple entrance. it actually detaches very easily from the temple (as pictured on the box art) to allow easier access to the inside. the eyes are flick-fire missiles, with scary face's hair conveniently providing ammo refills should you run out. all in all, from me. (b) the back spin the skelly head and stone steps appear - we haven't seen this feature in a while. nice to get these pieces in dark bley. a conquistador hides under the stairs - this is a bit useless as the stairs can't fully extend while he's there . moving right... a trapdoor - what could possibly be behind it??!!??!!? answer: not much, really. a little red stair. i really like these 2 stickers though - very intricate. the staircase leads to what i like to think of as the crystal skull transmogrification chamber. now, i know nothing about the movie except that it's supposed to be have a kind of 50s b-movie plot rumoured to feature (look away, spoiler-haters)..... aliens. these weird, creepy gold chairs look made from the bones of aliens if you ask me, with their strange vertebrae and silver claws. it wouldn't surprise me if bringing these aliens back to life was part of the plot of the movie... hence the crystal skull? i guess we'll find out may 22. in any case, transforming aliens clearly like a disco whirl as when you pull the handle, the whole of this assembly spins giddily around. a very clever and simple trick - it's basically just a wheel under the platform but the effect is great. also under here is a bottomless pit (stickered)... i would very much expect a villian to be thrown down it at some point. "so, do you come here often?" "i don't know who designed this club. these chairs are really uncomfortable." nb. i am really, really over those pearl gold 1x2 roof corner slopes which started popping up in the 2006 castle range, infected exo-force and have now spread here. can we please have these in a different colour? or a different pearl gold piece? pretty please? ( c) left tower (looking from the front) a small tower with a trans clear gem. (d) right tower waterfall with booby trap. i like the sticker, it's very cartoony, which fits with the set somehow. when you turn the wheel, flick fire missiles spray out and hit whoever is on the stairs. both towers have a trap where if you move the skull, another one pops out from the dragon mouth. (e) central turret thing this thing is kind of annoying and doesn't really sit or work well. it's kind of like a laser beam sending messages to space, i guess. as the central dome rises, the two plates peel away. i find it is a little bit tight to work smoothly and the two plates doesn't really sit well together at the top. maybe i just need to rebuild it. i'm sure this will also be explained in the movie. (f) final trap - the stair that isn't there the final trap is at the front - as indy goes down the staircase, you can push the red heads and all the 1x8 bley bricks come tumbling down. simple and works well. (g) alternate view here's how it looks as pictured on the box with the head removed. as you can see, this allows better access to the centre of the temple. as you can see, sadly there is nothing actually interesting there except a staircase to the turret and 2 dark tan slopes which are just stuck there and look a little out of place. i mean, come on, everything else has a splash of dark red and gold! your destination: nowhere! part 4: in conclusion so after all those endless pics, what about the set itself? cons:as a playset, 7627 doesn't quite make sense. admittedly, the traps that are there are well-designed and unobtrusive. on the other hand, there's a great big whopping entrance at the front - but i wasn't sure if the figs are supposed to sneak in through the backdoor and go up the spiral staircase and past the waterfall (as shown in the box art) or if they were meant to end up in the golden skull room. the middle area doesn't really connect with anything, nor does the giant space turret. it may be that some of these questions are answered in the film, but whereas with 7624, 7625 and 7626 i could at least picture a story myself (eg with river chase is fairly obvious what's happening - a chase down a river with a croc and a communist staking them out)!, the temple set is a little all over the place. the design feels a little off to me - not really bad but not really great either. pros: on the plus side, the natives and crystal skulls themselves are great. at 900+ pieces, this is also a great parts pack for dark tan, dark red, plant pieces, gold oddments etc. i especially love the baseplate in that shade. i like the overall shape of the temple - a big staircase with secret nooks and crannies. the build is reasonably interesting and there are some clever tricks with the traps. but upon reflection i shouldn't have to sell this set - it should be able to sell itself! as i said before, i'm a huge fan of dark, mysterious old temples so for that i have to give it some love. it reminds me of the big old adventurers sets and the whiff of nostalgia is itself a powerful intoxicant. however, for the price lego is selling it in australia/ europe/ canada i couldn't recommend it as a must-buy for full price when the smaller sets in this series are themselves so good. review done - woo! edited by imperialshadows, 01 june 2008 - 11:59 am.

the figs look great! the natives and the skeleton conquistador are my favorite figures in the set. the set itself is very good. the interior sort of reminds me of an older style lego set for some reason. it could be just me, but it has a classic feel. this will a great set to add to my list! great review!

looks great! i cant't wait until i can get my hands on this and the other new ij sets. this is turning out to be a really good theme! i'm really liking the crystal skulls and i also think the baseplate looks very nice. those natives look fantastic in my opinion. thanks for the great review! edited by erdbeereis1, 01 may 2008 - 02:53 am.

brilliant review, and great pics. thanks. hmmmmm i would actually like one of these now, where before i was unsure.
thanks for the great review, svelte_corps. i've been wanting to see this set in detail since it debuted at the conventions. i have to say that, on the one hand, i agree that the minifigures, the crystal skulls, and the colors are great (i even like the waterfall), but, on the other, i kind of think that the set itself is a disappointment. it looks like they tried to accommodate design and playability needs, but really didn't come through on either. so, as you pointed out, the mid section doesn't really fit in with the other parts, and the trap sequence doesn't really flow, either. but, perhaps your right, and all will be answered in the film. i was surprised at just how empty the temple looked in the photo taken from above. they really should have gone the extra mile and made the temple look more like a temple, and not worry so much about the action features. eh, but so it goes. but, i, too, am a sucker for tombs and temples, so i won't be able to pass it up. archaeology on!
damn, you've convinced me to get it now, thanks for the review, tan is my favourite colour in lego! batbrick away!
thanks svelte_corps for the great review, if it's out in aussie then it should hopefully be reaching nz soon. i can't wait! this looks like a great set, for me at least. i too am a great fan of spooky old temples, they are such fun. i love the look of the base plate, but the stickers don't look all that great. i wish they printed it like they always used too. i have to get this set. and the other ones too. thanks again, you have brightened this sad day.
outstanding review! your efforts have totally convinced me to get this set no matter what! it really looks very great and funz reading that review. i will be looking forward to the new addition of those mini-figs. just love the layout of this temple. a great addition indeed
i was going to review this on monday but my camera ran out of batteries! anyways, great review! as i have the set built, it's a really fantastic set. the waterfall is a reall cool sticker, and the flick fire missiles are quite interesting. another point of interest: there are seven of the new flick fire missiles overall, if anyone cares.
nice big set ! thanks for the review. the skellies seem to me as the only really big plus of the whole lot. i agree on the homer simpsons' paternity to them...
great~!! your cat is soooooo cute~

the architecture/aesthetic design looks like a twelve year old's modification of the real set. the parts look good though. steve
i brought this set a few days ago and agree with everything you say. i would have never noticed that the boat sticker is the set number unless you pointed it out. glad to see that one set of fuel can stickers was extra, i spent ages looking for a place to put them. cool review btw
very good for a first review! i bought this set and jungle duel at target the other day (i was going to wait and buy them when i go to downtown disney this summer, but how could i pass up saving four bucks that i can spend on store-exclusives? ) and i have to say i absolutely love them. the amphibious vehicle (don't they call it a duck in the movie?) is definitely my favorite lego vehicle i've ever built. everything about it is wonderful- the size, the colour scheme, and it's accurate to the one in the movie. and irina spalko's hair is to die for. on a side note, i don't get why they made marion's arms white in the set. the shirt underneath her vest in the movie is obviously blue. i switched the arms out for light blue ones and it looks a lot better, and it makes marion's eyes look great. -ryan
an extremely thorough review - you definitely do this set justice. looks like a fairly interesting set, and that comes from someone who isn't particularly a fan of lego indiana jones. tom
thank you for the nice review metalandi, and thank you for the nice story and selfpromotion simon willems. the racewaytracks were always nice dioramas in the catalogues of the eighties.

hello all, i don't believe there has been a review of this set yet, so i wanted to take this opportunity. up for review today is 8160 cruncher block and racer x as part of batbrick and iamded reviews: here is the box, i have to say i love the art on it. it's very colourful and makes the truck look a lot less crap than it does on the box. plus, you have to love the "missile launching action" bit right, am i right? why are you all staring at me? and here is the back. pretty generic, but shows some nice details and so forth. oh dear! in turning around the box have i killed myself and iamded!? okey dokey, up first is the best part of the entire set: the minifigs! racer x is wonderful, though coming with a boring bruce wayne face. but it is cruncher block, his lady driver taejo that really shine. look at those awesome suits! the cool faces! taejo has a ripped shirt! now up is the first building part of the set, with me and iamded looking rather slick in x's car. while i'm not a big fan of yellow, it is very nice, and slopes in an underused colour is better than no slopes at all: front view, the new windshields are fantastic: while a very cool car, it is rather silly of tlc to give us the exact same one we got in the smaller set. i didn't get the smaller set with this car, so i'm still happy, but it is a bad marketing move: sorry iamded, i know it's your birthday, but......vroom! now for the second part of the build and my favourite, the front of the truck: annoyingly enough, this part opens up to shoot a pointless rubber projectile: to do this, you open the roof (a nice detail btw) and pull back the mechanism, here: thus blowing the front part open and launching it.....well, not far really the wheels and covers are pretty cool, and the front is nicely designed, the red looks good and the rear vision mirrors are a great touch. and now for the most disappointing part - step three, the trailer: (note - clicky joint piece not part of set, just used to hold it up!) that's right, almost the entire thing is open, even the "filled in" side has holes! i'd certainly be cared to be back there, one bumpy hill and back you go! i didn't put the lame computer stickers on, and the control area is pretty lame in general. not to mention taejo (who is depicted on the boxart as standing at the desk, would most likely just be sucked out the back at those speeds! there are some pluses too though, like the ridiculously awesome minifig paintings i'll be using for wayne manor. also note the "control" on cruncher's desk that when turned, turns the gun at the bottom. it's an alright feature: here is an example, i've shot iamded on his birthday. what? it's a love ray! haven't you seen the care bears? and though i'm not a massive fan of stickers, this is just too cool. the little aquarium is very simple but very clever, using a printed piece between two clear windows to create the illusion of a tank: it looks much better in real life, trust me, and here is a side view to better explain: now, to connect the two is a good thing, i like the way a simple technic piece assumes the job. oh, and behold my hand! the completed truck, which, while a mixed bag, still doesn't look too bad (i guess): now the completed set, which, despite its unbelievable large flaws, still looks cool. (warning, the kickass iamded and batbrick figures do not come with this set): more pics here: http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=3147324 all in all: minifigs: 5/5 - racer x is beautiful, cruncher block and the driver too, and taejo has a ripped shirt, damn! design: 2/5 - pretty poor considering the best part is available in a cheaper set, and only the front part of the truck looks cool, but still not truly awful. build: 3/5 - despite having a bad trailer, it was a fun build and sometimes you need something that doesn't take ages to make. price: 2/5 - overpriced easily, but rogue shadow is worse! fun: 3/5 - the mere concept of such an open truck kept me playing with this baby for hours! total: 15/25, not as bad as it would seem. overall i'm really glad i bought it as the minifigs are fantastic and the paintings and fish tank are cool. it's fun, stupid and downright ridiculous, but while not a great set by any means, certainly isn't as bad in the brick as it looks in photos. until next time, batbrick away! edited by batbrick, 13 june 2008 - 12:20 pm.
awesome review batbrick! i don't see any appeal at all really in this set, but that's okay, as i want to stick to castle anyway. the car is the best part imo, which you can get in a different set with another cool car and for a cheaper price. but the main downfall to this set is the fact that the truck's trailer is half blown up and the survivors are magically staying inside and not being sucked right out of there, as you have mentioned. i would have thought tlc would at least included some sort of cover that you could take on and off easily (kind of like the modular buildings). having said all that though, the front of the truck does look incredibly cool, and those minifigs are sweet. too bad they all have flesh tone printed on them. so, while this may not be my set of choice, i can see the appeal... well, really i can't, but it's just my opinion! i'm sure there are plenty others who would love to scoop this set up. ~peace
warning! this reply may contain several minor movie spoilers. if you haven't yet seen the movie and want it to be a complete surprise, do not read. batbrick, on may 10 2008, 06:05 am, said: but it is cruncher block, his lady driver taejo that really shine. look at those awesome suits! the cool faces! taejo has a ripped shirt! i was originally skepitcal about the driver figure—i like the head, but i was trying to figure out why they put in a female minifig with no hairpiece. after having seen the movie, i now understand why; cruncher's driver is a fairly manly looking woman, and most of the lego hairpeices would make the minifig look too girly for the character. :) now that i know why taejo's shirt is ripped up i don't mind the bits of fleshie color that are printed on it, but i do wish they would make some of the new torsos a little more head-colour agnostic...there's no real reason why cruncher and his driver couldn't have had ties that came all the way up to their necks instead of having those little wedges of flesh showing through loose collars. yeah, they are low-level mafioso type scum, but they aren't complete slobs. batbrick, on may 10 2008, 06:05 am, said: front view, the new windshields are fantastic: they are indeed very nice, it's the main reason i started looking at the speed racer sets in the first place. batbrick, on may 10 2008, 06:05 am, said: while a very cool car, it is rather silly of tlc to give us the exact same one we got in the smaller set. i didn't get the smaller set with this car, so i'm still happy, but it is a bad marketing move: i think the error they made was in the smaller set though. in the movie, the only time we see cruncher's semi is when he's being chased by racer x. racer x and taejo do end up on the same team for a cross country rally race (along with speed of course), so i guess that's where they were going by putting those two together in the smaller set, but it would have been much more interesting for them to have made up a set with taejo and one of the cars from the very goofy, comic book-gimmicky teams they are racing against. especially since one of the teams (that is chasing taejo specifically) is a bunch of army-wannabee loonies—i'm sure more people would have loved some sort of dark/sand green racer with one of the ij soviets at the wheel than another racer x. to summarize: two racer x's is bad, but it is the smaller set that should have been changed (imho). batbrick, on may 10 2008, 06:05 am, said: annoyingly enough, this part opens up to shoot a pointless rubber projectile: thus blowing the front part open and launching it.....well, not far really as much as i normally don't like the stupid techic launcher thing, and would rather not see it in a set ever again (although one of these days i will make a giant multi-launcer rig out of them just for fun), at least there is a reason for it to be in this set, as cruncher's semi has a missile launcher in the front end of it in the movie. i think you're supposed to lift the panel that hides the missile before launching it, similar to the way that panels slide out of the way on the semi cab to allow for firing in the movie. batbrick, on may 10 2008, 06:05 am, said: and now for the most disappointing part - step three, the trailer: that's right, almost the entire thing is open, even the "filled in" side has holes! i'd certainly be cared to be back there, one bumpy hill and back you go i'm gonna chock this up to the standard lego philosophy of "playset" rather than "model" design for a lot of things. the semi rig and raver x's car are the models, the trailer is the playset. seeing as how the trailer is cruncher's mobile office (rather finely appointed with lots of paintings and his pirahna "babies" in their tank behind his desk), and the intent seems more or less to have a playest bit in order for kids to re-enact the scene from the movie, i'm not going to give them too much grief over this. they tried to capture the basic bits of the movie set (which we see mostly from the inside during the movie) and translate it into a playset type environment. that being said, i do wish the back walls were more solid, as i see no reason for there to be gaps in the back wall when the front wall (or the "fourth wall" as the case may be here) is already conspicously absent. batbrick, on may 10 2008, 06:05 am, said: there are some pluses too though, like the ridiculously awesome minifig paintings i'll be using for wayne manor. also note the "control" on cruncher's desk that when turned, turns the gun at the bottom. it's an alright feature: could have been a little better, but it's such a minor bit of this scene in the movie that i can see why they didn't spend too much time and effort on it. it would have been nice to have more paintings though, had the back wall been more complete (and i like your idea of how to use them :) ). batbrick, on may 10 2008, 06:05 am, said: and though i'm not a massive fan of stickers, this is just too cool. the little aquarium is very simple but very clever, using a printed piece between two clear windows to create the illusion of a tank: definately a feature which is not showcased nearly well enough on the box art. since it is one of the major features of this set in the movie, it's nice to see it translate rather well into brick. batbrick, on may 10 2008, 06:05 am, said: design: 2/5 - pretty poor considering the best part is available in a cheaper set, and only the front part of the truck looks cool, but still not truly awful. that may be a bit harsh (but not much) given what i've said further up this post, but it probably only deserves a 3 at best, so i'm not realy going to quibble the point. :) i still think that racer x should be exclusive to this set and a different car should be in the smaller set with taejo, which would have improved the cachet for this set overall. batbrick, on may 10 2008, 06:05 am, said: price: 2/5 - overpriced easily, but rogue shadow is worse! true...this should have ideally been about a $30 set (especially given the general awesomeness of the ij race for the stolen treasure set), unless they made the trailer a bit more detailed (better back wall, perhaps some drop down gun ports like in the movie) or at put least one (or more) of cruncher's goons in the set, then maybe i could agree more with the msrp. on that note: if i remember correctly from my visit to my local tru yesterday in search of the new ij sets (since local targets seem determined not to get them in stock yet), they had this set on sale for around $35 along with an offer for a coupon good for $7.50 towards the purchase of a ticket to the movie with any speed racer toy purchase over $25. i may be wrong on the sale price, but i know the ticket offer was there. so, if you haven't seen the movie yet, and are interested in this set, tru may be the place to go right now to get both at a slightly cheaper price. batbrick, on may 10 2008, 06:05 am, said: fun: 4/5 - the mere concept of such an open truck kept me playing with this baby for hours! so you did enjoy the playest aspect of the trailer, even though you didn't care for the design...looks like they didn't do too badly then on what they wanted out of that bit. :) batbrick, on may 10 2008, 06:05 am, said: overall i'm really glad i bought it as the minifigs are fantastic and the paintings and fish tank are cool. it's fun, stupid and downright ridiculous, but while not a great set by any means, certainly isn't as bad in the brick as it looks in photos. i was actually thinking about going and getting this set now that i've seen the movie and i understand what the heck is going on here more. your review has definately added an additional impetus to that notion. my pocketbook (does not) thank you!
thanks for that fine review, batbrick. the most interesting part of the set, for me, are the neat mfs.... the trailer looks really pretty skeletal. however.... it´s a nice little play set and´ll fit its purpose i guess.
nice review. good pictures, thanks. i think i may get a couple of the smaller sets, as i think these will become collectors sets in years too come, not sure this range will be that popular? love the minifigs though.
thanks for the great review! it seems like the most awesome part of the set is the sticker sheet, which is a reversal of the usual situation!
i bought this set a few days ago and agree with what you have said about it. the trailer is fun to play with but just so plain. overall great review.
i really like this set: my favorite parts are the minifigs and x's car. vrooom!
good review.i think the sets amazing!
must...get...!!
nice review, brickbitz. i actually think this kit is really very nice for the size. true, you only get three figures, but it seems that's a norm in most batman sets. besides, everything else is great. the tumbler looks like an amazing build - they really nailed this tank of a ride. and the ice cream truck... plus, this set does seem to have some neat pieces in it (trans green popsicles and lime hubcaps, anyone?). i think this far beats the rest of the batman lineup this year, which seems quite disapointing overall. edited by grevious, 16 may 2008 - 08:12 pm.
it's on the way! and also the buggy!
trooperdavinfelth, on may 16 2008, 11:11 pm, said: although i know you don't take many pictures in your reviews(imho, ) but can we see a little more about the tumbler? i'll get some set up tomorrow in better light. to be honest there isn't a lot to see, most of it is just basic technic blocks underneath with all the slopes built up on top.
thanks a lot for the review brickbitz. i really love this set, sure the figs are annoyingly not new, but the ice cream truck is fantastic and the tumbler is a marvel of black slopes. i see now that it is far too huge though, i reckon i will either keep it that way as a "mega tumbler", mod it to become another battank, keep it as a model tumbler, or pull it apart and use the bits to make a tumbler like wetwire's awesome one. love those popsicles though, and those wheels are very nice, so overall as a loyal batfan i love the set, even though it could've been better. batbrick away!
a nice review of an interesting set, thanks brickbitz. a great new batman, a funny ice cream truck and a pretty detailed tumbler. and although i wish that vehicle would be just a bit smaller i almost wonder that it´s not even bigger, compared to tlc´s other batvehicles.... and well, the interior could be better too....
deinonychus, on may 16 2008, 09:21 pm, said: hey dunamis, think you can get a straight-on shot of the face? the red pieces inside the eye sockets are topped with trans-greenish-yellow studs which make his face look eerily alive and very close to his screen appearance. it's a nice little detail that seems to not show through on pictures i've seen of the set. the legs are a little wobbly. i'm scared that he'll be leaning too far forward in about 5 years sure. i'll get a few photos tonight and post them. the eyes are a nice effect. you are right about the legs as the model does wobble a little. i forgot to mention that the base does turn which is another nice feature.
nice review dunamis ! i built it two weeks ago on the legoworld speedbuild in oslo and didn´t have time to get the "feel" during that crazy race. i agree with you that the base is nice & sturdy, makes it stand real still ! i´m looking forward on your next score! four eyes arms on copmike
ok, here are a couple of shots of the head and eyes: a very nice effect. any, silly me, in my first set of photos above, i never folded in his ribcage (you guys gotta call me out on these things). here is what it is supposed to look like: anyway, carry on...
quote since there were links posted to the .pdf files of the instructions online, i’m sure you can all get an idea of the manual and the parts inventory. however, for those of you without access to the internet here are photos of the parts inventory pages: luckily for me i have access to the internet to read this review in the first place seriously though, nice review! my girlfriend has told me that i can't have this one after we just got through a 3-day build of the 10030 star destroyer... but i'm sure i can turn her around eventually... :)

snice review! (super nice) though i think i'll pass on this one, i really dislike the head. what's with the frame around the neck and the clip under the head? that, and i don't really care for ucs or technic stuff. the base looks nice though!
nice review! but id rather save my money for the indy and clone wars sets.
thanks for the great review! sad to say, as cool as he looks, he's a sale-only set for me.
hi all again. another one of todays special deliveries. i think personally this set is great. mars mission is really finding it's feet. 7646 etx alien infiltrator
the walker reminds me of the old kenner cap-2 captivator which is good.
thanks for the sweet review, brickbitz! that really is a neat little set, that walker is fantastic, most likely the best part of the set. though the alien craft does also look neat, and it's cool how it can fold down into aa walker. or rather, a sentry turret, seeing as it can't really move while in that mode. still, it's nice. my favourite part is the mini mining robot though. so cute! ~peace
thanks for that interesting review, brickbitz. the alien fighter looks pretty nice, nothing special but streamlined and fast nevertheless. that transforming feature´s a nice addition for sure, and these new flicker missile with its launch apparatus.... hmm, i hope i won´t spend quite some time in search of that little 'rocket' piece.... however, there´s still something i miss with these alien crafts.... i don´t know.... i like some more organic looking design, and they even come in some nice and different shapes, but still.... perhaps a real space fighter just needs a solid cockpit, cool windscreens and controls to satisfy my odd likings. that 'exo suit' looks really good and i wonder why it´s a little underrepresented on the box art. the jet pack/space scooter´s a really good idea, and the only thing i hate´re those darned studless technic beams.... it could look so much better with a studded version of these parts. but of course that´s only due to my personal preferences.
thanks for the review!! that makes me wanting this set even more!!
thanks for the review nice little set and its around $20.00!
hi y'all! guess what happened today? when walked into my toys 'r' us in fullerton, ca, just to buy a simple tiny turbo racer, what do i see? all the agents sets sitting on the shelf, ready for the taking! i didn't have too much money with me, so i just got 2 of 8631 mission 1: jetpack pursuit! it's a really cool little set, so i thought i'd review this puppy for you! i shall proceed in the order of the instructions. so, let's get started! the minifigs let's begin with the minifigs, saw fist and agent chase! they are really cool, some of the coolest minifigs i have seen in a while! i took off saw fist's wig & chainsaw so you can see his head and cybernetic arm better! here is a back view of saw fist, and - surprise! agent chase has a double sided head! one side with his cool "mission face" with sunglasses and headset, and one with his casual bruce wayne type face (note, though, that it is not really the bruce wayne face). his wig, btw, is mutt's hairpiece in black! very neat! poor saw fist seems to be forced to always drag his chainsaw around for it is way too long to just hang down from his shoulder like a normal arm. the snowmobile next up, we have the snowmobile, a sleek little vehicle with only minor design flaws! the container with the jewel is attached to the vehicle by a single stud, so it doesn't fall off, but is easy to pick up! in the pic below you can see the only two tiny design flaws: thanks to the exhaust pipes, the laser cannon (or whatever it's supposed to be) can't be lowered any further than this. also, the corners of that slope-ish piece that the handle bar rests on are sticking out a little at the sides. other than that, it's pretty well done! the jetpack finally, there is the jetpack! imo, a name like autogyro-pack or something would make more sense, but whatever. although a little bulky, the jetpack is very well designed! the rotor can be tilted back, and at the lower back of the jetpack, there is hook with which you can grab the container with the jewel from the snowmobile. what i like best about the jetpack is that although it is attached to the minifig in kinda the same way as that of the riddler, this one doesn't rotate around. so, the agent is being held in place steadily! "see ya later, chainsaw-cyborg-dude!" stickers this set comes with a surprisingly large sticker sheet. the reason is that half of it are extra stickers! there are two large agents logos and one inferno logo - perfect for agents mocs! there are also a star and a small, round sticker portraying the number of the mission. the star seems to be part of some kind of game where you collect the stars from all sets on an agents id that you get from the mission 5 set. i don't know, though, if you get any gain from this except for becoming a full-status lego agent! below, you can find the list of parts from this set! click here for a better quality pic! that's pretty much it! i hope you liked this review and will run straight to your next toy store to get one or more of this set! this was my very first set review! so any questions, comments, or requests? any more pics you want me to take? would you like me to exchange the chainsaw with something else, or do you want me to try the agent's new hairpiece out on another fig? if so, just tell me! see ya! edited by oky wan kenobi, 25 june 2009 - 08:21 pm.
that's a great review for your first one. i think the jet pack if far to bulky it could do with some minimising but that’s life. i assume that you can’t fit a standard hand in the chainsaw arms are the hole would be to large but would you be so good as to confirm this for me? overall i quite like the jet ski and the ability to lower the arms to much doesn’t both me. how much was it just so i can get an idea of the price? finally thanks for posting this review so quickly.
this is much much much more promising than the 2008 batman set for $10.00. the vehicle looks like someone took time to design it, but the batman one looks like . lego dear lego, where is the quality for batman??!?! i really like the new cyborg arm, and the propellers on that thing : ), it is a really promising line although i would get rid of all those bionicle pieces.
is there any chance u could post pics of the comic and the box i love legos box art and instruction art?
what a lovely set, thanks for that fine review, oky wan kenobi! the mfs´re wonderful, that helipack looks solid and well done and i especially like the slightly asymmetrical design of the neat snowmobile. a very playable little set for sure, and the most interesting part´s for sure that new cool mf arm....
yay, oky wan! wow, the agents line is looking good so far. the jetpack is pretty nice, and the minifigs... my dad was in portland just yesterday, and if i'd have called an hour sooner, he might have been able to get to the tru...
thanks for the great review oky wan! at first i didn't think i liked the agents sets but the more i see them the better i think they look. i will definitely pick up 1 or 2 of the sets. i really like the jet pack, and the figs look great. that double face is very nice. tlg should make more figs with these faces in my opinion.
great review!thank youvery much! i think this line is much more promising than most orginally thought it would be. i'm onmy way to see ifican find the big rig right now!
thank you.
not many words this time, but as they say: a picture is worth a thousand words - and your pictures are lovely! once again, agents is turning out to be a cooler and cooler theme with each new review. this set looks like an awesome parts pack, and i love the bike! btw, anyone else notice the possibly accidental reference to alpha team? agent charge is back, it looks! edited by grevious, 21 may 2008 - 09:05 pm.
like all the others, (except the truck) this set is great. love the figs and the green crocidiles.
nice set... im definately gonna pick it up when i see it. i like the design of the base and it comes with lots of usefull an neat pieces.
wow, thanks for the great review, sirnadroj! the overall set is what attracted me in the first place, that elevated hut and swampy setting just sucked me right in! it all looks really nice to me, a definite buy. that agents head would make a great indy, for those opposed to fleshies. and that monobrow, i mean, villain guy looks very... er... well, the monobrow is unique, thought i noticed the suit looks a bit skin tight in the crotchal area. don't look at me like that, you saw it too! anyway, the helmet's the best part about the villain, great for warhammer 40,000 orks. ~peace
very useful pieces, that new agent head (i think it's new) could be used for a gordon freeman minifigure, and break jaw's head for otis the security guard when you take his donuts away from him.
great review and a good confirmation of exactly what i suspected... this is a parts line for me. much like exoforce before it, this will be the theme i pick up when i'm out of other things, or it's on sale. plus those dark green alligators bring tears of joy to an old pirate. alice, on may 22 2008, 12:43 am, said: i always joked that our house would have a moat around it with mechanical alligators. you were joking? what about the monkeys and the miniature golf course? don't ruin my dreams ...
thanks for the review. i the bike and the bad guy's helmet.
i've copied another thing because i don't know how i must do a review. and i can't do long reviews! set ref: 7884 name: the buggy: the escape of mr freeze number of minifigs: 2 number of pieces: 76 price: 13,95€ front of the box: back of the box: the comic: very close: what's in the box: without: the set: the set with the box: the time: wow, this is a funny set, but it's a little expensive, and a little to small, but i like some pieces like the fire, and the mr freeze gun. and the best of all, here it comes, no stickers! that's one of the greatest things. but i understand why lego has made this set, some people want batman lego, and they are most of the time expensive, and the mr freeze set is also expensive, but this set not. if you want more pics, you msut ask! for exaple for the minifigs, or the mr freeze and the blaster. ask it, and this is my first review and sorry for the great and blurry pics! the final verdict: 7.5/10 figures: 8/10 playability: 6/10 build: 7/10 pieces: 7.5/10
nice review, thanks! i really like those little go-kart thingies, they've got a fantastic mario kart look to them
quote but i have to say that these two small vehicles just look plain ugly imho, without any inspiration nor orginality indead. the only reason to get this set is if you couldn't afford the batcave back in 2006 and want a mr. freeze fig for a cheap price. and anyone who did get that kit really have no reason whatsoever to get this. wait, did i forget something? oh yeah - thanks for the review, riddler. edited by grevious, 22 may 2008 - 11:54 pm.
like many others, i'll buy this just for mr f, quickly recycle the parts, and pretend this set never existed. the flame detail is indeed terrible. the bat is back - and he's flatulent! this third bat-wave isn't really doing anything for me. i'll get the penguin set as well for pretty much the same reason - although the sub on that is pretty cool - but skip the others. maybe batbrick can make us all nice alt-mocs to improve these sets... thanks for the review though!
thanks for the reveiw the figs are bloody great! but those cars are a bit... well i'll put it blantly, retarded!!! although they shall be good after some modding! and whats with that grapple hook? does it even have a rope, so i guess batman will hokk it to mr freeze so his ride looks more ugle anyway, can you pleese take some pics of the figs
thank you, the riddler! ) for this highly informative review. despite the fact that i still consider it to be one of the weakest sets in all batman line, i guess that now i may even get more than one of these for the same reasons as batbrick. ) good day, gentlemen! )
thanks for the extra pics, i don't think you could have gone into much more detail than that! nice pics of the joker van too, will you do a review of that one? batbrick away!
i got this yesterday and built it this morning. apart from the figs, it is very crappy. mr freeze's buggy is ok but the bat buggy is easily the worst vehicle i've seen for years. colours are all over the place, the grappling hook feels cheaply made, the inclusion of those odd pearl silver parts which have been in the exo-force sets seem especially random here, the terrible bionicle flame piece... it's the first lego vehicle i've built where i've immediately had the urge to disassemble it and pretend i never bought it! really, i only got it for mr freeze so i shouldn't complain. but still. it's a real step backwards. the comparable catwoman dragster set was heaps better. the penguin sub is sweet though thanks for the review anyway!
coming in at around $50 us, turbo car chase is one of the bigger of the new agents sets. a big box with a helicopter, car, and gate in it. seems like a winner, but how good is it really, and is it worth the cash? let's start with the minifigs. this set comes with a standard inferno henchman, spy clops, and agent chase. the henchman is you basic lego criminal type with a gun and a jumpsuit, nothing real groundbreaking here. spy clops, on the other hand, is very cool for, technically, half of a minifig. his head has a neat electronic goggle print and the rest of him is a torso mounted onto a set of six legs made from exo-force robot arms. the whole thing is really well done and neat as hell. agent chase (turbo car chase! ) seems to have a standard agent body and a double-printed face with one side a sunglasses and headset print. the other face is a determined agent look. the set also includes a laptop with doctor inferno wallpaper. the laptop is a new piece and works like the lego books that are in a lot of harry potter sets. molding on the keyboard is really well done and the thing can be held by a minifig along either corner, but not in the middle and not while closed. the gate in the set is nothing revolutionary by itself, and i sort of get the feeling that it was included to drive up the piece count and the set price point. that being said, there are some things to like here. for instance, the gate has four wheels of barbed wire attached to it. the barbed wire is new and makes me want to start building some world war i trench mocs. the rest of the gate is fairly big and it has a handy ramp attached so that vehicles can roll through it easily. the main feature of the gate is a sound brick. it's much better then lego sound and light units of the past, when the gate is opened it depresses a button and an alert klaxon blares that sounds every bit like a prison-beak in progress. the triggering action works surprisingly well and it's pretty much for this feature alone that i'm not going to immediately break the gate back down and add it to my parts bin. the designers did make an effort to create more then just a fence though. a nice control panel connected to a big spotlight crowns the piece, and a pair of cameras watch the opening. it's really hard to mess up a lego helicopter, and this set is no exception. the inferno chopper is a nicely proportioned and well built machine. it looks properly menacing and has the uniform orange and black of other inferno property. it's armed with a set of four technic pegs cleverly used as guns on outriding mounts, as well as a pair of the newer-style flick-fire missiles. i personally don't care for flick-firing missiles, but these look decent enough and seem to stay put so i really can't complain about them. along the fuselage are a pair of intake pieces that i've never seen before and i'm guessing are new. they're pretty well designed and will come in handy for mocing down the road. the action feature of the aircraft is the wench system. this is very different then other lego wenches in that you build the entire mechanism and housing. you can then use it to raise spy clops up and down from the bottom of the chopper using the rotor. now, this also keeps you from sitting there and just giving the rotor repeated spins to simulate flight. i'm not too thrilled with that, but there are a hundred other lego helicopters out there with fully rotating rotors, so i guess i can let it by just this once. as you'd suspect, the bottom of the cockpit is completely open, which makes this a vehicle pretty much solely for spy clops (sorry henchman). but there is plenty of room beneath the body to attach a plate with some seats on it to accommodate another pilot without drastically altering the design, or even removing existing pieces. the turbo car is a slick little honey of a lego car, and the silver pieces that make up the body work contribute a lot to that fact. the front license plate appears to be an exo-fore code brick. but it also hides the activation lever for the passenger ejector seat. the seat works about as well as the spruce goose, which is to say not well at all, but here it's the thought that counts. the interior of the car is really well done. there's even a radar screen for keeping track of pesky helicopters. but the bond-like features don't end there. a lever in the compartment raises pair of guns in the hood and a knob on the rear deploys a quad rocket system with more flick-fire missiles. this is a car that won't be stopped easily! the rear has two cones sticking out. i'd like to think they're smoke nozzles or oil-slick sprayers. all-in-all, this is a really good set. the car is pure lego vehicle love and looks fantastic. the silver pieces are very nice and it's a shame lego doesn't use metallic colors in system sets more often. there are, however, a lot of sticker for this set and i know how much that bugs a lot of people. i personally like how much detail the stickers add to these sets and don't mind them so much. the set also comes with an agents id card for chase which you can put little star stickers on from other sets as you get them. it's printed on a real nice piece of sturdy plastiboard and would be cooler if you could put your own picture and name on it instead of pretending to be chase. sold by themselves, the car and chopper would be must-haves. all tossed together with the gate sort of makes the set a little less then the sum of it's parts. and with 498 parts (most of them small) that's not so hot. it's only slightly over-priced in my opinion, but if you do shell out the money you won't regret it. i'm very comfortable recommending this set to anyone. close to perfect, but the price and some minor flaws bring it back just a little. i'd say 4.33, but out of 5 is close enough!
deinonychus, on may 23 2008, 10:12 pm, said: pics and thoughts tomorrow! i picked up this set earlier in the week and was quite pleased with it (in fact i have missions 1-5 and am happy with all of them - this series is much better than the old alpha team ever was). i look forward to reading your thoughts on it. i will say 2 things about it now though. 1)my set came with defective instructions. in 2 places pages are missing and duplicates of other pages repeated. for instance, the car instructions are missing steps 16-21. fortunately, i was able to make out what pieces went where in the missing steps by studying the illustration in step 22. i hope you have better luck with your instructions. 2)this set contains the best lego sound brick ever (it's just begging to be incorporated into my arkham asylum).
thanks for the awesome review, deinonychus! this really is a sweet set, a bit expensive a set for me, as i only get the cheaper non-castle sets, which is a shame because i love that head! it would be great for some more cyborg troops. the car is awesome, i didn't expect it to have that many silver parts, that's fantastic! heaps of play features too, that ejector seat mechanism sounds interesting. thanks again for the sweet review! ~peace
thanks for the great review! i'm really liking these agents sets the more i see them. the car seems to have alot of features. its to bad the the ejection seat doesn't work as well as one would hope. oh well. makes me want the big rig even more now!
great review thanks for sharing
dragonator, on may 25 2008, 08:21 pm, said: thanks for the review whitefang. i love these sets, and i wish they were available in nz. so far, it seems they may never come here... but i can sit and hope. i like the look of them after your make-over, a real skeleton army there! did you say you've bought 12! tht's lots of skelies. are you planning a big moc or something? no problem! i had bought it last month. i thought it was so simple to do a review for this. was looking through the thread, then i realised there is a request for it. it was an unexpected shipment that send to singapore. it came in very limited quantity. most of the battlepacks were snapped within a day or two when it arrived. well, i am thinking of building something big in the future. it's just a plan that i have not decided yet. for me, i always love to see the beauty of a big army with different battalions, forming a kingdom. that's why, i always buy many many sets that have figures that attracts me. and for this battlepack, it served a very good purpose for it!
thanks for the review i wanted to see what was in this set looks good! is it sold in stores? edited by mammymarf, 25 may 2008 - 03:38 pm.
whitefang, on may 25 2008, 06:14 am, said: for a single battlepack like this, with an attractive reasonable price. you obtained a series of 5 skeleton mini-figs with tons and tons of useful castle accessories. to me, it's a very very great buy, and it's a must to stock up for my army building! i wish these battlepacks had a reasonable price click here to see the canadian price of these battlepacks, 18 dollars thats 6 dollars more than the starwars battlepack yet you get the same amount of lego (or less then a starwars battlepack). how the megablok does lego price its items . i'm gonna have to skip this set, and a few others that i wanted because of this bloody outrageous. back on topic thanks for the detailed review, whitefang i also like your little changes to the set they really make this set look better.
thanks, whitefang! castle battle packs.... simply wonderful! finally a dream came true, well done tlc!

for those of you who buy so many of this and the other battle pack with crownies, what do you do with all of them? is this simply to create a large-scale army, or do you plan to build large castle scenes with all the figs. i'd love to see some pictures (on the "share your castle army" thread).
hi gang! as you all know, indiana jones iv has just debuted, and tlg has released a set depicting the incan temple (7627) from the film's climax. but lego beat harrison ford, george lucas, steven spielberg and company to the punch by nine whole years with johnny thunder's adventures in the amazon ancient ruins. the vitals: year of release: 1999 parts count: 453 msrp: $80.00 the set included eight figures: (from left) two skeletons, dr. lightning, gail storm, gabarros, achu, johnny thunder, and señor palomar. on the far right is my new sigfig, el conde voltio villar. construction begins with dr. lightning and his jeep. it's a sturdy adventurers-style vehicle, with fatter tires at the rear for better traction. next is gabarros and his unusual boat. the hull is from belleville/paradisa sets, where it is usually pink or white. tlg ought to have put it in the pirate theme, as it is a nice, intermediate size. in this set, it is a small steamship. the temple is built on modular 8x8 green bricks which fit into square holes in the baseplate. this is the "treasure room." this square has a nasty double-spear trap. careful... this is the top section of the temple, crowned by achu the (mummified?) incan. more modular sections (these are from the front of the temple site, across the river from the main building). el conde: "you are too beautiful a woman to be wandering alone in the jungle, miss storm. please, allow me to accompany you." gail storm: "i'm with johnny, and i have a cutlass." el conde: "i'll be on my way." here's the finished temple, with all parts in place. now for the traps... "hmm, a giant ruby to bring home to the king." "¡uf!" "that was embarassing. miss storm saw me fall..." "and now i've fallen again!" "i had better rest here before something worse happens." "¡chispas!" "that's it, i'm leaving this place!" "why me? why?" the verdict: this is a fine set, a set whose bare parts/price ratio does not accurately reflect the intricacy of its design nor the rarity of its parts. i had to buy replacements for some of them, and let me tell you, they are pricey! that green baseplate? $14. the little dark gray saucepan near the fire? not available on bricklink at any price. the brown boat hull? vhtf. with this set, parts quality trumps parts quantity. and the minifigures are wonderful! there's not a dud in the bunch with the possible exception of the very common dr. lightning, and even he is not bad. when you factor in the coherence of the color scheme and the brilliant traps, it is obvious that 5986 is a classic. 10/10 edited by whitefang, 27 november 2008 - 05:33 am. this review is added to the index.
thanks for this great review, voltio! i never knew of this set 'till now, and it really looks great! i never paid much attention to those aztec/incan style sets, which i now regret. i love the bright colours used here, and all the great traps, there's so many of them, which is exactly what we can expect from an old incan temple like this one. i'm surprised there's no catapult. anyway, the minifigs included are also great, and am i right in guessing those bricks are printed? that would be fantastic, as they look amazing. that boat hull is new to me too, although i guess the fact that it's mainly in belville sets explains that pretty well. thanks again for the sweet review, do you have any other jungle adventurers sets you plan to review? ~peace
i've always wanted this set, ever since it came out in '99. i have never seen it close up (unless you count driving over it in lego racers 2), so thanks for the pictures and the great review. voltio, on may 26 2008, 04:43 am, said: el conde: "you are too beautiful a woman to be wandering alone in the jungle, miss storm. please, allow me to accompany you." gail storm: "i'm with johnny, and i have a cutlass." el conde: "i'll be on my way." hehe.
a real classic, thanks for that nice and funny review, voltio! a well designed set, very playable with a lot of nifty traps, a very good use of that raised baseplate and really nice crafts. the mf characters´re excellent too! and although the color scheme´s great and original, especially with all these neat printed pieces, it´s perhaps the only part of that set that looks a little out of date today.... nevertheless, the set´s plain charming and shows clearly that tlc don´t need licenses to do some distinct adventurer sets.
great review. i saw the instructions of this set, but never atracted me until now a great set an a excelente review.
vhtf= very hard to find. to answer some earlier replies... no, there are no stickers in this set. while some adventurers sets of the era had stickers (the 5956 zeppelin had tons), all of the interesting mesoamerican designs from this set are printed. also, simonwillems was correct; my mechanic is missing his hat, which should be a black kepi. they're extremely expensive on bl, though (proving once again that this set has some awesome parts), so i ordered a replacement from lego. it's in the mail and should come soon.
great review voltio, i never actually owned this set but my friend does, he gave me some of the peices, but he burnt the base (don't know why)
i got this as a birthday gift when i turned 7 years old or so. i can still remember the big box with the brown bridge in its display! so many hours of fun. one of the most amazing sets i own. a lot of play value. a true classic!
thank you very much for the review, cardinal brick! that's indeed a very nice little set! klaus-dieter
donneyboy, on nov 27 2008, 08:40 pm, said: i might buy a second one of that set, and build it in the bag. i just wanna prove that it is possible. i bought 4 myself! its like having a little beach fleet!
thank you very much for the nice review, 5150 lego! the helicopter is - apart from that it is very, very big and that it does not include any interior - a very nice set . the most i like the life raft becuase it is simply . nevertheless i don't know if i buy it (probably not) - but it's very nice! two questions : -where can you fasten the stretcher on to haul it up and down? -is the motor working with batteries? klaus-dieter edited by klaus-dieter, 28 may 2008 - 09:19 pm.
great review, 5150. although, you might want to resize your pictures before posting them so they don't take forever to load. quote wow. i was skeptical of this coast guard line. i was actually the complete opposite. ever since i saw the first pictures, i fell in love with the whole line. the helicopter looks to be one of the two best in the line, right up with the 4wd and jetski. great job tlc, and i do hope you have something equally as great planned for next year.
nice review! the helicopter reminds a sikorsky chopper,isn't it?
i could tell from the pictures that a lot (maybe all) the designs on the raft were stickers. in the whole set are there any printed parts besides the torsos or is it all stickers?
all stickers i'm afraid. though i'mnot a fan of stickers myself. some sets (like ferrari for example) take longer to put on than building the actual set. this one is not as sticker heavy as it seams though, and the ones that areon there really give the set that extra touch. printed would have been preffered of course, but in this case i didn't mind it.
i'm rather fond of helicopters and have built many different types. this doesn't really remind me of any particular model, other than perhaps an eh. 101 merlin and even that resemblance is very superficial. just for the record: this is a sikorsky sea king and this is a sikorsky mh-53 (a derivation of the ch-53). the only resemblance i see with the former is the colour scheme and with the latter the fact that it's got a fat rear-end, sponsons and six blades. it doesn't matter though, because i really like it. the colour scheme is great, the shape is nice, it's got quite a bit of detail and i just have to get my hands on the cockpit window and those new rotor blades. when i first saw the large aircraft pieces a few years ago i figured they were very much single-use parts, but the tail end doesn't look too bad. pretty clever. i like the raft too. it really does look like the real deal. that the helicopter can't lift it really isn't an issue, because in real life they wouldn't lift the raft either. they'd use the rescue hoist to lift the occupants of the raft into the helicopter one by one (or perhaps in pairs). imagine a storm with a helicopter hovering over tall waves with a big fat raft strung from a cable underneath it. the raft would catch a lot of wind and flop around quite a bit, causing it to loose all its occupants and also yanking the helicopter around, possibly causing the pilot to loose control and crash. bad idea! cheers, ralph edited by ralph_s, 30 may 2008 - 11:09 pm.
great review ???theriddiler??? is that a new batman torso!? edited by oli212lego, 28 may 2008 - 12:13 pm.
thanks, and yes that is a new torso! soon the 7886 wil be reviewd! who want's the second riddle? edited by ???theriddler???, 28 may 2008 - 02:11 pm.
thanks for the nice review, ???theriddler???. a neat and funny ice cream truck and a pretty detailed yet perhaps a little big tumbler. an overall cool set for sure!
great looking set, loved the review, pictures were good... sometimes blury but i think i will pick this up after i get the rest of the kotcs sets. riddler a tip i learned in photoclass is to take a breath in and hold it while pushing the shutter so you don't accidentally move while breathing. i thought it was silly, but it does work. again great review! looking forward to more...
???theriddler???, on may 29 2008, 12:22 pm, said: oke thanks for the tips, but you see that not blurry pics, i've taken them later, so now it will be totaly great pics! who want's the second riddle? excellent review! this and the other four batman sets are must buys.
uncle joker's cheap technic missile surprise great review, however, there isn't much appeal to the set after you see what the "surprise" is, though i can modify the truck to have an evil gas-ice cream making interior
thanks for the review, ??theriddler??! i am going to see if this set is at meijer, and i will buy it if it is. and i am reviewing the harley truck right now, and i will post a review later.
nice review m8. shame that most of the pictures are blurry but nonetheless. just wanted to say that out of all my lego sets, this one, 7888 is the best. the tumbler is so cool once it is put together! those four huge wheels at the back make it quite unique! if you do not have this set i highly recomend it. edited by 4olic, 30 august 2009 - 02:59 pm.

sinner, on may 28 2008, 02:35 pm, said: care to explain why? the mcm has a pure weight of parts that i find hard to quantify but love... it is just so dense when you build it, full of nice surprises, no technique required, and a wonderful stearing mechanism that i rank as more important than the suspension of the mars version. this thing was meant to crush anyway, who needs suspension? i also like the way you never felt that the m-trons deserved a base after building this, it was that good... the colour scheme was perfect... it's space and i like it... enough said great review btw god bless, nathan naturally you're entitled to your inferior opinion...
joebot, on may 28 2008, 07:31 pm, said: kinda sad to think that with tlc's recent ban on magnets in their products since when is that? the new train couplings have magnets, only with a special casing. anyways, m:tron is one of the greatest space factions, with mega core magnetiser as my favourite set of these guys (even though i do not own it ). the only thing that bothers me is the lack of (reachable) controls for the minifigs to drive their vehicles (but iirc it is the same with a lot of other space-sets as well)
sinner, on may 28 2008, 11:35 pm, said: care to explain why? personally i think that aside from the colour scheme the new one is far better. why? suspension, more enclosed cockpits, bug-like appearence.... i suppose it's a matter of personal opinion though. i just thought that the mt-101 was very skeletal and couldn't really steer that well, although i do like it. also the mcm has a better design, in my view, as the wheels are closer together, making it look a lot more tankish than the mt-101. also space in the rear isn't wasted on having a shuttle. cp5670, on may 29 2008, 02:52 am, said: as for the hose/jetpack things, i always assumed that they were either welding torches or flamethrowers. take your pick. hmm.... well they don't have much else to defend themselves with, and i think in the uk the mcm was marketed as a mobile recovery center. fluyt, on may 29 2008, 03:56 am, said: anyways, m:tron is one of the greatest space factions, with mega core magnetiser as my favourite set of these guys (even though i do not own it ). the only thing that bothers me is the lack of (reachable) controls for the minifigs to drive their vehicles (but iirc it is the same with a lot of other space-sets as well) yeah they could have used the normal levers instead of the pronged two piece things at the front of the cockpit. but there is certainly a lot to mod. joebot, on may 29 2008, 04:25 am, said: but the old m:tron round magnet pieces are presumably discontinued. shoot... guess that bl and ebay are the only sources now... thanks for your input!

thanks for that fine review of a really classic and impressive m:tron set, inertia! tohst, on may 28 2008, 04:55 pm, said: the mm armored drilling unit has a more technic base giving it a less solid appearance (...) yeah.... it´s pretty sad, some of these new sets just look very cool at the outside, but appear to be hollow and blank at the inside, especially with the annoying use of studless technic beams. to mod these sets often means to change the whole inner frame, leaving us with a bunch of imho not really very useful parts. it´s not a very honorable marketing strategy to produce set designs that´re aimed to look impressive and cool on the box art, but´re pretty useless in their inner structures. of course i don´t want to offend some technic lovers, and although i always was more the system kind of guy, why can´t they just use some technic beams with studs at least? i grew up with 'just imagine', with pictures of alternative models on the box, and i don´t think it´s that easy, especially for younger kids, to mod some of these terrific blown-up sets like it once was with sets like this one here.... implosion off!

harley & mistah j. i want to preface my review by admitting that i’m an unrepentant harley quinn fanboy. i’ve been enamored with the character since she first appeared in batman: the animated series back in the 90’s, and i’ve since followed her misadventures through her introduction into the regular batman series during no man’s land, into her own series, and even on the short-lived and not-so-good birds of prey tv show. so please excuse any pro-harley bias. so, down to business. the 267 piece set retails for $30 us ($35 at toys r us) and builds up very fast and easy. it consists of batman’s bat cycle, harley’s hammer truck, and brand new batman and harley quinn minifigs. there is also no lack of weapons. in addition to the usual bag of bat-accessories and guns, the set also comes with a pair of gray revolvers. batman in this set has the new “armor” torso print and the hips are the same color as the legs, hinting that this is supposed to represent the movie style batsuits more so then the traditional comic book “underwear over tights” look. harley quinn is a very cool looking minifig, and i haven’t grinned so much at a new batman character figure since my first batman minifig a couple years ago. the figure is very true to the character, and the torso has been accented with a few shape lines to try and distinguish her as a female despite the boxy body. harley’s jester cap is an interesting new piece. it seems (to me at least) to be made of a slightly different grade of plastic then we’re used to. it’s molded in red and painted with black and white, and it comes packed in its own separate little baggie. i expect that this piece may have cost lego a little more then usual to produce. harley also has a buildable accessory, a giant mallet. sure, she can’t stand up all that well unless it’s held in specific ways, but it’s neat and most importantly, it’s funny. it’s especially fun for smacking the everloving crap out of other minifigs with. the bat cycle is in bag number one and is a very fast build. this isn’t some little japanese sport bike like nightwing’s cycle. this monster is almost a car and seems to pack just the right amount of intimidation for the caped crusader to exploit. thanks to the thick tires (two in front, one in back) it stands up just fine on its own and rolls very well. the huge exhaust pipes are a nice touch and give the thing a look of engine power. the only real flaw is the inclusion of the flick-fire missiles mounted on the sides. but, as with any lego model, they can be easily left out without hurting the look of the vehicle. the hammer truck is the bulk of this set and a lot more fun then it looks. of the monster truck persuasion, the vehicle is designed and built with a surprising level of solidity. the axle mounts are particularly impressive. the big wheels and tires just beg you to drive this thing right over the bat cycle (or batman). the mega-mallet gimmick is also a surprise. not so much for its technical complexity, there isn’t any really, but for the fact that once you start turning the knob at the rear to swing the mallet back and forth, it’s really a lot of fun. there are some low points to the truck design. again the flick-fire missiles are tacked on and there’s a cargo crate/bed set into the back for harley’s loot of jewels. the crate would have looked a lot better molded in black. in brown it breaks up the look of the truck a little. speaking of which, the look of the truck is very pleasing. the red and black harley quinn color scheme works really well on the vehicle. there are a few stickers here, and unfortunately, the diamond patterned ones are applied over multiple bricks. the rest, however, are great. not only does she have an “i love joker” bumper sticker, but she has a joker playing card taped to her dash, i guess serving as a picture of her beloved puddin’. there is also a sticker for activation of the hammer, which boldly shouts hit me! this is a fun set. a neat new batman vehicle and a big truck with lots of playability. the harley minifig is a must-have for any bat-fan and, if you only get one of the batman sets this year, i’d recommend this one. the price versus piece-count on this set is a little bit of a deterrent though. this might not be the best set for collectors on a budget or people looking for something completely new and innovative, but anyone buying this for a child can rest assured that the kid will get your money’s worth out of the set through its play value. when added together and averaged out, the pros and cons of this set combine to give it a score of out of 5. even if harley herself is a clean 6 out of 5
what a showman!, guess you have to get in before someone else does the review! looking forward to the review....

thanks for the review, great set, definitely the first of the batman sets i'll be getting. i love the truck and the batbike isn't as bad as i thought it was, a win for me. batbrick away!
hi all, so i was at "the wal-mart" yesterday and had the munchies and was looking for something to eat. somewhere along the line, i stopped caring about food and decided to browse the toy department to see what they had lego-wise. usually, they have jack squat, but on this particular day they had a lot of new sets. i impulsively picked this set up, along with harley quinn's hammer truck and the new little campsite from the indy 4 line. i must say, when i first saw images of this set i wasn't exactly thrilled or anything. i mean, i didn't really see anything particularly special about it, but after purchasing it, i must admit that i would consider it a must buy for any lego fan. but enough babbling about myself. onward with the review (my first of an official set)! in this picture, you can see everything you get with the set. i thought the box-art was pretty nice looking. the manual, on the other hand, took somewhat of a beating within the box, a common problem with most more recent sets. i do have to say that i wish they would at least make some effort in fixing this. they could just make a little thin cardboard "folder" to minimize bending and tears. for batman minifig collector's, the highlight of this set are the robin and penguin figs. previously, you could only get them in the pricey bat-cave set, but this set provides a much cheaper alternative. one thing you will notice, however, is that robin's hairpiece is a new mold, as it is actually a black version of mutt's hair (from the indy 4 line). personally, i think it actually looks better than the hairpiece used on the older version of robin. as the batcave had before it, this set comes with some bricks to make two cute (but deadly) penguins. they help add more charm to an already charming set. when you're finished building, you'll end up with a nice little assortment of extra parts; 1 black "cheese slope," 3 1x1 tile (black, yellow and white), a revolver, a technic pin, and a 1x1 red round plate. here's robin's scuba jet. it's nice and sleek looking. notable parts of interest would probably be the green turbine engines. my only complaint on this one would have to be the use of decals on the 2x2 round yellow tiles. for that type of a part, printing seems as though it would have been the best way to go. now for, in my opinion, the best part of the set...the penguin's sub. this set has more decals than robin's scuba jet, but they seem more necessary in this case. i actually wanted to put the decal's on the sub, as i think the it looks great with them. obviously, it looks like a penguin, but wow, does it ever do it with style! it has a lot of interactive features, the first of which i will mention, being the periscope which raises up and down. and for the collectors of parts in new colors, it has a few parts in medium orange?, such as 2x2 tile. here's a shot of the bottom of the sub. another nifty little feature is how you can lift the top off and fit the penguin inside. and there is enough room inside, so that you can firmly place top on again, and without interference to the movement of the periscope. another little feature is the rear spring-loaded missile. you just tilt the small lever toward the front of the sub, and it fires. and the last small feature are the flick-missiles on each side. overall, this is a great set with a lot to offer for a decent price. a lot of fans might view the only drawback to it as being the use of decals, but if you plan on keeping the kit together they make it look really fantastic. buy it if you can. matt edited by imperialshadows, 01 june 2008 - 11:42 am.
yay, another technic shooter!! whew, i need a spare one in case the 14,348 other ones that i have all happen to break. seriously, do lego set designers get some sort of bonus for incorporating catapults, technic shooters, and / or flick-fire missiles??? anyway, thanks for the review. looks like a cute set.
thanks . why isn't this set on s@h? who want's the second riddle?
axle, on may 30 2008, 03:30 pm, said: the only problem i see with the box-art is that the penguin is drowning! is not! he just received underwater breathing super-powers and.... and.... oh, well! ) speaking seriously, great review, btw! ) thanks! ) one question: the teeth are printed on the sticker, aren't they? ) and are not on the box? ) good day, gentlemen! )
set: 8635 - agents - mobile command center pieces: 1154 price: $us89.99 those dedicated agents. they've fought chainsaw-armed villains, battled radio-controlled cyborg crocs, chased pallets of badly-stored golden loot and wrestled killer sharks with vicious, toothy grins. finally they've caught the notorious dr inferno and imprisoned him in their cavernous mobile command center. but dr inferno won't go down without a fight! can the agents stop the evil dr 'disco' inferno fleeing? will spy clops laser gun burn through the door in time, or will dr inferno simply use the lovely agent trace's enormous ponytail as an escape ladder to freedom? more importantly, will there be a riot in the streets of lego city as afols go apopletic at the thought of a 12 wide truck roaring through their ordered town layouts? stay tuned! part 1: the box, instructions, parts as the largest of the agents sets (so far), the box is easily the biggest. trainee agents, examine the following three pics and see if you notice anything odd. box front: box back: box middle: spot it? that's right. the printed cardboard which has supposed to be the bottom half of the fold out middle section is on the back, slicing the ultra-large set image which would form the foldout in half . the way the cardboard is printed as one piece before it's folded i think this would be very hard to do 'accidentally' so suspect a major stuff-up somewhere along the production line. i bought this set off bricklink so would be very interested if anyone in the states who has seen these boxes actually on the shelves can tell me if this is common or rare. basically i want to know if i should be annoyed that the bricklink seller didn't list this in the set description, or are they all like this? the instructions come in 4 booklets. the parts list comes in at 5 pages, which is a lot even at half-size pages ! large images of the parts inventory are in this folderwhen moderated for anyone interested. here's also some cute agents-type artwork at the end of one of the books. instructions show piece call-outs and are divided into sections according to numbered bags. as you'd expect for a set with 1100+ parts, this baby comes with a lot of bags. it's a treasure trove of dark blue. as well as the obvious large slopes and wall panels which make up the body and the roof, there is a wealth of smaller navy blue pieces as well - small 1x1 bricks, 2x2 bricks, 1x1 plates, 2x2 tiles, heaps of 2x plates, some slopes, 22x cheese pieces... basically anyone wanting a lot of dark blue should think about this set. the roof panels alone, for example, could provide a dark blue sea for a modernised pirate moc. 2 dsss (dreaded sticker sheets). quelle surprise - stickers! the grey parts of the stickers here are metallic silver ink, which is a nice touch. actually, as sticker sheets go, they're not too bad. fairly subtle for the most part and the navy blue actually matches the bricks themselves. however, after looking at the sticker sheets i thought i was missing something. what about the pieces used for the projection screens showing dr inferno and the sharks - why weren't they on the sticker sheets? there must be another one! frantically i checked and rechecked the box and flipped through all the instruction manuals to find the elusive 3rd sheet. where was it? ten minutes later i noticed something which had honestly never occured to me - there were actual printed pieces in this set! so obvious and yet so unthinkable. it's horrifying how years and years of exoforce and speed racer set releases can mentally condition people's thought processes. tut tut, lego. what have you reduced us to? here they are, folks - actual printed pieces. (yes, i do believe this news deserves the caps.) i also noticed this nifty modification of the usual 2x3 cupboard - you can now fit drawers in it! very clever. this may have been around in belville sets for years for all i know, but it's new to me. the drawers slide in and out very well and the top one sits on slight indentations in the middle of the cupboard. part 2: the figs! our trusty agents - charge, chase, trace and fuse. (high powered agents don't have time for names of more than one syllable - that's why the bad guys always lose ). chase and fuse have the mutt hair in black and dark orange. the lovely agent trace has an exquisite new hairpiece in dark brown, perfect for 'rapunzel' themed mocs. as you can see, her ponytail is loooong. makes it hard to sit down, the poor girl. i feel sorry for all these female figs with such intricate hairstyles that they can never relax in an ordinary lego chair. however, at least she has two breasts unlike the recent harley quinn fig. compensation indeed. seriously though, it's great that there's a separate torso print for the female character and this attention to detail is typical of the set as a whole. three of the agents have reversable heads - nice touch with the headsets and i like the id cards on their pants. obviously the agents security system is based on some kind of crotch measuring device. this would make sense considering the conspicuous bulges in the pants of dr inferno's men (see the other agents set reviews.) the villains - spy clops, dr inferno, gold tooth. dr inferno's hair in all it's glory. this is a great piece, although the orange colouring is a little rough on the front. it's so 3d, it deserves a back and side view (and indeed eb thread) all of its own. as mentioned elsewhere, this is different plastic to the normal minifig hair, but it doesn't quite feel as soft as the exo-force hair. it doesn't fall off as much, anyway. the figs get 10/10 from me. awesome hairpieces in great colours for the agents and a sleek navy blue/ neon green uniform. the villains' faces are great and they are all very distinctive. the attention to detail is outstanding and it's great to see a lego in-house theme with characters as memorable and cool as figs from the licensed themes . part 3: the build the build is divided into three stages - the small vehicles, the front of the truck, and the massive command center section. (a) small vehicles first up, all the small vehicles. we have a small flyer, 2 buggies, jet ski, and a speed boat - all in glorious navy blue with little bits of silver detailing. top view. these vehicles are all simple, small and well-designed. probably the weakest is the flyer, only because the cockpit looks a little large. in fact, the small flyer is probably the weakest element of 8365 overall, which tells you how good the set itself is! in various threads here, this set has been heavily criticised for being way out of proportion. there's a reason for that, as we shall come to. however, the existence of these small sets should appease some people. with the new coast guard sets, for example, all of these save the flyer wouldn't look out of place on a city beach with a little modding. here's an example - agents beach party! (spongebob couldn't help but crash.) the villains only have one small vehicle, but they've been well-served in the smaller sets, and this one is a unique and clever design. i love the triangular shape and the simple but clever technique of making the arch slopes meet up around the propellers. it's sort of insectile in black and orange, and looks very different from the usual assortment of helicopters etc. (b) truck front this thing is a beast! seriously, look at it. it's chunky and mean looking. you don't want to mess with this baby. the build is really nice. like a lot of star wars vehicles, it's all based on technic beams pinned together. unlike a lot of mars mission sets, underneath isn't all technic beams with some plates slapped on like a facade. the majority is a lot of plates and bricks which all fit together solidly. you can see from the detailing of 'cheese grater' slopes and silver pieces on the front how effort has been made to give this vehicle a distinct feel different to other lego sets. sure, the silver slope mirrors might be a bit too much for some, but this baby is all about attitude. you can imagine it roaring down the road en route to dr inferno's diabolical lair! after all, these sets are 'agents' sets - nobody said they were *secret* agents (c ) command center - whole assembly here's a view of the whole thing assembled - inside and cool details to follow at the end. it's kind of hard to show here as it is extreeeeemely long. this is indeed a big set. the build for the trailer part of the command center is fun and very satisfying. yes, there are large pieces but there is also a huge amount of detail. it is also solid as a rock. i remember being annoyed building the big ferrari truck a few years ago - everytime you looked at it, an 8 x 16 plate fell off. the mobile command center is solid - even with the hinged roof and special features, it is not delicate at all. kudos to the designers, again as it is mainly a brick build rather than a technic one. i also like how the command center part connects to the cabin - it's not a special piece at all, just a technic axle going through two circle plates, but it works and it's solid. (please note i've been selective about which stickers i've applied during the build.) top view: the rear: here's an example of why i like the build: (a) the designers have enough sense to put a ladder so a minifig can climb up to the interior when the command center is open (b) notice that although the ladder clips at the top, there is an *extra* clip there in the middle purely to hold it in place so it doesn't flap around and holds firm. i don't know if most designers would even think to put a ladder there let alone go the extra mile and put a mechanism to hold it in place. pure class. oh, and notice the greebly detail stuff to the right there too. the other side. this is probably the other weak part of the build - the bricky gaps at the top where the hinge to open the roof sits. it's a little gappy but the set is so big you don't really notice. (d) and now for the fun stuff - inside and neat details! ok, so we've built the thing. it's big. it's blue. the top of the trailer itself would make a good warehouse moc for a harbour layout. but what about inside? is it any good? what about all those small vehicles from the start of the review? where do they go? well, i'm glad you asked. because the solution is superb. the small flyer folds slightly and slides into place here: lift off the roof and you're away! the large buggy and the speedboat go under here: the jetski slides out of the rear here, attached to its own little platform: and the small buggy goes inside the main cabin. there's even a crane so you can lift it down. so now we know why this set is so large! to fit everything in! it's amazing that this functionality doesn't affect the aesthetics of the set as a whole. but we still haven't finished on the details. the front section has a very easy-to-swing-open roof section and missiles: there's also a command section underneath the bit where the flyer lifts out: and now for the interior. i have to say i really like this space. not only is it packed with great stuff, there's also enough room for minifigs to move around. i hate bases where the figs only have about 2 studs to actually stand and walk. aquabase invasion is a nice set, for example, but the actual functional space inside the base is teensy. claustrophobia! you know within a week they'd be fighting to toss each other out of the airlock. no such problems for these suave agents, who have plenty of legroom *and* the ability to launch missiles from their ceiling. the whole of the interior: zooming in: moving from left to right. first off, the medicine cabinet. looks like someone's been leaving secret mission dossiers lying around. the projector area for mission briefings. dr inferno recently changed his hair colour from purple to orange, it seems. why are all these minifigs so obsessed with their hair? the projector folds down when the trailer is open. push the button and the light glows on. now dr inferno's hair is orange again! this is one of my favourite parts of the set. it works a charm. the batteries for these lightbricks can also be replaced - instructions are in the manual. agent charge considers shark-fin soup for dinner. did i mention these projection panels are printed? the detail is very fine too. the tool section. laptops sit in the middle compartment. you get some flippers, yellow scuba tank and various implements. i'm so impressed that the helmet is pearl silver with a different coloured visor too - there's so much variation in the parts in this set, you don't get the sense the designers are using the same thing over and over to save money. it all feels luxe and top-of-the-line, just like the command center itself. two laptops - yay! the aforementioned rooftop missiles: the dr inferno cage. nasty electric shocks! bzzt! (you can see my reviewing skills are burning out now - sentences.... truncated...) another example of detail - nowhere else in the set is a 1x1 transgreen tile used - they could have used a 1x1 trans green cheese wedge piece as there are others in the set, but they didn't. how does dr i get out? flick that lever on the right hand exterior and the door pops open. spy clops the loyal minion awaits his master on the other side. and there we have it. take a bow, guys! there's a lot of spare parts. a suspicious amount of dark blue small slopes but i checked the instructions and didn't see anything missing. i have to say, i do like the new policy (since speed racer i think) of including these small slopes as extras. part 4: overall rating if you've made it this far, you've got more stamina than dr inferno's army of cyborg animals themselves! as i said earlier, this set has drawn criticism for the size of the truck. however, large vehicles do exist - i grew up in a wheat farming area and as a kid the size of the lorries that thundered past carrying grain was probably intimidating to me as this monstrous espionage machine is to the good citizens of lego city! on top of that, it *does* contain a plethora of 4-wide vehicles inside ! criticism of this set on the basis of size to me also seems misguided as this is basically a playset - and it is a very good one to boot. as you can probably tell, i love it to pieces and wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone, whether for parts or for play value. check out the parts list in this folderwhen moderated and you can see just how many excellent pieces it contains. a light-up brick, a flood of navy blue, metallic silver bricks - we're spoiled. 8635 is also an enjoyable build, with fantastic figs and top-of-the-line detailing. in a year when i've found city a bit disappointing after the run of great sets in 2006-2007, the agents line has been one of the surprise hits for me and i can't wait to see what the designers come up with next. edited by svelte_corps, 02 june 2008 - 12:46 am.
i see you've also learnt to call dibs. looking forward to seeing your review!! edit: oh, i see! i just arrived early. a truely fantastic review, you make me not want to pass this set up, even though i can't possibly afford it without leaving my beloved castle collecting. it really looks like a fun set, so many neat vehicles, and two laptops, i can't wait to see what other sets we'll see them in. thanks again, great job! ~peace edited by iamded, 31 may 2008 - 09:56 am.
man i was hoping to be the first to review, ordered from tru 2 days ago. oh well this set looks sweet, can't wait for your review.
you know i like many had doubt's about these sets when they were first mentioned, but i've decided i want the whole line now! this set is the créme de la créme. just beautifully stunning! that is a great review svelte_corps, you have gone into fantastic detail and description of all the elements. really it is this review that has persuaded me to buy this set. i blame you! the minifigs are great, the vehicles are better, and the truck and interior is awesome! the few minor draw backs are far outweighed by the attention to detail and the many unique and cool elements used in this set. and printed pieces! that is even better! great job, you have obviously put a tremendous effort in making this review, and i for one definitely appreciate it! i am looking forward to these sets being available in new zealand!
wonderful review - one of the best i've ever seen on this site. man, we thought this might be the weakest set in the line, but it turns out it may be the strongest! everything about this set - from the color scheme to all the details to the minifigures to the piece selection - is just wonderful! i think this set has finally confirmed it: agents is everything alpha team wasn't, and is how they should have done a spy theme from the start. kudos to tlc for finally getting it right - and i sure hope there's a second year!
wow, excellent review, thanks. that set sure looks fantastic. it's incredible how much features they've managed to pack in while keeping it roomy. i'm really impressed by the quality of the design. tlc is sure getting back on track with great design. ow... 2008 is going to be expensive...
i first i thought the whole agents line would not be very good. but boy have i changed my mind! this set looks amazing, as do all of the other sets in the line. i really like how the small vehicles all fit into the truck. i don't like it when sets come with smaller vehicles and don't have anywhere to store them, so they just float on the side. that light projector is fantastic! i can't believe they are actually printed! this is definitly on my to-buy list! thanks for the amazing review!
great review. i just got 7644 mx-81 hypersonic operations aircraft. it's a great ship. i started to review it, but then it started to rain (i was outside), so the review is coming tommorow. technicolor stickers! very pretty!
another great review. i'm looking forward to getting this set sometime soon. i wasn't aware of the power function aspect, similar i suppose to the old technic sets which had an additional instructions for those with the relevant motors. i knew those dino's i got at clearance would come in useful. nice to see the recent "bulldozer" treads appearing in black. grey seemed a slightly unusual colour choice.
excellent review. loving. this. set. i mean, come on, it's a flipping tank! awesomeness is written all over this - from all those blades and scoops at the front to the mini rover. and yes, you can even turn it into a motorized battle tank! reminds me of the old technic days when they advertised in the manuals how to hook up the kits with separately sold motors. another day, another review of an awesome set. yes, this is sure tlc's year!
no, but this is one of the most anticipated sets of 08...
well, title says it. the description, you'll understand later. i ordered this off of s@h last tuesday, and oddly enough, it's listed on s@h as mx-81 hypersonic airplane... i'd like to apologize for the random, horrible, faded pics. i took the review outside, and the clouds kept shifting, changing the lighting, and then i had to go inside because it started raining. it's been raining for a week. it's raining now, as i type this. so, i foolishly went outside to take pics. the front of the box. not bad, as far as boxes go. it features a lift-up tab... ...which shows the various functions. back of the box. still not much to say... two manuals. i think this is just right- not too thick, but not too many manuals, either... oddly enough, the box came with a little folded up piece of paper telling us not to mix the bags. it comes sorted into 4 bags, by the way. minifigures the set features 3 normal mm figs, 1 normal jellie, and one of the new commanders. i really like this guy. he has a few issues, like his hands being stuck sideways, and still being hollow, but still a great improvement. he'll make a lovely addition to any halloween moc. stickers the set comes with a fairly big dss for the spacecraft. pretty normal, but i do like the dragon sticker. then, suprises of suprises, a technicolor sticker sheet for the aliens! how cool is this, huh? the tops of the actual stickers are shiny, which is hard to see in the pic. even the bottom is shiny! who said stickers can't be cool? the mining craft the little guy is pretty cute, and well built. my only gripe is that there's nowhere to spin the drill! it seems so lifeless without a feature... the alien craft you'd think a commander would be important enough to have a seatbelt, rather than be stabbed with a clip and stuck on the ship like those other grunt aliens... i think this thing has some potential. shiny stickers, different body shape. and when you look at those engines, this thing could be an alien corvette! but then you look at the back. pretty bare, no flares or anything. it's a cool little craft, but it just...lacks. the modules these things have some potential, as well. with some modding, they could be pretty cool. unfortunetly, it's pretty boxy, there are no engines, and the wings are too small. the top is pretty nice, though. the greebles are all right. the controls, as usual, are a sticker. pretty spacious, mind you. the cockpit doesn't stay flush with the body, though. the front plate underneath it can be easily replaced with a brick to fix that. ...i'm not gonna comment on this. the main body too bad. the 'labratory' isn't much of a lab. a trans-red panel and some tray thing are all that compose the 'lab'. i was expecting more, but true to form, this mars mission set has no impressive interior to speak of. there is a lot of space, though, so it shouldn't be hard to mod. phew! the lab folds up like so. pretty simple, and would allow access to the lab, if there was one. and then we have this thing. what is it? defense laser? communications array? satellite t.v.? the modules connect like so (sorry, out of place...): too bad the pins stick out... various pics... as you can see, this thing has more of those bars than an at&t commercial... (there, you understand the topic description now? ) the rear. it uses a white city plane wing for the...wings. when i first saw the prototype pics, i thought they slanted downwards... that would've been really cool. ah, now to the platform. from the position of the drill, i think this could be a really cool turret location when i mod it to more military space. back to the bars. if we had space monkeys, they'd love this. this set has more bars than a jungle gym.( ) here we see the button that drops the platform. pretty clever, and it's not in the way. best of all, it really works! really well, actually. good job, tlc. 2 more bars and a shooter mechanism. jeeze, this is really setting itself up for a joke. a shooter mechanism walks into a bar... never mind! here we have the handle that allows you to pick it up safely. a good idea, but it's placed waaaay to far back, way off the center of balance. you have to hold on to it pretty well to keep it angled up, though it does stop your hands from getting in the way of the platform. ah! the platform in action. this is really a neat little feature. not only can the ship land in a reduced footprint, but it also prevents the nice white paint job from getting red dust all over it... it's centered pretty well, too, and you don't have to worry about knocking it over, just don't shove it back at all. here we have the latch. when the button on top is pushed, this gets pulled inward... ...which pulls out of this hole and allows it to swing neatly down. good luck, and happy mining!! again, sorry for the lack of in-progress review. i would've liked to take pics of the mechanism and so on, but typical of the mm sets, you can't really take it apart. well, this is really a nice set, which can hopefully be upgraded with a better lab with little difficulty. some of my military mod plans include: -strip the lab and install a command center -get rid of lots of bars. the thing has more bars than alcatraz. -install some turrets. this is a big command ship, so why all the forward-facing weapons? it'll need some aa defense... -mod the landing platform to be a troop dropper with installable aa turret. -mod the cockpit pods to be more aerodymic. so, that's all folks. shall i include one last "bar" joke?
thanks for the great and very detailed review. i love the new holostickers! i'm still not sold on this set though. i'm not sure why... i think it's the big wing piece and the too-technicy build (from looking at the instructions). the platform seems kind of out of place. and for the size of the set, the functionality doesn't seem as good as it could be. it reminds me of 7699 armored drilling unit - looks impressive but doesn't seem to do that much. i do think mars mission has improved this year though. bar none, this is the weakest of the new mm sets i think.
iron moose, on jun 4 2008, 02:34 am, said: that certainly feels like an homage to the deep freeze defender... which itself feels like an homage to the galaxy commander. thats the observation i had when i saw the first pictures of this set online a few months ago. i am a proud owner of the 6973 deep freeze defender and 6980 galaxy commander, so i'm looking forward to see how the 7644 stacks up next to them. there is a definite lineage here, and these sets clearly demonstrate the evolution of lego set design over the years. the mx-81 may not have the most playability out of all the new mm sets (although it has alot from what i can tell), but its hard to beat the look of a large sleek space cruiser sitting on your shelf or dresser, at least for myself. anyhow, this is my first post to the forum and hope my welcome won't wear out here anytime soon. edited by spacefan, 04 june 2008 - 06:43 pm.
i don't understand why there's so much negativity... this is actually my favorite of the new mm sets. the finished look is very sleek and not very gappy at all. the deployable landing pad is great, and it'll make it easy to put on a shelf without taking too much room. lots of greebles... although i will concede that it's just begging to be modded. still, though, i'm definitely buying this one. :) it has a really great look to it!
two more questions: 1 - how stable is the entire craft when balanced on the platform? is there a chance that it will just collapse? 2 - what are the total wingspan, height and depth measurements of the model?

hey, thanks guys. so you tolerated the bar jokes and faded lighting? radiant7, on jun 3 2008, 09:01 pm, said: i appreciate your review mr. mandalorian, but why the negativity?. i'd try to find more positives about the set instead of kinda criticizing it after each picture. i personally think it looks freakin' awesome!. the size is very impresive and i nearly fell of my chair when i saw the first pics earlier this year. it's quite unlike anything i've ever seen from lego. algernon, on jun 4 2008, 06:34 am, said: i don't understand why there's so much negativity... this is actually my favorite of the new mm sets. the finished look is very sleek and not very gappy at all. the deployable landing pad is great, and it'll make it easy to put on a shelf without taking too much room. lots of greebles... although i will concede that it's just begging to be modded. still, though, i'm definitely buying this one. :) it has a really great look to it! spacefan, on jun 4 2008, 10:38 am, said: i don't understand the negativity either, one man's treasure is another man's trash i suppose. that said, having grown up with lego during the 80's this set has a certain nostalgia factor in its overall look and feel that harkens back to that earlier period in my life which i fondly remember. aside from the factory star justice set (elements of which i loathe), i expect the 7644 to be the closest thing to a classic space revival that we'll ever see again from the lego group, but i hope to be pleasantly suprised someday. though i'm not living in the past, and do appreciate everything lego is doing now and will do, and has done since. and, like you, i'm one who's definitely buying this set. no matter how few of us there may be. i'm sorry you guys thought i was being negative- i actually love the set. it brings a real feel of classic space to mm (no, i'm not talking in the third person. ). however, it does have its own small issues, which are nothing, really. i said that there's not much of a lab- but that's the beauty of lego. there's a lot of room in the ship, so it should be a piece of cake to mod to a bigger lab. too many bars? i'll take them off. i really like the set, i just want to change it to suit my tastes. it looks beautiful- it will find a home among my other mm sets as a favorite. iron moose: good question. it's about 17 inches wide, 11 inches tall (with ramp down), and 16 inches wide. as for the platform, it's pretty stable. it tilts back a small degree so it doesn't collapse when tapped on the nose, but i wouldn't leave it on the edge of a table while in that position.
i think this thing is compensating the poor lab with the bar army.
hello shefols and afols, as well as tfols, welcome to eb news reviews, i am your host...for tonight anyway... shadows will take over after this episode, if we make more... today we are reviewing mars impulse sets 5616 and 5617. starting with 5617 alien jet, i must say it is a small and quick build, the jellie, is made of hard plastic, which surprised me, as i had expected jellies to be a soft plastic. the jet is mainly 2x4 plates, some swingy hinges, the "seatbelt" and a thing which i cannot seem to name my one gripe about it is that the jelly cant see where he is flying, it looks better with a mf in it. there was a red 1x1 as a spare part. we move on to the 5616 mini robot, which is basically a "safe" brick, with binoculars, soem cheese slopes, little arms, and legs. the best part i must say was the metal detector and "safe" brick, as these seem to be quite rare in sets (by my knowlage anyway). the austronaut has a face, shown in dr. sinsters review. the set also comes with a pick-axe and lime green gem. extra peices where a cheese slope, a green 1x1 and a white droid arm. that concludes these mini-reviews. i also will use this opportunity to show my photo setup. both sets are reccomended, if you either need a army, or are just trying to get a variaty of figs like myself. next wee-*camera fades* edited by sinner, 24 june 2008 - 04:17 am.
yes, the beard and hat are leftovers from what was meant to be a athos photoshoot, i was too lazy to remove them so... they are - 2 maps of slovakia and one of europe. stauder.
nice and pretty funny.... i don´t like that little alien thingy but the other set´s quite nice.
hate to admit it but i enjoy staudie's humour more than i enjoy shadow's highlights include the inability to reach the cheese and the acious robot, thanks for the review! batbrick away!
thanks for the nice review - it was one of the first ones i got when emerging from my dark ages . i bought two of these, just for buckbeack - i thought he would make a good statue in a persian temple type moc. i also liked the minifig head pumpkin and plant part in bright green - both new pieces to me at the time. all in all, it was a good castle or forest building set with a nice selection of pieces for rocks, grass, plants and trees. the dark bley plume piece also now appears in the 10185 green grocer set as detailing on the roof of the turret.
guys, thanks for your kind comments! i am glad that you have enjoyed this review. for this set, i think i bought about 7 to 8 sets, all for the griffins. it's used for my griffin riders in my castle collection. now, the green and brown parts come in very handy for castle mocs too. imperialshadows, on jun 9 2008, 11:13 pm, said: a very nice little review of a pretty nice little set that i wish i'd bought between 1 and 10 of. just for the griffin. oh well. your review has shown me that it's useful for more than just that, so maybe i'll try to pick one up someday. can't have too many black capes, books, or printed things. speaking of which: the gray thing is technically a plume, like any castle plume, except in this case it's a feather (presumably from the griffin), and made from the mold to the old indian feathers in the wild west sets. it's a case of an old part coming back for a slightly new use, in a new colour. beyond that, the "stone print" tile is a bundle or rolled up blanket or package, depending on where it's used. i don't think it's ever meant to be a stone. it was used as a rolled up pack on the back of the star wars speederbikes, for example. nice pics, plenty of useful information. i'd give this review an a+ thanks for doing it! i am very happy that you enjoyed and find my review useful. thanks for enlighten me. now, i know where is the origin of that gray plume. i wonder if i can use it to match with my castle knights as its plume. in addition, i mistook the rolled up pack as the stone print tile. why didn't i think of it? i must have overlook it, and used it as a stone tile instead. nevertheless, i am glad you have give me some good insights on the parts that i am not familar with. svelte_corps, on jun 10 2008, 10:49 am, said: thanks for the nice review - it was one of the first ones i got when emerging from my dark ages . i bought two of these, just for buckbeack - i thought he would make a good statue in a persian temple type moc. i also liked the minifig head pumpkin and plant part in bright green - both new pieces to me at the time. all in all, it was a good castle or forest building set with a nice selection of pieces for rocks, grass, plants and trees. the dark bley plume piece also now appears in the 10185 green grocer set as detailing on the roof of the turret. i never thought of using buckbeak as a statue for worship. i find this concept very interesting. yes, i agreed that this set offers new parts at that time. personally, i pretty like the green plant. good for any kind of terrain settings. i did not realise that the dark bley plume piece appear in the green grocer. thanks for pointing out. edited by whitefang, 10 june 2008 - 03:39 am.
ohhh great idea to review the "old" potter sets! especially the line from prisoner of azkaban... i was in my dark ages then. luckily i was able to catch up on the missed figs with one internet order. this draco is the best tlc has made, if you ask me. the new one (also doubling for belloq and "guards" in the indy line) doesn't look quite as hautain as this one. buckbeak looks cool. looks like his neck/head can be moved, right? rather similar to lego horses. well designed. the orange brick doesn't have a pumpkin face on it, right? unlike the one from philosopher's stone in the set with the troll. i'm looking forward to more reviews by you, sir whitefang! good work
i bought about 5 or 6 of these sets when they were on sale in mid- 2006. i still have a few of them laying around unopened. i think i payed like under $5 for each and thats a great deal for all the variety of neat parts you get with this set.
very cool review !
lookin' good so far! though i must say it's doc ock, not dok ock... the catapult is, well, ridiculous, but the boat is very spiffy, and the buoy is a nice addition! i actually like the stickers on the window pieces, perfect for this building, and great for post-apoc scenes. black life-saver rings are a nice addition too.anyway, hurry up dragonator and batbrick! and daisy! i want to see the rest of the review! ~iamded away!
great review as always, batbrick! ) i always enjoy reading them because they really make my day! )))) i hope that we shall see more and more.... good day, gentlemen! )
where is my soap????!!!! haha, anyway, nice review as always, batbrick! i too have the set and hate the wall jutting out, catapult, and missing wall. but hey, review.
brainbox, on jun 14 2008, 07:14 am, said: thanks for the review, even if it is a number of years late. i picked this up whn it came out, and thought it was a rather cool set (besides the catapult). plenty of cool pieces, and the baseplate has found a use in the batcave. although i think my dad managed to spill some beer on it at one point. that was awful to clean off... not late, just delayed beer? and i though playdoh was bad.... brainbox, on jun 14 2008, 07:14 am, said: i wasn't expecting that! there i was, casually scrolling down, when i stumbled onto a picture of me. had to be done, and it fitted your character didn't it adam, on jun 14 2008, 07:40 am, said: where is my soap????!!!! over there! mack, on jun 14 2008, 10:55 am, said: btw as adam mentioned i believe you owe me a bar of soap, for reading your review ... see above. grevious, on jun 15 2008, 03:30 am, said: great review. the hippy and the "story" at the end were hilarious. i think this was easily the best of the spiderman 2 sets. you're right though - it wasn't movie acurate, as the actual movie dock was far shabbier and more trashed than this. ah well, i guess tlc couldn't do everything. thanks grevious, it is a great set. the hippy is awesome, it was hard to take him apart. iamded, on jun 15 2008, 08:46 am, said: wait... dragonator's not caring that he's being held by doc ock? what are you doing? a very nice finish to the interview, now i really want this set! the story at the end was neat (except for spidey dieing! ) but my favourite part was the exploding dragonator. nothing personal mate, it just looks cool when people are thrown into fusion reactors! yes, i agree, exploding dragonators are always hilarious! maybe i should pm him that pic... as for dragonator not caring, it was late and i was getting careless batbrick away!

great review! i wish i'd bought this set when it came out. oh well...
nice review! thanks valentin and a cool collection of prequel fighter you have there 'want'
commanderbly42, on jun 16 2008, 11:11 pm, said: great review! and what are the stands that you used? they look much better than the white bricks that i use. oh, those stands were once cd-r spindles. it's from the container that can hold 100 cd-rs. hi whitefang, can't deny that they were once my fav. hunts for lego, and yes, that price tag is a tad hard to remove. well, while am delighted at the v-wing, i still kinda wish it had come with a printed brick for its instruments panel.
yes i recommend this set it was my second star wars set ever and i must say it was a stunner for me commanderfox
great review!! thanks for posting!
why didn't you open the bags?????
there's something called opening the bag do you do this with everything lego set there's something called opening the bag do you do this with everything lego set
seeming as there were no reviews of this set in the index i have uploaded mine from jabbas hutt . here is my review for lego set 10178 motorized walking at-at because i live in the uk i got this set with 6 free duracell batteries which was great! (it's just twice as expensive as the us) heres the basic set that is from the instructions. this is the cockpit but please note after i took this photo i realised it was slightly built wrong. heres one of the feet in proportion to a minifig to give you a general size. this is luke skywalker swinging on a wire trying to destroy the at-at i really wish lego didn't make so many luke's because i want differnt minifigs. it would also be nice for a thermal detonator piece. underneath the at-at you can see the shaft that moves the back legs, the motor and squeezed in on the righ t the massive battery box. a load of cogs that move the legs. these are the included figures snowtrooper, general maximilian veers, at-at driver/pilot or whatever you want to call him and luke all whithout there wepons. please note veers should have a dark stone snowtroooper torso with 4 red and blue badge things not 3. these are the figures with weapons i gave them and the included ones snowtrooper has new style blaster, veers has standard light grey pistol like the ones from the old adventure sets, at-at driver has old style blaster which i call heavy blaster and luke has shiny handle blue light sabre . the shiny blue light sabre was included with the set which is a bonus because i really dont like the grey ones. http://www.brickshel...sc00521.jpg.jpg this is the switch which is attached to the battery box on either side of the at-at underneath the lift up side panels. you push the forward to walk forward and backward to walk backwards simple eh . a front veiw with the the panels open. here are the drivers controls which are simply a cotrol panel and 2 exo-force robot hands which are joystick things seen in the film if you look closley. the almost useless carry handle. this is the weird back piece. looking down the at-at from the back where you can see the the battery box and switch. troops decending from ropes and cables and vader leading the assult for this i hadnt got any more imp's so i used clones pilots. (i now have a whole load more snowtroopers) solo and chewie sabotaging. more troops to squash rebel scum huzahh! a very bad picture of everyone packed up inside. the size incomparison to its predecessor overall i would give this set 9/10 because it should come with more snowtroopers or it could be and endor version with loads of strormies and scout troopers. aswell as this you can really sit any one down because of the battery box but i stilll find space to put all the shown figures on this review in the interior as you can see on the above image the chains and ropes are hanging down a bit. tjis set is now limited to 5 per customer in the uk and now no longer comes with free batteries. the walking on this is a bit wonky and dosen't really walk like they do in the film as it moves two legs at a time. i am currently attaching a motor to the head to make it move independently.
great review indexing it, as i write this. how come you think the ctt is the at-ats predecessor? do you mean the motorized at-at or at-at's in general? i think this is a great set and i am very fond of mine. it's one of the few sw sets of mine that is on "parade" at all times. most are packed away in the attic. kimt [btw it's not alone, the older version of the at-at is keeping it company]
as far as i know the at-at was a invention by general veers himself? benny
nice job with this review skipper
nice review! i echo the sentiment that more snowies would have been better.
nice review ! the "driver/pilot whatever you call him" ( ) 's helmet looks kind of odd, and why does have a long red pole instead of a kick-butt lightsaber?
vader had a red pole because i think it makes him look bigger and in the films i doubt it is but i think his saber might be bigger.
i never got the set. it looked way to skinny. i came close to buying it for the figs but then decided not to. if you compared this one to the later one there is a big difference. this one just didnt seem proporshined with the legs and its body.
thank you for the review, skipper. i never got this set because it was too expensive, and motorized. it completley reminded me of the old robotic toys called zoids, or maybe even gundum. at least the figs are great. a chrome lightsabe hilt for luke, ecxellent. and the pilot is cool too, and another snowie doesnt hurt. and i didnt even know about the commander guy (whatever you call him), so people could have made a custom ds this whole time?! thanks again!
hmmm, ive still got this set and i must say, i think you did a good job of reviewing it. but... overall, i hate the set, probably the worst ucs set so far (apart from the naboo fighter but that hardly even counts as ucs) from my experience. unless you really really want it and have nothing better to spent your $$$ on, in that case go for it. but in my case, it was a very repetitive build and final model was quite... well, bland, not must variety to it, if you know what i mean.for the price, i would really reccomend the ucs star destroyer, because thats a much better story..
darkrebellion, on jun 25 2008, 12:39 am, said: great review kimt . i like this set (even if i don´t own it) because it looks simple fantastic to display. i just have one question: the mini executor can be moved around the death star ii or its attached to that place? thanks for the review . it's attached to the ds and cannot move as such. though there is 4 "spots" where it can be attached to the ds. reading your comments on this set, i can see why tlg has been forced to put it on sale on the us s@h. i don't agree that the isd is better - imho they're exactly them same - big and grey this is a question of personal liking - which is the coolest ds or isd. not comparative. i'd still call this an ok ucs when looking at it individually, but there sure is a lot other ucs sets that would get a better score than 5/10. kimt
i think it's a very weird and boring ucs set, but... what a lot of grey plates! you could build something much better out of them, but it would be fairly flat. it looks very fragile though , my ucs at-st is... edited by shoc, 25 june 2008 - 10:28 am.
the build was a bit boring and i suppose a big grey ball isn't all that interesting, but since the death star ii in the movie is a big grey ball too, i don't see the problem. i didn't think it was particularly fragile. i don't care about minifigs or playability either. a few plusses: in my opinion it looked pretty damn impressive sitting in my lego room and the construction is really clever. all in all, i actually liked this one, but perhaps i have a different expectation of sets than most of you. sets are mainly parts packs and would you look at the quantity of grey plate in this thing! (it's new grey btw). i paid half price for it at shop@home uk, which is still a _lot_ more than half price from the us, and i didn't regret it for a second. cheers, ralph
i decided to re-read this review because i just got this set today. i dont really have a concern over the design or repeating build process because owning this set was never an option for me as i collect ucs sets... but i am surprised to see an almost total lack of positive posts. i really hope that i enjoy this build.
i've just ordered the bits for this from bricklink (i'm awaiting the final order now) so i'm interested in these comments. i can see that, since i'll be building it with the kids, i'll have to plan in plenty of breaks and do lots of parallel building to keep us all from getting bored!
that's a neat little set. i like the design of the fighter. thanks for the review - it's been keep it up kimt
hey, thanks for all the feedback, guys! ill try to do the sith infiltrator this weekend.

jameseh, on jun 28 2008, 08:24 pm, said: does the sliding cockpit come off easily? my friends brothers breaks everytime you touch it, but he may have built it wrong. it put me off the set. im very sad to say that sometimes it does. but thats only if you hold it from the top and bottom with your fingers and thumb respectivly. but if you hold it in your palm or from the sides, it wont break. emphasis on sometimes. but dont try to mess around with it by removing its pieces or adding new one, or modding it in any way, because the sliding mechanism wont agree with the mods and break. but this hardly takes away from anyone liking this set because, imo, its perfect just how it is.
great set, great review! i have it too and i am very glad to own it! it will probably be the cheapest and best way to get a grievous fig for a while (even though it doesn't come with a cape ). you guys know that you can use the new robot/skeleton arms from the castle sets to make him hold his lightsabers horizontically, right? i always have him with two of each kind of arm.
it's all good... but!(i know, you expected a but ) it's a rat.
thanks for the review. bearing in mind that the whole point of this set is to get a cheap troll warrior, i actually quite like it. the cart isn't brilliant, but for 13 pieces it's not that bad. the troll fig is great as always, and i guess the rats are always nice to get (not so much in real life though). the sets that contain the trolls have a fairly solid number each (i mean, tower raid has three!), but nevertheless i think i may have to pick up a few of these. whitefang, on jul 2 2008, 02:49 pm, said: in addition, the flick missile really works. use a little bit of force from your finger and flick it, the missile will fly. well, it certainly does not impress me at all with such playing feature. the troll's hands are going to get quite sore then aren't they?

hey, your review is great (as usual!!) as for the set itself - well, it's an impulse set after all - small and cheap, nothing special. well, the rat is special, hehe, for me the rat is the most interesting in the set (cause i don't have a rat). i don't have a troll warrior either, but i'm not very interested.
quote in addition, the flick missile really works. use a little bit of force from your finger and flick it, the missile will fly. well, it certainly does not impress me at all with such playing feature. something to toughen up kids fingers! thanks for the review, cant wait til i get this comes to oz!
guys, thanks for your kind comments. it seemed most of us here love this impulse set, mainly to build army. guess, i am a little bit too critic in my review. i was expecting a little bit more! nevertheless, i intend to buy multiple sets of this and build on my orc armies and split them into different battalions. this is indeed one of the better ways to acquire orcs. wilhelm screamer, on jul 3 2008, 11:30 am, said: i got two of these in the mail today and was so eager to do a review of it. thanks for saving me the work. opps, i was eager to do a review as well, when i bought these sets. i hope you enjoyed reading this comprehensive review. nikola bathory, on jul 3 2008, 04:08 pm, said: hey, your review is great (as usual!!) as for the set itself - well, it's an impulse set after all - small and cheap, nothing special. well, the rat is special, hehe, for me the rat is the most interesting in the set (cause i don't have a rat). i don't have a troll warrior either, but i'm not very interested. give the new theme a chance. i feel tlg have made an effort to revive certain elements that are present in past castle themes. although it is not as good as the past, but it is certainly better than the recent castle themes. shoc, on jul 4 2008, 01:00 am, said: why is mouse friendlier than rat? well, mouse sounded more friendly, because it can associate with tom and jerry. but, calling it a rat equal calling it a pest.. it's just a matter of putting it in different terms. that's all. edit: instead of posting another post to explain why i used mouse. i will write it here. tom and jerry is reflected as a cartoon. children associate jerry as a mouse, since its supposed to be heart-warming and make us laugh. in real life, there are many different pets we raised. one of the possible pets we considered is a mouse. mouse are supposed to be shy and friendly creatures that live in harmony. while rats lived in packs, hunt food in the dark and is widely regarded as a "pest". in this review, i am trying to illustrate rat and associate it with mouse by presenting it in a much friendly approach. there is no right or wrong answer. it's just making use of different words to represent how i feel towards a particular thing. edited by whitefang, 04 july 2008 - 08:08 am.
this is a nice way of building up orc armies, but i do wish it was designed like the knight impulse set. there you have a minifig, enough weapons and armor for two figs and a weapons rack made out of basic pieces. add a generic fig from your collection and you have two knights and the pieces from the rack can be easily used in mocs. the pieces that make up the siege weapon in the orc impulse are not as easy to use in other creations. i'd rather have seen a "orcish" weapons rack (different from the knights rack, but like it, using basic elements) with a second helmet, another weapon, the orc armor and a shield to put on it. still, although not as good as the knight impulse, it's a nice little set. whitefang, on jul 4 2008, 03:43 am, said: tom and jerry is reflected as a cartoon. children associate jerry as a mouse, since its supposed to be heart-warming and make us laugh. in real life, there are many different pets we raised. one of the possible pets we considered is a mouse. mouse are supposed to be shy and friendly creatures that live in harmony. while rats lived in packs, hunt food in the dark and is widely regarded as a "pest". where i come from people keep both as pets. however, if either are found in the house uninvited, they are considered pests. and if you look at the chinese zodiac, rats are very well thought of and are symbols of prosperity. the brick mouse rat
hello all eurobricks members, i will be doing a continuation of my impulse set reviews. i was pretty excited when i laid my hands on these new impulse sets yesterday. hope to give most of you a good insight for this set. name: street cleaner theme: lego system / town / city year: 2008 pieces: 22 minifigs: 1 an image of a 5620, street cleaner let the cleaning begin the street cleaner has a job to do. it is to clean the rubbish on the streets, after a new year countdown. it seemed the cleaning agency have a new equipment to use. it's not as big as the previous street sweeper machine. the cleaner will need to operate the equipment manually, by pushing it. look at the mess after sorting out look at the pieces offered. it's not a very complicated set, since it's an impulse set. there are some pretty useful parts lying around such as the broom, spade. however, i was quite surprised when i could not find the lid of the rubbish bin. i can't used this rubbish bin to place it around my town, without a lid on top of it. i believed it is not a norm, by not including the lid. look at that bin well, that rubbish bin seem to be containing his equipment in it, instead of the rubbish. the cleaner's face looks pretty sad. i think he wants to have a change of job. front view i love that blue brush very much. quite fun to play with, especially pushing the rubbish aside. that's why a spade is there to help him to dig out the litter and the broom to brush it away. ok, now i know why his face looks so sad! where is that street sweeper machine? summary review playability: 6.5/10 (not bad to play with) design: 7.5/10 (the design is relatively interesting, with the use of the technic part, to be its foundation.) price: 8/10 (an inexpensive set to get another cleaner and some neat accessories.) overall: 7/10 (not a bad set after all. pretty average, but still quite good to buy if your towns required more cleaners.) hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine. comments and critics are strongly welcomed. pictures can be found in my brickshelf(when moderated) edited by whitefang, 04 july 2008 - 03:44 pm.
thanks for the review . not a bad price (of course, its impulse) for a fig, a little cleaner thing, and two accesories. the brush, fig, and spade i dont have yet, so i might just pick this up.
wow, what a great little impulse set! i relly dig the face as well as a chance to get some cool accessories like a broom, bin (no lid....sigh) and a mushroom top (hat). a really nice review and story too whitefang, i think this guy will be joining my set of lego when he shows up in australia. cheers isc
thanks for the review! poor little minifig: this guy has to haul the heavy machine all the way from the depot onto the littered streets to locate some trash, but when he has finally found some and switches on the machine everything will be launched towards his pants.... no wonder he's looking sad.... a nice set though, and inventive too! when it comes to streetsweepers, i remember getting the first of it's kind on my birthday in 1991.
hello all eurobricks members, i will be doing a continuation of my impulse set reviews. this will be the third review at a go. hope everyone of you will find this review useful in a way. name: coast guard kayak theme: lego system / town / city year: 2008 pieces: 21 minifigs: 1 an image of a 5621, coast guard kayak roll roll, roll your boat it seemed the coast guard has a kayak of his own, roaming in the sea, making sure that swimmers will be safe in the beach. now, i am illustrating him as a life guard instead. this set is simply wonderful. among the 4 new impulse sets, coast guard kayak is the best looking set in my opnion. the kayak design is very simple but looks realistic . furthermore, if you don't need it to be a coast guard kind of stuff. use it as a leisure water spot instead down in the marina. i will think any lego citizen will love to have some water spot in their busy life. so come down here and wind down with this new sport. bits and pieces kayak and the bouy the bouy is very useful to position it at the coast of your water to highlight the boundaries in the sea, and warning incoming ships or vessels. oh, i did not make it tilted purposely. there is a white round base which allow it to tilt on both ends. useful parts these parts are useful to add on in your city. somehow, when i see that red cone, i can use it as a police stop, to inspect vehicles on the road or form a barricade with it. the bouy base shape is unique too. i like it very much. it is great to attached it by the side of the boat as a life bouy. the coast guard's life vest and helmet are very useful for water activites. the life vest was produced in past sets, and now it re-surfaced again. i am glad these vests made their way back. a look of him, without the life vest summary review playability: 7.5/10 (fun to play with, especially the bouy when you see it moving up and down.) design: 8.5/10 (design is simple but straight to the point, especially the kayak design.) price: 8/10 (an inexpensive set to get more coast guards and more kayaks.) overall: 8.5/10 (a very good set to have in your lego town. the kayak is simply so lovely to me.) hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine. comments and critics are strongly welcomed. pictures can be found in my brickshelf (when moderated)
excellent review; i like how the new coast guard sets blare out new when you see them.
i really enjoyed your review of the kayak! so many little things in one set that aren't currently in my collection. i didn't even realise it came with a buoy! cool helmet, lifejacket, face, and oar, i will definitely need one of these! cheers isc
nice review good little set probable one of the only impusle sets i will be geting untill/if they make agents theme impulse sets and i like the neat double-sided face edited by darth_legois_619, 03 july 2008 - 10:35 am.
thanks for your comments, guys! i really appericate it. brainbox, on jul 3 2008, 06:11 pm, said: this is quite a nice set actually. it evokes some of the design elements of the mx-11, while looking different enough to justify me buying it. the head on the astronaut is one i like, so even better. i hadn't realised it was that one actually. does 26 pieces make it one of the bigger impulses sets? i think i may have to get one, if not two... imo, impulse set total piece count should be 30 or less. it will be ideal and more ways to construct a much better impulse sets such as past impulse sets that we came across. i may be wrong, on the 30 piece count thing. but, this is how i view impulse sets. brainbox, on jul 3 2008, 06:11 pm, said: plus it's called 'crystal hawk'. how can that not be considered cool? do you know i bought this set, mainly because it have such a cool name attached with it. "crystal hawk", i simply fell in love with that name.
thanks for the great review. now i just have to have that set!
i really like the look of this impulse set! even though i sold off my mm sets to buy sw i kept my astro fighter and this impulse set really appealed from the moment i laid eyes on it. i feel the swooshability and cool extras like the double sided face far outweigh the lack of cockpit. thanks for another great review whitefang!
once again, another outstanding review by svelte_corps! i am not a very big fan of agents, but this theme defintely offer plenty of useful parts. this volcano base is simply fanastic for parts usage, especially in doing up landscaping, with mountains, by making use of the brown burps. i must admit that the exterior looks real cool, but the interior looks rather empty. these orange slopes certainly make a great illustration of the larva, which gives the agents a hard time to infiltrate within its compound to save his comrade. i am quite sure, this set will defintely attracts lots of kids to coax their parents to buy it, since the bright colors will defintely caught their attention. with all those hi-tech, sleek weaponary, i am sure this is the next big thing for kids out there. well, i am not sure if this theme works for me as well. but this set defintely works well for landscaping project.
thanks for another great review! i definitely like this set. sure, the interior might be a bit bare, but i think that the outside of the base with all of the great lava and rocks more than makes up for it. it is a bit weird that on the one side there is nothing on the inside. but that's easy to fix. anyone know when this will be out in the u.s.? thanks again for the fantastic review!
silent-sigfig, on jul 8 2008, 01:35 pm, said: anyway, the review was great. can we have a close-up of fire-arm's face? that's the best pic i have at the moment, apologies re blurriness. snake, it is released in oz in sept, this baby came from s@h edited by svelte_corps, 08 july 2008 - 04:03 am.
excellent review sc. thanks for sharing. the figs are awesome. i really like the female villain - an excellent face. i also like the agent uniforms. the laser gun is perfect. it has that peter sellers/pink panther dooms day device look that i envision when i think of laser destruction. the volcano has some neat features as well, like the trans. red/orange lava. it is a bit heavy on stickers though, as are many new sets/themes. but overall, i think this set will really appeal to the kids. - a great review of a neat set.
honestly i'm too much of a space fan to be interested in this set. i'd rather have the sub. good review though. :d
thanks for the step-by-step!! set looks great! mmmmm, clawdette....
ah, great review! i have always wanted this set since it came out, but with the price, i think i will get the mobile command center first. this will need serious interior mods, like i did with my dino attack chopper(pics soon).
svelte_corps, on jul 7 2008, 11:03 pm, said: that's the best pic i have at the moment, apologies re blurriness. cool. he looks a lot meaner and more damaged-terminatorsy that his brother.
great review!!! realy thank you svelte_corps! maybey you can put al the agents villains round dr. disco like a sort of dicussionroom or something...just an idea undersigned mowo
thanks for the review svelte_corps, i have yet to purchase an agent set but i think that will change shortly. i am not a big fan of the stickers but the huge laser gun, the unique minifig design, and beaucoup trans-orange pieces have me sold.
when i got this set, my first rock raiders set, i thought it was the best set i ever had. maybe that was a little bit of an overstatement, but i like a lot, the pieces mainly, and this is a nice little review! are92 rowar, on jul 10 2008, 08:22 pm, said: omg iamded's torso! [ spoiler] oh my god!![ /spoiler] what would be more appropriate is commenting on iamded's torso saying "omg jet's torso!"
great review . man, this brings me back! i still have like 5 of those rock monsters. in response to your statement, rock raiders does belong in this forum, being everything space related. 1) it's on an alien planet 2) in the computer game's start and in the story (yes, there was a computer game-my cousin has it) they are in a space ship 3) there are huge alien rock monsters trying to kill them.
rock raiders was one of my favorite lego themes ever.
7663 sith infiltrator year: 2007 number of pieces: 310 number of minifigs: 1 price: 29.99 usd brickset hello everyone, and welcome to my second review on eurobricks, the sith infiltrator! lets start with a pic of the box, shall we? as you can see, its a limited edition set, meaning the fig and set could be worth a lot in the future. this set takes about 20 minuets for the seasoned builder. an overview of the infiltrator (also know as the scimitar): as seen in the picture, this ship is very sleek, with very few studs on top (snot= studs not on top). basically, its the cockpit with two wings (with two "fins" on each wing), attached to the hull. heres a side view of the scimitar: very cool- looking! it lands on two "feet" in the front while the cockpit rests on the ground. rear view: the back. the outer cockpit is beautiful, a printed piece on the back (no dreaded sticker sheet! (dss)) and a large printed disc on top: heres a look at the middle: there is a flick-fire missile (trans-red cone attach to technic pin) on the inner wing, a trans-red lightsaber blade in the back of the hull, and a trans-red lightsaber blade in between the fins on either side. all of those lightsaber blades may come in handy... hey, look: the fins open from the wings!: the fins open due to double hinges on each fin. unfortunately, you have to hold the ship up in order for the bottom fins to open. now, lets have a look inside the cockpit: to open, you lift the back printed part, which is attached to the printed disc on top, which is attached to a hinge. it opens pretty smoothly, but is somewhat loose, so sometimes it closes on its own. also, the disc isnt secured well enough to the door, and often breaks off, even with the smallest movement to it. inside, there is an elevated control panel and two sliding pieces near the floor. this ship also comes with a small speeder bike: its very cleverly built, and is a really neat addition. see that clear disc on the bottom? it fits perfectly into the sliding pieces in the cockpit: hmm... whats this?: a hidden compartment! now this was a very cool idea by tlg, a secret compartment found by taking off the top slope of the hull contains darth maul's weapons and tools which include: a (chrome!) lightsaber hilt, a pair of electrobinouculars, and three probe droids. a closeup of a probe droid: just a plain, black minifig head with a black lever on top. finally, the fig: darth maul in the flesh plastic. a good fig altogether, with a black hood and lightsaber blades taken from the ship. he did come with a crisp, new black cape (packaged in a small, white cardboard box), but i am currently using it for another fig. note that this is a limited edition fig, so stock up. a comparison pic of the two mauls: the 2007 version is on the left, and the 1999 version on the right. note a few key differences between the two: the new one has smaller red tattoos and a smoother torso. also, the new one has bigger eyes and a more cartoony look. maul on the speeder bike: of course, he fits perfectly in the cockpit wile sitting on the bike, and he can reach the controls: well, thats about it, here is the... final verdict: build: 8/10, easy and fun, breaks every once in a while. playability: 7/10, this set has many features, but is very fragile between the cockpit and hull and between the two cockpit pieces. swooshability: 1/10, too fragile to fly around, plus the flick fire missiles fall out. minifigs: 9/10, a great fig with a chrome hilt and a double sided blade. a little cartoony. design: 7/10, very clever techniques, very sleek, but very fragile. price: 8/10, fair enough, could be a few dollars cheaper. overall score: 6.5/10, a very sleek ship with clever building and play techniques, but very, very fragile, and shouldnt be picked up off of the shelf too often. and with that, my review is over, but all of yours are not: comments and thoughts very welcome!! edited by jimbutcher, 15 september 2008 - 02:59 am. indexed
this set looks like a dandy. is the darth maul fig any different in respect to the torso or head design to the original?
i'll be honest - i don't like this ship at all. it's one of my least favourite ships in the pt and i have to yet buy either one of those sets. i also found it funny that this set was meant to be a walmart exclusive yet never appeared on the shelves at my walmart. anyhow, thanks for the review!
i'm not real fond of slimeface. he looks too much like the joker-bombs. i was hoping for something newer. the slime printing is a nice touch though. steve
great review. i love that slime face !
thanks for review...(i hope svelt corps still reviews it ) slime is pretty cool, i knew about the torse for a while but its no less cool now

nice review rezourceman, i wanted to see one of this set. it seem's there isn't much to it other than what it looks like in the official pictures, but i may well get it. i like slime face!
thanks for the review! it's great to see detailed pictures of slime face. the set looks good but not as good as some of the others in this line. great review!
i feel like a n00b asking, but what is the usd price? i didn't see a price in the review.
nice review, thanks! tlc is really going all-out with the agents theme. i wonder if it will last longer than one year (unlike other recent one-and-done themes). my only real criticism of the theme is those freaking stickers. my god, look at the size of that dss in this set!
great review!! really thanks i slime face, even slimey as my slime sense nice that break jaw is also in it! undersigned mowo
aside from the price, i love this set! when i saw the prelim pics of agetns i did not like the theme, but all the sets are starting to look more attractive now i can see the cool features and details! as for this set, i really like the bad-guy boat for some reason and the submarine looks good - i love the dark blue colour.
batbrick, on jul 19 2008, 09:53 am, said: is it impossible or just very hard to mod? nothing is impossible to mod! probably the easiest part to change would be the front where the missiles are and the treasure chest slides out - you could make a sizeable compartment there. however the middle section is so narrow and the end fins are just that - fins - that it might be harder to expand without changing the shape of the sub. you'll find out soon when yours arrives! batbrick, on jul 19 2008, 09:53 am, said: the octopus sounds great, thanks for that, is he meant to be on any side? i'm guessing he's a mutant inferno creature. about slime face, is his head much different to the joker bombs? i know he has slime marks on his head, are they very apparent? it's not really clear but since all the other mutants are evil (or at least controlled by dr inferno), it's probably a safe bet the squid is too. slime face's head is different to the joker bombs - different eyes and teeth (although the smile is similar i guess) and the slime marks are much more apparent in the flesh (or abs) although they don't photograph that way. joker bomb face below for contrast:
great looking set. and that glowy blue octopus is really cute, i might just get it for that. be great in a space moc.. wondering, from the pdf instructions i saw, it wasnt clear what the agent in the sub is sitting on, hows his seat work? and it looks like theres a compartment below him...

thanks for the review. this is one of my favorite space sets of all time. i even had 2 of them back in the days. my only complain about this set was that i found that the wheels where too small , i had some trouble passing the rover over the little "craters-mountains" of the space plates
dovchenko, on jul 10 2008, 08:24 pm, said: no more of your great reviews? why? a good review right here, got into the thick of the set without becoming boring with an absence of pictures or not having enough text. i've exhausted my collection of classic space sets. i'd love to keep them going, but just one more set. you can check out this index for a complete listing and links to each of the reviews. thanks for the feedbback. mutex, on jul 10 2008, 09:37 pm, said: this is one of my favorite space sets of all time. i even had 2 of them back in the days. my only complain about this set was that i found that the wheels where too small , i had some trouble passing the rover over the little "craters-mountains" of the space plates it is a gem in the classic space collection. the playability is great! i agree with you as i never thought this was much of an all-terrain vehicle with the wheel construction. the bottom of the vehicle would always touch the bottom of non-smooth surfaces. the wheels do need to be bigger (but i still like them). cp5670, on jul 10 2008, 10:43 pm, said: i got this set off ebay a while ago and one of them was broken in shipping, even though the set was otherwise in display model condition, and the other one broke off while i was building the set. i replaced them with the newer variety. great buy on this one. what did it cost you? hewman, on jul 10 2008, 11:11 pm, said: not in attempt to hijack your thread but to add to it, here's a pic of my blacktron 1 version of this beautiful set. that's excellent. i love the alternate color scheme. great job here! whitefang, on jul 11 2008, 12:11 am, said: however, there is one thing i don't understand about this design. why is the driver seat has a wide back with no cover behind? and, the command center has no door at the back? i understand that these space guys are always carrying their helmet around, for oxygen supply. i wonder if there is a better answer to it. yes. the extra space was probably for the oxygen tanks on the figs. it makes taking them off a lot easier. as for the lab/control center, i never had an issue with it being open. i think this was just for playability. one could always "pretend" that some sort of invisible force ray closed the side when activated. great comments! i love hearing what others think of these classics.
oh man, this review takes me back! i got this set when i was 8 years old, and loved it. i remember modding it to remove the lab in the back, and i put in a giant laser cannon instead. 'cause when you're 8 years old, everything needs a giant laser cannon. cp5670, on jul 11 2008, 12:43 am, said: the only bad thing about this set is the name. it can't even roll over a single plate's height. not very "all terrain" at all. ha! very true. the vehicle is built so low to the ground that the front end catches on everything.

this set never got me as a kid. i suspect it was because of the wheels; i had mostly basic sets so it would have been more of the same. looking at it now i can see i have misjudged it, and i love the lab-lift method. i'm going to have to build this to see it in action! thanks for another great review.
awesome review brickster! i didn't you are also a space fan oh how i love classic space the all time perfect lego space related theme everytime i see one i want to buy them more and more, when compared to modern fang dangled sets with detailed figs and cool new accessories, they have nothing on classic space, simple beauty maybe its the blue/grey/trans yellow color scheme classic space forever edited by piranha, 30 august 2009 - 07:51 am.
i love the sponge bob sets, i have all of them! nice review.
great review. as much as i hate spongebob lego, i just might get this set. it has a good number of useful parts, like the computer and keyboard, and all of the brown pieces. how much does this set cost in usd?
lots of yummy pics in the review thanks! hmm a double sidied minifig, with a painted top! thats the first time i have ever seen this done!?!? this is a great set and has recieved as evideneced by a lot of "is it new" questions, is sponge bob sets available in auzzi land? i have not seen them in shops... regards cpt. pb
i ordered the set via s@h and it cost 34.99€ in germany, 37.99€ in belgium and 50$ in australia. it looks like it´s a exclusive set, but without the 2limited edition" sticker on the package. in the usa it´s not aviable, now. i think it costs as much as the rocket ride (30$). @ mrs pegleg: he has the same, short pants, like in the other sets.
the fish doctor is supposed to have a new torso.
ronan nissen, on jul 15 2008, 07:09 am, said: the fish doctor is supposed to have a new torso. says who? i think the one he has is fine...
i never have buy a sponge bob set but this looks so cool so maybe... (just maybe) i will buy it . i am curious of why tlc haven´t done the flying dutchman ship, it was in the first rumor list of sponge bob sets, that surely will be a must .
awesome, light blue train doors. yummy! it is quite strange that spongbob has become the best source for train parts: the baby blue doors, the orange round windows ,...
the official name for this lego set is "the emergency room". i have all the other spongebob sets, including three krusty krabs, two bikini bottoms, as well as one of everything else , now all i need to do is wait until next month to buy this set if i find it at my local toys "r" us. that spongebob minifig looks cute.
this set doesn't have much playability, but the hospital is better than the one released by lego recently. it has more detail. i like it.
nice review, nft! i´m not that much into spongebob, but these two pieces just for themselves are interesting to get: container cupboard 4532 and cupboard drawer 4536 the latter not being sold for the last 6 years! both together are an excellent way to create detailed interiors. 6 of those for me, please!
there's a lot great pieces in this set, i would be willing to get the set just for them. thanks for the great review!
my fish doctor has the torso from 7902 doctor's car, which is unfortunate, because the other torso is more stylized and cartoonish, i think. however, i did have that mad scientist lab set, so a bit of digging through my old collection will hopefully yield the better torso.
i recently bought this set for my daughters birthday. it's the first belville set that i've bought for her so it's a bit of an experiment. the house is 5 rooms and it's made up of mostly large pieces. there still is a decent amount of normal lego in it though. the doorways in the house align when it is opened out. starting with the bathroom, included is a shower, toilet, sink with vanity and a baby potty. the mirror sticker is one of the few that i put on. the open plan lounge/kitchen/dining room is well appointed as well and it has a nice glass table and coffee machine. the kitchen chairs are fabuland parts... and don't work really well. it seems they are having jellyfish for dinner! the clock is the only printed part in the set. upstairs is a baby room and the master bedroom. the radio and the tv (not shown) were stickers to my disappointment. up top is an extra room suitable for reading. (those antenna things were made from spare parts by my daughter. i have no idea what they are supposed to be... ) there are some stickers that go on the back, but i didn't put them on. as it is the set looks ok this way, but since it is a dolls house it doesn't really matter. i do think though that the fireplace should have been given a back. the bbq is made from normal parts and is quite effective. i think it uses the same light brick that's in the 4998 stegosaurus set. my kids were using it as a torch before my grumbling ruined their fun... like all belville sets, the highlight is arguably the accessories. i'll be borrowing a few of these from time to time... here is the controversial baby catapult. as you can see, it works ok, but lego probably should have tried a bit harder. we also bought for her 7583 playful puppy. it also comes with some nice accessories, but not enough to justify buying unless you want the rest of the parts. poor puppy; where does he sleep? here is my daughter assembling it. she made me make the house though as she wanted to play a game we bought her. (note the lego drink bottles! ) i didn't take any photos of the figures as they don't seem to be anything new, but i can if people want me to. at the time i was in bit of a hurry as i took these before bed so i wouldn't be stressed if the kids broke it the next day. overall, these sets seem overpriced to me, and hard to justify unless you actually want a buildable doll's house. (which we did.) it's still too early to tell if my daughter likes it or not... but at this stage it seems she lost interest in a few days. she does tend to go back to toys though. edited by whitefang, 23 may 2009 - 07:03 pm. indexed
mommy and daddy are naughty!
yay! it's good to see your kids get to build some stuff too, sinner . all through the review i was thinking 'this was a present - but who actually put it together?' so i'm glad the last pic cleared things up as for the set - it looks much bigger than i expected - i think it does make a good sized dollhouse. there are a stack of nice pieces in there - cupboards, oven, trans-blue 2x5 bricks, all the accessories, plants, flowers, food, the light-up brick, the pink roof slopes - but not enough to justify the $aud129 retail price. maybe on sale i'd pick it up and resell the belville figs but david jones hasn't even had a regular 20% off lego sale for the whole of this year that i've seen. i think the playful puppy set is a horrendous ripoff for $aud20 though. i agree with the baby catapult - the range is terrible. lego just isn't trying any more, is it? at least they've moved on from throwing cats off three storey buildings. 2 questions though. 1) was it a fun build? 2) are those large figs anatomically correct under their frou-frou finery? if not, what the hell are they doing in the second pic whilst baby sylvia explores the oven?
great review, and i note something like a bucket in the dog set... shame its not blue... as for the fire place piece i love it and i want one, ever since finding it on mlcad!!! i love the bbq, it looks so good!, you know i might even buy this, it it was not so pink! now as for the kiddies, in ovens, make sure they are not over cooked they can be stringy , and as for the couple up stairs, now we at least know what you do with your mini figs when no one is looking/ lego sets in public places , just following your name sake i guess and i must say lego, shame, shame, that catapult needs reviwing, hardly even make a dent in a castle wall! regards cpt. pb
nice review, good to see your almost letting your kids play with your lego i like the functionality of the baby catapult, its good that they include some working features in a build this big! are you not showing the figures because its really hugh hefners playboy/belville mansion? i dont see the grotto though, must be an add on set like the poor puppy! its just so darn pink
great review sinner, i haven't seen a bellville set review before! i just realised what you meant by 'fore' in the topic subtitle, too. imperialshadows, on jul 12 2008, 09:31 am, said: obviously, it really is all about the accessories, and it's got 'em, but not enough to make me spend that kind of cash, and i don't even mind having a pile of pink parts around. i agree, a lot of the pieces are good but i don't think i would get it. however, i do think i will get the set with the dogs, so my minifigs can have giant mutant hounds! jimbutcher, on jul 12 2008, 06:45 pm, said: and look what you found... a bucket! a bucket, in disguise as a watering can...
sinner!!! you know, i had never seen a belville set in any review with such great pictures before! i just can't take my eyes off, in the master bedroom. the scene is quite, a little hot. enough of me, peeping up there. let's take a look at the interior. i am very surprised by its construction of the house. it's quite big and is nice of you to buy a great sweet gift for your daughter. i am very sure, she will enjoyed playing with it. somehow, it reminded me of barbie doll products. maybe, its too pinkish for me. the accessories is the "plus factor" in any belville sets. it offered quite a handful of great accessories to add into any types of mocs construction to add in the plus factor in it. sinner, you are a very nice dad! i like how parents, buy educational toys for their children to expand their imaginations instead of sitting in a couch playing video games and etc.
thanks for your report and the pics, my sister wants this set, but she's already got the last house and she doesn't play very often with it, but the new one looks very good, too
i'm confused... the finale of big brother australia was last week. so why only now are we seeing pictures of housemates brigette and ben performing a striptease? and where is rory in his signature g-string? very odd.
7655: clone battle pack year: 2007 number of pieces: 58 number of minifigs: 4 price: 9.99 usd brickset welcome to my third review on eurobricks, i hope you enjoy! while at any store that sells lego (target, wal-mart, tru, etc.), you will notice that the clone battle packs on the shelf are way fewer in number than the droids battle pack. as you might guess, the clones are way more popular, and finding them gets harder and harder as the release date of this set goes farther into the past. so stock up! alright, heres a pic of the box: a small box, as expected for inexpensive sets like these. note the "build your army" button on the front: tlg obviously is encouraging customers to buy multiples, and with good reason, which will be explained later in this review. well, lets get straight to it: the contents of this set. you will notice a speeder bike, a gun turret, and some clones. looking good so far! lets have a look at the turret: an excellent star wars element to have around, especially for mocing. it is very cleverly built, using a tire guard from city sets for the general shape of the turret mount. all you have to do is attach the (new mold! explained later) gun to the 2x1 plate with the center stud, and... presto! i wonder how the clones build these turrets to fast in the middle of battle... a rear view: with a clone mounted: my only gripe about the turret is that you have to take off the gun in order for every clone to have a gun. now, we move on to the vehicle of the set, the speeder bike: a rather sleek and good looking bike, with some useful pieces on it as well, such as the blue cones, the megaphones, and the engines. some say it looks bare without the figs mounted on it, but i think it looks just fine. the commander drives while a trooper shoots on the back. a side view: and a rear view: my only gripe is the same as the turret: you have to remove the back gun for all the clones to have weapons while on foot. the back pistol attaches to a 2x2 round studded plate with a technic hole in the middle. finnaly, here are the new guns: this set comes with 1 new blaster rifle and three new pistols. it could have included one more rifle for the turret. and of course, the figs: includes: 1 yellow commander (lovely fig), 1 shocktrooper (comes with a pair of elctrobinouculars), and two regular troopers (so clean and white). the figs are excellent, all that any sw or lego fan should want. it could have maybe included one more regular trooper, but that might be pushing it. thats all for now, folks, here is the... final verdict: build: 8/10, extremely easy, should take the seasoned builder about 5 minutes to complete. a fun build, though. playability: 5/10, i guess you can get this with the droid battle pack and make them battle, but this set has no real play features of its own. but it is good for collecting troops and using them for mocs. swooshability: 9/10, i guess you can zoom the speeder bike around... minifigs: 10/10, four great figs that should be bought in multiples, a great army builder. design: 10/10, a clever turret, an awesome speeder, and four great clones. what more do you need in a 10 dollar set? price: 8/10, not bad i suppose, but if you calculate a dime for each piece, this set should come out to 5-6 dollars. but still, billions of these are being sold world-wide, and tlg is making a ton of money off of them. overall score: 9.5/10, a truly memorable set, one that will be a favorite for ages to come, and very popular. a great army builder for a small price, plus vehicle and turret! with only a few very minor flaws, this set is one of the best of star wars. and this concludes my review, and as always, comments are most welcome.
nice review! i got over the gun problem with the shockie since the rebel in the y-wing doesn't need one. i wish i could have gotten more of these but i'll know for next time.
when i saw this topic i was like : "oh my god this set is out since 2007. this guy is so late!" but i read your review and this idea got out of my mind! thank you jim! i have 2 of these and i even have twice more droids than clones! i should have buy more but it's sold out now

thanks for the review... ...unfortunately the droid battle pack is discontinued for the uk s@h ...also the clone battle pack is discontinued for the usa s@h ( for the americans)

thanks for the review. i want to add that the few parts which are contained in this set are very usable for own mocs. the rancor, on jul 12 2008, 11:11 pm, said: ...unfortunately the droid battle pack is discontinued for the uk s@h ooops - it's also not available in germany any more.
thanks for the review jimbutcher . i think this set is cool especially the cool redesigned stap i just it.
great review! but for the car: i don't like the color combination of red+blue
great review of a lovely set! thank you! sadly i don't see my 6641 really often, because it is kind of in the back of my shelf. but i might get it and swoosh it (?) a few times...! imho i think 6675 is a little bit more aggressive. cool! please make more!
whitefang, on jul 13 2008, 11:25 am, said: the wheels are pretty different. i don't remember seeing these wheels in many other vehicles, maybe some members can help me on this. first of all, another great review! thanks for doing these! as for the wheels, these were primarily technic wheels but did find their way into some other models. in white, i can only find a handful of minifig sets that they are included with. there's half a dozen space sets but, apart from the 4-wheelin truck, the only other town set appears to be the 6524 blizzard blazer (tractor with snow plough). the wheels were also in a train set called 4549 road & rail hauler where they were the wheels on a big forklift. cheers rog
love this set! nice review also.. i had the set in my hands a few times but never bought it, though i drooled at it, i remember. i guess i didn't get pocket money at that time, it was not that common around europe in the 80s i guess. so better to say that no one bought it for me.. a few years later i got the safari truck, which is also really sweet. i like the colors of this model and the detail of it. the minifig is really classic, made only for this set (appears in some later train sets as well) and shows the exact image of the truck on the shirt, including the motor piece. one of the most detailed and loveliest little sets from a sweet era of legoland city! ps voted "o" for outstanding. edited by zzz, 14 july 2008 - 09:50 am.

wow! oh set 4999, how do i love thee, let me count the ways: 1)an attractive cottage 2)a usefull service van 3)great parts including green burps! 4)responsible energy for my lego town! this would be the perfect addition to my seaside village. by the way, what is vestas?
omg, i have seen the light! will it be availeble from s@h? or is it just a promo? thanks for making my day wonderfull! dr. brick
wow, it does look really cool. i love that...oops! it's gone. can't post pics of that yet, sorry. it was requested that we remove those pics. sorry everyone. have a nice day.
i wish i had seen it.... judging by the reactions it is a pretty good set!
whitefang, on jul 14 2008, 11:23 am, said: hinckley, is it ok for me to share a picture or two on the vestas exhibition that happened few months ago in singapore? don't worry, it's not anything related "directly" to the vestas promo, wind power plant. er...is this a test? are you working for tlg now? i'm being watched you know. they're outside my window... so, no. not if the set appears in the pictures. and if they're just of the convention, post them in community...
sounds cool but i can't seem to find any of these leaked pics, not even on brickshelf. maybe i am not searching under the right phrases. oh well. i guess i can wait patiently.
wow! managed to find a pic on brickshelf and this is a great set. hope it going to be released properly and not just a promo. one thing though, would it not be quite noisy if you lived in that house
filefolders, on jul 14 2008, 07:29 pm, said: what's so great about the cottage? i do agree that the generator and van are teh pwnzorz. i think the great thing about the cottage is its very reminiscent of classic holiday home type houses that lego used to make like this one from the late 80s which a lot of people (me included) believe lego need to make more of.
ok guys, respect tlc? crazy policy (they don´t take care about thiefs selling those sets long before official release,but they complain about one small photo on web ). if someone still needs photo, simply email me on josefzizka@post.cz, i will be glad to send you three pictures

my sister got this from our grandparents once when she was interested with space but it fell into my hands later. i had a lot of fun with that. by the way, the name for the test thing is called a centrifuge. it tests a person's ability to withstand high g-forces. edited by filefolders, 15 july 2008 - 03:55 pm.
*mini-bump* wow, i'd completely forgotten about this theme, which is suprising since i absolutely loved this theme as a kid (minus the sound n' light brick, which i thought was pretty big and ugly). sure brings back memories of looking at those little catalogue booklets that came with the sets.
thank you very much for the review. now i remember! i got mission control when i was only 5 and built it with the help of my older sister. i loved it so much, i never rebuilt it but now... i just have to! space simulation was one i never got but looks to be a great set.
do the manga guards heads fit on a regular minifig torso?
update: i will be merging reviews as they go idle, this is now the dino attack review thread "what, jay's not doing viking reviews!?" nope, i think christopher110 took care of those just fine. instead, i have brought you what is most possibly the highest-anticipated set of the year (;) :d) - the t1 typhoon. and i gotta say - dinos apart, it's actually really cool. the dinos let's get the worst over with. yes. those are all the parts in that 'dino'.
the base of the propeller. it wobbles a bit, but doesn't fall off. very sturdy. right side of the rear propeller. and the left (and better) side. the tail. it uses construction similar to the x-wing's nose, but on a larger scale. definitely cool. a very neat part of the copter. the guns are constructed so that... ... they turn without turning the cockpit. the interior is rather blase, though.
i really want those figs.....damm you bloody jay!!!
that looks like a really great set, although i don't think i'd have anywhere to put it. i don't think i'll ever be able to get the set anyway, since it doesn't come out over here.
no, there aren't any pictures yet.
photos are not available, but basically it is: -guns +chains +ropes +crates
i guess we'll have to wait for the photos! officially announced by lego, the dino attack line is going to be made available in europe in october 2005... edit: check out the official dino attack site here!
thanks bloody jay! any chance you could be reviewing the other dino attack sets?
mr. lego_bildur, on jul 25 2005, 10:11 pm, said: thanks bloody jay! any chance you could be reviewing the other dino attack sets? possibly the steel sprinter and urban avenger, but i can say with finality that i will not buy the tank until i find it available for $30 or less. on that note, if anybody does find it for $30 or less, shoot me a pm. ;)
sorry for the double post, but i just had another question in mind: how long/high/wide is this "badass" copter? (including rotors). i have heard of as long as 25 inches for the length, but is this true or is it just an exaggeration?

wow, i think this is the first time i'm the first to have a new set (at least here) and review it. got it 2 days ago, thanks to a fast shipping from s@h this time, and i found time now to review it now. enough of the babbling, let's let the facts and pictures speak, which actually turned out pretty well this time. set nr.: 4210 name: coast guard platform number of minifigs: 4 number of pieces: 469 release year: 2008 a few shots of the box first: 2 books of instructions we got here, first one for the helicopter second one for the rest and the platform itself: a general overview of the platform from above: the 4 minifigs, 3 rescue guys and one oil rig worker (?). the pilot seems not very happy that he has to work in the middle of nowhere at sea right beside the entry of the tower we have the diving equipment holder: next, the guy can jump in this little speedboat... ...and another guy brings it down to water with the crane: if somebody is rescued from the air, he arrives here and is brought to the tower with the little moving platform than runs on "rails": down under we got a buoy and several life belts and extinguishers: with the lift somebody who is rescued by the boat can be brought up. i think it would been better if they would have made a mechanism there to bring it up, but it's okay: a few floors higher the sea is being observated and watched: on the ground level we have the medical station/warm-up room: the helicopter as stand-alone: all in all for me this is besides the police station the city set of this year. it's got great features, and looks fantastic and also has many useful pieces. you can't do anything wrong with buying it, 10/10 for me! that's all for now, hope you liked my review. edit: oh damn, i forgot to write "review" in the topic title, can a mod please add this? thanks!
thanks for the awesome review, metalandi! your pics are very clear and you go into detail about all the functions of the set. i agree, this is a great set - one of the best of the cg line for sure, way better than the boat set with the tower on the bionicle baseplate, and cheaper too. i even like the helicopter better than the oversized version. lots of great parts and a really nice build by the looks of it too. i can't wait for this to be released in oz!
good review ;) i will buy it this year :)
thebrickster, on jul 18 2008, 02:35 pm, said: excellent review metalandi. it's always great to see early pictures of new sets. this set really reminds me of an oil rig, and could probably be easily modified as one (if one wanted an alternate model). the two components that i like most are the boat crane and the control room, but other sections are pretty slick as well. are those printed pieces in the control room, or stickers? i'm really starting to gain an appreciation for these new coast guard sets. they've come a long way over the years: http://www.majhost.c...guard/09set.jpg 575 coast guard station -released 1978. i picked up the control boat & tower (7739) a few weeks ago but haven't opened it yet). in any case, thanks for taking the time to review this set and share it over eb. first, thanks to all your great response for my review, i'm glad you like this set aswell. as it comes to stickers, the tiles ant slopes in the control room are printed pieces! the rest as coast guard logo patterns and so on are stickers. i forgot to make a photo of the sticker sheet unfortunately
i it!! i dont think i'm gonna buy it but i loved the review nice oil rig worker; he looks so rough undersigned mowo
thanks for the great review. i'm loving this set a lot - it looks well designed, and the helicopter is awesome! plus, i love the new worker figure with the beard. quote i agree, this is a great set - one of the best of the cg line for sure, way better than the boat set with the tower on the bionicle baseplate i wouldn't say that at all - true, this base is bigger, but the other set was well designed as well - plus the included boat is wonderful.
is there any way to order one of these if you don't live in france or one of the countries where s@h sells it?
the worker looks like he soiled his pants um oh yeah... nice reveiw! very cool set... im not sure about the bottom floor glass being dark grey and the top floor glass being light blue.
nice review! this is just the "crown jewel" for the coast guard theme. i love the layout of its platform. it looks real neat to have it placed it in the midst of the deep blue sea, awaiting of any emergency rescue. sometimes, i feel that this set can used it to merge with my aqua raiders sets. i thought of using it as a land base, for the raiders to dock in their stuff before submerge into the ocean. ok, it's just a wierd idea of mine. just feel that aqua raiders and coast guard can work hand in hand, since they are naval expertise! it seemed, i can't view all the pictures somehow. nevertheless, i can still view some of it quite well. i love the command center. the amount of computer printed pieces simply make me smile, with the monitor, keyboard, radar screen and etc. the helicopter is cute too. however, i pity the victim that is loaded at the back. it seemed a little bit too dangerous. in addition, this set seemed to have quite alot of stickers, which can be quite discouraging. i do hope to see this set soon. so far, i quite like the current coast guard sets.

paramedic unit set #: 6364 year released: 1980 piece count: 140 minifigs: 2 list price: unknown well, let me first say that the english name, "paramedic unit" is not really a good name for this set. the function of a paramedic is to take a patient from an emergent situation, and deliver them to a hospital for treatment, generally an emergency room. this is a rather small "clinic" that i would imagine is more for family care than an emergency room. in addition, the car looks more like a doctor/nurse's car rather than an ambulance or emergency response vehicle. i would call this a "clinic" rather than a paramedic unit. in any case, it's a great set, esp. for table towns that need medical services. what i like is that this set is small enough to place anywhere in your lego city or town. starting with the instructions: like all the classic town sets, alternate models are pictured, although i never tried building one: i like the little medical bus/van. the set includes two minifigs, that include a female doctore or nurse, and what i presume is a patient, based on the torsos: i really like the vehicle. it's a 4-stud wide two seater: the colors work well and i like the use of the white bar between the seats (and the 1x1 blue plates for lights). unfortunately, the emblems are stickers. here's a shot of the neat little "clinic": i like the use of the blinds for the exam room. it shows that lego considered patient privacy when making this set. the interior includes an exam room, desk, and two blue swivel chairs: and a neat little eye chart: although the letters l e g o would have made a nice touch. lastly, a picture of the complete set: i must admit that i remember buying this set back in the 80s and i regreted it after taking it home. i'm not sure what i didn't like about it (perhaps the "girl" back then), but now i really think it's a neat set. well, there's a line of patients waiting to have their eyes checked... comments welcome.
thanks a lot for the review, brickster! i never had the chance to get some classic town sets, but i wish i couldve! i just wonder why lego cant release sets like this anymore....
thanks! i own this set...! it was a good time as tlg released a lot of little buildings. (just look through the 63xx-setnumbers)
grevious, on jul 19 2008, 10:04 am, said: wasn't this the first hospital with modern minifigs? (because i seem to remember seeing an even older hospital online that had the armless, faceless figs). you're correct. this was the first: hospital 555
whitefang, on jul 18 2008, 09:11 pm, said: paramedic unit, does not seem to suit well for this set's name. it should be named as clinic, outpatient treatment, family doctor and etc. the definition of a paramedic is "...someone who assists physicians in providing medical care..." i think in more modern times a paramedic is generally thought of as a more qualified and experienced ambulance technician but the dictionary definition would seem to fit with the lego model quite well. cheers rog

i like this set, like most i view it more as a clinic, it sits nicely in my town plan. these old sets are all very cool
i rate this a 5! one of my last sets before my dark age. suspension wheels are superb and are rare! the minifig, although smiling, really looks tough because of the tanktop. oh did i say im giving it a 5?
i remember building this set back in the day good set, i'll give it a 4.
another great review, whitefang. this is a wonderful 80's vehicle - and i think it might be one of the first - if not the first - that had the spring suspension system. i know of at least one other set that had that: the biggest extreme team set from 1998 had a vehicle with those pieces. quote this tow truck is pretty useful. as you can see, current city sets hardly have any tow trucks available to tow new cars design. this tow truck is catered for 4-studs vehicles for classic town. can you imagine yourself this truck towing a speed racer car? i think it looks really out of proportion. firstly, speed racer cars are out of scale even with city vehicles. also, i have hope that in the next few years we will get more octan sets to go with the wonderful gas station - and i suspect that a 6-wide tow truck will be at the top of the list. it wouldn't be a hard set to make, and i bet it would sell well. edited by grevious, 19 july 2008 - 05:31 pm.
oh! never seen that set before! fun and strange that wheel supension system. has it ever been used in any other sets?
three cheers to classic town trucks! it felt nostalgic to see this appearing at the surface after seven years. time really flies and may classic town continue to be close in fellow townies' hearts.

i love this set, it's nice and simple. maybe it's because i build this set by myself by ordering all parts and buildinginstruction. and i made one extra tanktransporter :
i can't wait. the set looks really good, i don't know why but i think it looks a bit like the star wars at-te. edited by skipper 24, 19 july 2008 - 04:22 pm.

wow! this is a great mm set! and i wouldn't say that, but wow! this looks awesome. it's not the theme i really want, but if i get this set by accident ( ) i won't mind! hope to see your review soon.

anyone know the us release date?
wonderful review. i'd die if i had to upload that many pictures... man, this is it: the pinacle of mars mission's second and final year. man, this baby is flawless. there are so many indications that the designers took care in designing this kit - like the space for the pilot's backpack, the compartment for the mini flier, the sturdy leg design - etc etc etc. kudos to tlc for making mars mission go out with a bang. i have high hopes that whereever the space theme goes next year, tlc will make it worth the wait. edited by grevious, 20 july 2008 - 05:43 pm.
is it seriously? this set was a must-buy for me in the first place, but now that i see it in so much detail, it's just perfect... even the alien ship is better than usual. i love the scooter that flies out of the escape pod, the backpacks, bulldog stickers, and water tank. :d i'll be getting this one! space fans unite!
ok, minus ten for the placeholder, but plus about ten million for the review. this set is just amazing. it's really earned it's colors, and i'm sure no classic space fan can complain, even snefroe . i didn't know it had the tilting function for the drill- s@h is so pathetic with its pictures, and they really missed this amazing function. the detachable ship is so cute, it's almost classic space in it's design. major thumbs up to tlc. hell, make it a hug, even.

wooha! i thought i never would see a nice mars mission set, but this walker ist the best proof i was wrong. it really looks good and i love the bricks used to make the shape. the airtank is cool and for once i have to say even the stickers are looking good. man, did i really say that? normally i hate stickers. nice review (some pictures would have gotten better with macro on, but as it seems to be time to forgive i won´t point on that any longer) thank you very much vbbn!
holy brick! i just love the water tank and those legs are soooo cool! i dont think i have enough cash to buy after the star wars release...yikes...! thanks vbbn,for a super review!

looks like a great set, i may consider making this the first mars mission set i buy. nice review also. but quote lol, thanks. i just wanted to claim my place for the review. personally i don't think you had a place to claim. somebody else could have also gotten this set and had a proper review ready before yours but felt it was wrong to post because you had posted a placeholder ( clubninja in this case). i think placeholders should be banned and if you are not ready to post a full review you should not post anything. simple really. either that or what is the policy on here regarding more than one review of a set being posted - then you could have both posted reviews and it wont really matter i guess. just my 2 cents worth thanks for the review though.
today i'm gonna review the bigger of the 2 castles from the fright knigh theme. i got this one last week at a pretty fair prive at ebay, new and still sealed. i love opening boxes that had been lying arounf for years and being the first to build an old set. since i know this castle theme is not liked so much by the general public, i'll try here and change their minds, cause i really think this is a great set. this time i have to say my pictures turned out pretty amazing, even if i am still using just my cellphone cam, but i'm really pleased now with the quality. here we go! set nr.: 6097 name: night lord's castle number of minifigs: 7 number of pieces: 598 release year: 1997 let's start with a few box & instructions pictures: the inside od the box, with a few alternate models: the back, with another possibility how to assemble the 3 main parts: instructions: next, the 6 minifigs, starting with the witch on her black dragon: all 5 figures of the fright section: and the poor royal knight: we go on with the set itself, first a general overview (it's really high!): on the "first floor" there's a trap with which you can drop stones or other things down on unliked guests, the pot comes originally from fabuland i think, i love this thing: in the same floor there is a second trap, if you pull the bar, the door opens: we move on to the tower itself (did i mention it's really high?), on the ground level there's the place for the witch to do her spells: the wall is a secret door, which reveals a skeleton when turned over: on the next level there is this little thingy, first it only seems like a barrel.... ...but when you pull the two 1x4 tiles on the back, a skull is being revealed, scary, huh : i don't really understand what this is for but i assume it's a telescope to watch and observate the dragons, i do find that a bit senseless since there haven't been telescopes in medieval times (or have there been): the back of the tower with the prison and the room for the treasure chest: the prison opened. it's secured with a chain, which i like very much cause you really can lock it with that: treasure chest: from the highest peak we now go down to the very ground level, at the back of the castle there is another secret wall-door, flanked by two shields: at the back half of the inside there is the throne hall for the bat lord, with a nice warm fireplace in the back (this is, where the secret door is placed): the second half is pretty empty, except for these two baskets. i don't know exactly what they are for, but i ike the idea for using them as water places for the horses: one thing that might be a bit stupid is that 2 of the 4 side entrances do not have doors, so they are open and a guard would have to stand there the whole day. you can see it in his face he isn't very happy with that : that was my last review of the sets i got the last weeks, but i'm looking forward to make much more in the future. overall this is a pretty good set, i don't know any other one with so much details and playability. the minus point is, as already said, that it is too open on the sides, but that can be solved easily with a bit of modding. also i must say, this set isn't that much juniorized as many might have thought, though the design is a bit unconventional, but exactly that's what i like most about it. all in all it gets a 9/10 for me hope you enjoyed the reading and the pictures, can't wait to see your response. edit: oops, i forgot to put one figure of the fright knight faction on the photo, but it's the one in the last picture. edited by kimt, 10 august 2008 - 01:28 pm.
i thoroughly enjoyed your review metalandi, thank you especially for taking photos of all the contraptions and detailing exactly how they work. as a member of classic-castle, the census always seemed to be that fright knights were a class 4/10 or 6/10 but as sandy stated above, it is one of the closest you can get to an evil faction. by today's standards, the contraptions seen here are much much more sophisticated and well thought out and are definitely missing in 2007's king's castle siege. i enjoy the design of this castle much more even if the towers are taller simply because the design in the king's castle siege left builders with an empty space right in the courtyard without even a base plate! and it's nearly impossible to get your hands in and play in the enclosed space (why would anyone unless you're simply posing figs, and even that was difficult). this castle instead, had a variety of trap doors and surprises, so despite the varied colors used here, it's not that hard to realize that the designers for this castle really took time to think things out and tried to make the castle enjoyable for the children that will play with it whereas our 2007 castle was strictly built to give kids the impression of an enormous magnificant castle with little to nothing inside. it's like comparing beauty (2007) to brains (this castle). edited by legobear, 20 july 2008 - 01:32 am.
metalandi, on jul 20 2008, 12:23 pm, said: i actually got one set left i would like to review, but i'm off tomorrow to italy until thursday, so i won't be able to do it until then. you won't be off 'till tomorrow. that's still a day away! there's still time! no, but still, i'll be looking forward to the review when you get back! ~peace
i have this set, and ilike it! 6097 have many usefull parts! greate review!
metalandi, thanks for doing this fright knights review, by opening up a misb set which you have bought recently. i am very sure the feeling is very nice, especially touching the bricks which is preserved for 11 years sealed in bags. i am quite fond of the fright knights theme. unfortunately, this theme was released during my dark age. i never really bought sets from fright knights. instead, i bought plenty of minifigs to build an army. if i could turn back time or find another misb set with a reasonable price, i am very sure i will get it. my soldiers need a castle to stay in. i will be looking forward to your next review. keep up the good job
well, that the bricks look new comes from that they are new. i got this set new and unopened
ahh... i remember how badly i wanted that set when it was new... oh well... definitely one of the most original castles, if not the most. i actually liked how the 1st floor was made into a throne room. the tower looks pretty impressive, too. of course, the castle has a flagrant flaw -- the walls on the sides are open. i also think it lacks in the minifig count, though that is understandable for a castle with a dragon. quote the fright knights are probably the closest you can get for an evil human castle faction. totally agreed.
quite the topic bump, but dang, what a cool set, and so tall. this is the kind of sets i had as a kid, but i don't remember this one. i'm jealous.s
a 5/5. the set is beautiful, both the remake and the original. a classic and a beautiful thing, like dos. edited by maiq the liar, 20 july 2008 - 09:45 pm.
thanks everyone for the comments. it's great to see that you enjoy these classic reviews, esp. this set. panda9001100, on jul 20 2008, 03:10 pm, said: i made a little modification: excellent! you've also got some other very nice sets there, like that awesome monorail! you should share a review. rupi, on jul 20 2008, 04:25 pm, said: i am a proud owner of this set it's great to hear that some of you have this classic fire station. it really is a nice set with great vehicles and accessories. i also think the overall design is excellent.
great review of a great set! sadly, i don't own it. as for the alternate building idea's on the back of every box - yes, i miss that as well! i really miss it!
no question. this is a "5" one of the best and most influencial town sets ever, imo
great review, great set. nice look, great features, very playable.
this brings back a lot of memories as i used to have that set when i was a kid..... great review!
a great small set! i remember this set most of all because of the inverted window screen. loooooved the chopper, but never got it... another "5" please
hello all eurobricks members and town lovers, today, i will be doing up a review on snorkel squad, one of the most important and basic vehicle in any fire department. snorkel squad, in simple english terms, it refers to fire engine, fighting fire, always on standby, ready to save the citizens from crisis. trust me, you will understand why this snorkel squad is superb impressive by the end of this review. on a side note, there is only part that is replaced by another color. can you find the difference? name: snorkel squad theme: lego system / town year: 1987 pieces: 151 minifigs: 2 price: usd$13.50 an image of a 6358, snorkel squad looking smart on their stand-by this snorkel squad is a fanastic fire engine, that is ready to save people from the fires. it's primary color "red" is used in all fire emergency department and vehicles. in case of any emergency, this snorkel squad will be activated and arrived at the scene as soon as possible. no time to waste! personally, this is the best fire engine that i had ever seen. meet the fire fighters it comes with two brave fire fighters. both of them wear the standard fire fighter outfit that is present in almost all fire station sets in classic town. the torso is very nice and formal, and looks real impressive onto them. i love the buttons on them. furthermore, these white helmets are a symbol to the world of fire fighting. these are the people whom save lives by risking their own lives in dangerous situations. water hose compartment the water hose is a string that is stored in the front. it can be rolled out, and the fire fighters are able to use it without much difficulty. they will just pull out the hose and spray onto the fire. the next picture, shows a much clearer look in its interior. in addition, the fire logo that is on the compartment, is actually printed. yes, it's not a sticker, and that is great news for us! interesting features these clamps on both sides, is supposed to stablise the fire engine when the ladder is heading upwards. it is a simple mechanism, which illustrate clearly what it does. this feature is recently seen in construction vehicle such as the mobile crane. of course, it is not a complicated feature. it just made use of three quite common white parts. swivel mechanism these swivel mechanism, in my opnion are very fun to play with. these connectors on the front and the back, enable the long fire engine, to make sharp turns on any junctions, arriving at the scene fast enough. this is not a fire engine that only travel straight roads. try it onto your base plates, and you will be surprised, how well it can turn. best playable mechanism in 6358 the driver will be activating the ladder at the back of the vehicle. in order, to adjust the height and making sure that the ladder do not fall short, the tiles on the plates are acting like a stoppage. the ladder are able to rotate 360 degree without much problem, if you removed the driver out of the control panel. it goes up as tall as 30cm! look at that amazing height. too bad, i have not constructed my cafe corner yet. otherwise, i can give you a better feel of how amazing this baby can go. i used the old road baseplate as a guide, and roughly it can goes as tall as 30 to 35cm. look at the black hinges below. by shifting it to the last, that was the maximum height it can move. this is a very good way to adjust the height. oh, and i forget to mention that there are 2 storage compartments for the fighters to place their equipments behind. quite easy to access. no doors? apart from the standard roof top on the driver's seat, there is no doors present at both side. i am quite sad to see that there are no doors. maybe, these fighters are supposed to jump off the seat, instead of opening the doors? well, i guess this is the only major flaws that i had found in this set. heading off *got you* meet the model 6358 fire engine summary review playability: 10/10 (superb fun. the ladder and swivel mechanism is really very fun to play with.) design: 9.5/10 (excellent design. it got an almost full 10. the lack of doors, dropped my ratings slightly.) price: 8/10 (a very mid range price. i don't think it cost very expensive. but, i am not sure how much it cost now.) overall: 9.2/10 (best fire engine ever, and one of the great looking one too. get this model now.) i gave it a "5" based on my review score card. what about yours? hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine. comments and critics are strongly welcomed. pictures can be found in my brickshelf (when moderated)
a great review, i like this set it captures the classic town feeling well, and the ladder is cool! i can't help but feel thought that these reviews are being churned out to quickly, you should leave a gap, i am being flooded with all these great reviews!
what an awesome little set! i really like this engine but don't remember seeing it during the late 80s. it must have been out during my dark ages. i love the basket/section for the firemen. equally nice is the fire hose which extends a good length. the color combination of red with white and the trans. blue windshield looks goos as well. this is a great engine and one that would look perfect in a classic tabletown - and it's 4-studs wide! very nice review whitefang. i look forward to seeing more of your classic town reviews.
guys, thanks for all of your wonderful and encouraging comments, towards this set. this was one of my most favourite set in the late 1980s, and i am glad to restore it somehow, with a small little part missing, which could not be that hard to replace. bernddasbrot, on jul 22 2008, 12:06 am, said: but this review induced me to get over this humiliation from my childhood ( ) and check ebay for the 6358. bernd, i am glad reviews like these, mananged to change your perception towards this set. honestly, this is a very good set to pass by, and i hope i had highlight the key features in this set. hope you will have an easy time, getting it from ebay or bricklink. rriggs, on jul 22 2008, 12:31 am, said: great classic firemen and - in your version - a suspiciously blue fire extinguisher good job, by spotting the replacement part, which is hiding among them. that's why i show the orignal image. lord of pies, on jul 22 2008, 12:34 am, said: i can't help but feel thought that these reviews are being churned out to quickly, you should leave a gap, i am being flooded with all these great reviews! you should really take some time off, and sit in front of the town and trains forum, looking through at your childhood memories, where classic reviews like this are released in this forum. i am leaving some gaps in between my reviews now. i supposed brickster will slow down soon. captain green hair, on jul 22 2008, 02:07 am, said: this definitly is a nice set, i think this was also the first set to use that white basket cgh, you are absolutely right. this is the first set that made use of the white basket component. in fact, there is only 2 sets in the entire lego theme which have make used of the white basket. it is the 6477 which is released in 2000. i am quite surprised after 13 years, they are able to produced it again. thebrickster, on jul 22 2008, 10:10 am, said: what an awesome little set! i really like this engine but don't remember seeing it during the late 80s. it must have been out during my dark ages. i love the basket/section for the firemen. equally nice is the fire hose which extends a good length. the color combination of red with white and the trans. blue windshield looks goos as well. this is a great engine and one that would look perfect in a classic tabletown - and it's 4-studs wide! very nice review whitefang. i look forward to seeing more of your classic town reviews. you shared the same sentiments as i do. it's a pity that set was released during the dark age of yours. on the other hand, these sets are my childhood sets which i grew up with. more classic town reviews, all the way! edit: this is my 1000th eurobricks post since i joined! it has been another great milestone for me, in eurobricks! edited by whitefang, 22 july 2008 - 06:46 am.
nice reveiw it looks like a great set i think i know what i will do tonight- rebuild my lego fire department it has- [fire pickup truck, fire truck [from 2005 sorry cant remember set number] and the most recent fire station if i can find all the pieces......
quote i am not against with the newer sets. it just that, part of the reasons which reflected in the review had fufill the basic key factors of a typical fire engine. in addition, it was my all-time favourite under the "fire-fighting" theme. yes, i agree! this set is wonderful even today, and is one of the best fire kits ever release. and actually, realistic scale is not really a necessity in lego - it's just my personal taste. for example, i've never liked the tiny planes in the old airports that much, but i can see why a lot of people like them better than the new ones. edited by grevious, 28 july 2008 - 03:17 pm.
one of my all time favourite i still love it even after all these years, though it did always seem a bit out of place as when i was a child i’d never seen a similar looking fire appliance in the uk.
hes is forgeting the slash: [img] [/img]
oh thanks, im curious to know, did you get an extra set of clone gear, someone said they did.
oops, i missed that, guess i just over reacted. random spellingg mistaks on!! edited by yorkiejim, 21 july 2008 - 06:25 pm.
it looks like a really good set and like it is a lot larger than the old one. thanks for the review!
navy trooper fenson, on jul 21 2008, 07:25 pm, said: nice pictures, but three questions: 1. how many pages do the instruction books have? 2. what are the spare parts? or: does this laaty come with two clone-commander-equipment sets and four assaij ventress lightsaberhilts? 3. where did you get it? 4. how much did it cost? i can answer one! he comes from norway
i have a question, what is the door above the gun for? (pic)
so basically, you cited as faults what everybody had been complaining about since the first information of the set arrived? skeletal interior and lack of clones? although i didn't realize it didn't have numbered backs. that really is just ridiculous. lego finally comes up with a very intelligent solution to the frustration seen when building large sets, but then they neglect to implement it. wtf? lame. still, this may be the only clone wars set i buy besides the exclusives. the exterior, which imo is the only part that matters, looks so fantastic. i don't care about clones, i have enough of those already. and at 90$ it's still a better buy than the rgs. the torrent is cool but not as cool as the fighter tank or dgs imo. awesome in-construction pics.
i bought this a few weeks ago and absolutely loved making it. it's amazing how the paneling comes together to make such a tight fit, but can easily open up. the legs could have been a bit more poseable, and the guns don't launch easily unless you push hard and fast. i'd like the firing mechanism to launch more smoothly. but it looks absolutely amazing. about price, it was ¥13,000 where i am, but i'm used to lego being expensive in japan, so it was good value.
funny minifig actions there. i do love the at-te, a definite buy for walker fans.
sorry for reanimating this topic. there is a technic brick in the mid section of this set. does anyone know the function of that ??
i dont think we have instuctions yet... but on topic, i have an at-te in the mail, on the way, so i should have a review of it in the next week or so. jifel
cagri, on mar 11 2009, 12:03 am, said: exactly kim, that's what i meant. i pondered and wondered that for a long time :) i decided to ask here when a friend wondered the same thing. i hope it fits with the new droship. it would be really cool. and it's also great that tlg knows what they'll be prodcuing a year later.. it does. the description of the new 10195 dropship and at-ot states that the at-te can be carried too. they've planned this for quite a while.
7676: republic attack gunship number of pieces: 1034 number of minifigs: 5 price: 119.99 usd brickset hey everyone, i just got the rgs yesterday at tru after i came home from camp. i saw all of the topics that i missed, and noticed a mini-review and a review with one pic, so i thought i'd make a huge, shiny new review that has lots of pictures and all of the requirements of kimt's index. note: i did not apply any stickers to it, as a personal liking. so, lets start by looking at the box: a shiny, clean, and futuristic box, quite different from the other star wars box designs before this. there was so much clone wars merchandise with this font and design in the huge display at the front of my local toys r us store, and not just lego. it so beautiful, with the white and sky blue... anyways, for some reason, the boxes of the new clone wars sets seemed more shiny than usual. maybe it's because they were just shipped, but once you pick up the boxes, they will feel really good in your hands, despite the fact that only about half of the space in the boxes are used... the back of the box: the back shows all of the main features of the set, plus pictures of the three other clone wars sets meant to be released alongside this one (although i did spot the twilight and homing spider droid, which were supposed to be released in september or october). so, on to the gunship: built straight from the bags. it took me about 4 1/2 hours, with breaks. it has an overall great design, but somewhat fragile, especially when building it. the cockpits always fall apart when opened, as well as the bubbles on the wings (which i will get into more later). the color scheme is very well done. you can always find the piece you're looking for thanks to the color diversity: red, dark red, lime green (ooh!), blue, black, tan, light bley, dark grey, yellow and white. also, split down the middle vertically, the ship is almost all symmetrical. front: side: now, lets start with the many features that this set is hiding. the front has lots of lime green, a rare color. but more importantly: ...a rotating gun is found on each side. they rotate in a pretty wide range, although fragile. cockpits: there are two main cockpits, right next to each other. not very detailed, and are the same. and for some reason, the whole cockpit element flips up to reveal: ...nothing. just the skeleton of the ship. probe droid storage: above the cockpit lies a plate that can be flipped up to reveal a storage area that holds: two of these probe droids. at least, that's what i think they are. hull: in this pic, two features are hidden. mobile command center: the first of the two is a mobile command center, but essentially just a hover chair. it is found by flipping up the two panels on either side of the hull. bacta tank: the second is the bacta tank found by just sliding it out of the storage area behind the mcc. one half of the tank opens: ...so a minifigure can go inside and heal his/her wounds obtained in battle. cargo hold: now, this is probably the main feature for this set. the two sliding doors (two on each side) slide open thanks to a clever technic mechanism. not much in here, just a gun holder and a place where the passengers wait to be dropped off in battle. speeder bike: i guess you guys saw it, the speeder bike. it is found by opening the rear flap. the bike is very cleverly designed by using a brown trike body. it's only a few centimeters shorter than the bike found in the clone battle pack. rear gun: just a gun similar to the front ones. engines: huge engines (or are they cannons?) that are really fun to build. they really give that cartoon feel to this set. missiles: in between the engines are two sets of four flick-fire missiles. bubble cockpits: there is one bubble cockpit on each wing that supposedly control the turrets at the front. very fragile. storage containers: two storage containers on each side hold the clone accessories. but, i wouldn't recommend putting them in there, because the antennae can fall out, or you might forget about them. sticker sheet: the dreaded sticker sheet (dss) has all of the stickers you need for this set. unfortunately, mine was crunched up. i don't like stickers much anyways, but i might still apply some. note the republic symbol stickers, why couldn't tlg just use that printed piece from a few years back? also, you get to choose between a bird-rat thing or a sleeping twi'elk as your hull decal. what they're for, i don't know, looks like the movie or show will explain it though. minifigs: finally, the five minifigs of this set. they are all great figs, including: commander cody: amazing, especially with the gear. the orange is nice, but i thought he was yellow. clone trooper: again, amazing. the gear is great, and the new helmet and torso are great! all of the clones in the clone wars line have the same heads. also, you can see the flesh beneath the helmet. asaaj ventress: not so happy about this one. the torso and dark blue legs are cool, but the dress is pretty ugly. the head is alright, but could do without the cartoon-y face (yeah i know, its from a cartoon). also has purple markings on back of head. obi-wan kenobi: pretty cool, besides the face. cool hair and torso, though. plo koon: beautiful! the true gem of this set, in my opinion. the head is the same material as kit fisto's. and the tosro is awesome, good for making a custom ki-adi mundi. well, that's about it, here is the... final verdict: build: 8/10, very fun and easy, should take the seasoned builder about 4 hours. somewhat fragile. playability: 9.5/10, lots of fun features, although some can break easily. swooshability: 3/10, i wouldn't recommend flying it around much, as you can barely pick it up safely. but with two hands gripping the bottom firmly, it can be moved around, but not spun or swooshed, etc. minifigs: 8/10, all very great figs, especially plo koon, but could have included more clone troopers. design: 7.5/10, some excellent ideas included in here, although some spots are very fragile. price: 7/10: should have been only 100 usd if not for the new molds. plus, at tru, it was 130 usd. overall score: 8.5/10, a great set to have for your star wars/ clone wars collection, with some flaws. save up for this one. so, how did you like my review? your feedback is much appreciated! jimbutcher, out. edited by jimbutcher, 15 september 2008 - 03:06 am. indexed

swman, on jul 29 2008, 10:33 pm, said: i really like the new gunship. different enough from the old one to be better, but similar enough that they don't look totally weird together. really like the new minifigs. didn't think i would like the new clone troopers at all. the accessories are fine. i would never use them on the regular clones, but to each their own. everything is perfect except the rear of troop cabin .... seems so flimsy with only 2 2x1 white brick holding everything together ....
what's this thing on the clone at right ??

thanks for all the feedback so far, guys! i meant yellow for cody's color.

whitefang, on jul 30 2008, 12:56 am, said: pedro, for your first review, you have amaze me with your photo session and the strucutre of your review. i am very impressed by your high quality pictures. you have done an excellent job! i completely agree. this is an amazing review - bits of humor, great photography, and detailed descriptions/photos. based upon this review i've placed an order for this set (along with some convincing from amazon's 20% sale ). the only drawbacks in this set that i can see concerns the tower with it being 1) small compared to the seige tower and 2) missing a few walls. however, this is also the joy of lego as one can simply purchase a few bricks and build their own walls and/or expand the tower's size (or even attach it to a castle). of course, this increases the price of the set, but considering how cheap bricks are on bricklink, tower raid is still a very good value. i hope you continue doing reviews, pedro.
th set was fantastic becuase it was cheap and supplied a very good amount of pecies and had rather good minifigures.
i really liked this set, it's cheap and comes with a good supply of flesh heads and the new hair mold. i love the tent too. i'd give it a 10/10.
good review. this is my second ij kit that i got and i think it is a great deal. only 10$ and get 3 figs and great parts to use. i may pick up 2 more so i have penty of ants and other goodies that this comes with.
too many pictures .... we dont need to see every step

i've got to go with the town one, since you have to stand on the dino one. steve
i vote for the dino quadbike, definately! i wish i had that but i'll have to make do with the much less violent european version (dino '2010' not 'attack') here's a comaprison... european version: usa etc. version: there's a subtle difference, but i prefer the us one as for the coast guard quad, i think it's ok but not as good as the new one.
nice review , for portugal it costs 60€. i also consider it oversized, it shold be the third of that size... portugal and spain may have good prices but 90€ for the v-19 must be a tippo.
i'll probably get this in hong kong where lego is cheap next time i go there to visit my relatives. also pretty nice review, a few more pics couldn't hurt. also are there just two of the same white control computers for the controls? that's what it looks like in the instructions. edited by skipper 24, 01 august 2008 - 08:41 pm.
thanks for the review, christian, i was hoping for one soon . this set really looks good, but as you said, rather big. the figs are good, and i agree that ki-adi mundi should be included. i like the hidden compartments for the blasters and missiles, and the cockpit is really cool, considering it seats two (i thought only one). i will surely pick this up sometime.
do you have any pics of the wheels? i wanna see what those are like.
this and the at-te and the spider tank and maybe the droid gunship are the few clone wars sets i'll buy. i loved playing as this tank in the clone wars video game( even better with cheat codes for extra missile spam ), so this is a must get.
this set costs a s$100 in singapore.i went to hng kong too see lego and the shops there are more expensive by a few dollars.however,i went to australia before and everything there is the same price but when there is a sale it becomes very cheap!anyway, thanks for the review!i was wondering about the details of this set.the clone's faces look a lot like anakin's face.why is that so?i thought it is supposed to look like jango's?
i personally think this is a great set, but a little pricey. i wish it was available in the us though.
im definatly gonna get the atte. im thinking about getting the spider droid and fighter tank. i alredy own the older version of the republic gunship (but i still want it) agentrick57, on aug 1 2008, 08:44 pm, said: i loved playing as this tank in the clone wars video game( even better with cheat codes for extra missile spam ) sorry to get off topic... but i own that game! i liked playing as the republic gunship the best!
4478 geonosian fighter review parts:169 figs:4 price:?15.00 (i think) here is a review of the amazing geonosian fighter set, it was my first ever star wars lego set! here go's... 1. manual not much here although it's an old style manual cover. random shot. back. 2. general set and minifigs a pic of the entire set, it has 2 reddish tan battle droids geo pilot, geo soldier, geo star fighter and geo turret. the 4 figs, the droids come with backpacks. geo soldier. i prefer this gun. give him a cane to become poggle the lesser the geo leader. detailed legs are always nice. the bodies are a little fat for geonosians i guess but nice printing on them. the head. the wings. 1. 2. 3. voila! all done 3. the star fighter it has a landing gear type thing. the detail on those plates. the pilot in the cockpit. cockpit with canopy. 1 of 2 ball joint things, this is the engine. 2nd ball joint which is the front gun. 4. the turret the turret by itself. turret with the soldier. a printed round plate. 5. overall build: 7/10 a little repetitive but enjoyable. minifigs: 9/10 4 that's pretty good for a set this size. design: 6/10 the fighter dosen't really look right nor does the turret but they are both strong. parts: 8/10 lot's of interesting parts and comes with two of the ball joint things as well the minifig parts being good. price: 10/10 cheap (for the uk) considering the amount of minifigs and parts. playability: 5/10 not much but you can have mini battles with the turret and starfighter. overall: 8/10 i gave it 8 because of the design which was not accurate and the low number of parts. thanks for reading and hope you liked it as much as i did . edited by kimt, 04 august 2008 - 11:42 am. indexed
i always thought this looked liek a cool set, with lots of nice (and sadly unique) pieces. unfortunately the only attack of the clones sets i got were the jedi starfighter and yoda vs dooku. amazing sets, but i would love to have owned them all. i'd never really looked into this set very much, so thanks for the review!
this is actually one of my favorite star wars sets. awesome rare pieces, and excellent construction. geo figs are a plus too. best of all, it's nice and cheap.
thanks for the review. i'll definately get this set sooner or later. imo the tiny turbos are awesome. i actually bought nearly every set so far, built the models, added the stickers and packed them away in zip-lock bags in the attic. sadly i don't have display room for them (yet). a fine set, carwise.. dump the slammers and buildings into the spare bag and keep the cars. kimt tiny turbos on!
kimt, on aug 3 2008, 01:06 pm, said: thanks for the review. i'll definately get this set sooner or later. you better hurry. they are not at s@h any longer! quote a fine set, carwise.. dump the slammers and buildings into the spare bag and keep the cars. that´s exactly what i did. the slammers are already seperated to our color boxes.
thanks for the review! i have quite a few tts.(tiny turbos). i never got this one, but if it's on sale....
looks like a pretty good set with a some nice colors. the spider is probably the best model in my opinion, but i mean look at the wasp kinda weak it you ask me. nice review .
thanks for the review, kim! kimt, on aug 3 2008, 01:01 pm, said: i crossed the german border and bought me this one mainly for the parts. what parts were you looking for? or just for all of the parts? i like the story with your wife. the spider is really cool. nice photo shots on the grass, kim! too bad the other alternative builds are kinda odd. always creators on!
i once bought a entire lego collection including this set. however, i never have build it. seeing this fine review has given me new motivation to do so. nice work again skipper!
i have mixed feelings about this set. it's one of the sets that sent my into a dark age (the birth of my son contributed heavily). when i first saw this set i was convinced that the earlier snowspeeder (7130) was superior in every way. i liked the look of the 7130 version better, i liked the coloration of it better. the turret was better (it used a webbed 6 x 6 dish). after seeing this review, i realize i was wrong on some accounts. the cockpit is much more movie accurate. the 7130 version had two separate compartments. this version also came with a tow cable, something that was lacking from the previous set. while i still am unimpressed with the overall look of this set, it is much less blocky, which is always a good thing. overall, i still prefer 7130 to the 4500 version. but the 4500 isn't nearly as bad as i first assumed, and i regret never buying one of these when i had my chance.
great review! i bought this set when it came out but sold it a couple years later for some extra cash. i have no regrets selling this one, as i was never really impressed with it (different story for the 4483 at-at - oh how i wish i still had that one). the snowspeeder was alright, just didn't have any sort of "wow" factor to it. the best part of the set is probably the rebel trooper. looking at the last photo in your review, looks like you're about to have a major battle in your hallway. apart from the snowspeeder & motorized at-at, i see the arc-170 fighter, grievous's starfighter, and is that a podracer i see -- and what is the set with the treads? it's not star wars, but looks like a pretty cool set (maybe a mission mars vehicle).
nope there is a guy sitting there. he's there because on dine 2010 there were no guns like on dino attack, so so i made a big gun like on the dino attack set. i can see where you got the pod racer idea from now.
ahem! please get back on topic guys

i really liked this set. it was simple to build, yet detailed and included three figures, which was nice. if only lego would do a few more hoth sets, then we could make a real battle.
you have to love the originals, well i didn't like the very first snowspeeder so this is the original to me. i like it more then the new one that comes with the echo base, beter color scheme and more realistic i think. i got this set in stores and still love it to this day =]
kimt, on aug 3 2008, 03:22 pm, said: not one of my favourite sw sets. kinda boring and the set is poorly designed imho. we do get the general, but that's not nearly enough. thanks for the reivew and fine pics. kimt gg has a cape...a custom cape!!!!!! what more do you want?
i have all three of the slave i ships, and i agree with kimt...although it is a very small, compact ship, the first slave i (boba fett) is still the sturdiest. the newest slave i (boba fett) is not bad, and is of much better construction than this slave i from jango fett. even though i like the size and scale of the jango slave i and the newest boba fett slave i...when you pick that very first one up, it had the feeling of....."you can throw me against the wall, drop me off the roof of your house, or let 4 two year olds play with me...i'm not gonna break!" at least thats's my opinion. good review
personally, i hated that set. i fell apart way to easily and was just not built well.
okay i have fixed that pic (thanks oky wan). i have modified this but then yesterday i built it back to its original state to review it.
a very nicely done review. i remember getting this slave i - it was my first large star wars set.
i remember having this set (actually i even still have it, at least the pars are somewhere ) when i was a child, and i used it for making races, as it is there for. all these many reviews let me think again at that i also planned to make some reviews for the town section. i got your message thebrickster, don't worry! i got a lot to do at the moment, but i should find some time this upcoming week.
manta, on aug 3 2008, 10:33 am, said: wish it was still around. even though, little sets <$10, like the new coast guard 4wd & jet, and the quad are great little city sets. lego seems to be returning to good quality small sets with their latest city line-up. metalandi, on aug 3 2008, 10:46 am, said: i remember having this set (actually i even still have it, at least the pars are somewhere ) when i was a child, and i used it for making races, as it is there for. you should look for them and resurrect it. it really feels good after you've found all the pieces and put a set back together again (as it was when you first bought it).
this little set really makes my point small playable inspiration to build the set into a few other models, great set i wish i had it my town is going to need more vehicles. i really miss main model instructions with alternate build idea's.
nein! you rejected lul. lul's are awesome! thanks for the review! i like the set a lot, mace is only featured here. great fig of him too, i like the grey jedi robes torso. cody is great as with the other figs. the tank's probably a second favourite, next to the mighty at-at of course.
thanks for the review, i'll index it later. i've added a poll, so that members can vote their opinion and refrain from useless comments like "awesome!!" (this has been done to all reviews in the sw review index). keep up the good work. this is one of my favourite sets - i have both versions and as it is known, the only difference is the minifigs. i really like the tank, it has great playability and if it had wings, i'd definately swoosh it. kimt
good set, but it's flimsy as sin (but that may have been my rush job building it). mine got shoved off a bed oh, and i lost my light up mace >.> propably somewhere within the blue bin 'o' doom™ (aka the brick bucket™, or block/null™ ) edited by maiq the liar, 04 august 2008 - 10:15 pm.
6701 space minifigures review set#: 6701 set name: space minifigures released: 1983 pieces: 36 (including minifigs) minifigs: 6 brickshelf gallery peeron.com bricklink brickset.com introcomment: as i reignited my love for classic space a few years ago, i decided to start hunting sets i didn't have. this small one fell into my lap very cheap. with box and minifigs in great condition. so now i've resized the pics and done the review. and no i am not envious of this forum...really...i'm not.... the box. the box is pretty neat. it has a very comfortable size (compared to modern boxes) and the back of it shows what you get. i like the way they (tlg) split the minifigs and arranged everything neatly. front: rear sadly the box has seen better days. but it's age taken into consideration, i think it's just fine. the figs: a fine collection of red, white and yellow space figs. some great accesories to go as well. not much more to say, except this was a great "army-builder"-set. a true must have for most classic space fans. the verdict: it's kinda hard rating this set, since it's a minifig supplemental set. no design or colourscheme to comment on. it has a lot of playability since figs will always come in handy when building/playing with your space sets. kimt
pretty nice set, but the newer minifig packs had greater variety in both the figures and equipment. my favorite one among all of them is 6704, which is also the only instance of both blacktrons appearing in one set. quote i wonder why this set had no blue or black astronauts? whatever the case, i always loved the small minifig sets that lego released, as i could never get enough astronauts. my favorite was the set of futuron astronauts. i think the blue and black guys hadn't yet been released at the time of this set.

thanks for the review. i've added it to the index and added a poll in which members can vote their opinion on this set. i think this is a very good set. i like the colours and the very playable feature that allows the wings to lock in attack formation. now all i need is to buy this baby. edit: i gave it an above average rating, since it's well designed, looks sturdy and fits the sw theme sets perfectly.
pedro, on aug 5 2008, 12:29 pm, said: it looks pretty big compared to other starfighters too. did it take a long time to build? it took me 3 and a bit hours to build it, although i had some problems with the technic and i had to take pictures during the build.
i built mine today. as soon as i tried to put it in attack position, the thingy rotates the wrong way and it falls apart. what a waste of $55
rayman, on nov 29 2008, 10:16 pm, said: yes i believe that the yellow technic is only used for the building. however i didn't find it neccessary. what a strange step... its to hold the wing connectors in the the same place while the wing is being attached.
actually we should care that there's only one fig in it since it's kind of expensive (though that's my opinion) , but the ship is really awesome . it's too bad there's not a battlepack that includes clone pilots. edited by bricklanta, 30 november 2008 - 06:15 am.

i love this set and i gave it "outstanding". i might note though that the cylinder is just there as a dampener; when disenegaged the wing function still works, just not as smoothly. interestingly though the cylinder is an old piece, (i have a few others) it's just that this is the first time it's been used without a spring... i had no problems assembling this set.
having just bought myself a copy of the wonderful metroliner (4558) i felt like doing a review. before we start i'd like to thank greenhair for selling me one of his metroliners for a mere 80 euros. granted, the motor, "trainstation" and tracks weren't included but i did get an extra railcar instead. - * (please note that i have included the fourth wagon in the final pic but that the official set includes just three wagons.) the metroliner was released in 1992 and was extremely popular amongst lego fans. the set a picture of the box showing the set completely. (pic taken from peeron) and one of the minifigs and the accessories.: as you may notice, tlc was extremely generous, supplying us with a grand total of 11 minifgs amongst which no less than 4 female minifigs. ah, the population crisis is finally over we also have three suitcases, three cups and a small freight parcel and freight handling thingy. normally this would include two bicycles; a red and a black one. a general side view of the three carriages. (thanks to greenhair and the brickster) and here's one of the extra carriage. (thanks to greenhair and the brickster) moving onto the front and back carriage, which are externally identical. please note that greenhair changed my back carriage's headlights. these would be yellow in the normal set. all the doors in the entire set are printed pieces. (sorry for the bad picture quality in this one) the interior of the two however is laid out a bit differently. the space in the front carriage is occupied by a cockpit (or whatever it is called in trains) and some space to store your cable connecting the front lights with the engine. i can imagine it must get quite cramped and dangerous for the minifig driver with all the cabling. further back we have a quite random, weird looking engine. one part reminded me rather of a jet engine on a commercial airplane. the engine is accessible by means of the two side cargo doors. at the end of our first carriage we hit what looks like the train's restaurant, two tables and no chairs. the two middle carriages are identical, both have a small sink nicely hidden from the intervening and impolite looks of fellow passengers. the carriage further contains two tables and four seats. two cargo spaces are nicely tucked away from view below the tables. our final carriage has a back cockpit as well but differs from the front carriage in the central cargo area - where our train employee is hard at work earning his lego nickels - and the rear sleeping area. the bed is a double one, the upper one able to be flipped up for somewhat difficult access to the lower one. the train station i could not take photos off since it was not included in the purchase. judging from the building plans however i feel it was thrown in at the end just to add 'something' to the set. its construction is very simple, consisting of a few grey plates on top of a few pillars. access is provided by a plate which is connected to the platform with a few hinges. there are however two lamp posts, a timetable and a few chairs so if you don't like the platform you can still use these parts in a variety of other constructios. to end off i took a pic of the complete set (with extra wagon) and a friendly surprised train driver opening the door and greeting the camera man. conclusion being a '90s set, the train basically builds itself. the entire build cost me two hours and a half (i lost quite some time simply admiring the set) and was extremely straightforward with no suprises at all, but i need to admit it has its charm. the exterior is simply amazing. the sleekness of the design, the colours, it matches perfectly! i believe however that a width of 8 studs would be more to scale but 6 wide still looks amazing. the interior is somewhat simplistic but is easily moddeable with a few extra pieces. i basically bought the train as a parts pack. the standard set (three wagons) includes no less than 8 train doors with windows, 14 train windows, 4 smaller longer ones and 4 freight doors. the front and back of course count as unique pieces as well. one feature i am displeased with are the printed doors. i like printed pieces and while the blue-white-red stripe looks beautiful on the side the printed doors kind of limit mocing capabilities to carriages with a stripe on the side. i considered simply removing the stripe but i found out i could just get normal grey ones from bricklink for a fair price. i am very pleased with the train but since you already know my opinion, feel free to tell us yours of this fabulous set! edited by thebrickster, 09 july 2009 - 01:51 pm. poll question was not multiple choice, switched to radio group
i voted outstanding, this is simply an amazingly good looking train and comes with indeed 11 minifigs! i sold this one because i need a budget to build my ship, but i kept one because i love it! not bad for a first review ruben!
cool review. i actually have two of these. i got one for christmas when it was rereleased in 2003 and another one in a charity shop a few months later for €5. i love the minifigs even if they all have smileys, and having two sets of them can really fill up a town.
it's great to see someone reviewing a train! this set is definately a five! lego hasn't made a complete train set like this in a long time. the metroliner is really a legend among classic trains. the great level of playability and detailing makes it a terrific model. specifically, i was just noticing the details of the passenger car. it has a sink! - how cool is that? and 11 minifigs - when was the last time lego included 11 figs in a single set? a truly outstanding train set. thanks for sharing images as i've always wanted to see it up-close. it would be awesome if you could share some single side shots of the cars.
this is a great review of a great set, hairy ruben! i voted for outstanding since the only thing you can say about this train set is that it is outstanding. it has been the best passenger train in all the time from lego's beginning on until now. i bought the rereleased version of it in 2003 - and i really, really do not regret it! klaus-dieter
panda9001100, on aug 16 2008, 07:37 am, said: only strange they named it metroliner. in holland when we speak of a metro, i need to think at short distance trains only used in big cities like rotterdam. it was only named metroliner in the us, because of the color scheme is similar to the real-life metroliner. i believe in eu it was called the euro-express, and probably just "passenger train" wherever that would be suitable. the product-number 4558 is universal, though. hairy ruben, you don't have a review of the double-decker/club car on the way, do you? i myself never got it, and i am seriously considering buying one from bricklink, plus it is more-or-less an requirement for this train (one of very few double-decker cars to actually stay within the general outer dimensions of the train).

thanks for the cool review, hinckley. when i saw the picture originally i thought it looked good, but not that good. but seeing the pictures in your review, i love this, i voted it as outstanding because it has great parts, and a brilliant construction, ingenious perhaps! sirnadroj, on aug 5 2008, 02:30 am, said: simply put, i'd have to admit this is one of the best indy sets. i agree. it's so sad we europeans can't get it...
thanks for this great review hinckley! i agree with you this set has to be released as normal set. i just recognized how clever the building technique is, you couldn't see that on the packaging shots we got before. hopefully i'm able to grab this off ebay or somewhere else sometime!
6804 surface rover review set#: 6804 set name: surface rover released: 1984 pieces: 16 minifigs: 1 (white classic space minifig) brickshelf gallery peeron.com bricklink brickset.com introcomment: i have to keep my fondness for space going and since i'm no fan of the still "new" life on mars mars mission theme, i've decided to give you another review of a small classic space set. more to come in the following days. the box. unfortunately i haven't got the box for this set. but peeron.com was kindly enough to support me with a proper pic. and as usual this is a small easily brought home sized box. oddly tlg doesn't add the "flip" on top anymore. i remember standing in toystores, pulling 6 or more sets down from the hanger before accesing the one i wanted. it gave buying lego sets that threasure hunting touch. [snaps out of his daydreaming]... a small box with a picture of what you get. i've got no rear pic, so i can't tell if tlg did the same as on the 6701 set (split up the inventory). the fig: one single white classic space minifig. this is the worst one in my opinion. i never liked those white guys. and they get easily damaged by the sun. nah! give me a red or yellow instead (later blue or black). the surface rover: both i am the lucky owner of two of them. (yes this is a small showoff ) side though small, i still think this is a neat little set. compared to the modern "impulse" sets, this is high competable. i like the simplicity of the small classic space sets and this is no exception. the sr is made from very usable bricks, that can easily be used for making ship/base/craft mocs. rear as you can see, one of them has been used for surface exploration for many years. it could do with some replacements, but i haven't had the time, yet. the verdict: a fine little classic set. not much more than that. it holds some useful bricks and worked fine as an "impulse" back then. the classic children's birthday presents during the early 80's. i got quite a few space and town sets back then. remember to vote your opinion on this set. i gave it "average" for the bricks, the price (back then) and as an all in all conclusion. kimt
outback amazon crossing g'day mates! another fine review from the legoland's desert down under. this set makes for an excellent addition to your jungles, deserts, outbacks, or other wild and untamed places. set #: 6490 theme: outback year released: 1997 piece count: 117 minifigs: 1 list price: $15 (usd) starting with an image of the box, one can conclude that this doesn't look like the amazon at all, but rather the outback: on the back of the box are some great alternate models, including a creative idea for a crocodile zoo scene: the instructions have the same images on the front and back: the set comes with one outback fig, a man dressed in green with a bright red cap - i call him the crocodile hunter. also included in this set is a crocodile, some bones, a skull, backpack, pan, and a few extra trans. round 1x1s. the tools are pictured on the truck: now here's a great desert/rugged terrain truck: ready for some 4-wheel'n fun. i love the liftable top window/sun roof and the windshield. i like the use of these colored trans. blue pieces that contrast against the yellow, rather than hide like regular clear pieces: the truck has a few hooks/clips to attach a pick, rifle, antena, and camera. also attached is a water/oil can and an extra tire that just rests in the back section: the front end of the truck has a great winch and hook to help the truck out of hard places: working suspension helps the vehicle travel on rough terrain: the truck is just half the fun. this set also offers a nice bridge/creek bed for the truck to drive across: i like the use of six fence/ladder pieces for the bridge. the two in the center have double open sides. here's the left side: and the right side with a single burp as a mountain/hill: i really like the use of the tan and brown baseplates representing desert and water. the complete set as the crocodile hunter tries to climb back into the truck after attaching the winch: final thoughts: i've always liked this little set. it offers a great amount of playability with the wonderful little 4-stud wide truck and bridge scene. a few years ago, playmobil offered a desert racing theme and had this set as my favorite of the collection: desert racing and adventures through dry creeks and rough terrain make for a great theme. hope you enjoy this review and consider picking up an outback set (or two) if you can still buy at a reasonable price. happy outbacking! the complete outback theme: 6444 outback airstrip 6487 mountain rescue 6490 amazon crossing 6550 outback desert racer 6553 crisis news crew edit: i dedicate this review to the memory of steve irwin (1962 - 2006): tribute
thanks for this review, if you'd only know what memories you brought back! i think i remember this set better than any other i had, when i was a child. some time after i got it, i decided to disassemble it and combine it with the jeep from 6552 rocky river retreat. it came out pretty good, though. as it became the main attraction point of my town (beeing the car of my favourite minifig back then, and, and, and... looong story ), i kept it assembled that way from this day on until earlier this year, when i finally disassembled it because i needed the parts. edited by metalandi, 06 august 2008 - 03:57 am.
this is by far my favourite outback series set! i loved the fact that you can bend the bridge in different directions so that the suspension of the car really worked to keep the car levelled, like you placed it in your last picture. i had lots of fun with this when it came out eleven years ago in 1997, the bridge scene could also be used in the adventurers serie of 1998. classic, highest rating, buy it if you don't already have it!
nice review. this set looked very nice for it's time.
oh i loved this set when i was young! i think i got it for my birthday, and it was one of my favourite sets at the time. funnily enough, i was thinking about it the other day, and how i really should build it again... thanks for the nostalgic review.
thanks for the reviews once again. it looks like qite a nice set to me, although the european version will lose the big gun. i like some of the stickers (although i wish they were printed), and i actually quite like the dinosaur. i probably won't get it though, the set i'm most likely to get is the fire hammer.
bloody jay, on aug 5 2005, 01:15 pm, said: the back of the cockpit. i love the little gun, it turns 360 degrees and tilts up. oh yeah, and those green barrels they've been using are awesome, i can think of tons of uses for them. what uses might these be?
heh...$40? you're lucky...they sell those for $60 here...am i getting ripped off?
here we are, my first clone wars set, and my first star wars review. here we have the wonderful droid gunship, one of the cheaper of the clone wars sets. this set is exclusive to wal-mart, and its one of the better exclusives out there (i'm looking at you, twilight ). first off we have a shot of the entire set with the box. a random page shot, along with pics of the parts list. the build is split up into three sections: the back, the cockpit, and the missles. the back has a lot of nice dark blue plates, and is the only part of the set which uses stickers. the bottoms shows various technic systems, which i'll get to later the cockpit has many details (mostly guns), and the rotating guns are a nice touch. the cockpit can fit a battle droid, but not a minifig. i'm not sure why a droid would want leather though the last part is loading this baby with the missles there are four black(small) and two dark bley (large) missles which are loaded in groups of three as sls. the middle mechanism is for the missiles, and the back part with the bionicle teeth are used ad landing gear the knob on top turns... to release the missiles on the clones ... leftover bits and the used ss(not so d this time around) the gunship versus a time traveling agent charge . overall build: 8/10 a basic build, but at some points repetitive. minifigs: 10/10 just your basic droids, you can't go wrong. design: 7/10 a basic design, with some interesting techniques. pieces: 9/10 a mix of old and new pieces, along with the return of this lovely piece which hasn't been seen for almost 10 years price: 8/10 $30 for a gunship? i'll take it! final verdict: 8/10 a great price for a small set like this, and it has a great bit of swooshability
nice review agentrick.$30 is a good price, but tlc think thats €40 so i'll have to pass. btw i thought this ship was supposed to hold many droids like in sw battlefront. oh well, its good for show. edited by skinny boy, 09 august 2008 - 09:31 pm.
what? my st came up as the first post....
this is a great set it's too pricey though if it was $10 or so cheaper i'd get it!

that's it! thanks for the review but now you make me want to build my own one! thanks a lot! on a more serious note, i really like this set and have always wished to aquire it. i have two broken tie interceptors, so this should be a easy build. and as someone in the pirate forum, i think, said, it would be a great baseplate for building cave to hide the booty! thanks pmg and welcome!
thanks for the review pmj . i like the play value in this set even if i don´t own it . the way the orbs are put into the rocket is awesome and i really like it, but at the end the set have some lack of detail .
hopewell, on aug 11 2008, 11:24 pm, said: i read the visual guide recently and learned a bit more about the twilight. i won't get into spoilers but it seems that the ship becomes a sort of endearing family van for the characters which is neat. big bulky, uncool, but it gets you from one place to another. if it factors into more than just the 90 minute film, i may pick this up. it seems that there's room for a lot of personality in this ship once you see the film. it is a corellian freighter smuggling spice for the hutts. that's cool right? lol the minivan of the galaxy =] what a selling point if i am really impressed with it in the film i suppose that would change things, but i will have to see =]
thank you svelte_corps for the review! i like the inside, nice and cosey! i also like your little garden! for me, this put the twilight different in a better perspective than my first perspective of the twilight. i voted outstanding. greets the-force!
seems like tlc has done a pretty accurate representation of the ship. the real fault for the ship's messy design has to go to lucasfilm, not tlc. my guess is lucasfilm is trying to recapture that "what a piece of junk!" magic of the millennium falcon. i guess we'll have to wait to see the movie to see if they succeeded or not. the idea of a "space mobile home" reminds me of the winnebago from "spaceballs." great review!! informative, entertaining, and opinionated. so many people shy away from stating an actual opinion in their review for fear of offending anyone. what's the point of making a review if you don't state what you think about it???

[/quote] part 3: a closer view[/b] close-up of the main body of the ship: front-on. it is well-designed how the figs appear in line of sight (unlike the 6211 where jabba and leia were photoshopped in to the box art). don't ask what rotta is doing out of the line of vision there. some things are better left unsaid.

[/quote] [the rear deck is so large that it is wasted just being used so ahsoka can bungee-jump. i came up with a much better use for it. outdoor garden! despite having one roboticised hand, anakin was still quite the green thumb. and his light-saber was very useful as a hedge trimmer. so much so that he set up a side business between rotta-rescue missions. here's a promotional postcard: and to finish on a light note, i'd like to remind you that you do get another ahsoka hairpiece, which can be used for all sorts of things. ugha warrior upgrade: dr inferno hair transplant: and finally, attack of the deadly blue-ringed octopus, native to australia's beaches and oceans! thanks for reading!

having plenty of time on my hands this summer i did some reviews. yes, i'm aware this has already been done, but i'll just do it once more. no harm there set# 5615 set title: the knight price: 2.99 euro / 3.49 usd pieces: 21 (yes a whole 21 bricks) release: 2007 the box: a neat little box that has a great size for dropping into your shopping cart. for once tlg didn't shove the bricks into an oversized cardboard box ;) the knight: this is a great minifig. though he looks a little unsatisfied...might be because his head isn't put on "all the way". a great army builder fig. the only thing that i find a little annoying is that the "collar" isn't completely rounded. it looks too much like an animation and left-hand work. the weapon rack: yes! thumbs up for this. plate mail, sword, shield and jousting helmet. plus the spear and open helmet on the fig. so many great additions to put into use. bring it on pesky skeleton army. the all in all verdict: a great set. a little too expensive compared to the crossbow attack in which one gets 2 knights and a skeleton plus bricks for 5.49 euro / 5.99 usd. but still a great army builder set. and the 7090 set, does not have the same knight fig. kimt
argh! what i was typing kept getting deleted by my stupid keyboard!!!!! on topic: this looks like a great little set, i could use a few of these, but i haven't seen any at a local store. too bad for me i suspose . great review, and i like the green plate on the bottom, never can have too many greens for my small but expanding swamp i'm building. hope i can pick some of these up eventualy.
this is an awesome set in my opinion. i scraped my crossbows for mocing recently, but the set is still an amazing army builder. for the price for the sw battlepacks, which have 4 minifigs and a cheap vehicle, you get 4 knights ( this is 2 sets to equal the price of a bp ), 2 skellys and 2 skelly horses, plus 4 crossbows, 4 good wheels, and some other good dark blue and brown pieces for my ever expanding castle town. great buy.
another small set my local target doesn't have. they don't have the best castle selection, they only really have dwarven mines and castle seiges. i'll buy this if i see it there though, because it looks like a great little set. i could use the awesome knight, and a skeleton that has a regular body so he looks like he is in armor!!!!!
this set is a great little bundle, the kitted out knight, skellie knight, weapons, and the few bricks for the fence and weapon rack. the castle 07 barding here is very nice, indeed the colour scheme of the new castle guys is great imo, the light blue and blue work nicely together and against the grey background. i don't really like the pearl grey helmet - it would be nicer in metallic silver like the visor i think. interesting comment re: the skellie helmet - i guess black normal knight's helmet with visor would be quite nice for him. i got this set as part of the complete castle collection from s@h. however, i have extras of all the smaller sets and skeleton tower, except i don't have another one of this set. it's on my list of sets to buy. unfortunately it wasn't on s@h for ireland when i was making later orders - quite an odd omission. also last year castle '07 was exclusive to argos (uk catalogue retailer) who only had three sets (not the joust). i should see if the local toy store has it now though, as they did stock some '07 castle in addition to '08 at the start of the year. i think small sets like this should be well stocked in shops for a year or two - it surely doesn't do their sales much good to be so sporadically available? sorry, turned into a bit of a ramble. anyways, the point is that this set is good enough i'd pick up another. the cobra: that sucks about customs. i try to keep my orders to within the €23 duty-free limit for here in ireland. if your imports are waylaid you pay 20% import duty, 21% sales tax, and a postage fee for the diversion to customs. nasty! edited by brickzone, 13 august 2008 - 11:15 am.
kimt, on aug 13 2008, 05:00 am, said: the quality of the set. feel free to comment on the review and/or set also. thanks . the set is average. it's useful for picking up a few knights, but i'm not really partial to the skeleton. the idea of a knight and a skeleton tilting just strikes me as being odd. my biggest issue with the current castle line is that most sets force you to purchase a mixture of skeletons/knights orcs/knights orcs/dwarves etc.. this is fine for those of you who love your fantasy, however it makes the line a bit underwhelming for the rest of us. still, as mentioned earlier the set does have an upside so it is worth a purchase. the review on the other hand is aces with great photos and a detailed description of the set and its contents. nice work.

perhaps he meant the pearl light grey lance, which is not that common.
indexed name: holiday villa theme: lego system / town year: 1988 pieces: 197 minifigs: 2 price: usd ? there were quite a few sets in the 1980's that weren't sold in the us. i remember reading once that it was because they contained wine glasses and tlg felt they wouldn't be able to market a toy that encourage the drinking of alcohol. this set was one of them. i remember seeing this in a catalog that came with a fabuland set and wondering what it was and where i could get one. i wrote to lego and got an overseas catalog which had the futuron 6990 monorail transport system in it before it was available in the us. i was amazed. i ended up buying 6349 holiday villa from that catalog but, for some reason, gave it to my best friend for his birthday. i've always wanted this set and finally bought it from bricklink this year.... my purchase included everything except the box. i really like the boxes. but, in lieu of a boxshot, here is the instruction manual: i imagine this was the image on the front of the box: the parts one of the things that appealed to me about this set is it's abundance of rare parts. this base plate is an excellent piece and was only available in two sets: classic lego telephone: technically, these blue windows 1 x 4 x 5 windows are only available in this set, according to bricklink. it was available in different form (with and without fixed glass, trans blue glass) in other sets. regardless this size and color window is rare and the blue door was only available in 4 sets. this was a huge selling point for me as i'm a window monkey. never heard that term? it's like a parts monkey (a collector who buys mulitples of sets just for parts or large lots of bulk from bl and sorts them into bins) but just for windows. tell your friends i coined the term: these sloped windows have endless possibilities in many themes (maybe not with the curtain decals applied) but are another great rare part that appears in this set: the build remember this piece? i'd like to see a badass agents car built on this car base! : i am a fan of the six-wide car but i see the appeal of the four wide. it has a very nostalgic feel to it: there's no denying that this is a beauty of classic lego 4-wide cars: this set comes with two mini-figures, one of which appears to be a painter. classic vintage lego figs: onto the house which begins with the basic floorplan: a kitchen that's open to the rest of the house and a little oven and hood vent is one of my favorite touches. it's one thing to throw an oven into a house set, but the designer of this set made it a cool part of the architecture of the house which gives it a unique feel: the completed first floor and carport: i do wish the sides of the roof were white with a little overhang like an actual roof. this method of white on bottom, red on top looks more like a child's drawing than a real house. this is easily fixed with some modifying. still, you get a lot of roof pieces in this set: here we have the completed set. the husband cleans the yard while the wife gets plastered on wine. don't tell the american kids! another angle: working in the kitchen: getting smashed before dinner. i think she may have a serious problem: the bedroom. a little stark, but the bed looks comfy: overall shot of the interior: rating playability: 9/10 (the possibilities are endless with drunky mcwine-wine and husband. really, playability is up to the imagination of the player. it's a house, not really very action-packed.) design: 9.5/10 (great design with plenty of rare parts. love the classic car, too! loses half a point for the all red roof...) price: na (i believe this was inexpensive, but since i have no proof, i will have to leave this factor out of the overall rating.) overall: 9.25/10 (classic sets like this all deserve 10s in my book, but looking at it with an objective eye it's excellent, but not perfect.)
this looks like a really great set! i wasn't around in '88 to get it but i like it! it actually has things inside the interior! thanks for the review. hinckley, on aug 13 2008, 06:11 pm, said: there were quite a few sets in the 1980's that weren't sold in the us. hooray! (sort of) in england we don't get, in normal shops, batman and spongebob sets, and not at all - avatar sets, and brickmaster, but america gets all of these. maybe it's revenge for america's lego neglect in the 80's. hinckley, on aug 13 2008, 06:11 pm, said: i remember reading once that it was because they contained wine glasses and tlg felt they wouldn't be able to market a toy that encourage the drinking of alcohol. this set was one of them. they didn't want to encourage the drinking of alcohol in america but were fine encouraging it in other places? maybe that's why my country has such a big problem with binge drinking... or maybe not.

hello all eurobricks members and town lovers, today, i will be doing up the third item in the shell promotional series in 1998. three out of the eight promotional sets are under town theme. the third in the line is the exterme team sub theme which is promoted in 1998. extreme team is a bunch of adventurous, daring, breath taking individuals that risk their lives for an unforgettable excitement of the lifetime. their vehicles range from land, air and sea type of extreme taking types. extreme team is one the unknown themes ever released in my "dark age". i only had this small lovely set in my entire extreme team collection. hope we are able to see more interesting reviews under extreme team as well. name: extreme team raft theme: lego system / town / promotional / shell year: 1998 pieces: 19 minifigs: 1 price: usd$2.00 an image of a 2537, extreme team, raft this will be an exciting water adventure! this is another great addition to your female population count. she is one of thhe daring individuals in the extreme team, that take her raft beyond limit, into the rough waters where she might face possible dangers. look how confident she is, with those witty eyes of her. i am very sure she will survived the course of her entire journey. raft's design this is a very simple design, with just a big piece of wooden plank and a couple of logs tied together on the side, and it is ready to take it down to the water. speaking of some real adventure, do you dare to take this raft in the unknown waters? there is a small holding area, where she is able to place her critical equipment to ensure her safety throughout the journey. bottom of the raft excellent range of equipment this set actually provides very good range of equipment. there is a pair of oars, hammer, life vest and backpack. the most wonderful piece of equipment is the pair of dynamites. first of all, they are printed. next, they can be used in wild west or any playing possibilites which involved in explosives. this is a very good impulse set to stock up these accessories. i wondered what she need to use these dynamites for? her extreme team black jacket is very nicely designed, with their logo "x" or another way of saying "xtreme". i find the green arms and black jacket matched pretty well, with that blue cap. front view relaxing herself, listening to the calm sea to summarise, this is one of the better impulse sets ever produced. it comes with a simple raft with tons of good accessories, and a very cheap way to obtain dynamites. in fact, these are my only 2 piece in my entire collection. somehow, this set managed to find its way to my collection in my dark age, and i am very pleased to have this. no major flaws on this set, it fufill the conditions of an excellent impulse set! summary review playability: 9.5/10 (high playability involved. you can used it as an indy, adventurers or whatever purpose for the raft) design: 10/10 (very very simple design with superb great accessories. for a promo/impulse set, it's very good) price: 9.5/10 (a very inexpensive set based on the 1998 pricing. great way to buy this to add in some adventures of your own) overall: 9.7/10 (this is a fanastic set, mainly for its accessories. get it if you still see any of these. it's defintely worth the money, if its reasonable) i gave it a "5" based on my review score card. what about yours? hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine. comments and critics are strongly welcomed. pictures can be found in my brickshelf (when moderated)
this would be great for any pirate fan, the extraback pack for the soldiers, some spare owes for the row boats, a female face for a wench, and a rather simple raft for that unlucky pirate lost at sea! over all a nice set, i am a little confused by the dynamite though... perhaps an easy way to go fishing or perhaps to clear a rock in the forseen future? or is it that she is just a suicide bomber attacking the white house water (joke not ment to be tasteless or offensive to those lost in the act of terrosim, greatest respect to those who have lost loved ones) great review, regards cpt. pb
water and lit dynamite isn't a good match.
aerial recovery set #: 6462 theme: town res-q year released: 1998 piece count: 201 minifigs: 3 list price: $25 (usd) my personal favorite of the res-q theme released in 1998 was this helicopter, 6462 aerial recovery. the set offered a pretty modern helicopter, raft, three-wheeler, rescue gurney and net, and three figs including a diver. the set is action-packed and offers a high degree of play value. starting with the box, front side and back: front back i always liked the rough ocean/sea water pictured in the boxart. the same image from the front of the box appears on the cover of the instructions: but the back of the instructions picture a plain view of the copter: one sticker sheet with a few "res-q" stickers is included, mainly for the tail section of the helicopter: interestingly, the set includes three figures, one being a diver. what i always found strange is the inclusion of an "x-treme team" diver who has the logo on his torso (although it's a very nice fig): back shot: i think this was my first set with a lego three-wheeler. i always liked it a lot: the set includes a yellow raft (also found in the divers sets) and some scuba gear: note: the raft has a black piece in it's center for lifting up by the helicopter for sea and emergent rescue, a gurney can also be lifted by the helicopter: the set also includes a net with hook to lift the three-wheeler and other items. an extra string pulls the net closed: here's a shot of the helicopter: the front section has a large trans. blue piece enclosing the cockpit: inside is a printed radar slope: a smaller trans. blue piece appears a bit higher for access to the middle section of the helicopter and/or a small storage area: in the middle section is an place for the gurney and a box for storing some of the adventure gear: here's a picture showing the gurney: on the side is a pulley mechanism that swings to the right when not in use: on the opposite side is the winch to raise and lower the grappling hook: here's a picture of an open storage box: i like the tail section with propeller: decal is not shown here's another shot of the copter from a different angle: and the final image, the entire set: final thoughts personally, i think this is pretty nice set. i like the thought of using the helicopter to rescue people at sea using the working winch. extras like the trike/three-wheeler and the rescue net make the set even more fun. hope you enjoy this res-q review.
a neat set with lots of accessories, but i never liked any of the lego helicopters with long streamlined canopies, as they are obviously more influenced by military helicopters and space ships, than by real civilian transport helicopters. i'd give it a 3 at best. very good and thourough pictorial review though!
i stopped collecting lego sets in the early 90s because of this kind of sets. i've always been a classic town fan and i really didn't liked the futuristic design of tlc's newer sets.
what exactly makes you feel this set isn't realistic? it has got nothing what wouldn't be on a real helicopter, imo. and for the futuristic design, yes, it looks modern, but it works. and actually, most of today's real helicopters also don't look like in the 70's anymore.
this is one of my favourite sets. i remember getting it in tesco soon after it was released. those were the days... the res-q line was good, and this set made it better.
about the rarest one up there is that black ninja. i only have one ninja and he is dark grey. i also have five samurai. the witch may be fairly rare but i am not sure. i didn't really collect much in the fright knight era.
looks great, and the figures up there are old, and kinda rare. i don't really like fright knights though, so i probably won't get this set.
thanks for the review. i've added it to the index. i'm not a fan of this theme. but i have to say that this is a neat little set, that does hold some good things. figs and weapons are always welcome and one can never have to many wheels. so i rate this "average."
this is a pretty nice set. i really like the torso and its "genericness" so it can be used for other factions. and at least this set has 2 shields (althought i prefer the triangular ones) instead of just 1 shield you get from crossbow attack (from the wrong fraction, i'd have liked a crown knights shield 100x better). some improvements for this set would be a normal bow and a sword instead of 2 of the 3 crossbows, smaller wheels and triangular shields. 4/5 from me (actually 3,5 but i'll round it up)
i gave it above average. it was a nice set and included some nice pieces, but it is only an impulse set after all. edited by newright, 19 august 2008 - 01:06 pm.
this is probably my all-time favorite lego set. it was originally given to me for my birthday by a close friend of mine back in the release year of 1997. the cargo plane was, by far, my favorite vehicle ever. unfortunately, someone stole the plane from me when our families went on vacation and the rest of the set was given to my cousin's oldest son when i was no longer interested in my lego collection. now that i'm back into lego, i use that building's construction for various projects, especially as a dr. inferno look-out shack using parts from extra mission 3: swamp raid. the shack compliments the original set greatly. edited by skorpius47, 19 august 2008 - 01:44 am.
no, yoda was released in no less than 3(4) sets. ok, so i remembered wrong. i just have plenty yodas and one is more than enough for the set list click here thanks for pointing that out.
i think this is a pretty lame set. it came with dooku, who i think only came in this set, plus a unique lightsaber. still, they could have made it much bigger, added anikan and obi-wan, and added structures and made it more like the scene from the movie. also, the speeder doesn't seem very accurate.
i missed this set.but i reallly like the yoda and count dooku.i especially like count dooku's lightsaber.one thing though,is it me oris yoda's lightsaber blue in the picture? edited by pr0visorak, 20 august 2008 - 12:21 pm.
i got this set a long time ago. the review pretty much says all there is to say about it. (never knew what the red/brown thing was anyway, i used it as a canon.) isn't this also the only set up until now that had count dooku in it?
very nice review. one thing you have to consider: when lego sees pics of the star wars universe, they have to decide which would be the easiest set to make with the most playibility. therefore, they chose the hmp. quote thanks for the review. it's always good to have a 2nd opinion on a set. i've added the usual poll and i'll index it tomorrow (must sleep). super pics and great to have "in-build" pics default_thumbup.gif a fine set which i'll surely buy when i find it. default_hmpfbad.gif where? edited by lt. col. thok, 18 august 2008 - 10:07 pm.

niuce review! i voted above average, it's very cool but not awesome.
and it's now a part of the index. i've added it as "review 2" since we've already got one. thanks for the review and it's always nice to have nmore than one view/opinion on a given set
i remember getting this for christmas, and despite the earthy grey parts i relly enjoyed it, and it is nice to see pictures of it again- thanks.
metalandi, thanks for doing up this review! this is a chance for me to gain some insight for extreme team theme. this is a very interesting set that can be used for so many purposes. 3 different vehicles, wide range of accessories and nice minifigs. what i love the most, is the mountain, bridge and tent. it provided so much playability. i am very impressed with it. thanks for sharing.
thank you for that very interesting review, metalandi. a cool set with a lot of features and some nifty vehicles, very playable and well designed indeed. perhaps a bit too colorful for my likings, but pretty impressive in its conception for sure. i wish we could see some more landscaping coming along with todays vehicle sets as well...
set data 4920: the rapid rider year: 1999 subtheme: rock raiders pieces: 37 (+1 extra - trneongreen plate 1 x 1 round) price: euro 3,50, used, not including s/h, on ebay building time: less than 10 minutes. more info: bricklink - peeron. i could have owned the 4910 hover scout (see metalandi's review here), but while i was buying some used sets, i forgot to buy that one too! so, here's my only rr set, the second smallest one (if we don't count japanese promos; sweets are surely sweeter if they come with a lego set!) pieces: face and torso closeup; i like the torso, the face is good except for the bandanna. building is based on two big pieces: landing skids and plate 6 x 6 x 2/3 cross with dome. let's go! building is over: review: pros: small set (= cheap), 1 fig, two accessories, some interesting pieces like the rock and the crystal. no stickers but 3 printed pieces! good color choice. cons: tipper bucket is fixed, no hinge. no levers or steering wheel, it probably moves by using the buttons on the 2x2 tile. it deserves a 4/5.
rock raiders was the shit back in the day. awesome theme! i had this set as well as the tunnel transporter, which was amazing.
i do like the set, although i don't own it. i do remember lusting after it when i was a kid, though (mainly because of the female minifig and the colors). it's a bit simplistic, but comes with a few great parts. you also did a great job on describing the set, and the pictures give the full impression of the appearance. for the review, i just have to point out a few things, to give you constructive criticism: first of all, it's chef, not "chief" (entirely different professions), and secondly, the scale you give in the poll isn't very even. "above average" jumps to "outstanding", which is a too big of a gap in my opinion. you should've used "good" or "great" in between them. but these are only minor faults, this is a good review anyway!
a very good set indeed, we have at least 3 of them, but we like them all.
nice review,3 or 4 years ago my dad picked up two large boxes full of classic era legos (classic town,some pirate,and alittle episode 1 star wars etc)i couldn't find the building in this set but i had the little van from this set.its very sturdy, i should know my idiot friend dropped this from my second floor window and it styed togethersure the pizzas fell out and they probably got cold thanks for the review!
i used to want this set so badly and i almost got it when it was rereleased. i still wonder why i didn't because with a building, van, 5 pizzas, and a then very rare female fig. this set would have been perfect for someone with a smaller collection like i had then. what surprised me the most is how well this set still holds up to others today. off to bricklink!
thanks for the nice review of this great set, whitefang! i always want to grab one, but the price to buy it now is too forbidding... i also always think the girl minifig is supposed to be a customer... lego is really up to everyone's own imagination... edited by alywin, 15 may 2009 - 06:27 pm.
i just built this set in mlcad as a requestfor a fellow eurobricks member. somehow i missed out on this set completely when it came out. i was really suprised how long it took to build (virtually). despite its size this set is packed with details, minifigs, vehicles and tools. thanks for all the pictures! gif xml: 6479 emergency response center edited by missouri_bb63, 31 december 2009 - 09:32 am.
there are very few late 90's or early 00's sets worth ever having and i wish i had this one. with it's futuristic look and yes, that tow truck too, oh yeah heaps of equipment ! it's not over junorised, there is still plenty of building in it. thanks and have a happy new year, 'metalandi' !
wow, this is one great review! fantastic pictures, this looks like one cool set with heaps of neat functions. a shame it doesn't include exclusive figures (like ahsoka and captain rex in the at-te or plo koon and asajj ventress in the gunship), but you can't have everything. so again, thanks for this sweet review! ~peace
thanks for this great review, baby i like the clarity of your photos, and the description is well written. i'll try and see if i can gather the money for this one (fingers crossed) luxorv
thank you kimt for adding the poll. hehe. this is my first review so, i'm not so confident about the pictures. thank you guys for viewing and commenting.
thanks for the really cool review baby . i think this is an awesome first attemp for your first review: it flows well, really good pics and many pics . in the set, i think this is a good purchase i will buy it when it comes out in the us and i think it is cool looking and the fuctions look neat . edited by darkrebellion, 26 august 2008 - 11:12 pm.
wow, this ship is really big, judging from the size of its hull!!! wondering where can i keep it when i've bought it. ;)
right so here's my review (finally). the whole gallery of box, parts, minifigs and finished model is here, over 2 pages. so on with the show. minifigs http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=1340864 in the set you get krakaroff (i dunno how to spell it) and victor krum. the figs are exactly the same, bar their heads. these are two fantastic figures, the expression on krakaroff's face is priceless. judging by the design i think we might get a yellow krakaroff cropping up somewhere, which would make me a happy bunny (he'd make a fantastic viking) ideally i'd have liked more than 2 figures for my money, three would have done it, i think 2 is too few. piece count http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=1344573 http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=1344571 http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=1344572 for a ?40 set, the piece count is quiet good, i don't know the exact number but when building it, i didn't feel short changed, bar the exception of the hull. now i don't hate the hull, my problem is that is doesn't connect with bricks like the old pirate ships. there are pros and cons to this, on the plus side its more secure, and your whole ship doesn't need to be taken up with support structure. the negative side being, you can't really make it bigger (as they've only released a megablocking 4+ set with the right piece, and its the wrong color). i also like how its wide, meaning you can fit loads of minifigs on the main deck. overall though i liked the pieces. of note are gold studs (http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=1344510) (5 in total, you get one spare), the return of the black falcon shields (http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=1340835) and the new drumstrang shields. the construction a simple fun build. nothing too fiddly. the finished model http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=1344474 (big picture) i really like this set. there's no bones about it. it seems lego with the latter half of 2005 have given people who loved their original pirate ships hope for the future with this and the fantastic viking longboat. even with the two 4+ pieces (the hull, and front of the ship) i wasn't put off. http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=1340841 http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=1344461 the front of the ship is a nice piece, and can be used for stuff like castles. http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=1344490 http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=1344491 http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=1344492 http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=1344494 and the hull isn't all bad. what i really liked was the little cargo hold, at the moment i have a treasure chest in there, but there' space for about eight of them i reckon. playability wise it does make alot of sense, and as you can see you can imprision minifigs below deck. http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=1344484 http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=1344488 http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=1344506 http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=1344500 the quarters are great as well. you can comfortably fit about six minifigs in the main gally, three by the steering wheel, and a couple up above the top cabin. you could fit more, but it'd look strange. my only gripe is the design of the top cabin. when you want to open it up, you have to remove the mast. i know its simple enough, but i think that it wouldn't have taken much for tlc to design it better. but saying that its easily done, and i like how the cabin can be lifted with ease from the steering deck. http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=1344540 the final play feature is the plank. you can while away the hours murdering hapless minifigs who've displeased the cabin. a really nice addition for pirate fans. the final verdict[/b playability: 9.5/10 - lots to do for all the kids. piece count: 9/10- a great selection, loses one for the hull. figures: 8/10 - just needs one more! construction: 9/10 - nice and simple. value: 8.5/10 - let down a bit by lack of minifigs, and the cons of the hull. [b]overall: 8.8/10 overall this is a set worth getting, especially if you miss proper pirates. it wouldn't take much to turn this into an amazing pirate ship moc. hope you liked my review. matt

that explains why it isn't in our local stores. i also got it from s@h, but my box hasn't got the "special edition printing" on it, surprisingly.
nice review. the figure fitting inside is great. i think the price might be a little high but you did get it from tru so what else is to be expected.
great review! the y-wing is an awesome starfighter and the detail in this set is superb. funnily enough i was just swooshing mine today! edited by pedro, 27 august 2008 - 08:25 pm.

i've built the y-wing and the imperial landing craft (7659) more or less at the same time and, for about the same prices, i think the imperial landing craft (ilc) is much superior to the y-wing. the y-wing doesn’t have much functionality besides an awkward dropping bomb device and a moving cannon. the missiles firing system is … your fingers. the ilc has an awesome missiles firing system (i wish i could get it individually for mocs), a clever bomb dropping mechanism, 5 minifigures with weapons, the wings fold up together and the “cargo” can be detached as a play set. i’ve built the ilc first so i got quite disappointed with the y-wing.
stauder, on aug 29 2008, 12:37 pm, said: don't aregue with him when it comes to y-wings. he offerd to swoosh one in the nude... stauder. indeed...
the y-wing is a truly beautifull ship, and lego has done a great job on this one, lacking landing gear is a minus point though. and nice review by the way!
is it worth the money since the new y-wing comes out next year?
i think it is a fair to ask questions here with the expectation of a new y-wing in the coming year. i came here to look at the review even though it is a few years old. no images to go with the review. bummer. i'd like to see a more friendly tolerance on dated threads being bumped.

another fine review! i love the last (action) picture. thanks for sharing! btw, i am so looking forward to that 384 london bus review.
thanks for the review, ~vbbn~. i have to say, ef has never really caught my attention, but this set seems alright. to be honest, when i saw the topic title, i was expecting a tiger- looking mech. the mech itself is cool, except for the huge leg pieces. i think the minifigs are great in ef sets, with the dark colored outfits, like dark red or dark green.
i voted "average". i think this is the least attractive among the 2008 exo-force sets. i saved my money to buy some of the 2006 mechas.
what do you mean the troll’s should outnumber the crown knight? how are you going to manage that? well here’s the answer. theme: castle set name: troll warrior set number: 5618 number of pieces: 19 figures:1 released: 2008 list price: £2.50 (gbp) $3.50 (usd) 2.99 (euro) 5618 peeron.com 5618 bricklink catalog 5618 shop at home lets us begin with the box. the troll warrior and his might cart. set sets for children to pester for at christmas. now for what’s inside. the contents of the box, it doesn’t look like much. now for the troll himself, i’m glad they selected this troll torso rather than the other one for the impulse set i think this one is the superior one. also he comes well armed with a spear and sword but no shield sadly. someone really needs to look at the rodent problem in the castle sets.. now the cart, nice easy construction as with all impulse sets, i’m still not convinced by the flicking missiles. a line of those would do some damage. what an oncoming army can expect to see.. all together now and it looks rather good. so there we have it a cheap way of bolstering the troll army and outfitting them with some more weapons. also for anyone planning a pied piper moc another set with a rat in it. the rating system figures: 8/10 (|preferred troll torso and helmet style. ) parts 7/10 (two spears and a sword but sadly lacking that all important shield.) fun fun fun 4/10 (somewhat more to do on it’s own that other impulse at least the troll can fight the rat!) design 7/10 (well designed even the flicker missile doesn’t look bad) price 8/10 (at £2.50 more than the other castle impulse.) grand total 34/50 (lack of a shield and to small to stand alone for my rating system..) conclusion. castle fans got a great army builder with the knight and they’ve been lucky enough to receive another one with this set. i’m glad we’ve got a troll impulse as it allow for enlarging the armies of evil some the crown knight don’t totally outnumber all their opponents.
nikola bathory, on aug 28 2008, 11:47 pm, said: wait a second, a "troll"?? isn't that an orc? i thought that this is a troll: those are giant trolls. the regular sized green guys (such as is included with this set) are trolls. yes, they look like orcs but lego calls them trolls.
nice review! i never new trolls had fireworks, at least that's what it looks like to me. maybe i shall build a trollish fireworks company! fireworks on!
i'm not really impressed by this set as much as other impulse sets. the knight impulse set #5615 offers more in my opinion since it gives two helmets, two weapons, a shield and an armor piece along with the weapon rack. i'm not a fan in the slightest of flickfire missles and projectiles like on the cart, and the previously mentioned one piece axle limits the wheel usage in other mocs. i would've liked to see an added chest armor piece at the very least and a shield would've made this great. those things are so rare and it would've bumped the piece count up to 21 to match the knight set. since both are showing the same price on s@h(in us dollars at least), it would've made sense.

i wasn't all that impressed with what you get in this set for the price. but you have an interesting point; that the robot can be considered a reference to the classic space bots. makes me think i ought to try modding the robot later...
something i forgot to mention is that great review xenologer, on aug 28 2008, 08:28 pm, said: makes me think i ought to try modding the robot later... mod the robot? why? you should see the interior! stauder.
kimt, on aug 28 2008, 09:52 pm, said: i'd rather get another impulse set than this. except the other life on mars mars mission impulse sets. actually i kinda like the crystal hawk impulse. the default model isn't that great but you get a few nice wing plates to work with (after rearranging it looks pretty good). i guess this one though, is good for some nice parts, tho its pretty limited in what you can rebuild it into, and it seems less value because the astronaut has no vehicle... best impulse set has to be the troll warrior... feels very 'complete', and space orcs are always nice to have...

cues the indy theme song let's follow indy on his pursuit on the stolen ark. indy rides full speed ahead on his white horse, but the nazis are pulling away! will indiana jones be able to grab on to the truck and reclaim the treasure? or will the nazis and their high-powered mercedes trucks prevail? let's find out! 7622 race for the stolen treasure set info set name: 7622 race for the stolen treasure theme: indiana jones released: 2008 price: 29.99 usd 34.95 euro 24.99 gbp pieces: 272 minifigs: 4 price per piece: about 11 cents and now, the main event! first, the box shots the front shows a nice image of indy on his horse, trying to make it on to the truck, and the attack truck taking aim. the back this side shows some of the features of the set, in little pictures on the left. instruction manual not much to say here, as it's the same picture as on the box. inside the manual on one of the last pages we have a nice picture like the one on the back of the box, showing some features of the set. random manual pic here we have the nice piece call-outs that we have come to expect lately. the bags were numbered as well. the pieces a nice selection here, especially if you like black, dark bley and bley. "cool" pieces the golden treasure chest has a really nice sparkle to it. the set also has a good assortment of coins and jewels, and some wonderful silver 1x1 dots. the canvas covering this is quite nice. it has a nice dark tan color, and some nice detail on it as well. the minifigs first comes indy's beautiful white horse. i always like lego animals and this one is no exception. here are the figs on the left indiana jones, and his nice stubble, printed legs, side bag and the best lego hat in history. and the nazis, peter, hans, and klaus. their torsos are very nice and the hats are amazing. they look really nice with all of their tan. the extra parts here you get two of the nice silver 1x1s, some clear 1x1s, and the usual technic pins and levers. now the finished set! first we have the attack truck the truck looks very good. it looks very military like with the colors and the design. it is designed wonderfully with really nice mudguards and a well-detailed front. the only fault of this is i think the top part where the gunner stands is a bit bare. the front here you can see the front, which has a nice smooth look with some nice details as well. the front ridged piece works well here. the gun this is well made. it is built by attaching a lightsaber hilt in a sort of videocamera piece. the actual area where the guy stands is pretty bare, but not too bad. backside of the truck the spare tire here is a simple, but nice touch. a side view the mudguards are smartly built by clipping wing flaps on to handle plates. this part gets a bit tedious, but the end result is worth it. the big boy cargo truck! this is another really well built truck. it has a lot of the same design elements as in the smaller truck, such as the mudguards. front view the front of this truck is as nice or better than the other truck. it uses good snot building, and everything fits in well. a close-up view of the tire area just behind the tire you can see those silver 1x1s being used as the suspension. this is a really nice addition and it looks great. note: it's only visual suspension. it is not supposed to work. the canvas cover in action now the canvas attaches by putting the holes in the canvas, on some little blue technic pins and then clamping them down with the hinged pieces. it looks really nice and curves nicely. the windscreen treasure! my favorite piece in action. i took this picture with the flash on, so you can see how it sparkles. i think we have waited far too long for this great piece. the complete set! everything all together. indy is chasing fast! indy's got it! brickshelf folder now, for the ratings! price: 9/10 (not bad, but could have slightly more pieces. at least it has 4 minifigs and that makes up for it.) parts: 9/10 (a nice selection of parts, lots of greys and black.) design: 10/10 (the trucks are really well-designed, the mudguards are excellent.) playability: 8/10 ( i always like rolling the trucks across the floor. ) build: 9/10 (pretty good, but gets a bit repetitive in some parts.) overall: 45/50 brickset bricklink entry peeron lego s@h even after intense fighting, everyone always gets along when there's food to be eaten... "hey indy! vant some mustard?" "how about some ketchup?" summary this, and all of the other indiana jones sets are some of my favorites. they all have nice colors, good design, and great minifigs. although i need indy in a different outfit pretty soon. his outfit is starting to smell a bit ripe . this set in particular is very well designed, and i can't wait for some more indy next year. thanks, and happy building! edited by erdbeereis1, 29 august 2008 - 03:47 am.
great review! hmm, i notice that the leg of that old guy is not so perfect. perhaps you want to push it?
i love this set... indy is what got me back into lego.
i discovered this review a month ago and since that point in time, i could not get the image of the sparkling golden chest out of my mind. i finally just purchased the chest for myself. i suppose this is a testament to how well honed your picture taking skills are. this set is definitely a nice one. i'm not a lego indy collector, but i was tempted to purchase this set several times. the vehicles are very nicely detailed and have some cool building techniques, such as the wheel guards.
another great review erdbeeries! i have to give it a i have thought about this set long and hard and your review might just force me to pick it up. the vehicles look nice and the nazi's are great figs. bravo.
legoman132, on aug 29 2008, 03:35 pm, said: this set is nice it looks like a dhl van funny, thats what i thought when i first saw the pics good review btw oh and i keep meaning to get this set but keep forgeting..
good review, thanks! for the mail van, while it certainly adds interaction and fun to a lego town, it alone lacks details and playability, and thus not a good set, especailly taking its price into consideration. its value is pretty much just like, if not less than, some impulse sets, in my opinion...
it's a good set, but i think the first sticker shouldn't say "7731"
legoman132, on aug 29 2008, 06:35 am, said: this set is nice it looks like a dhl van makes you wonder if there was some kind of promo or hookup in the pipeline that never happened?? i have this set and i really like it. it works well with either the new city sets or with my older 1980s/1990s sets. i actually like the use of the old style car base and mourned the day that these became exitinct the first time round (c1990). thanks for the review! cheers rog
it's an ok set. i just don't really like the look of the van much. too rounded for my liking. what happened to the box like cars??
i agree that this is a very good looking set. i just finished building mine yesterday, and i love it. but here is one suggestion. trim the large sticker that goes on the roof of the vehicle by cutting along the angles at the front of the sticker. if you use it as it is, it will extend beyond the "flat" surface of the roof and will overlap the lower sections. past experience with stickers has suggested that this sticker will "lift" at the front corners. lego stickers are probably the best that there are, but sometimes modifications must be made. now i want that large coast guard helicopter, #7738!!!
i had to vote outstanding on this set because it simply is, great minifigs, a cool head sculpture and a nice little boat means unlimited playability, great review though man!
as i've already said somewhere on this forum, this is the largest islander set i own and therefore my favourite. thankyou for your great review. i picked mine up for only 5 pounds along with crocodile cage and king kahuka, but i can't help you with the original price. i would search the web but i'm too tired right now...
$17 for an old set is good. i may hunt for it on ebay. :)
very solid set. 5 minifigs and plenty of weapons to go around, adding up to great playability, what more could you want? (aspecially from a set this size) only i would have liked another cutlass, a musket (instead of 1 of the pistols) and for 1 of the pirates to have another head, but those things are no big deal, it is still a lot better than sets nowadays. edited by fluyt, 23 december 2008 - 09:50 pm.
those indians look useful for indiana jones in the future {as long as the have the new skin color} i wish i could have picked one of those up when i could.
i do not like the fact that the clones have pure white legs. it looks weird to me. it was also weird that they included shock troopers, but it was probably a way to get people to buy it. this set also seems like one of those that was kind of thrown in with a mix of other sets like the tie crawler. i never picked it up, and with the new clone wars sets out, i won't.

i like this set, but i don't like the pure white legs for the shock troopers. it looked better with the black leg joint piece. i also think the set looks like half an at-te.
did anyone encounter the problem with the main turret? apparently, the very tip of the piece (cone shape) can't be put onto the "pole" piece. i check the instructions 2 times and still can't find what i'm doing wrong. is it just me or did anyone else got this problem as well?
i did enjoy it thanks for sharing your thoughts in this set and reviewing it. i'll add it to the index. maybe you should consider joining the reviewers academy and rule the galaxy (or something )

valentin, nice review! i was thinking of doing this review, and realised there were 3 reviews being done for this lovely set. i must admit this is an amazing set, after buying it in tru for sgd$49.90 (15% discount). i like the comparison of both spider droid even though one is not lego. thanks for doing this lovely review. it's enjoyable to read.
thanks. keke, imagine the horror that gripe my heart to see the discounted price on the sg's toys 'r' us flyer about a month after its release into retail. anyway, looking forward to your other reviews too.
kudos on a well presented and written review. i think the reason this set didn't release in us was because it didn't have any warnings about choking anywhere on the box, therefore no lawsuits in us for lego. cheers isc
worst set of the year? worst set of all time? the pictures say it all, no ratings necessary. a waste of paper for box and instructions, and waste of plastic for bag and jelly alien. the little alien ship that comes with the switch fighter beats this one hands down, as well as any other lego spaceship i have ever seen and i have seen many. thankfully this set isn't available in my country, which is something i never thought i would say. anyway, i hope tlg makes these awful jelly aliens disappear forever after this year.
thanks for this review. as for the set? well, i am not to crazy about this set, but i want some sort of small alien fleet vehicals, and this would work well. but i would rather ave my money to buy classic town. edited by ~vbbn~, 01 september 2008 - 02:48 am.
i already don't liked the aliens, but if the fighter was better i would already bought him. now i will maybe buy one of it just for the 2 limegreen pieces.
cardinal brick, on aug 30 2008, 06:23 pm, said: the question is what could you do with this set, i mean it’s just spacemen in a line? what could you do? the possibilities are endless!! 1. you can stand them in a line 2. stand them in a circle 3. stand them in a square 4. sit them all down 5. sit some of them down and leave some standing up (adult supervision may be necessary for tfols attempting this one) 6. take them all apart and scatter the pieces like some kind of huge space mine has gone off 7. yeah, ok. that's probably enough for now seriously, i love all the sets of minifigs from all the different themes and this is a great one. i always wanted them when i was a kid but never did. my focus always was on town sets (petrol stations and police sets please stand up) and there was never enough pocket money left over for space. sigh! you are so lucky to have this great set! thanks for sharing cheers rog
mass-manufactured and designed to withstand extreme amounts of punishment... it's an iron drone, and it's marching on its sentry! set data 7711: sentry year: 2006 theme: exo-force subtheme: robots pieces: 74 (+4 extra) <- both counting hinge control stick and its base as two separate pieces price: euro 7 circa, misb, including s/h, on ebay; rrp was euro 5 circa / 5 usd. probably 5 ukp. building time: 20/25 minutes (10 minutes building, the rest of the time placing stickers!) more info: brickset - peeron being 2006 my last dark year, i wasn't a big exoforce fan but they were ok. i tought 2007 models were better, and still think 2008 models are the best. that basically means 1) it's a shame that there will be no more of this line and 2) this is my first 2006 model, yet i bought in in july 2008. ok, let's do this one. box front: box was battered due to italian post; they'll do their best to give lego boxes a "war" outlook. close-up: the japanese katakana read "tokushu butai" -> special (military) force(s) box back: amazing alternate model; some like it more than the original design. box content: a small but capable sticker sheet, two bags and instructions. sticker sheet: and they're numbered! random instructions page: connecting legs to the body instructions page - sticker detail: that's why they're numbered. instructions page - parts inventory: does anybody check if they're all there before building? surely not me. loose pieces: nothing rare, i think; small techinc parts come in different colours, as usual (you often don't see them when the model is complete, but sometimes you do) the iron drone: "strong and durable" (and much better looking than those crappy mm jelly aliens) building starts. the open cockpit - front and rear view left leg - front and rear view; right leg is built of the same pieces. left arm - with laser cannon the cannon - great use of the hollow studs with the "plant tree palm top" right arm - with twin missiles complete model - front view complete model - side view and rear view rating and review. parts and building: nothing new, but both models are o.k. instead of waiting the last page of the manual, you'd better put the stickers in place while building. looking at the box you'd tell stickers background is (trans) purple. it actually is trans clear (excpet for the yellow and black stripes - warning: hazard!). try not to put your fingerprints on the sticky side! consider using tweezers. posability: both legs and both arms feature three joints; and that's good, so that the weight doesn't have the sentry falling down. final model: smaller compared to 2007 claw crusher and 2008 batlle arachnoid, but cheaper and surely worth the money. the "minifig" is just another iron drone, not much to say. final rating: 3,5/5 edited by sinner, 01 september 2008 - 02:22 am.

this is a very good review, no doubt about it. about this set, this is a cheap way to buy this set with a witch and some nifty accessories such as the black cat. in fact, i think this is the first time i had ever seen a black cat. it's simple, but not very useful in my collection. because other fright knight sets also offer the witches too. i don't need many witches. overall, i feel that this is an average set.
yay, another fright knights review! odd comic at the end. skipper 24, on sep 1 2008, 07:05 pm, said: ever wanted to turn into a animal, wanted to curse your enemy or just wanted to be rich beyond your wildest dreams. you should go visit the witch and her fireplace. she can brew you up a potion for any occasion or purpose. so head down to see the witch right now. sounds like a song or nursery rhyme, somehow. anyway, to the review, it is a great review, such a small set but you've summed it up well. this is one of the few unpromo fright knight sets i didn't get, sadly. not 'sadly' because of willa the witch, i have about four of her, but the special cat, and the other bits (one can never have too many lego bats). i voted the set outstanding, i think it is for its size. kimt, on sep 1 2008, 08:16 pm, said: you already know how i feel about the review. good or bad feelings? edited by shoc, 02 september 2008 - 11:45 am.

huzzah! the king has declared a royal tournament pitting the brave knight in his shining armour, against the feared skeleton warrior and his shadow horse. the jousting arena is set up so let the joust begin! 7009 the final joust set info set name: 7009 the final joust theme: castle released: 2007 price: usd 7.99-gbp 5.99-eur 7.95 pieces-62 minifigs: 2 figs 2 horses price per piece: about 13 cents let the games begin! box shots the front has an image of the knight and skeleton jousting with lightning in the background. the back show the two now fighting with an ax and ball and chain. i don't really like the box image, as i think the background looks too dark. manual the front has the same picture as on the box. on the back some of the other 2007 castle sets are displayed. this is better than the usual sweepstakes image that we get. the pieces nothing really special here. but you at least get a good assortment of weapons. shields i always like lego shields and these are no exception. the patterns are great. minifigs first the horses. these are great, the knight's horse's coverings are really nice. now, the minifigs. the knight and skeleton both have nice armor. the torsos are plain black for the skeleton and bley for the knight. the finished product in the middle is the jousting barrier which is simple, but serves its purpose. on the left we have the weapon rack which is good. it would have been nice if tlg had included a rack for the skeleton as well though. extra parts only two extra white parts here. you can use them if your knight's horse wants to retire and look like a normal horse again. oh! that has to hurt! it seems that the skellie has won this round! poor knight... brickshelf folder now, for the ratings! price: 7/10 (not a very good price per piece ratio, however at least 2 figs and 2 horses are included) parts: 7/10 (the shields and log bricks are nice, but most of the others are nothing spectacular) design: 8/10 (relatively well designed, but a bit boring) playability: 8/10 (you can joust with it and that's about all) build: 8/10 (short and easy) overall: 38/50 brickset lego s@h peeron bricklink strike! it seems that the horses have rebelled against their riders... summary this set although not amazing, is still a very solid set. the minifigs are great and so are the horses, but the rest of the set kind of feels like an afterthought. even with its negative aspects i still recommend it, especially if you are a castle fan. thanks, and happy building! p.s. if you want to see how i made this set a bit more fun, check out this click

swman, on sep 1 2008, 05:08 pm, said: this was a great set for the price. ten dollars for a cool minifigure and a decent sized ship is great. indeed, it is. kimt, on sep 3 2008, 01:11 pm, said: yeah this was an ok set. i remember getting a few of these at tru. the boxes were smashed up and i got some 30 percent off. (still not as cheap as regular us price ) some ok bricks and a great minifig. thanks for sharing your thoughts and opinions on this set i'll rate this set as average. oh, yeah i've added the review to the index. thanks for the index, kimt. by the way, a certain someone recommended that i should change the fig pics, so i did that. edited by jimbutcher, 05 september 2008 - 01:35 am.
is your knight army feeling short? do your knights get consistently run over by the skeletons? if so, this is the set for you! 852271 knights battle pack set info set name: 852271 knights battle pack theme: castle released: 2008 price: usd 12.99-gbp 6.49-eur 9.95 minifigs: 5 it's army building time! packaging the figs come in a plastic box with a slide out tray. to open, you slide out a tab on the bottom, and pull the tray out. the weapons one plus of this set is the good weapon selection. you get a whopping 5 shields, a spear, a lance, acrossbow, a pointed lance thing and a lovely chrome sword minifigures now the main focus of this set, the figs! one thing that's nice here is that you get a good selection of different knights. the figs are quite nice, with different faces and helmets for almost every one. minifig backsides! i really like the archer's quiver. two sided head the archer has a scared head on the other side. brickshelf folder and now, the ratings! price: 6/10 (certainly a bit overpriced. it should have been $10. the star wars battle packs have only 1 less fig plus some parts for $5 less) parts: 8/10 (no bricks, but a nice selection of weapons) minifigs 9/10 (the figs are great) overall: 23/30 lego s@h brickset bricklink even with a bigger army, the poor knights are no match for modern technology... summary even though the pack is a bit overpriced, it is still great for increasing your army's size. i would get this set if you are a castle fan looking to expand your army, otherwise don't worry if you pass on this set. thanks, and happy building!
great review of a neat way to bulk up your castle guards and their associated weapons and shields. i hope we continue to see sets like this in the future, they have to be a good money maker for tlg and they always please the fans. francis marion, on sep 2 2008, 10:39 am, said: they should have given him a horse ... with that lovely new barding. nobody would complain about the price then, even if it was $15.
great set, but with two huge cons. - availabilty: only on s@h? well, surely not in italian stores. - why are the figures already built? are today's kids so dumb? let's go back to those old minifig packs!
i think this battle pack is a little expensive, but the minifig ,their heads and weapons and stuff are very very nice! but because of the price, i'll rate it " average" ^^
i love this set. i bought one when i went to the lego store at downtown disney, and went home and bought another online. i love that it gives you a variety of weapons and figures. i like using the bowl helmet guy to man my catapults and crossbows.
great review! i still don't plan on getting this set. i want to get more important stuff like the new medieval market... edited by lego12, 07 october 2008 - 12:19 am.
dear all, i found this to be a very usefull army building set. at 2 euro per minifig it is relatively cheap in my book, so i bought 4 battle packs recently. although, it could be difficult to integrate all of them in your army. personally, i reshuffled some of the weapons as to integrate them better. but that is a personal preference ofcourse. kind regards, teddy
i also love the impulse sets, but we have already too many policemen (although i actually bought this one). our bobby isn't looking very nice is he?! we normally but policemen in a pool or sea with sharks at events like legoworld, so maybe that's because of me edited by jopiek, 02 september 2008 - 11:00 pm.
i bought this set for 2,14€ yesterday and i have to admit that for that price i'm veerryy satisfied ! i bought it especially for the dog (my first one) and for the road sign. during the construction (short!) of the set, i was wondering something... does the speed limit has a signification in every country or some variant exists? in my country (france), the speed limit in town is 50 km/h so i understand the road sign in this set. but in other country, and especially the country were the speed limit is not in km/h, does this set had another road sign?
tanks for the review erdbeereis1 but i don't really need to buy this set since they're are always loads of police sets and it's not as if i need anymore cops, although stud makes it tempting...
thanks for this fine and elaborate review on the 2nd best impulse set there is. (yes the troll warrior wins by a zillion miles) i've added it to the index
set name: crossbow attack set number: 7090 theme: castle pieces: 54 minifigs: 3 released: 2007 price: 5.99usd, 3.99 eur, 7.99 cdn legoshop.com description: ready, aim, fire!it's a battle of brave knights against the evil skeleton rider! includes 2 knights, skeleton and a skeleton horse! rolling wagon has a launcher that really fires! bricklink inventory peeron inventory brickshelf gallery now, on to the review! the box as you can see, the front of the box illustrates the set very nicely, showing the skeleton warrior attacking and the knights firing their crossbow. the back the back of the box shows a small battle happening between a knight and a skeleton, as well as the main feature of the set, the firing crossbow (more on that later.) the instructions not much to say here, its the same as the front of the box. the back of the instructions this merely shows pictures of other sets in the castle line. random instruction page this set does not use piece callouts to tell you what parts you will need in each step. however, the set is so small you should never have trouble finding a piece. the minifigures this is the main reason i bought this set. you get two knights, one with a standard helmet, and the other one with a new mold. you also get a skeleton warrior. the horse the set comes with a skeleton horse that looks great. however, it is a single molded piece that has no articulation. close-up of the warrior riding his horse here you see the brave skeleton riding in on his...ah......er......um......noble steed! the accessories/weapons for minifigure accessories, you get an axe, a skeleton sword, and a skeleton shield. extra pieces i was left with one skeleton arm and one leg when i was finished the build. the crossbow wagon and now, to the main part of the set, the crossbow wagon. it is really just a plate with some whells attached and a lot of those cheese wedge pieces to create the track for the projectile. back view this view shows the mechanism that makes the crossbow fire. it is powered by a rubber band. you pull back on a technic piece, which creates tension in the elastic band. when you let go, the elastic pushes the piece forward, which in turn hits the projectile and makes it fire! it works fairly well, but i would have prefered it fired farther. entire set the skeleton charges at his adversaries! the knights prepare to counterattack! overall build: 10/10 the build is simple, easy and quick. set design: 7/10 the crossbow could have worked a bit better. playability: 8/10 the crossbow is fun to shoot. minifigs: 10/10 it doent get much better than this. i love that domed helmet mold! price: 8/10 the set is very affordable and worth the price. overall score:43/50 conclusion overall, this is a great set and a solid army builder. you get three minifigures for a fair price and the crossbow wagon adds some much-needed playability. i bought two of these to bolster my army and to stock up on those rare domed helmet pieces. basically, get this set! thank you for taking the time to read my review. i hope you liked it!
nice review, to start off. you got all the details someone could possibly need, in my opinion at least. i do enjoy this set as well, and i've bought only one to keep my minifigs as unique as possible. despite my personal preference, i still find this a nice army builder. good amount of minifigs for the price, as mentioned earlier, with each being different from the other. though i would like the catapult manager to be armed with at least something, i still feel that he can just flee if he's ever in trouble. he's a good guy to use for the castle gimmics if you have it. one more small comment. i also love those domed helmets, even if they aren't actually new. my favorite of them all, being followed up by the racer helmet.
millacol88, on sep 6 2008, 01:55 am, said: i've experienced that problem too. i find my knights outnumber my skellies about 3:1. a crownie dies easyer than a skeleton. it's so hard to perforate the lungs or pierce the heart on a skeleton with a spear or crossbow bolt, isn't it? a great set with a reasonable price. thanks for sharing it with us. added to the index.
this was my first set from the new line, so i'm rather partial to it. i'm glad to see it get such high praise. it's quite the lovely little halloween-y set. i wonder if thebrickster could modify this for his ww grave stone mocs? (hint, hint, hintedy, hint, hint. ) edited by pirates forever, 13 june 2009 - 02:02 am.
yaaaay! this set is outstanding! it was first set i have bought for pieces! seriously! if you like skellies its mustbuy for you!
this set is alright but it doesnt have that pizzaz feeling you know what i mean. i would prefered a knights carrage realy but the design is ok.
i voted outstanding, because i think this is the best cement mixer tlg ever made, also love the 6-stud wide based vehicles, as you mentioned. i both bought and sold it again this year, and i already regret it, but i had to sell some stuff because of a loss of space
i got this set last month and i can definitely say that even if you think it is one of the best sets ever, you won't fully appreciate it until you build it yourself. the elevated city station is much more complex than it looks, and the whole set is extremely detailed. the good: - as stated in the review, there's a lot of track, roughly twice as much as the last monorail made, 6991. 5 long straights too! - the designers didn't need to put in the hamburger stand or the ticket readers, but they did and made it even better - great figure selection; airport workers as well as civilians the bad (if you can call it that in such a great set): - hard to incorporate into an existing town if using the default track layout. the center loop would be inaccessible to vehicles and the layout is very large. - the monorail needs nearly a full straight section on either side of the city station or it will impact the corner of the station and stall if a curve is too close. - as far as i know the only town set with road plates that doesn't have a wheeled vehicle. a car would have been nice, a bus would have been incredible. but these small things in no way diminish from the fact that this is one of the best sets ever. edited by section8, 05 september 2008 - 01:17 pm.
this is an outstanding review which deserved to be featured here! after seeing this set, it prompts me to own this set, and match with my 10159 legend city airport. it's very nice to see such outstanding set being reviewed and presented to our very screens. everything about this set is simply outstanding. i can't imagine that such incredible set actually released before. why don't they ever continue with this anymore? sigh, it's nice to see so much detailed from its shuttle, snack bar, stairs, waiting platform, validating machine and etc. this is an instant "5" set! if given a chance to own a misb set, i will defintely seriously consider about it.
yes, this is one of the best town sets ever.
who was the one who rated it "above average"?
an aweome review of an outstanding set.
sets like this just don't come around too often do they... i didn't realize exactly how much detail really was in this set. tlc should bring back the monorail! great review of an amazing classic town set!
thanks for the in depth review of a set miles out of my price range! it was great to see more of this legend than the miniature square in my magazine... god bless, nathan
norro, on sep 6 2008, 09:34 am, said: thanks for the in depth review of a set miles out of my price range! i thought it was out of my price range too. then i realized that i had probably spent enough since coming out of my dark ages to buy a misb 6399. so i bought it, and i am going to cut back on buying other sets for the next year or so to offset the one big purchase. those glimpses of the 2009 sets haven't made me regret the cutback. edited by section8, 06 september 2008 - 09:07 pm.
very nice review indeed. b.t.w. a lot of children just love this set. one year we had it with us to legoworld and children asked a lot of questions about it.
*gasp* blasphemy! someone voted this set "below average". *brings out hunting rifle* ahem, back on topic; i remember wanting this set badly, for years. and i still want it, just no as much, because it's expensive and, as this review proves, takes up a lot of room. i've already got my trains to think about, and i won't be getting this set anytime soon. i also have a faint memory of this set being featured in one of lego's advertisements, more specifically someone narrowly missing it, hitches a ride, races the monorail to the airport and catches the plane. i am yet to find it on the net, as old lego adverts are hard to come by, especially the european ones. now, to more important matters... *starts hunting* edited by freddie, 07 september 2008 - 10:03 pm.
i know this is not the advertisement movie, but if you want to see the airport shuttle moving click here. freddie, on sep 7 2008, 11:02 pm, said: now, to more important matters... *starts hunting* now, to more important matters... *helps hunting*
what an amazing set and a truly wonderful review! thanks simonwillems for the work you spend on this.
good review, who voted this below average??? i own one and managed to pick it up off ebay a few years ago now with the track expansion pack for £150, in very good condition so glad i did, an all time classic
yeah its very nice along with all the older sets. i've got the cement mixer that was released around about the same time as this.
tenorikuma, on sep 7 2008, 08:30 am, said: it would be cool to see a review comparing this set with the newer orange garbage truck. true, woold be good for the people that have few new city sets like me, and your review is good btw! i own this set however, because it was really cool those days, nowadays all trucks nd cars can do neat things, but that wasnt so back then.
nice set, but nicer review! looks like the set has quite some nice parts.
a very robust set. the fact that it seats two figs plus has l&s makes it a unique set. i definitely liked the big airport subtheme tlg created in the early 1990s.
jopiek, on sep 8 2008, 12:24 am, said: thanks of course for the flattery but, do you then from your profession understand what the purpose is of the front 'spouts' that even can be hide, since that puzzles me. it can be that the lego designers thought it was a nice touch and didn't bothered about the realistic value of such a feature but i don't suppose that that is the case here. somehow, i had just noticed your reply. to be honest with you, the aes in my country does not have front spouts in their fire engine. i do not remember seeing this feature before. it is a possibility that this feature is included in some models or an imaginative addition from our lego designers. i will need to check this out. kimt, on sep 9 2008, 03:16 pm, said: perhaps the front sprouses are for foaming the runway? that is a logical answer.
i was going to get this, but instead i got someting else (firetruck i think) nice review!
this looks like a great set, i like the futuristic fire truck. that might be what i do with my imperial shuttle's glass cockpit.
cp5670, on sep 7 2008, 05:25 pm, said: nice classic set. are those hoses around the engine pneumatic tubes? that technic catalog looks interesting too. i have the catalogs for the next several years but not that one. the most extreme example of this was the engine step in the 8865 set, which uses over 120 pieces by itself. the pneumatic tubes are listed seperately under x188. the classic hose is x467. i think they're just the same with just a single difference: the x467 seemed to be already cut in lenght instead of x188 which must be cut in lenght. mfg widdi
a nice old classic, the driver has a nice hat and torso, and the train is well designed, except for that thing on the roof.
jopiek, on sep 8 2008, 12:20 am, said: the chair was just loose so it should be placed on the 2x2 plate that is also visible in the picture of the middle car. b.t.w. the front magnet is the old type. i have some decouplers but we don't use them because they are not really that reliable. lego just release a whole line of trains at the same time. i just discussed with my parents and they told be lego had those sets longer in store back then. i must have gotten the 7745 somewhere in 1983 or even 1984 although it was released in 1981. i started of with the 7710 (push along train) and then upgraded the tracks with current rails when i got the 7745. the 7745 was realsed in 1985 ;) lego had 2 12v passengers trains between 1981 and 1984 (the 7740 & 7725) during the 80s the avergae life of a train was about 5 years.

a great review for a great set. thanks for sharing it with us. a like the older lego trains. btw i think you need to fix this: quote name: jetport fire squad (light and sound series)
the best 12v legotrain is for me the 7740. the 7725 is still a goodlooking train and the only one with short wagons in a electric version. before i started to with bricklink, i started to build this train in blue. i've build 4 trains of it and sold 2 of them. still one for sale . you can also build this in other colors, like a yellow one: or you can build a black version, which i made a death train of it. driven by a skeleton . edited by panda9001100, 17 may 2009 - 08:01 am.
are you going to review the other 12v sets if you have the time?

beach cruisers set #: 6445 theme: island xtreme stunts year released: 2002 piece count: 97 minifigs: 2 list price: $7 (usd) during a trip to legoland california in 2002, their big store had a neat little display of some new sets and themes including island xtreme stunts. the new theme offered great colors including orange, tan, and light blue; which immediately caught my eye. the theme focussed on island fun with some adventure, and included some great figs like the brickster. i had to buy at least one set choosing truck & stunts trike (review coming soon) at the time. the theme was short lived and many of the sets were on sale at discount toy stores not too long after their initial release. i picked up this set, 6445 beach cruisers for $3.33 (usd), which will be my first of three island xtreme stunt reviews. starting with the box, a race between the street surfer and skate boarder: the back shows some alternate models including a sail boat and jet ski: same image on the instructions as the box: but the backside shows the island xtreme stunts video game for different platforms: the set includes a small decal sheet for the skateboard: i love the two figs included within this set. one is a "hippie-type" with shades and leafed muscle short, and the other "pizza boy" skateboarder. check out the "pizza boy" on his skateboard: two green brackets are included for attaching each fig to the long grey bar. using this piece, one can make the skateboarder do tricks and flips. the "street surfer" vehicle is pretty nice to: the sail is placed on a black bar and lance, then attached to the vehicle: here's a picture of the vehicle. to me, it has that old "soap box derby" look to it - like something kids would create to race down a hill: the vehicle doesn't have a steering wheel, but rather two levers which i think work well in the cockpit: here's the underside: the set has three neon orange wheels that attach to technic axle pins to attach to the vehicle: lastly, the entire set with a few extra pieces: final thoughts while island xtreme stunts is not the best city/town sub-theme, esp. for the traditional lego classic town fan, it does have some fun sets like this little beach cruiser. good figs, a skateboard, and a very "rollable" (fun word equivalent to "swooshable" but for vehicles with wheels), vehicle. you can even blow on the sail to get it to roll across the floor. this set is a lot of fun!
i had never seen these sets before in my retail stores before. however, i do remember the existence of its video games. look like an interesting set for great outdoor enterainment and fun for lego citizens whom is out for real thrill and excitement. this theme never really got me excited back then. after reading your review, it's quite useful for some new addition to your town features, such as including a skater boy, holding the pizza instead of using the pizza van. the high fuel cost must have caught up to them, to resort using skate board for delivery. as for the street surfer vehicle, it's a cool looking vehicle with unique construction. pardon me, i have not seen such design before. i will actually tear off the wheels, cover up the sides and used it for wind surfing! that's the whole idea. after giving some thoughts and weighs its factors, i will have to give it a "3" for this set. i will probably get it if its on sales. once again, brickster this is a lovely review which has showed us a new perspective of island xtreme stunts.
like whitefang i too only remember this line in computer game form. i used to love that game! i actually have never seen a review for an xtreme stunts set, so this was nice to see. as for the set, i think it looks pretty good. i really like the hippie guy. the windboard thing is nice as well, but looks a bit strange somehow. i give this set a solid 3 out of 5. thanks for the nice review! edited by erdbeereis1, 08 september 2008 - 04:05 am.
her name was sky lane. it's quite sad, though, to actually play the game--the "xtreme tower" is the only set that made it into the game itself, and it was a really watered down version of the information center from the first two games. but the island was, in the game, filled with incredible buildings that would have made really cool sets.
air chase woosh! the brickster's seaplane flies over the beach quickly. hippie dude is in close pursuit on his hang glider. fuel is running out for the brickster's plane. can hippie dude catch him before he either gets away or crash lands in the water... you decide, with island xtreme stunts air chase. set #: 6735 theme: island xtreme stunts year released: 2002 piece count: 83 minifigs: 2 list price: $10 (usd) a nice addition to the island xtreme stunts theme, air chase includes two air vehicles; a seaplane and hang glider. the set has nice island colors inclusing white, light blue, and orange. also includes in the set are some great chrome pieces for the brickster's airplane wings. starting with the box. you can see hippie dude in close pursuit: the back of the box depicts some nice alternate jet skis: same front box picture on the instructions: and on the backside, pictures of the video game: air chase includes two nicely detailed figs, hippie dude (for lack of his official name), and the brickster: here's a picture of the orange hang-glider: and the underside: unfortunately, the hang-glider is too heavy to be held up by a minigig. while i like the brick-built glider for the extra pieces, the plastic wing pieces from the ninja theme would have worked effectively and be a lot lighter. i think the seaplane is the best part of the set: here's a shot of the front end. i like the skeletal shark/fish design. what's great is none of the pieces use stickers. they are all printed: including the tail end: although the cockpit has no steering wheel or lever piece, it does have a very nice printed 1x2 tile: the wings of the airplane have hinges to allow them to fold inward slightly: also notice the nice chrome/silver pieces. here's a shot of the underside of the seaplane: and lastly, the complete set: final thoughts: air chase is another one of those "fun" island sets. two figs with two vehicles make a perfect combination for creating some dog-fights in the air. at the same time, the brickster's plane can land in the water to explore other adventure play opportunities. this set is also a nice addition to the island xtreme stunts truck & stunt trikes (6739). the seaplane can be hauled by the large semi-truck included within 6739. hope you enjoy this review.
hippie dude? thats snap lockitt, island xtreme is one of the best themes ever, im trying to get the sets off bricklink, thanks fo the review i need this now.
shoc, on sep 9 2008, 05:55 pm, said: thanks for the review! i loved this theme, it had some of the greatest pieces ever arranged in any theme, brilliant printed parts and figures, and some good colours. snap lockitt (hippie dude ) is a great figure with a cool name, i own him from another set, but unfortunately not this one. it looks like a very good set, no stickers and good printed parts too. nice review. hahaha. that made me laugh for some reason... i don't know why though, i agree with it. i have him as well, i got him from the orange jet-ski set.
one of my favourite sets! me and couple of buddies got this set back then. the fig was so cool, sun glasses, fast boat....
i love the classic sets of that era and a great review helps show off the simplicity of some older sets.
yeah, the name on this set is strange. i think all the boxes say garbage truck. i guess it's up to each builder to decide whether 1x1 round plates are recyclable material or not. it's a great model in any case. i love these highly detailed city trucks we've been getting during the last year or two. i used to have a preference for the late 80s/early 90s city line but some of these new sets have really surpassed them in detail and functionality.
nice review. this is a very nice vehicle, one of my favorite of the newer city ones. jopiek: there are two generations of road plate that are wide enough for six-wide vehicles like this. the current plates are dark grey with plain white printing, and look not great in my opinion. the previous ones are imo the best road plates of all time - green with dark grey road, white dotted line/zebras, drain covers and yellow verge markings (just like we really have here in ireland). for urban area i would still choose the green-edged plates and just cover up the green - the markings are so much better than the current plates.
trop beau
this looks like a great set, and i'm happy you were dumping spongebob, he deserves that. this set looks very nice, and if i see it i will probably pick it up.
that's a really nice mod badsneaker! the added bulk serves it well.
i like this set, but i can't give it a good grade for playability, as the rearmost hinging section is too stiffly hinged, so when you open it, it's likely to break if you hold it just over the shovel and broom. my truck thus has that function, and with it of course the whole container tipping, disabled. i also moved the cab a bit forward and the front axle rearward to give the cab the typical garbage truck look, as they are often very low slung. this also created space behind the cab for some equipment.
nice review i realy need to pick up this set! and the cement truck too
