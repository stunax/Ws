306 Lunar Landing Plates Year Released: 1979 Piece Count: 2 Minifigs: 0 List Price: unknown As part of the Classic Space Collection, Lego offered two sets of moon plates. One was a set of two crater plates, and the other, this very useful Landing Plate set. Not much to review, but worth sharing a few images: The landing plate: And T-Plate: The two plates connect to form this very nice Classic Space landing platform: Set 497, Galaxy Explorer included the landing platform, but the one that I had was lighter in color than the one contained in this set (at least the yellow circle). Future Lego space sets could benefit by having similar road plates. Share your thoughts.	neutral
These are pretty good, but I think they look too much like the standard town roads from that period. I like the black space plates from the early 90s better (6710).	negative

first, what i liked sooooo much was the cover of these plates, with this large picture of a classic space scene. I still have a '306' misb just to keep that nice feeling of taking it out of a plastic box, and look at it... there were different versions of the cover though. second, the markings of the landing platform changed at some point. i'd have to check it later when i'm at home, think it had something to do with the interupted yellow lines...	negative
WhiteFang, on Jul 7 2008, 11:42 PM, said: Actually, with only 2 plates, I could not do much serious expansion with it. Instead, I merged it with my old city baseplates, and used it as a docking station for scientific purposes or restricted facilities that is guarded by the police. You make a very good point there. I've used these plates to represent restricted areas, and even as simple airport runways, beyond their space uses. I never liked the black plates (they were during my dark ages anyway, so I've never really seen one up close), but I have seen them used in a Death Star display as suggested and it turned out fairly well.	neutral
Why pay $350 Dollars, just download the instructions on buy the pieces off Bricklink. This is was I did when I wanted to create the Blacktron II in the Futuron colour scheme. Also I tend to like both sets of base plates, I bought the black ones myself and they were of great use but there more for creating the idea of a city or space station, something more completely man made. The gray ones give a better look of the roads being laid over bare rock especially when you introduce the plates with the craters. I would love to see a 48*48 baseplate with roads through them which would allow more building space on the side and maybe some craters. Also 48*48 baseplates with craters but a few different kinds to create more or a realistic look and less of a repeating pattern. And with all those rocks you have to put everything up on supports, much better looking bases then.	negative
I also love these plates! I build a lot with them (e.g. this ). Unfortunately they are not available in bley ...	neutral
How about "These Policemen are unarmed?"	neutral

Thank you for the nice review, Sinner. Holodoc, on Aug 1 2008, 08:59 AM, said: Nice review Sinner! The old sets... I donÂ´t know - every old set, especially equipped with the old non-moveable arms minifigs look very odd nowadays. I agree with you with the hull shape and its possibility to be extended, but every other aspect, the lack of detail, the keel itself (you canÂ´t float it in shallow water) keeps me from rating it higher than 3/10. In my opninion the best police boat so far is 4021 *click to enlarge* Well, if you're meaning REALLY old sets, than I agree with you, but a lot of the sets from the very late 1970s and onwards are still very nice. This set just isn't a good example, that's all. OH, and I also agree with you about that police boat. However, the newer one in the CITY line is also great, IMO. The only thing that weighs against it is the giant size, which makes it feel awkward in more classic towns. Edited by Grevious, 03 August 2008 - 06:30 PM.	negative
As you may have seen in my topic in general LEGO discussion, I received a bunch of old LEGO from my step-grandmother-in-law. Among the bricks were instructions and pieces for an almost complete set 345 from 1969. I was very excited to find this out, so I put it together. I recently took it apart and re-assembled it, taking photographs along the way for the sake of Eurobricks. So, without further ado, set 345: House With Car. First off is the car. This was still constructed in the bucket of bricks I received, so I never took it apart: Next I'll show you the instructions. Lots of added bricks per step, which was fun. However, the angle of the instructions sometimes made it difficult to find where things were supposed to go. The in-build shots. Finally, an all-around view of the finished set. Sadly, I don't have much time to post more pictures or thoughts. However, I'll try to come back and update the review later this week. Until then, enjoy!	positive
Nice review, 'Mariko'! This set is way past my time. The baseplate is okay (though I hate those dots). The car is pretty cool too...	positive
Great review. I never had this set, but it looks nice. I really like the checker pattern near the big window.	positive
Way before my time, too--in fact, this set came out twenty years before I was born! The baseplate doesn't actually have dots--I'm not sure if they were there once, and then rubbed off (a possibility, as the studs are rather smoother than I imagine they once were), or if this particular one didn't have the dots. This set also shows that the difficulty LEGO has in doing vehicle scale isn't new. The house is the perfect size for microfigures from the LEGO Games; however, the car is massive--over twice as tall as a microfig!	neutral
Image Link from Brickset I thought I would do a pic review of the 1st Lego Castle, The Yellow Castle, #375- released in 1978. First, let me say that this set was truly "ahead of it's time". It introduced new building concepts (such as the hinge and new figs (most were still the armless, faceless mini-figs during this time). This set introduced me to Castle which was my first real favorite theme. I enjoyed breaking it out from the garage and building it again. The majority of the pieces are 1x1, 1x2, 1x3, 1x4, 1x6, and 1x8 standard yellow bricks. The set also includes yellow 1x4, 1x6x2, and 1x8x2 arches, yellow 2x2, 2x3, and 2x4 bricks, various grey plates, 1x2 black inverted slopes, red drawbridge pieces, two classic red castle doors, 8 hinges (2 for each corner), and a few other nifty pieces including six red 1x1 windows. A complete inventory is available at Peeron: 375 Inventory. A view from the front. The drawbridge is 6x8. The front tower stands 12 1/3 bricks high (plenty of room for horses). The drawbridge does work. The string (originally black) is attached to the opposite side between a plate and the arches. The right side of the castle (identical to the left). I've always loved the 2x2x3 sloped bricks (and corner pieces): The back. I love these red doors. A 1x4 brick attached to the other side of the baseplate keeps intruders out. That banner was the original sticker piece. Notice the wear. The rear tower, largest of the towers: And backside: Two hinges at each of the corners allow the corners to open for playability: Before opening: Open: Lots of arches add to the detail of the inner walls: Inner front: This set included 14 figs (how about that for quantity). Unfortunately, I peeled off worn stickers from the shields and the breast plates years ago. The blue castle guards and knights are the keepers of the castle. I still think that these helmets are the best Lego ever made. They just look good. The black and white knights: And the red knights: I've always prefered to use the black and red guards and flags from the knight's joust set(s): Conclusion The Yellow Castle is truly a classic set and I'm so glad I kept the pieces to this together after all these years. If you have a chance to buy one or even obtain the set instructions, it's worth building and wouldn't be difficult to substitute grey or other colors. I hope you enjoyed this review and feel free to share your comments.	positive
There's two alternates on the back of the instructions and as I recall, some sort of bridge on the inner fold or back of box. I threw away the box to this set years ago- just lucky to still have all the pieces. With standard pieces, you can build all these alternates and many more. That's why I don't particularly care for the new castles (like Vladek's). They make building so difficult and duplicate pieces are so limited. Here's an old shot of the castle in the city that it use to guard. We played for hours back in these days,	neutral
Great review. It is nice to see an in-depth photo review of this set. I especially love the last picture of your old city! It certainly does bring back memories...	positive
Quote i'm also impressed by the colors of the shields! even a good cleaning wouldn't do that with my old shields... have you ever tried replacing the heads by modern heads, just to see how that would look? Remember NEVER TRY TO CLEAN STICKERS! :'( KimT	neutral

They do need to be re-sized. In US, I converted them to .59 inch width. You could do the same in cm by converting to 1.5 cm wide. I did the same with the torso stickers - same ratio. I ended up with a PowerPoint sheet of multiple shields and torso designs. Printed on sticker pages from a good quality photo-printer gives you very nice stickers. The hard part is cutting them. The results are the four knights pictured above. The web site also has Forestmen and custom torso and shield designs that are very nice.	neutral
Here's a shot of a custom forestman. These really work well: I'm using just regular sticker paper. How do you stick transparent plastic on top?	neutral
Quote so you're using two layers (stickers) doesn't that make it very thick? Not really. I think it works out very fine. 1. Print out the image. 2. Put on the Plastic. 3. Cut out the image. 4. Apply on the part.	neutral

Now this doesn't mean you can never revive an old thread, but just do it when there's a reason :-) Yes, I believe it is the oldest.	neutral
Great review! The set is really nice, I love that the front of the motercycle can turn and the engine is just beautiful, with its half stacked bricks like KielDaMan said. The price used or new is quite a bit, but there is a good variety of bricks here like the bricks inside the wheels. Did you get this set from your father? Great review LuxorV!	positive
Thanks for the feedback guys! Indeed this is a great set, and I'm very attached to it. As far as I remember, I got it for say my 2nd birthday, I think But it is not my first LEGO set. You'll learn more on this in my next planned review	positive
Great review for a classic model. I love it.	positive
Rare classic sets are always a priceless part of any LEGO collection, and it's a good thing you still have this first set of yours Luxor (or did you purchase a new one?). Excellent review BTW, it's always a pleasure getting a closer look at these classic sets which I wouldn't have known to exist had I not seen this review. Overall I think it's a really good set at that time, of course judging this one by modern standards won't be fair but at the time I'm pretty sure it was a 'cool' set to have (though less cooler than having the Harley Davidson set).	positive
Thanks, Luxor, for bringing us this excellent tour round an old classic! For its time, this is truly a remarkably detailed and beautiful set, and I think it's amazing how it's still in such good condition after all this time. Do you have any more from this era (excepting the Harley, of course )? I've created a whole new index to put them in	positive
INDEXED 410 â€“ Payloader Theme: Legoland/Vehicle Piece Count: 28 Year Released: 1973 MSRP: ??? Links: Brickset, Lugnet, Peeron, Bricklink *Note: This set was released under the number 604 outside of the U.S.* Ah, classic Legoland. A time before mini-figs ever existed, and cars and buildings could be made with just a few bricks. The part selection was pretty basic: bricks, plates, slopes, windows and wheels were all you needed to construct an entire town. Heavy machinery could be modeled in 4-wide and be just a few bricks tall. For this review we will be taking a look at the 410 Payloader, one of LEGOâ€™s first sets of a bucket loader. So grab a hard hat, we are heading to the construction yard! Box image courtesy of Bricklink. Box Contents Here we have our instructions which are obviously the older style of LEGO instructions. The steps used much simpler imagery, but they get the job done. They show how to build the Payloader in seven steps. This small set has all of 28 parts in it. The more interesting parts of note are the red digger arm, the bucket, the blue 1X2 brick with arm holes, and the blue 2X2 brick with the classic LEGO logo printed on it. Construction In the first few steps we start building up the base. Then add the arms and start building the cab. Add the bucket, the trailer socket and finish the cab. Throw on some wheels. Completed Set And with that we are finished with our nice small model. Here is the back right side. Notice how the back of the cab was left with an empty spot. Here is the left side. Notice how on the top of the arm they made it so you could just push down on the tips it to make the arm lift instead of having to grab by the arm itself. On the front we have the nice LEGO logo shown to remind the forgetful of what they were playing with. You can also see how much space is in the bucket itself, which can't hold more than a few small plates. Finally on the back we have the trailer socket. This was a nice addition to make it able to tow trailers from other sets like 685. Just donâ€™t try to bring it into your layout populated by mini-figs, they may have a problem trying to get in. Other Thoughts Considering this set is nearly 37 years old, I myself am still surprised by how well the bricks have held up. I purchased this set from a thrift store a year ago for a mere 25 cents. Normally when used LEGO is purchased you can expect to see scratches, marks, wearing, discoloration, etc but boy was I surprised to see how all these parts are in mint condition. Even the instructions still looked like they came from a new box and not all ripped up and tattered. The pieces still connect to each other nice and tight and the metal pieces for the wheels haven't rusted. This just shows that with proper care these things can last a lifetime. I really would like to get a small display case to show it off. Conclusion Playability: 8/10 In addition to the standard of having rolling wheels, you also get a fully movable bucket assembly. With it you can pick up smaller pieces and unload them into a dump truck. Design: 7/10 Like all other Legoland vehicles it has a very basic design, but you can still easily identify what it is. Simple yet effective. Parts: 7/10 Like most other older LEGO sets, all you really get are a few basic bricks and plates. However, you do get a bucket assembly and the 2X2 brick with the classic LEGO logo on it is very cool. It was also nice of LEGO to include the trailer socket so you could tow around your trailers. Price: 8/10 Bricklink's history shows them to sell for around $10 USD used. While that is a bit much for a set this size, it is pretty good considering this set is over 37 years old. However, if you are looking for a new boxed set be prepared to fork over about $50 USD. Overall: 8/10 This small machine would make a nice addition to your collection as a reminder of LEGO's past. So what are your thoughts on this classic set? Edited by TheBrickster, 01 June 2010 - 05:55 AM.	positive
Thank you very much for this wonderful review! This is the oldest Lego set in my collection. I received this model from my grand parents many years ago - I'm not exactly sure who in my family it used to belong to, but it has a home with me now. It's a very simple but attractive looking vehicle, and functions pretty well too. Overall, very nice.	positive

Well, it's not exactly a large shuttle, but still a nice set: 442 Space Shuttle Year Released: 1979 Piece Count: 79 Minifigs: 1 Vehicles: 0 List Price: unknown This little classic was my smallest classic space set. Believe it or not, I still have the box: Here's the back: The instructions are pretty tattered and missing a section. I had to download some from the web: But the ship is again intact, missing only one grey 1x3 plate: I've always liked this computer piece: Here's the under side. This set included the small classic jet engines: A close-up of the sloped printed space brick: And the complete set with minifig: This set was a great little space ship that made a nice addition to the Blue Space Theme. As small as it was, it could hold two-three figs (one standing up). I don't even think the Mars Mission Recon Drop Ship holds three figs. In any case, it was a must-have for Blue Space Fans, and probably only a few bucks back in the day. SWOOSH!	neutral
This classic space shuttle is simply superb! I love the layout of this shuttle. In fact, it reminded me as one of the space fighter jet, that roam around in space, defending the boundaries from intruders. I just love these old grey bricks very much and the printed computer brick is just lovely. It's such a pity, that I did not grow up with Classic Space in my childhood. These are actually great stuff, and formed the base of the Space theme in LEGO. Brickster, thanks again for another outstanding classic review.	positive
The computer is my favorite part. Sadly, I dont own any classic space...Exept for some space police, and a blue classic space man.	positive
Great job! I love reading vintage reviews, as it reminds of our childhood days. Glad to see this in very good condition. By the way, I will move this to LEGO Trains & Town, to see if TheBrickster will like to include this set inside the review index over there. I believe he is maintaining vintage town set reviews over there, and this suits there well.	positive

Here is the Spirit of St Louis. Just go there (Washington) and have a look of this legend : Cavannus, on Jul 15 2009, 09:40 PM, said: In 1977, trans or yellow slopes existed already, and using them would have made the plane more realistic. I don't think so. There is no 45Â° slope in the original plane design ... and no front cockpit window. Quote A third rear wheel would have enhanced playability and design, rather than this ugly black round brick. Except that it wouldn't have been the Spirit Of St Louis. This set is a great one and I wish I'd bought it in '77. It is the Spirit of the 70ties ...	positive
I really like the design, it has an aesthetic value lacking from most official Lego planes and follows closely to the real thing (minus the colours), something that can't really be claimed for more recent sets.	positive
483 Alpha-1 Rocket Base Year Released: 1979 Piece Count: 170 Minifigs: 3 Vehicles: 1 (two sections) List Price: unknown Despite the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty of 1968, Lego dared design a Rocket Base complete with a rocket system that may have had nuclear capability in 1979. Luckily, the rocket was defective having rather flimsy white bricks that did not stay together well during launch attempts. Lego scrapped its WMD program and the result was this classic "blue era" space set known as the Alpha-1 Rocket Base. Instructions: On the backside of the instructions, the set is featured with the Space Command Center, Space Cruiser, and a few vehicle sets: The set includes three figs: And this great rocket fuel tanker: Here's the front section complete with computer: And the rocket fuel section: The set has some interesting features including the Control Section, Fuel Control, and Launch Pad: On top of the Control Section is a nicely design radar/tracking system: Here's the open control room: The Launch Pad and Fuel Control: The Fuel Control includes two sink pieces and blue steering wheels: And Lego's WMD (Weapon of Mass Destruction), the Alpha-1 on the Launch Pad: Here's a shot of the launching mechanism: Unfortunately, I have lost one of the blue sink/faucet pieces as well as a black hose: A close-up of the Alpha-1 Rocket. The white bricks never stayed together well often times coming apart within your hands: The arming and guidance system was nicely designed: A view of the complete set: And another: This is a great set. The base, fuel vehicle, and launch platform offers a great amount of playability. My only complaint is the rocket (as mentioned above). I don't think I ever played with it a sa kid because it always fell apart. Share your comments regarding this Classic Space set.	positive
Ahh, the good old days. Thanks for the review.	positive
Nice rewiew The set is good too)	positive
Thanks for the review, my favourite detail is the salad! :-D BTW, could you exchange the modules and make pics of that? I'd like to see how the building looks with the flat roof instead of the dutch style one. I'm not sure though if the vents on the flat roof makes sense as long as it's only used as a garage top... :-/ Maybe they should be removable as the balconies and such things to make the modularity leading not to weird results... Other than this: In combination with a lot of money and the Cafe Corner set this really could get me into city! ;-)	positive
Thanks, I love the look of this set! I love the mix of colours, it breaks up the model rather than being a single monotone colour. He's used several complimentary colours in order to make up the model. I agree I think the chimneys on the flat roof is weird ontop of the garage, but not so weird one you place it ontop of the building. I guess he's done it to give us the choice of roofs and chimneys. You can always remove the ones you don't like... He also seems to have screwed up a bit on the tiling for the sidewalk on the side module. On Cafe Corner (And the building module of this set) the sidewalk has the pattern light grey 1x6 at the front, then dark grey 1x2 next, then dark grey 2x2's. However on this he's put the 2x2 tiles first then the 1x2's at the back. Easilly fixable though. Overall I love this set, thanks for the pics! Compliments Cafe Corner perfectly.	positive
Hi Thanks for posting those great pictures. I got the CC some time ago and I really looking forward to get my hands on the Market Street. I think the colour scheme of this set is great, maybe because blue is my favourite colour (just check my wardrobe)? I really like the design of the roof and the staircase. I ?am not so sure if I like the gateways but I believe they will grow on me when I get the set myself snefroe1, on Jun 20 2007, 09:02 AM, said: 5) the white lamp and the the yellow cylinder are at the same level of the tiles. IMO it should be above the level of the tiles... I? am totally agree with snefreo1, the yellow cylinder and the lamppost should be on a level above the tiles. Actually I have put a 2x2 plat under the lamppost on my CC, looks much better if you ask me. Unfortunately Shop at Home does not send to Norway???, so I have to purchase this set in Billund (Yes, I ?am going to Legoland this summer) or on ebay.	positive
I'm not much of a city fan but this looks great. I guess this is the closest we can get to Legoland (miniland) quality sets. And considering this is a three floro, small structure, and it's over 1,000 parts, just imagine (pun not intended) how many peices are in LL California's Empire State Building or WTC Freedom Tower models! Both are large and in real scale over 100 floors! That's a lot of bricks. Anyways, I've got a friend who loves city. I'm sure this one would make a great addition to his town setup! Gotta tell him about this new set! *y*	positive

Thanks for this review, and that great little comic! About the skellies though (X-D), you have to admit that besides their long arms making the skellie legs look out of proportion, that they're just made poorly. They're sticking straight out, as opposed to every other fig, which have a slight bend to make them look more natural. Also, as I'm sure you've noticed, the pegs are on angles! That makes it impossible for them to hold their weapons straight, and they can't even put their arms over their heads without stressing the plastic some... I mean they're DEAD. Well, at least undead, they're not supposed to be stiff, and personally I like the ragdoll look more, it makes them seem more dead :-P	negative
A very nice review with good pictures, thanks Grevious. *y* And undead ragdolls on! :-P	positive
WOW! That was both an entertaining time, and a learning experience! It was entertaining because the comic made me laugh! It was a learning experience because, well, I dunno. Just wanted to say it. Anyways, great review, Grievous! Edited by trooperdavinfelth, 01 July 2007 - 09:46 PM.	positive
Excellent photographs! and I like the comic too. I don't care what anyone says, I love the new skeletons. *skull*	positive
Nice review, and great little story. :-D *y* Look at the normal horses, their legs are positioned like that too. Only the skellie horse's legs are touching, so as to strengthen the middle, otherwise it could easily snap in half. Also, I think the new skeletons are nice, their head is awesome, I just don't see why TLC couldn't make the bent droid arms with the hand facing vertically, instead of making a new arm design completely straight.	positive
Nice review and a great story also grevious, this is a great set and a nice little army builder one at that. The only thing that saddens me about the line itself is the new arms on the skelies, they just look far to big when placed next to a normal fig. For me the old versions of the skelies were far better, why tlc changed to this is beyond me. Still i shall be buying alot of these sets just to increase my army.	positive
Thanks for all the comments, guys, and thank you, JoeM16 and iamded for pointing out the reason for the skeleton horse leg positioning. ;-) Well, I'll be gone on vacation until the 16, but I may pick up a set or two while down in Tenessee, so if I do, expect a review and another story when I get back! ;-)	neutral
Amazing little set. It seems this year that there are no crappy Castle sets. Good review.	positive
I've searched high and low accross England to find this...and it's nowhere! I'm too stingy to buy off S@H and so I'll wait my turn. OK, now ot the set: Let's say I buy 3, for ?12. That's 6 soldiers, 3 skellies and 3 horses. Considering each fig is worth ?1 and horses 75p, that means 25p for the catapult! Awesome! There's no Lego Castle anywhere in England! :-/	neutral
I have not seen any either.... :-/	neutral
That was a great review!!! very entertaining! :-D love the comics!	positive
Thanks for your review Ickelpete! *y* Nice little movie you made (what?s on tv in the background?) ;-) :-D After reading, I wonder more than before what this Dino has to do with Creator? *wacko* The complete mechanism is technic, only the "design"-pieces on top are classic-style. I agree with your comment on the colour-selection. :-X Is that turquise next to lime? Looks like - well, I?m not telling you what I think of right now... ;-) Pretty Lego set, but not for me. I?m waiting for the first pics of the ferris wheel. Or even better, the 8275 Technic-Bulldozer :'-) *wub* New motors On!	positive
Thanks very much for that review. I downloaded the instructions last week and I was largely impressed with what was in it. However, like Holodoc, I am waiting for the Bulldozer. I might have to settle with the dino though if Lego charge Australian some absurd price... EDIT: I just watched the videos. Thanks! They are great. The dino is better than I thought...

Ugly. As. Hell. But an awesome parts pack, worthy of purchase.	neutral
:'-) Such a beauty, the functions are great, cool video! I want to get this set so badly... Great review! *y*	positive
The box is has really strange dimensions - it's very flat but has a large front - the 1:1 scale. Regarding the spines, because they're made of the softer non-ABS plastic (the stuff the 1994 cutlasses and brown muskets were made of), they lose their shape a bit and so are hard to grip; they simply fall off. I suppose TLC use loads of different colours because a single or two-colour dino isn't very nice to look at, especially when the surface isn't very smooth - it takes your eyes away from the surface and puts it on the colours. Someone should make an all terrain dino that can walk everywhere from this set - I don't have the skill with technic - I always end up layering and never finish any models. :-(	negative
Thanks for the nice review. It's butt ugly to me but the motors + IR control seem pretty neat ! Even at that high price, it looks like a good parts pack ! *sweet*	positive
great review *sweet* maybe i will buy this one... but not this month... buying lego in billund has left me totally broke :-X :-$	positive
i like the dropship kit and got this. Now that I built it I see so many things I can do to tweak it to make it a MOC. I think this is a set everyone MM fan should get.	positive
The dropships looks neat, and your review is good. It isn't my theme, but it clearly is a fantastic set for the space lovers under us. Mars Mission is really a good step in the right direction for TLC.	positive

Seems like we shared the same thoughts on a majority of it. I always think it is good to have multiple opinions on sets as it gives the community more data points to evaluate a given set.	positive

In case you don't know, the AT-AT in the Dark Side Development Kit had a single motor and a moving head. It worked by the head simply swinging from side to side due to balence shifts. I suspect the AT-AT will be same. I also think that there will be no remote for it either. Edited by Sinner, 14 July 2007 - 11:31 AM.	positive
Oh, is he ugly or what? I've never seen a dino that needed to go on a diet more then him. :-D But I'd get him for the pieces; all those lime-green pieces. *drools* But, meh, I'm not really in to Mindstorms, so I don't think I'd get this.

PaulC, on Nov 4 2007, 02:21 PM, said: I kind of like the design of this, but more importantly I really want to get my hands on the power functions motors and IR control system. I'd prefer the 8275 Technic Bulldozer, but there's no way I can stretch to the ?100 price tag, so I was thinking I would have to see if I could get a 4958 Monster Dino cheap in the January sales. If you really want the power functions the Bulldozer is better value as you get two large motors, two small motors and two receivers compared to the one in the Dino set alos watch Toysrus and argos both have had the Bulldozer for ?70-75 in there pre christmas sales usually for a week only I am hopeing they will be on sale soon as I want a Second Bulldozer to get some more motors.	neutral
This is both my first set review and post about a Star Wars set- (even though I have been collecting them since '99). I got this one early this year so I thought I would post a review on it. Please bare with me- I am not a great photographer. So with that in mind, here goes!

I like the two AT-DP Pilots and Agent Kallus is a well done minifig. I can complain about another storm trooper either Parts- 3/5- Other than the dome pieces I commented on before, there is really not any new parts in this. If you build space, star wars, or machinery, this will still be a welcome assortment. Experience of Build 4/5- This really was a fun build. It came together fast but was challenging enough for its target age group. Playability 5/5- This thing is much more sturdy than it looks. The legs take a little bit of effort due to the double locking hinges but hold together very well.This is a very minor complaint. Value 4/5- Typical- $49.99 for 500 pieces- I must admit I paid a little more than MSRP due to shipping but I can't complain about the value. Overall: 21/25- I really believe this is one of the best walkers that Lego has designed. The only changes I would make would be adding real control panels in the cockpit and it would be nice if lego made a real widow to fit in with these types of builds rather than a transparent tile over another plate. All in all, I would recommend this set and I hope the rest of the 2015 Star Wars sets are on par with this.	positive
Looks really nice. One complaint is the back it is a pitty that Lego didn't use any plates greebling there.	negative
Great review! Thanks for doing it. I'm a big fan of this set, the minifigures are good, as is the parts selection. I like the piece used in the cockpit to secure the minifigure in place. I would've liked to see some panels in the cockpit though rather than translucent red pieces, that said however they are useful pieces.	positive
Thanks for the review. Cannot wait for the 2015 sets.	positive
Whats behind the printed 4x4 dome? Is that 2x4 yellow plate? Im planning to replace that.	neutral
Great first review! As a huge walker fan its great to get one thats not a redesign, or one of those tiny battlepack vechicles.	positive
The legs are about 2" shorter than the AT-AT; its cockpit is a little larger than the AT-AT's "head;" it doesn't look out of place as an escort-type walker or heavy walker, especially as both are built in the same style, although if scale differences really bother you the most recent AT-ST is probably a better bet for you.

hi, i need some help...when i atach the pod to the place where the legs are placed, the small piece that unites the pod to the legs is loos from the bottom, so the top of the walker just moves around freely, wich is different from every video review that i have seen (where they can rotate the pod but its not loose) the small piece that serves as the axis isnt staying locked on the bottom piece and i have reassembled it all and still its the same :\ help! edit: sorry, i found out what went wrong...didnt push hard enough :D Edited by mrpinache, 05 July 2015 - 12:10 AM.	neutral

Firstly, Great Review ++++++ I was really on the fence on this one. This review has greatly changed my view on this modular. A definite buy for me. Love the interiors and the whole concept. The more i see it the more i see the little features which put this set apart or at least slightly different from the others. Of course great playability for the younger lot and i think a nice building to give any Lego City more character and colour...	positive
Looking forward to picking up this set on Saturday :-) Nice review, love the tiny details and the printed parts.	positive

Thank you for the amazing and really well-readable review! Makes me want to get the set even more!	positive
Thanks very much. I love it *wub* . It needs tweaking, but isn't that half the fun? Incidentally, when people were calling it Rhino, I thought it was just a reference to Captain Scarlet. Seeing the stickers in the middle made me realise my mistake. Buy! Buy! Buy!	positive
Thanks dude. This is a great set. Can you please take more pictures? Thanks	positive
seems like they infuse system sets with more technic bars. must be that technic isn't selling too well and they want to educate ppl how cool technic can be. :-P it's quite apparent when even the small bike needed technic frame.	neutral

Thanks for that very interesting review, snefroe1. *y* That vehicle looks really nice, with a lot of playability, but too much Technic brick construction for my liking. It seems like there?s pretty much space wasted inside of it, some kind of small laboratory or a room for the crew and at least a mining toolshed would?ve been cool.	neutral

The Life on Mars theme was so much better, with the aliens dominating Mars instead of the humans. And the aliens were so much better, with their own names etc. Good times. Anyway, I think this is the best set in the series. It looks so neat and reminds me of the Pelican form Halo. X-D Edited by iamded, 31 August 2007 - 05:11 AM.	positive
I think the Life on Mars series was great. Although I didn't click until the line was gone that the red hangar on the alien base was for the red mech, and same with the blue one. Man, I was gutted when I realised that, I want those mechs! However, the base was great, with the small mech and the flying crafts. Could the LoM mechs have been the spark of life for Exo-force? 8-?

Lego 41062 Elsa's Sparkling Ice Castle Lego managed to get a Frozen licensed set in the new wave of Disney Princess sets. However, I'm VERY surprised by the size. It's a $40 set and comes in a small Friends-style box (roughly 12"x12" size) - I almost didn't see it on the shelf when I was looking for it because it's so small. I mean, I know it's only $40 but it's a friggin' CASTLE. And why did Lego only make this a smaller set? If they'd made a $200 Frozen castle they still would have sold every one they could produce. They made big Harry Potter Hogwarts sets and those sure sold. And have you SEEN the toys in the Frozen section of stores? HUGE playsets for Barbie-sized dolls. But I suppose I'm getting the cart before the horse here, reviewing before I've even opened the box. So..... Name: Elsa's Sparkling Ice Castle Set Number: 41062 Pieces: 292 Price: $39.99 Minifigs: 3 Theme: Disney Princess Year of Release: 2015 Links: Bricklink Peeron Brickset The Box The front of the box is standard Lego fare, other than the large Anna and Elsa in the bottom right corner. Oh, and surprisingly, nowhere on the box is the normal minifig lineup. The only way to know what characters are included is to look at the set pictures. The 1:1 This set uses one of the minidolls as the actual size sample. That's probably not a bad choice since the minidolls are not nearly as well known as a minifig. The Back On the back, the play features are shown in insets around a rear view of the castle. Like Friends sets, you also have an array of play accessories. The Seals Is this standard on 2015 sets or is this specific to this set? I've never seen 3 tape seals on a set. Even huge modulars or Technic sets only have 2, so 3 on a set this small seems excessive. Perhaps Lego expects people to try to steal the dolls? If so, why bother with extra tape? A tiny pocketknife makes quick work of the tape so the third strip doesn't even slow you down. The Contents In the box are 2 instruction booklets (bent), a white plate, a sticker sheet, and 3 numbered bags of parts. The Stickers These are very hard to photograph since they're shiny. I mean polished chrome shiny. Those dark lines across the corners are not really there, they're reflections of my ceiling. The Manual Backs The back of one booklet has a Friends "Win!" girl. The other has an ad for the Lego Disney Princess website. That site is SO girly there's even sparkles following your mouse cursor around. So I didn't stay too long or look too deeply. The Sample Page The interior pages of the manuals are on lavender backgrounds. It's standard Lego instructions with part callouts and insets when needed. The Build, 1 The first thing you build is Anna, but I'm not showing that yet. Then you build this little picnic scene. It's tiny but effective, and nice to have something not icy in the set since the movie has the "In Summer" song for Olaf. I'm curious what's in that sandwich though - green and pink? After the picnic is the Olaf build, but I'll save him for later too. The Build, 2 Next is this small sleigh. It has an amazing amount of style for something so small. The curved front and decorative whips on the back make it look sleigh-like instead of blocky. But come on, it already had pink accents, are the pink flowers really necessary? Technically, yes, so the whips can mount to them, but still, it's just over-girly for my taste. The Build, 3 The sleigh needs a ramp to help it rocket along (for a couple inches, at least). The ramp starts like this, with a hidden lime green jumper plate that gets a cookie on it. I couldn't remember anything in the movie like that, so I asked my wife and she couldn't either. A hidden cookie under a hill? The Build, 4 After putting the tilting 2x8 onto the base and adding decorations, this is the result. A lime green bucket holding a pair of ice skates, a flower (in the snow, really?), green and white round studs that I assume are supposed to be grass and snow? The Build, 5 The sleigh looks huge sitting on top of the tiny hill, but it actually works pretty well. Assuming you're on a smooth surface like a table, you can give the sleigh a little nudge and it'll shoot down the ramp and a few inches across the table. The unevenness of the slopes vs the blue tiles holds the sleigh in line well, and the bumps in the slopes don't seem to hamper anything. The Build, 6 Moving on to bag 2.... man that's a lot of colors in this base already. And I'm already starting to feel like there's trans-blue cheese thrown around randomly. The Build, 7 Continuing (and rotating), some steps and even more colors thrown in. Magenta? In Elsa's ice palace? I sure don't remember any of that... The Build, 8 Wait, seriously? An ice cream stand in the castle? That is what the magenta is for? I kinda actually like the looks of it, but it doesn't fit the set. The Build, 9 Spinning back around, now there's a light aqua spiral staircase added along with a roof. This is where I'm really starting to wonder about Lego's thinking. Those light aqua stairs, and the light aqua 1x4 tiles, are exclusive to this set (as far as I know... it's possible some other 2015 sets use them, but nothing in Bricklink yet). Seems expensive (to produce) to me, when there's no huge reason to need them. Another blue for the tiles would have been fine. And the spiral stairs? Really? Elsa's castle is KNOWN for staircases, but NOT spiral ones! There should be a huge straight ice stairway out front or sweeping curved stairs inside, but not a spiral. The Build, 10 And now we finish the tree. Again, why? Where is there a tree next to Elsa's castle? And so weird... with ice hanging from green branches that have both snow and flowers on them. Huh? Did Lego watch a different movie? The Trans-Light Blue Bits Before looking at the upper level, a brief pause to look at some other parts. Here's the 1x2x5 brick in trans-light blue and the 2x4x6 rock panel in glitter trans-light blue. Do those look like the same blue to you? And again, ANOTHER unique part for this set. Why do those rock panels need to be glitter, when Lego made the same panel in trans light blue in 2013 and 2014 for SuperHeroes, Friends, and Chima sets? Apparently Disney REALLY wanted glitter, because there are a bunch of trans-glitter parts in the new Princess sets. There's trans-neon green cones for Jasmine; Ariel, Jasmine, and Sleeping Beauty all get glitter trans purple cones. So there's a bunch of new glitter parts for 2015. The Build, 11 Back to building - time to add the upper level. We get a bedroom with a decent bed, although stickered. The Build, 12 The other side of the bedroom has some little accessories. Perfume and a crown I assume? The Build, 13 Time for walls and a roof. I like the small white macaroni bricks for a wall, but what's with the lavender fence piece in the center? I'll grant that it looks nice (a common white fence would have been a little boring), but it's ANOTHER unique piece to this set. The Build, 14 The very top of the castle is built separately. Not a whole lot to say here other than why is there a torch in an ICE CASTLE? The Finished Castle Once the roof is put on, the castle is done. And that big purple star on top says everything to me about the styling. It just doesn't look like modern Lego to me; it looks like this should be an old Belville fairy tale set from around 1999. If I saw a photo of just the castle with no figs (or picnic blanket), I'd assume that's what it was. The Oops, Not Actually Done Yet Accessories At the end, there's a few bits left to add. There are these dark purple skis (yup, another unique part) in the lower level. Let me tell you, they're a pain to get into that location, at least with my big man hands. More Accessories The top level gets a stickered book. The sticker has a nice castle image on it that is, while not quite exactly the castle from Disney World, VERY Disney-looking. I actually had to google and see if that's the castle they use in their logo. Nope, but it's the same style. The Leftovers There are a LOT of extra parts in this. That's almost 10% of the part count in the set right there! They are pretty useful overall though. It's great to have an extra "carrot" and brown "branch" for Olaf, since you know those will get lost as he's played with. The Figs Finally, the reason for the set. Let's face it, the castle set is just an excuse to make these figures. And they're GREAT. I mean just fantastic. The print on them is just such a good match to the real characters. Compare to the cartoon version from the front of the box. Elsa's hair is a little darker than the cartoon, but overall these are just dead on. If I had to pick out a flaw, it's the "spell" Elsa is holding. It's too bad she can only shoot it forward with her arm down like that. It'd be nice to have the end of the splash part bent 90 degrees so she can have her arm forward and the spell shooting forward too. Oh, one other thing. The minidoll heads don't press down tight to the body like minifig heads do. There's still exposed neck. It looks nice, but it means Elsa's cape can swing around. The Fig Backs Elsa's cape is glittery on the back and you can see the removable bow in her hair. The Full Set One final issue. When you put Anna on the sleigh, her cape doesn't have enough flexibility (since it's a wraparound kind) and so it folds out funny. That's why on the back of the box it shows her standing on the back of the sleigh with Elsa in the seat. Edit: How on earth did I forget to comment on those orange flowers to each side of the castle? I'm pretty sure Elsa did NOT have any flowers blooming outside her castle! The Conclusion Hm. I really wanted to like this set, but I just can't quite bring myself to. It feels like Lego pulled a random castle design from the files then redid it into white and trans blue to look icy and allow a Frozen tie in set. The figs are great, but the castle isn't. I guess the real castle in the movie would be a boring set and this one has play features, but it just is too different for my taste. The Ratings Value: 7/10 - $40 for less than 300 parts is high (especially when so many of the parts are tiny, but on the other hand there's a LOT of rock panels and 1x2x5 trans blue panels), but the figs help save it. Design: 4/10 - Not one of Lego's best. Not as bad as the lows in the 90s, but not a great set. Minifigs: 10/10 - Possibly even a 12/10. They ARE the reason to buy the set . Playability: 8/10 - There are a bunch of play features, but they actually detract from the design, so I had to knock off a couple points. Parts: 7/10 - A bunch of impractical unique parts (how often do you need dark purple skis or a lavender fence piece?) but also a bunch of nice parts if you wanted to make your own icy scene. Overall: 7/10 - A great bunch of figs, but I'd recommend not bothering with the manuals. Just use the parts to build your own castle that's better.	neutral
Isn't getting parts in new colors a good thing? It is a shame there is only this one set, I think TLG could make a whole subtheme out of Frozen. I do agree that they overuse lavender and magenta, I don't see why every girl set has to have these sort of colors instead of what would be accurate to the source material .	negative
Thanks for the review mostlytechnic. I too wish they had done a real castle for this set, it certainly deserved it. My sons and I figure they could have used the old rock monster mold from Rock Raiders in white for the missing snow beast. I will pick it up though for the figs and unique pieces.	positive
I'm literally of the exact opposite opinion to OP here. I love the structure and the parts (this is a fantastic little parts pack that I'll be snagging more of when I find it again)...but I've no use for the figures (not a big Disney Princess fan). It's all about the parts. This set is freaking amazing! :D	positive
There is a very simple reason for the flowers and green-leaved trees; you should remember from the movie it was actually summer when Elsa set of the eternal winter… The orange flowers do bother me, from a design point of view; I would have liked it better if they were a pink/purple/blue/white color. Same goes for the leafy bits; they could have used the pink/purple ones they are gonna use in the Elves sets. It would have been fantastic if they had given us WHITE leafy bits (like snow covered branches)! I'm sure loads of us could use those in our MOCs!

That was a great review with loads of excellent pictures. The set is better than I thought. I want to buy one of the new sets as I would love a blue Batman, but they are so expensive for Australians.

What about the cartoon??? Batman: The Animated Series will always be the definitive Batman to me. The two Tim Burton movies were okay (they haven't aged well though), and I really dig what Christopher Nolan is doing with the new movies. Christian Bale did a fine job in "Batman Begins" ... but when I watch the movie, I hear Kevin Conroy's voice in my head. The cartoon rocked. And as much as I enjoyed the Justice League Unlimited cartoon, my biggest complaint was always: more Batman please!!	neutral

I didn't like how he insisted on wasting time with the backstory, and I especially didn't like the certain over repeated lines like "Mr Wayne, why do we fall down" and "You should learn to mind your surroundings."

Out of nowhere this set appeared at my local TRU. Hadn't been expecting this one for a while, so a nice surprise. *sweet* Firstly the box. Nice pic on the front. Good selection of minifigs. The officer and pilot look cool with their dark blue trousers. A new R2 unit as well. Don't remeber this in the film, but great to have one in a new colour. *wub* Back of the box shows some of the ship's nifty features. First thing you notice when you open the box, is the awesome selection of bricks. This makes a for a great parts pack. Loads of unusual red and dark red pieces. It's so refreshing to see a Star Wars set that isn't predominantly grey. There are also two instruction booklets. As soon as you open the first booklet you hit an error. Why would I want two Obi-Wans? :-| It's also at this point that you come across a big disappointment. On the box you get a flesh Qui-Gon. What is actually in the box is an EpIII Obi-Wan. Come on LEGO - why change it? |-/ All the figures look impressive in the flesh despite the BIG mistake. Once I started the build it progressed rapidly. Red pieces seem to be a lot easier to find. Lots of clever techniques. Quite a few Technic elements get used at the start. It reminded me of building a Technic set from the 80s at times. Here is the main body half way through the build. The landing mechanism is a nice touch. Its not fully retractable, but still folds away nicely. You find the ship keeps tipping over as you build it despite the feet, as it's only at the end thay it all becomes evenly balanced at both ends. Here the feet are extended. You can also see the yellow knob that rotates the radar on top of the ship. Landing gear up viewed from the front. Here are the radar. A great collection of dishes. They spin easily with little friction. Here is the ship at the half way point. The front works well with the top flipping up to squeeze in the pilot. More to come... :-)	positive

Brick Miner, on Jul 31 2007, 07:46 PM, said: as for the set, the thing that jumps out at me most is the use of dark blue for water... im so used to seeing the classic blue for water, that the dark blue seems weird. i don't like it. - BM Indeed, I only noticed this when I saw the S@H images. I guees that they're on dark waters. You can always put some trans blue and trans clear 1x1 round plates, no? I tried that technique to make the lava (using trans red and trans orange plates), it looks neat. Regarding the human soldier thing Yoda mentioned, it's quite weird. Like him, I'm going to swap the legs, so they're coherent with the soldiers from the other sets. Third note: is it just me or did you attach the two black gate pieces too high? Shakar	neutral
Shakar, on Aug 1 2007, 01:34 PM, said: Third note: is it just me or did you attach the two black gate pieces too high? Shakar No, I think this is correct. The upper plate with clip for the door is a little high, on top of a dark gray 1x1 brick. So if you want the door to operate well you have to place it like that. I just put the clip under that brick, a very easy fix, so my door now is lower which looks better IMHO, and no sneaky skelly can crawl along under it.... X-D	neutral

Thanks for a great review. I've got a pile of TRU and Lego credit I wanna spend and was thinking about getting this (since I got a sneak peak of your review in the Academy) but it's not here in the US yet. Too bad. Wonder when it'll hit? I do disagree about the manuals though. I find the thinner, stapled manuals easier to use than single large square-bound ones since they lay flatter when open. Have any links to the prelim photos of the front end? I don't remember seeing that and was curious how different it looked.	positive

I think I read somewhere that the US will not get this set or the motorcycle until August 2015. That means the flagship most likely won't be in August but even later in the year... nothing Bricklink can't solve though.	neutral
This is a mega review. You've taken the right pictures and the video demonstrations of the mechanisms really help get the good points of the set across. What's more amazing is that the review still feels very concise and to the point. You've actually convinced me to put this set on my list and not just as a decent parts pack. Lasse D, on 12 March 2015 - 08:47 PM, said: - The front shouldn't open like that - instead it should be easy to remove the whole front cover, leaving the suspension easy to work on. - The aero seems to be realistic, except for the rear end where there's no indication of a venturi channel. This should have been easy to include. - There is no fuel tank, nor fixed fuel connector right behind the cabin. - There are no air jacks! Seriously!? This is one of the most unique features of a race car like this... and LEGO forgot about them. Instead they automated two functions which are manual on a real race car. - The top cars at Le Mans are hybrids with ingenious systems. I would have loved to see the front wheels connected to some kind of spinning apparatus indicating a kinetic energy recovery system. I'm not sure air jacks are the feature that will have people fawning over this set, and pneumatics are being covered rather well later in the year ... but I agree with everything else, most notably removable front and rear bodywork (the removable engine cover on 8674 would be a good starting point here) and the inclusion of some nod towards a hybrid system. It's also worth remembering the preliminary design did have the Big Honking Fin (BHF) that is mandatory on all current prototypes, so maybe when that was removed any trace of a tunnel or diffuser went with it. On the subject of steering wheels, all modern prototypes actually have left or right hand drive. The regulations demand that both LMP1 and LMP2 cars are nominally capable of seating two people. Of course in practise the "extra seat" is taken up by the hybrid system in LMP1 and electronics/extra cockpit access in LMP2. However this doesn't change the fact that it would be easy to link the steering wheel to the HoG/front axle. Edited by Jay Psi, 12 March 2015 - 09:55 PM.	positive
Ted, have you described your photography setup somewhere? I love the crisp quality of your pictures.	positive
Great review. I think it look like a great set, both A and B. However the panels are the only thing I would need, but still a great looking set.	positive
A great review Jim. Just finished building this set. A couple of steps required abit of lego stressing to get together when there was an easier way. Just made it into RC ( almost finished it in LDD) which was easy to do as it has so much room for nearly any configuration of motors and not have them showing. A great set. Edited by jono.rocky, 13 March 2015 - 10:53 AM.	positive
Wonderful review, but I am still not sold on the set. If we get more sets with the bright green I might be tempted to get it, but until then it is too few parts in bright green (too few different types, not the number of pieces) to be able to use that colour effectively in making MOC's.	neutral
True, but I must say I like the new colour, very 'fresh' looking compared to the rather dullish regular green. Can't wait to build MOCs with it.	positive
I have been waiting for this set since the pictures for the toy fairs eirlier in the year and I am glad to say I am not disapointed. First the price it is not cheap at ?99.99 but I guess that is typical for a set with this amount of electronics in it.There is no parts count and I have not had time to add up the 2 pages of contents to get a figure. First the box standard flip top with large internal picture and rip to open lid. inside There are no numbered bags in this set which I prefer I like to open all the bags and put all the parts in the box before building. Next is a picture on the electronics 2 XLmotors as lego describe them and 2 standard motors. 2 IR receivers and 1 IR transmitter I know these have been discussed before but I really like the thought that has gone into the transmitters/receivers each receiver has 2 outputs to corespond with the 2 controls on transmitter they also have a choice of 4 channels so one transmitter can control up to 8 independant motors by changing the channel switch. The transmitter also has a neat motor direction switch so you can configure the transmitter operation. The set comes with three manuals 1 is the main drive mechanism 2 is the cab and engine and 3 is the attachments front and back. There is also the now standard parts list in the back of the third manual. There is no alternative model instructions despite the pictures of one on the box however there is a reference to the technic website on the back of the box but at the moment the page only has an advert saying the set is to be released on 1st September so I guess I will have to wait untill then to see if the instructions will be online. The build is fairly straight forward the main chassis is studless, the next picture shows the motors mounted into the chassis and the drive for the shovel and claw. It also shows the V6 technic engine. This next picture shows the IR receivers mounted on the back. The battery box slots into the back and can be easily slid out with the removal of two pins which is useful because I can imagine I will need to change the batteries on a regular basis. The next 2 picture are of the completed model Overall I was very happy with the finished dozer the functions work really well and as I have the monster dino I have used a second transmitter so I dont have to touch the channel switch, I have included some video On my Brickshelf page. Unfortunately this set does suffer from some quality issues for example moulding marks on the plates, colour diferences, some of the pins not finished properly, some pins were very stiff and quite hard to push into the holes but the worst issue was an axle that would not turn freely in a hole which just adds extra friction into the system. I am glad to see some studded technic in this set I much prefer sets that use both varieties of technic beam. There are only 2 Fairings which is a great improvment over recent sets if TLC had tried to make the bulldozer shovel with fairings this would have been a complete disaster. Marks for the set 8/10 for price with the number of motors I expected it to be greater. 9/10 for fun my kids love this type of set that does something when finished. 6/10 for quality TLC really need to work on this one. 8/10 overall I would definately get a second one if I see it in the sales. Feel free to post questions but I will be on holiday next week. More pics and Videos available HERE	positive
Excellent review, thanks! What is the cost in US? Not released in my area. The shovel is obviously my favorite area, it looks detailed and strong. I love the treads, because I need them to move the 4 x 4 barrels on my super-scaled turbolaser turret. Very good pics too. What color are the treads? I never had them. They are plastic or rubber?

Ah man...I wanted to review it with mine. Oh well. Here in the U.S. it cost $150 and has 1355 pieces total. The pins and axles did seem a bit difficult in putting them into place. A problem I have been having is the batterys are done after about 4 hours of play, which I really wish they would last longer :-( . Overall it is a stupendous set and it is really nice to see our old friend the studs make a return!	neutral
Thanks for the review, it really looks cool. Too bad it's soo expensive. :-/ I must admit that I prefer the 8421 mobile crane for more or less the same price, the design is more "sexy". *wub*	neutral

Hi, many thanks for this review, photos and videos.

Thank you Ickelpete for that great review. I give you two *y* up. I am not a technic fan, but this set definitly looks *sweet* . I see great potential using this set as a model for a smaller dozer for my town/train layout. I really *wub* the crawler tracks they used. I have been thinking about buying the snowmobile for the tracks. But if possible, I just might buy this set instead. I could definitly use the other parts for MOC's. Model On!!	positive
The new small Technic sets have incredible functionality for their size, and this one is no exception. With only 106 parts this crane can roll, extend, rotate, lift (and hold in any position) and has working stabilisers! The boom extends the same as the other sets with this boom; simply pull it. It works surprisingly well and due to circular ridges inside the boom the extension (which is just a standard beam) will hold in place. The gear at the back controls the height of the boom. As you can see the boom is only half extended. Boom fully extended, half down. The cable is kept in place via two gears and a blue pin, same as the 7905 crane. Even under decent weights this works well. The stabilisers however cannot handle much weight once the load is moved off axis. The stablilsers are a very simple but effective design. Another shot of the stablilsers. This also shows how far the boom will decend. The boom height mechanism works well also. I love the cab design. Overall this is a remarkable achievement for the low price. I bought it for the boom piece as I want to improve the crane that came with 7998 7898 ( :-$ ). I highly recommend it.	positive

Alright, so I usually do quick photo reviews when I get new sets. That's what I'll do here, but there's quite a few photos, so I thought I might as well make its own review thread. So, I got the Kwik-E-Mart by paying just2much on an early eBay copy. I think it's worth it, as this week I'm gonna be super busy, so I was able to build it Saturday and stuff. Here's my video review, I think it's one of my best: Well, let's get onto this photo review. The set is $200 USD with a little over 2100 pieces. The official release is April 15th for VIP members, May 1st for everyone else at LEGO Stores. And, if you want full size pictures, check out my Flickr by clicking here. The minifigures included are great. You get three exclusive minifigures (one being a completely exclusive character- the first time LEGO has ever put an exclusive mould in a Direct to Consumer set), and you get three of the series most popular characters in their normal attire for those who missed out on the first Simpsons minifigures series. The Kwik-E-Mart's exterior is loaded with lots of sticker details. The only printed detail you'll see in the exterior is the dial pad in the phone booth, which has appeared in some other licensed themes since last year. ( ^^^ right here is there the store can be opened- a simple Technic pin and receiver keeps it in place and allows for opening and closing) The roof of the store includes the garden shown in the Paul McCartney episode. The roof can be slided out/in once you open it with the hinge part. Here's a look at the store with the roof removed. The floors are a nice sand blue color, coming with 8x16 thin plates: And, for the interior, from the view of the store opened with the hinges at the back that I mentioned earlier: The left front corner, which includes some arcade machines of Bonestorm and Great White Hunter, an amazingly done Buzz cola soda machine, juice machine, the checkout counter, ect: The right front corner, with food aisles, freezers, and a frozen Jasper sticker: The back left corner, which includes some nice coffee kettle builds, the donut tray, hotdogs, ect: The right back corner, which has a door leading to a very small hallway that only has a mouse and cheese in it. The hallway leads to the employees only door in the back, and it's very hard to get in the door way (not that there's anything to do inside there): Also included is Clancy's copcar, which fits three figures: Here's a look at the piece list in the instructions, click on each to be lead to an enlarged version of the pic: Also included are some awesome printed pieces, and two unprinted coffee cups! Honestly, I think this set is perfect. The price is fantastic, and has a great PPP ratio. They really went above and beyond by including Snake in this set. I honestly think it's better than the Simpsons House in terms of accuracy and the value here- so many cool pieces printed and in exclusive colors. So, that's my quick picture review. Hope you guys enjoyed, and I'd love to hear your thoughts!	positive

Did anyone else have a problem with the piano against the wall of The Simpsons House? It just kept coming off way too easily and I was getting really frustrated with it sticking out and not fully going on so I had to put the two tiles that hold them one place over away from the wall for it to sit properly without falling out, I think I might put Snowball II behind it since cats love to hide underneath or behind things lol but just curious to know if anyone else was encountering this problem with the previous set.	positive

Due to a larger BL order in the U.S. I couldn?t resist to add two Hopper Waggons to my train layout. Here?s a review of this fantastic set. The box. Well, there?s nothing really special about it. The open box with three polybags. Note, that there are only three different colors used in that set (actually there are 4, but you can?t see the dark grey ones). Great color composition by the way. *wub* And - NO STICKERS !!! - :-D Oooops - I opened the bags too fast. Help me, I?m drowning! *sing* Not following the instructions, I built the wheels first to get the larger pieces out of the way. Keep on rolling. This is the load of the hopper waggon. 11 round bricks altogether. When I opened the set, I was curious if it was a new colored set or an old one. Luckily enough it was an old one, with old dark grey. I don?t know if TLC ever produced this set with bley. From the following pic you can clearly see, that the set is an old one. Look at these slope bricks. See what I mean? All bricks are looking exactly the same! Buy a set today means get at least three different textures on the slopes and maybe even more shades of tan. :-X >:-( I have said that in many other threads here and I?m saying it again: Back to the roots, Lego! You were able to produce good quality. Show us you can still do it! *sad* But now to the building. It?s a 6 x 24 train base plate you?re building on. Did I say I liked the colors? :-D This is the mechanism to unload the waggon. Built in the waggon with open gates... ... and with closed ones. Almost done. This is the first time, I realized that minifigs actually can step on those ladders. :-$ A short lift and the wheels are fixed. This darn mechanism! Wait, I?m coming with my monkey wrench! >:-) Who opened that door again? Do I have to do it all on my own? :'-( Finally the work is done. Now have a brake. One shot from the front/back. You can see the car is really huge! 8-? I put it behind the red car of the 4512. That sure looked very strange. *wacko* The set fits a lot better to the other cars of the "My Own Train" theme than to the older ones. The Score: Brick selection: 10/10 excellent color and brick selection (these were the days...) Playability: 9/10 great unloading mechanism Price/piece count ratio: 8/10 at peeron it says 20$, I got it for 39,95$ -> 30?/228 bricks. Not really cheap, but worth every cent! :-) Overall rating: 9/10 and a definity "must buy" for rolling stock lovers. Sad enough it?s not available on S@H any more. But there are still sets on BL and ebay. That?s for now folks, thank you for reading. I have some job to do...	positive

Another great review, thanks *yoda*! Man, those smooth slopes really look like crap when on a roof :-| That was the whole reason they had texture in the first place... |-/ I'll never liked those, they feel so cheap! The new SB head is great, and can Mrs. Puff's legs move? I just ask since her feet are separate, and in figs where the legs can't move, they're usually one piece at the bottom to keep them from breaking off. The set looks great, and seems to have a lot of playability	positive
Yoda, I don't thank you for this review, and after the Chump Bucket review too! Because I'm so exited to have them that since I ordered them from s@h, I come back home aftre the work the faster I can, with the hope to see a big box on my bed... and this, even if I know that it tooks more than 6-7 days to have my order...

Thanks 'mostlytechnic' for this review, I only brought this set to continue the shop series from creator. In my opinion it's only half as good as the bike shop/cafe one.

Brick On Review On 'mostlytechnic' ! Well, it IS only half the price of the bike/cafe one too :) But I agree, it seems odd that they've made a couple "shop" creator sets that don't fit together in style like this. I guess they've done that for years with the creator houses though - none of those really work together. David Thomsen, on 04 May 2015 - 01:33 PM, said: Reviews for this set really should picture them next to the Bike Shop & Cafe, which it's intended to be compatible with right down to the size of the baseplates and grey tiles around the edge. It doesn't look that great on its own, but if you add the two sets together you get something that begins to look like a street scene. Interesting to get two comments right in a row with opposite opinions :) I don't have the bike/cafe set, but to me, they don't looks like they'd really go together. They're the same concept (two buildings that fold in half) but the sidewalk is different size and they just feel differently styled to me.	negative
As a fan of Creator houses, I really want to like this set. However, I think that Creator houses have long filled a niche that's neglected elsewhere: residential houses. We haven't had a larger residential house since 2013; I'm not sure if these sets have anything to do with that, but it seems like they may be the replacement for larger houses. And I'd much rather have a larger house set than a set like this. I also agree with many others here; something about it just feels incomplete. I think that the various City business buildings we've gotten in recent years (including those in this year's City Square--which is much more expensive than this, but also contains much more) make for better buildings at this scale.	positive
Thanks andy_0306uk, your very clever strategic decision to serve us with blurry pictures allowed me to glance at this review without ruinating that whole wonderful Advent surprise too much.... :-P *y* But although I loved the last year?s one, I think they could do another theme (or perhaps even two calendars), because right now Castle?s pretty hot IMO.	positive

Yeah, I guess this would need a little more "out of the box" thinking than TLC?s doing usually for their Castle line.... Things that are similar to the City theme, and more civil life based, like some blacksmith equipment, market place, bakery, farmer and so on, but a wizard workshop, a hidden treasure and some medieval furniture would also work fine.... And an evil Santa with spiders and coal pieces as gifts.... and a sledge pulled by a dragon of course. :-D	neutral

9.30 euro is MSRP here in Denmark. 7 euro would have resulted in a nicer reception from my part, but the strong marked position of LEGO in its homeland together with the general high prices (because some of us are supposedly rich...) makes the prices less bearable. It is funny you should mention Germany. I thought the prices for LEGO were even higher there! I'm sure I paid more than MSRP last time I bought LEGO from from your country. On the other hand. The last thing I bought was the 5521 Model Team sea jet from 1993!	neutral
I couldn't find a review of this wonderful set in here, so here it goes! I got the set for MSRP (180kr = 24 euro) which is a fair price here in Denmark. As all other Creator sets there are instructions for several models (3 in this case). The box The box is a little larger than City sets in the same price range. The primary model is shown on the front while you see the secondary ones on the back. What you get 312 pieces in 5 polybags and two building instructions: one for the primary model and the other for the rest. The built It was impossible for me to speed build this model because of the nifty functional details from the retractable landing gear to the wings that can turn by means of the handle in the back of the model. It took me a full hour to build it because I had to "test" how it all works together. The finished model The landing gear isn't fully enclosed when retracted and the models are sub-minifig scale, but I still love the design of the models. The doors for the rear wheels open as you pull the wheels down and the final piece of functionality comes from the wings that can either tilt (the horizontal stabilizers) or have elevators. Wing in, wings out, wings in, wings out... Ratings As a whole I actually like this set even more than the Big Rig. The models are just as diverse but the added functionality makes the plane more fun to play with than the rig. Price: 7/10 - A good price, but not a bargain as the Big Rig Design: 9/10 - There could have been a sligtly higher level of details in the main model, but all models are really good looking and I especially like the design of the hovercraft. Functionality: 10/10 - I guess you could ask for working rudders, opening cockpit and so on, but the plane is really filled with movable parts and the turning of the wings works really well. Secondary models: 7/10 - A hovercraft! How awesome is that!? If only the last model was just as inventive instead of a standard helicopter... Modifiability: 8/10 - The bricks are in ordinary colours and there is a good variety of them giving you plenty of possibilities for MOC'ing. You can easily make the main model into something that looks more like an F-14. 9/10 Probably as good as it gets for a Creator set in this price range. It is entertaining to both build and play with, looks good and the secondary models are worth building as well! (Brickshelf gallery)	positive
Thanks for this excellent review Lasse D! :-) I was thinking about getting this the other day but decided not to. I regret my actions! Glad to see Creator making great sets, the theme has so much potential, I just wish that this set had more models... |-/ Oh well can't have it all, anyway, Thanks! *sweet* Batbrick Away! >:-)	positive
?34.99 is not too shabby. The big guy itself is nice, but the gem of the set is the Mech. Really nice Mech I must say! Great for posing. The Mini figs Suprisingly nice little build/vehicle. Never seen this element before....its probably nothing new though, Lol. No articulation of the legs? Nooooooo! Phew! The front two legs do articulate. Would of been bad if they didnt. Overall, I give the set 7.8/10. Not the best, but its actually quite nice, and the Yellow Mech is awesome. If it was him on his own, then 9.4/10! Cheers	positive

Hahah, entertaining and informative, a great read- thanks for the review! On a side note I thought Fant-Four-Stic was....ok. On the poorer side of ok.

Thanks for the review, i've had that set for quite a while, and it's among my favorite Marvel Superheroes Sets actually. Compared to the other stuff we usually get to accompany the minifigs... All those "Laboratorys", the most recent Construction Site, and the "Hydra Fortress" .. yeah... You're being a little harsh here Maybe you're still suffering from PTSD after watching Fant-Four-Stic!	neutral

Overall, I wish Marvel in particular would have more playsets in its theme (Batman has several great ones in the DC theme). But then again, if this is the best playset to date for Marvel, maybe it's better just to leave well enough alone. I would definitely like to see them attempt something in the $100+ (US) price range because I think it could be good; Marvel needs an equivalent to the Arkham Asylum set. Regarding this set, I saved myself some money and bought the 4 minifigs I needed (all but Spidey) on Bricklink for less than half the set price.

Personally, I thought your review was spot on and I very much enjoyed your tone. I'm not usually much of a mini-fig person, but I will admit I bought this set mostly for Dr. Doom (and considered Nova a bonus). Growing up, I was a big fan of the Fantastic Four and an even bigger fan of Dr Doom. I hope that someday the film rights will revert to Marvel and we'll finally get a FF film that respects the original source material and features a Dr Doom worthy of the name. As for the set itself, I don't have much use for playsets (not that there's anything wrong with them, I think the Marvel Lego line could use more of them in fact) and I didn't even realize it was linked to a specific show as I've fallen a bit out of touch with the franchise of late. I bought it; I built it; it sat a shelf for a while; I scrapped it for parts. I think most of it wound up as a greenhouse for my winter village set-up. It's not a _bad_ set, but I think you summed things up nicely when you called it mediocre. Thanks for the entertaining review.	neutral
I think I'm the only person in the world who likes Fant4stic... Was it the best superhero movie? Not even close, but I didn't think it deserved the hate it got. It was just incredibly and clumsily mishandled. Anyways, great review. I might pick this one up if only for the Beetle fig.	negative

The Minifigs: As you can see, the minifigs are really nice. They even throw in an extra fleshie head! No doubt these will fetch quite a bit on the Bricklink and Ebay markets. I?m keeping mine. Continuing the Build This photo shows how well this model is put together. Notice that they use four of the three-hole beams per side to hold this together. I remember reading that you can hang this model from the ceiling. I don?t doubt it. These right angle Technic pieces are used to reinforce the structure of the model. You can see them used here: I was shocked at how many light gray plates are in this set. I have TWO tubs full of these: The infrastructure is now complete: I got hung up for about an hour looking for one of these: Turns out, LEGO gave me an extra left wedge and shorted me a right wedge. So frustrating! I had to stead one off my 6211 Star Destroyer. It is not a very common piece by the way?	neutral
Hey nice review, im up to about the same point as you (page 70 to be exact) , tho i didnt have that missing piece thankfully! I think lego have done a much better job at packing the lego this time, i remember it taking me much longer to find pieces on the UCS ISD build	positive
So I see they even do mistakes on these |-/ That beast looks really sturdy !! That is great !! Are these yellow parts new ? I am not a Technic fan and never saw these before. Another question for you: is the instruction book easy to follow, especially regarding the colours. Does the black rally stands out comparing to the dark bley and so on ? I sure hope so ;-) Can't wait to see moer hehe *yoda*	neutral
I have been taking photos for this review for a few months and I finally took the rest of the photos last night. All the parts. If you want tan, this is the set to get! Main model. The garage is a great addition... ...but the car only just fits! The main house is very nice looking. The windows extend to the sides... ...but not the back. The chimney and drainage work very well, and I love the "basement". I think the front works very well. When I was making this I was multitasking doing weight training; do a set, do a step, do a set... and I ended up missing one of the row paths. I discovered this after I finished the basement. :-| The removable roof reveals BYO floors. Probably why this is called a Model house! The roof was quite interesting to build. This is my first large house set so it all was very new to me. I love the garage door. More nice pipework. This photo I mis-focused but there isn't much to see anyway! The door is a nice touch. The grill to the right on both sides is not just decoration as it hides the hinges for the door. I also made one of the sub-models. I was considering keeping this but I decided against it. Once again the sides have windows... but the back doesn't. The truck is there to make the photo more worthwhile! The roof to this one doesn't come off easily as all the tiles are used for the front. Just to clarify; these houses aren't attached so you can arrange them however you want. The fronts are quite elaborate and it seems that Lego were trying to make this almost like a simpler market street. The truck is too small for a minifig... ...but it probably was my favourite car. Thoughts I highly recommend this set. In most countries it is good value for money, including Australia. The design is excellent and three instructions are included. (The third is a school. If anyone has made it and wants to post photos feel free! At least one person at EB has made it.) I love how each house has its own car. Due to the way the primary model is made it is a bit weak at the corner, but that was a design choice. My only real complaint about this set is how Lego is going though a mould transition and thus some roof slopes are rough, others are smooth. I can accept either, and Lego has been moving to smooth slopes for years now, but to have a set with about 50/50 is annoying. (The MTT was the same.) But that is my only gripe with this excellent set. *wub*	positive
A beautiful and humorous review with very fine pics. *y* A fantastic set, full of neat details and in a wonderful color scheme. Great for every City builder for sure. I guess we waited for sets like that. We dreamed about them. I?m glad we got them now. :'-) EDIT: Congrats! It seems you?ve got your bucket back.... :-P	positive
I found the use of parts well done by the designers. I made a car and then tried to make a house from a different instruction book. I could not as several pieces were already used in the car. Nice to see them using all the parts like that rather than having a lot of "extra" bits. Moral of the story: one instruction book at a time. *sweet*	neutral

Thank you very much for the review Sinner. I definitly *wub* this set. This will make a great addition for us "Townies". I thought the size was too small.

Remember when I said in my review of 7090 to expect a review after I went to ToysRus? Well, somehow things didn?t work out, but fortunately I?m finally reviewing my latest purchases, starting with 7091 Catapault Defense, which happens to be one of the best sets in the Castle line. The Box and Instructions: Lego box art is at it?s highest point ever these days, with lots of special effects and great action poses. The castle theme is no exception, and 7091 isn?t either. I?ll let the box speak for itself: I love the back of the castle boxes as well, since they give another action scene and other neat info like a layout of all the accessories. The Contents: Only the bare essentials as usual: piece bags and instructions. I seriously wish they still put mini catalogs inside sets like they did when I was young, but I guess they are too expensive to make or something. Ah well, can?t have everything. No picture of the instructions this time, but since that isn?t necessary I?ll just say that they are fine, and do not have a problem with distinguishing dark gray from black. The Pieces: Here?s your basic shot of every piece included, minus a few extra pieces like an extra Viking horn and black skeleton leg. Not too shabby for a 10 USD set. There?s a lot of nice pieces in 7091, as you can see (and this doesn?t include the accessories or minifig parts!). The brown plates, wheels, and spoked things are always useful, and the dark blue and gold slopes are really cool. However, there?s also a fair amount of technic in here, so be warry. As usual for the castle line, 7091 has a heaping helping of accessories. Most of them are old pieces recolored, but the ball on chain (what?s the actual name, could someone tell me?) and the shields are brand new. I actually like the new skeleton weapon, since it?s fairly detailed and was really the only way TLC could make a part like that. And yes, the shields ARE printed (quite nicely too, if I do say so myself). Plus, you get Viking horns (always useful to have), a grey boulder, a basket, and 3 helmets. Not a half bad deal, eh? Oh, who am I kidding ? it?s awesome! Minifigures: Ah yes, one of the highlights of any castle set. You get 2 soldiers and 2 skellies this time, all with different weapons. The two soldiers are just regular Crown troops with different faces ? nothing special, except that they are awesome anyway. The skeletons on the other hand are much more interesting: an archer and a black skellie! Archers cool, of course, but I know many don?t like the printing on the black skeletons. Well, let me say that I don?t mind it so much. The only real problem is that the eyes are dark red instead of just red, which makes the printing a bit less noticeable. And I?ve been through it before that the new skeleton molds in general don?t bother me at all ? go skeletons! The Finished Set: Alright, there?s two builds in this set, and I?ll start with the smaller: the skeleton barricade. Okay, so it?s nothing special, but it?s cool all the less. The shield on the front and the slanted spears are nice touches. Here?s just how the skeletons can tower over their own barricade: with a little step. Ah, the catapault. The lovely catapault. Seriously, I love TLC?s design. Very effective, and also very realistic, especially compared to KK. Love the side details and the swiveling base, and you gotta love the clever use of that basket. Playability: Yes, I?ve made it a tradition now to write stories for any castle set I buy (and this isn?t the last one, you can be sure of that!). Here?s one featuring everything in 7901: Oh, and here?s a small ship I made out of all the pieces in this set plus a couple extra figures and weapons from my copy of 7901. Not half bad, IMO, considering what I had to work with. Overall Rating: Presentation: 9/10 Pieces: 8/10 Minifigures: 9/10 Finished model: 9/10 Playability: 8/10 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Final Score: 8.6/10 Once again, I highly recommend the reviewed set. Castle is possibly the best theme this year, and this set is one of many that prove it. As with all castle sets, it?s best if you buy several if you want to truly enjoy it, but this set alone is also impressive in both design and pieces and minifigures. Get at least one if you have even a slight liking for Castle. Edited by KimT, 10 August 2008 - 01:31 PM.	positive

Great review! I just built the original, and this one has clear advantages over the original (though I wish Lego would stop putting torsos with defined breasts and curves on children). I really like pretty much every change. I won't be getting it, and I'd be lying if I said I'm not a little disappointed. For the first four years, my mother-in-law got me the new winter village set for Christmas; after the last two, which didn't really fit thematically in my display, I had hoped for a new one--particularly since my daughter is getting to be around the age where she can play with them. I mention her specifically because I've seen lots of people dismiss those who are a bit disappointed as rabid adults who don't care about kids getting cool sets, and I don't think that's fair. I may have to see how much some of the parts go for on Bricklink. The rerelease is better than the original, but not good enough that I'd want to spend $80 to get a set that's nearly identical to one I have.

Great review, thanks Oky! IMO, the only significant improvements over the 2009 version are the figures, toys, and printed shop sign. As I already have the older one I'll have to give this one a pass.	neutral
I missed out on the first one, but I love the improvements made in this version, like the tree having an actual brown trunk so it looks less like an artificial one, and the carolers as well. I may pick this up, but I'm sorry to those of you who already have one.	positive
I didn't own the original toy shop so I bought it this time around. I just finished building it Saturday and I love it! However, I wish they had both re-released this one AND came out with a new addition to the village. :)	positive
Thanks for the nice review! The landing mechanism looks quite cute. Aren't the yellow axles 5L, not 4L? (Very strange that they would release such a part).	positive
MegaRoi, on 01 December 2015 - 10:56 AM, said: Hi there, nice model, great review! I almost reverse engineered this model, but used wrong parts for landing wheels, didn't know how to fix the nose proper, and so on. So i was very interested in this model and i like playing with it. I love the reviews, but i think i have to mention, that the yellow axle must be a 5L! The picture shows a 5L, and a 5L would fit the size of the model. The cart has also a 5L in yellow. What sitze is the yellow axle in this seit. Really 4L as written in the text? Greetings, Robert The picture of the manual says 4x 5L yellow axle, and that seems to line up with what im seeing in the pics as well So i assume the 4L is a typo	neutral
Nice review, even with the missing demonstration video of the A-model! Looks like this is an excellent panel pack for the price, and those soft axles will go down a treat. Will this set be the dark horse of 1H 2016...?	positive

It helps to have a comparison! You are right. I came to the same conclusion when writing the review. I tell you it doesn't look that good without stickers, but I don't have a picture to prove it. To be honest; I compared it to the model posted in the 2016 topic a few days ago. I applied the stickers before building the model, so I wasn't able to make a proper comparison. I will keep it in mind for future reviews. Thanks for the suggestion.	neutral
Cool! Glad you like 'em. And thanks for the kind words.	neutral
First thing I thought: HOT WHEELS?? WHUT. The set looks like the Hot Wheels 'Bone Shaker'.	neutral
the instructions for the Extreme Police Interceptor combo model is now online....will someone do a review of this B model? https://wwwsecure.us...tselector=true#	neutral
I was waiting especially for review of this set. Let me add few things about this... thing. It all will be complainging of person who works with these type of machines, so if you just want a unusual machine in your collection, ignore my complaining :) I see underground loaders almost every day, and believe me, this model would now work in the underground mine. First of all, its cab should stick out more from the frame. Each loader has cab placed out of the chassis, to provide better view for the driver. In this class of machine it would help a bit, but in low loader ones it is extremely important: This is the view from the cab of a low profile loader (looking at front - and yes, front of the machine is where engine is placed, because at least at KGHM all machines drive engine forward): Another thing about that cab is that seat and steering wheel/joysticks are placed perpendicularly to the machine chassis, to provide same view for driving forward and backwards. So another weak spot of the set. The model lacks of trans clear lights on the engine part, because all machines that work underground have same lamps on front and back. Another thing that comes to my mind is that warning light and antena would not live too long in the mine, becuase it could be torn apart by ramming into tunnels roofs. It does resemble shape of underground machine, but not a loader. Only machine that comes to my mind is something that are used for moving/placing hydraulic support jacks in tunnels. Sorry for poor quality, I didn't find better picture of it: It does have claw, four wheels and articulated chassis, but have much greater range of movement of the arm. Anyway, I'd give it at least 3/5 for overall look. Model itself, as a set, looks unfinished (or cut down on pieces after visit of an accountant...) For me it looks like engine part was built differently, with knobs for steering/claw operating sticking out from back. Claw needs almost seven full turns of the worm gear to close from opened position, and is rather annoing to use it in way it is built in this model. Bracket that holds bevel gears responsible for steering is rather loose, being hold in place by single 3/4 pin. On the other hand, the steering works very well. It seems that lack of differential will be more common in LEGO sets, becuase it is another model that have fake engine driven by single wheel (like in old russian RC cars...). I am OK with that, but it is a pitty that this model has only R2 engine. Thing that I do not like the most in this model is how the claw arm works. First of all, it barelly lifts the claw of the ground, the movement could be much better. And it has major design flaw - universal joints are not placed in line with articulation points, and this is main reason of 5L axle not being suported on both sides under the turntable. While rainsing the arm, it bends a little! I really would like to see this model built differently, with normal bucket and better range of movement.

Think this is the only 1H set I'll be getting. Guess I'm waiting for 2H for the rest of the construction stuff! This set looks okay to me; it includes the instructions for both models, which is cool, and includes some great parts. I like that it's not just another bucket loader and that it actually tries something different, too.	positive
Freekysch, on 06 December 2015 - 12:00 PM, said: Great review and great pictures ! Many thanks for talking the time to review this set .

MajklSpajkl, on 05 December 2015 - 11:45 PM, said: My opinion on the frictionless axlepins is that the flex axle might be easier to stick in them than in regular/blue axlepins... Didn't actually try it though :-) Frictionless pins have accurate round hole, while blue friction pins have something squarish. Flex axle will fit in both, but using tan pins doesn't require strength. Conncetion with tan pins is weaker too.	neutral
Great review! Im a bit undecided on the set though, it has some nice parts (4 cil engine in such a small set!) and it looks good, but also a bit small and simple, not sure if it stands up to the standards of the small tracked loader or similar for sets of this size, and as a parts pack (for panels/flaxles) the display team jet is infinitely better. Ill probably pick one up, but right now i really want another tracked loader... (last one was sacrificed to the MOD gods)	neutral
REVIEW - 42038 - ARCTIC TRUCK INTRODUCTION Arctic vehicles aren't new to LEGO. Back in 2000 the Town theme already had several small orange arctic vehicles. In 2014 TLG again released a number of Arctic sets in the City theme (formerly known as Town). Some of these sets are actually pretty big, containing over 700 parts. Looking back in history it seems that Arctic sets may have found their origin in the Technic theme. Although these sets were white instead of orange, they are unmistakenly Arctic. The 1986 Technic Arctic Sets contained the infamous Technic Figures. Unfortunately the 2015 Arctic Truck doesn't contain any Technic Figures, but nonetheless it's great to see a new Arctic vehicle in the Technic line, not counting several snow scooters. Let's see if the new Arctic Truck lives up to the expectations. Note: All images can be clicked for hi-res versions. SET INFORMATION Number: 42038 Title: Arctic Truck Theme: Technic Released: 2015 Part Count: 1219 Box Weight: 2110 gr Box Dimensions: 47,8 cm x 28,0 cm x 7,2 cm Set Price (MSRP): € 79,99 / US$ 84.99 / £ 59.99 Price per Part: € 0,088 / US$ 0.093 / £ 0.066 Links: Brickset, Bricklink THE BOX The box measures 47,8 cm x 28,0 cm x 7,2 cm and weighs around 1385 grams. The box actually feels pretty heavy which means it's filled properly. This seems to be a trend in the Technic theme. Slightly smaller boxes can save shelf space for retailers. THE FRONT The front of the box shows the main model and in the lower right corner there's a image with the dimension of the model. It's 40cm long and 18cm wide. THE BACK The upper part of the back of the box shows the functions of the main model. The lower left section shows the B-model, which looks very promising (more on that later). The lower right section shows the motorization options for the main model. The crane (partially) and the bed can be motorized. Besides motorization some LEDs can be added as headlights. THE SIDE On of the sides shows one of the newer smaller style panels. This is the first time it appears in orange. When you take a look at the sticker you can see that it's not symmetrical. Not sure why TLG "cut of" one of the sides of the stickers, since the position of the panel is very suitable for a continuous sticker. CONTENT OF THE BOX The box is pretty densely packed, which is better than semi-filled boxes. It feels like you actually bought something which matches the box size. The box contains: 2 Booklets 1 Sticker Sheet 8 Bags BOOKLETS & STICKER SHEET Unfortunately the instructions and sticker sheet haven't been packed with cardboard protection, which results in a curved sticker sheet and slightly bent instructions. In my case this wasn't so bad. At least no real damage. HIGHLIGHTED PARTS This set proves to be a great parts pack, especially when you might have missed some of the 2014 sets. BLACK LINK TREADS Usually the Link Treads come in Dark Blue Grey, but this sets includes 96 Black treads, which is great if you'd like to replace the DBG ones in your MOCs, or other official sets. UNDERCARRIAGE AND SUSPENSION Several parts are included to build the undercarriage driving the treads. Four Large Tread Sprockets and eight Small Tread Sprockets, which are used as return sprockets. Also included are four Steering Portal Hubs and four Steering Portal Axles for driving and steering the vehicle. Several frames, including two C-shaped Pivot Frames and two Steering Ball Joints to create an undercarriage much like the 4x4 Crawler. The set even includes two H-shaped Frames (a.k.a. Dog Bone Frames). NEW CHANGEOVER CATCH PARTS This year (2015) three new parts have been introduced to improve the changeover catch. More on these parts later. NEW PIN CONNECTOR Another new part for this year (2015) is the "1L Round Pin Connector", which looks like a pin connector, but acts more like a bush. NEW PINS Furthermore this sets includes quite a large number of three (relatively) new parts. 17 x Pin with Pin Hole, 14 x 3L Pin with 1L Axle and 11 x 3L Pin with 2L Axle, which have been introduced this year (2015). When the new 3L Pin with 1L Axle was introduced in 2014 it was only a matter of time before the new 3L Pin with 2L Axle would appear. Both new Pins are a great addition to the parts portfolio. PANELS Last but not least this sets contains a fair number of orange panels, including the 3x11 Panel in Orange, which is the first time we've seen this part. PART LIST Below is the entire part list for the 913 parts. As usual this part list can be found at the end of the second booklet. THE BUILD The build immediately starts with some of the new parts, used to build the compact gearbox in the center of the model. Notice the two 20 Tooth Bevel Gears. One would have been enough to drive the 12 Tooth Bevel Gear, so the second seems to be useless. TLG probably used it in the A-model, because they needed it in the B-model, which you can see later. The front and rear suspension are almost identical. The front side also has the 13L Gear Rack, used for steering. The picture below shows the steering rack on the front suspension in more detail. At this point you have more or less finished the chassis. The gearbox is in place and the majority of the functions has internally been connected to the right gears. The small turntable shows where the crane will be attached later on. At the end of the first booklet, some of the bodywork has been attached to the chassis. The orange-black color scheme never fails to please me. Throw in some cool stickers for the extra effect and we have a winner. If you decide to motorize the model, using PF, the top of the cabin can be lifted to accomodate the battery box. The chassis uses lots of orange (and some black) panels to give the model it's distinctive look. The protective black bumber/railing is a nice addition which adds something to the exterior. The dumping bed at the rear can tilt to empty it's load. It's operated by a Mini LA. The Treads, which look very cool in Black, are driven by a Large Tread Sprocket and returned by two Small Tread Sprockets. The front and rear sections are identical. Building the undercarriages feels a bit repetitive, which is a problem for most tracked vehicles. FINISHED MODEL Adding the crane to the model finishes the build. Your model should look something like this. When you take a close look at the finished model, you realize this is something else. It's trully a unique vehicle. The color scheme is brilliant and the fact that it's an Arctic Truck is really neat. It's a welcome change for the Technic line to see a vehicle like this. This picture emphasizes that's it's a very cool vehicle. Imagine this beast plowing through the snow! As far as I know it's not based on a real life vehicle. If's probably a combination of several vehicles and some imagination. I can be totally wrong though. The rear of the vehicle shows the crane and drum, placed on the tipper bed. From this angle you can see some of the internals of the model, the gearbox behind the cabin for example. The crane can be partially motorized (rotation and base), while the boom is operated manually. What I like a lot is the protective railing around the vehicle. LEFT OVER PARTS Some leftover parts, nothing noteworthy. FEATURES AND FUNCTIONS This set has several functions/features: Steering Driving Suspension Crane Tipping bed STEERING As you can see in the image below the steering mechanism has quite a bit of negative caster (please correct me if I'm wrong), which causes the treads to rotate a bit upward/downward instead of only to the left and right. DRIVING You mention driving as a feature?! Yes I do and let me explain why. Normally I would ommit this as a feature and take driving for granted. However, driving this vehicle (on a flat surface) causes it to simply slide over the surface. For other arctic vehicles this would be a plus, but with a tracked vehicle it limits playability. This is one of the main drawbacks of these tread, they simple don't work properly on smooth surfaces. SUSPENSION The suspension is working properly. You do need to apply some pressure, but all things considered it's not too bad. CRANE The crane has four degrees of freedom: Base rotation Lower boom Upper boom Hook It does what it's supposed to do. Base rotation and lower boom can be motorized and switched using the gearbox, while the upper boom and hook are operated manually. TIPPING BED The tipping is operated via a Mini LA. CONCLUSION While the set does offer various functions and features, driving and steering is a serious issue. Therefor this set is more likely to be showcased than to be played with. B-MODEL Instructions for the B-model are of high quality. Looking at the image below, you will see what I mean. Here's the finished B-model, a tracked Jeep with a communcations device. This alternate model looks so good, it could easily have made it as a main model. One thing that does pop in mind; how would this look with tires?! More on that later. When you are in the artcic region it's imperative to have proper communication channels. Since there's no internet backbone, you will need a big antenna of some sort. This B-model actually features a small trailer wagon with a transmitter/receiver. Here's more detailed image of the B-model, without trailer wagon. I would buy this model in a heartbeat if it were a main model. Simply gorgeous. The side view doesn't give away that this in alternate model. The stickers also work really well in this model. And again, nothing to complain here. The model even has a small crane at the rear, operated by the Mini LA. Here you can see the arctic fleet, comprised of both the A-model and B-model. I bet these two can get some work done!! A bit of a messy picture, but this should give you an impression of the size of both models. LEFTOVER PARTS Not too many parts left, which is obviously a good thing. ALTERNATE MODEL WITH TUMBLER TIRES Just like me, you probably have been wondering how this model would look like with (Tumbler) tires. Well, here it is. As I imagined it does look great. Admittedly, these are not the type of tires we ought to use, but to be honest; I don't really care. Again, the negative caster results in quirky steering. The tires are a bit too big, so they hit the chassis when you compress the suspension. While this has absolutely nothing to do with an arctic vehicle, I really love this picture. SUMMARY We're almost at the end of my review, so what do I think of this set. Let's start with getting the Elephant out of the room; this set lacks proper driving and steering. Does that make it a bad set?! Definitely not! It's a great set, but it lacks some playability when it comes to moving the vehicle. The crane and tipper bed do work properly, so there's still some playability left. Does this set look cool? Definitely! I think it's one of the coolest (no pun intended) and most original models of recent years. The orange and black color scheme works great and the stickers are well designed. The B-model is of very high quality and some might even prefer it over the A-model. And if you are not interested in either of these models, this set provides you with a variety of great parts! All in all I think this is a great set! Maybe not to play with, but it scores high on all other criteria. PROS Original model Great color scheme Lots of interesting parts Great B-model CONS Steering and driving don't work too well Repetitive build of undercarriages (minor con) SCORE Below are my scores based on different categories. 8 DESIGN Original and good looking model. 7 BUILDING EXPERIENCE Fun to build, albeit a bit repetitive. 8 FEATURES Packs quite a few features. 7 PLAYABILITY Some features work, some don't. 9 PARTS Comes with interesting parts. 9 VALUE FOR MONEY Two great model in a single set. 8 COOL! As a bonus, here's picture of the main model with Tumbler Tires. Why? Because we can!	positive
The set is a looker, you've got to admit it, but what it gives in looks does not make up for what it lacks in functions. I really wanted this set, badly even, when I restarted my adventure with Technic about a month ago. Than I learned more and more about what a good model can do, mostly thanks to this forum and YT. Right now I'm a bit disappointed with the Arctic Truck - smaller sets offer more functions and teach you much more.

A wonderful set and, perhaps, as close to Classic Space as possible. *y* Also there?s a great amount of very useful and interesting parts too like these round 'stabilizer' parts with clip.... :'-) There?s a complete different feeling with this new sets compared to the first MM ones.... 8-| Beside the a little more realistic aspects of it with the more enclosed cockpit (nearly with some controls.... ;-) ) it?s the overall more solid feeling I guess.... The other sets look pretty neat and fashionable at the surface, but their internal structure is much more hollow and useless with some studless technic beams and such stuff.... very shining, but hard and boring to MOD, just aimed for maximal cool looking box art and the rest went down for saving costs.... (beside that already pretty good 7692 Dropship that is). The only thing I don?t get with that is why the minirobot?s a one-armed one.... ach, Pirates on Mars I suppose.... X-D	positive
that head might have been from rock raiders. lovely set, and a good review. jifel	positive
Tks for the great review MM ;-) Its always appreciated to have reviews of new set. Having said that I really don't see the point of that set and its such money and time wasted IMO. I don't like that theme apart the dropship and 6wheeler and that tiny vehicle doesn't do the trick for me. I see it as a really cheap excuse to try and please Classic Space fan with that horrendous MM graphics and what amazes me is that you guys loke that :-D Money saved On !! *yoda*	negative

During the annual Thanksgiving Road Trip to the relatives, I stopped by the TRU in Portland, OR. Lo and behold, the new Mars Mission sets! Predictably, I bought them. I present to you: the MX-41 Switch Fighter! Man, what a long name. The box: Standard MM. On the front, it shows the Fighter in flight mode, and a yellow note telling you that it transforms. The back shows three pictures showing it happen. The parts: Once I open the box, the first thing that comes out is a bent and rolled up instruction booklet, and I was forced to put it under a stack of beer books for an hour. Then, there's the DSS. Yes, two of the stickers do feature a cobra. I wonder why, because this set's decal should be a beatle. X-D Decent parts, nothing too special. Then, I noticed this little part. It's used for the flick-missiles, but I have no idea what else it would be used for. :-/ The Build: The alien ship: When I looked at the box art for this set, I was releived to see that the aliens don't have another curved-forward wing ship. Instead, they have this little beauty, which appears to be the Alien Mini Cooper- small and hot. *wub* Anyway, partially completed. Even if you don't like the set, it has some nice green flame peices, which work nicely for space laser swords. Fully completed. The only annoying bit about it is that the crystal-holding thing in front wobbles all over the place. The alien fits into it by way of impalement. It must hurt getting in and out. Switch fighter (cockpit): The set makes good use of the Alpha Team cockpit. For controls, it has a meagre handlebar that the astronaught can't even reach. The rear "shell" of the fighter starts out around the alien containment chamber. It's a bit odd that the containment chamber has an alien sticker, because the instruction booklet lists it as holding crystals. The crystal canister is held back by a technic pin. This is, without a doubt, the ugliest color arrangment EVER. Warning: Mass stickers. :-X The cockpit fits into grooves in the "shell". Then it clicks into place in a 1x1 brick with a horizontal clip. The wing "mechanism": The wing. For some reason, the body of the "mechanism" has a blue brick. *wacko* The wing and "mechanism" connect to prevent the fighter doing a nosedive while in tank mode. The wing "mechanism" completed: The underside: The body and wing connect by way of a miscolored red brick. I have no idea why it's red- black would bave been much, much better. Completed. Tank mode: All in all, this looks pretty neat. The wheel base is pretty short, but it's not bad. Transform! The set transforms neatly, if ungainly. Without "Anti-grav" support, it would fall forward on it's nose each time it transformed. Jet mode. It's all right, but it could be a bit better. The "shell" keeps slipping back forward to the "tank mode" because there's nothing to stop it sliding. Spare parts: Overall: I thought this set was great. It could do with some fixing, such as the mismatched colors, but it should be a definate buy for MM fans. Brickshelf Gallery (When available)	positive
*wub* Thanks for another great review. *sweet* I am also glad that it is a very different alien fighter design as I already have three varients of the old type! The fighter transforms better than I thought it would; I was expecting just the wings. I should be buying this set as well... Mr. Mandalorian, on Nov 26 2007, 03:45 PM, said: Without "Anti-grav" support, it would fall forward on it's nose each time it transformed. Well, since anti-grav doesn't exist, and will never exist, there has to be another option! Looking at it in tank mode it does have a vague aerofoil shape so I think it should be able to work as a lifting body. All it needs to do then is move fast enough to start taking off and then it can extend the wings... 8-|	neutral

Thanks for this fantastic review Hinckley, I can't wait to see the comic! :'-) I REALLY love this mech as I am a fan of non-bipedal mechs (though I am terrible at making them), the purple is great and I can't wait to see what MOCers will use those awesome new spike peices for! 3 robots in one mech is a really good deal too, and that spider droid just adds so much more to the set. And thanks for taking the time to do this! *sweet* Not to sound like a smartypants though, but the grill peice in purple is not the first time this has happened, two were included in the 06 Joker Helicopter ;-) Thanks again! To the Brickmobile! >:-)	positive
Awesome Reveiw thanks for the pics!! Did the instructions come with a comic?	positive
Great review as always, Hinckley. Frankly I'm in love with this thing. So much so, in fact, that I've been calling it 'Shadow Panther' for weeks, but never mind... Anyway, why do I like it? Well, purple is such a fantastic Lego colour- it's sparingly used, which makes it interesting, and it simply looks great. Those jetpack/backpack things the robots are wearing, and if they are jetpacks, as the back of the box suggests, then the use of chaisaws is quite nifty and innovative. The minibot is cool, and certainly an interesting gimmick. Sure, they don't look quite as good in some of the other sets, but here it looks great. The overall structure and design are cool too. It's always nice to see an 'irregular' mech, and this is no exception. It's especially cool whee the spines are concerned. Plus, on top of all that, it's got a nice selection of parts, including some lovely new ones, and the inlaid box is interesting. Well worth getting, I think.	positive
Another fantastic review, Hinckley. I really like this set, I wasn't to keen on it when I first saw the pictures bit having seen the review, I am starting to like it. It seems quite sturdy, and it makes a change from the usual 2 legged mechs. As well as that purple is welcome anywhere, I have such a shortage of that colour! I like the rusty orange colour of the robots, and their back/jet packs are quite cool, and the mini robot looks sweet.	positive

Another great review, Hink! Looks like a great set. Quote The cockpit isn't sealed and is actually aggravatingly unrealistic as it leaves the drivers chest vulnerable to enemy fire. Actually the cockpit lacks any controls as seen here where it looks like Keiken is simply pounding a counter demanding food. :-D "Gimme food! Or else my friend up there willl shoot your punk- @$$ into mars!" Well, I guess that explains why there are no robot snipers in EF. If there were, well.... Wouldn't be much of a story, would there?

Oh, I just *wub* theat mini-bot. Creepy, but strangely cute... Nice piece selection, and the idea of something with rotors that double up as cutters storming (no pun intended) through the jungle ripping it apart is just fantastic (to me, anyway).

Here is my review of the set 6265 Sabre Island! Overview: Sabre Island was release in 1990 an it contained 92 pieces and its retail price was $15.50. It comes with 3 Imperial Blue coats, and a nice outpost for them. The pictures + full review: Anyway, you can see here a picture of the box, the model shown on the box differs from the actual model slightly. ...And the back of the box, which shows some nice alternative models from the pieces provided. A close up of two or three of the alternative models. And now for the minifigs. I prefer the Red coats over the Blue coats but these minifigs are nice, and for the number of pieces one gets a fair amount of them. The set itself makes a nice small outpost, it comes complete with a palm tree, a cannon (with ammo) on a turntable, a small tower a nice large Imperial flag and a little red row boat! Here is a shot from ground level showing the cannon and Blue coat (patrolling the out post!) The rowing boat was a nice touch, and it comes with a small flag too. "No Pirates will avoid the wrath of myself and my mighty Island!" The top of the tower is rather plain and simple which in some ways is good, as it keeps the whole set detailed yet not crowded, but I feel a little something should of been added to the top though. The back is lacking any type of walls, so one can play with the minifigs inside, yet their are also no stairs or any other ways for the Blue Coats to climb up their tower either! The rag tag pirates attack Sabre Island! But never fear, The Lord Of Pies is here! Me throwing a pie at Captain Ironhook from another angle. Overall I think this is a very good, if somewhat simple set, and makes a great cheap Imperial set! Comments, thoughts and Opinions are welcome! (And sorry about the darkness in some photos, I have not had time to take photographs when it is till light recently, for when I return home it is dark |-/ ) Edit: Fixed, Thank you!

LOL! Those Star Wars heiroglyphics are awesome! Were those in the movie? Or is this just a joke by the Lego designers? That would be the first time TLC showed any kind of reference humor! The rest of the set is great too, even the skeleton and the stickers. YES, that's right, I actually like those things. I like the new skellies because of their posability (I'm a big supporter & user of stop-motion) and I think there's nothing wrong with stickers. I mean seriously, why does everybody hate stickers so much??? :-| Sure, they are a pain in the megablocks to put on and, sure, they come off after a while and are never usable again, but hey, you don't have to put them on, even better, you can save them (like I do) and use them for your mocs! Could somebody tell me, please? I'm just curious. However, as I said, nice set! I might even get one. Gotta love that marion with the carot torch X-D and that arc is neat too! By the way, are all parts on it golden? Some more pics on it would be nice as soon as your camera is recharged! ;-) Thanks. Peace Out!	positive

No hovitos? NO! Ah well, if I get more pirate sets next year i'd use the Islanders as hovitos. In the video game they have the same torsos. I'd really like to get this, maybe in June I'll have luck. :'-)	negative
This set is so cool... and another must buy! :-$ I'm in trouble next year it seems... The figs are great! *wub* I think the plane is only OK; perhaps they should have made that in a separate set as it needed to be a certain size to fit the figs, but that meant that the tail is way too short. Here is a picture of the actual plane so you can see what I mean. (Notice the pilot is fishing... ;-) ) The temple is another story; I think Lego have done an incredible job with this, fitting in the key parts of this sequence without making an absurdly large model. Addtionally, there are many parts in this set that I haven't got so it shouldn't be too hard to justify. X-D Thanks for another great review. *sweet* I love the photo of Indy running with the idol and the boulder close behind. :-P Naith, on Dec 16 2007, 10:20 PM, said: lol is it just me or in the earlier concepts of this set we saw a native on the box? i wonder why they removed it :-( *wacko* I recall that too. :-/ EDIT: Yes there was one...

So here it is, the long expected ;-) review of the town plan: I bought it at the Legostore Riem Arcaden last Saturday. I paid 149,99 EUR for 1981 pieces. This set is separated in 4 parts. 1: the Service/Gasstation 2: the cars. the petrol pump and the fountain 3: the cinema 4: the town hall The Service Station has a lot of really nice details, like tools for the car repair, or the table with the cashpoint and the foodstation (there?s a croissant, a banana and a apple in this set). One of my favourit parts is the trolley with some tools, you can see it at brickshelf. At the second part are only a few pieces and i needed not much time to built the 2 cars, the fountain and the petrol pump. There?s something at the truck i don?t understand.. maybe i did something wrong.. but.. the truck has no backlights.. *wacko* I like the petrol pump, that?s why i post a pic of it: The cinema is the highlight for me. It has also really nice details, like the popcorn table or the gumball or candy machine. The colours sheme is really nice, the front of the building with the big displays is a cool idea. Overall a really nice building. The town hall has also a really nice colour sheme, i love that dark green mixed with the white stairs. A lot of plants around and in the town hall. As you can see some figs who married there. Not more to say about this building. See the pics and enjoy it: Overall this set is a must have!! It was really fun to built it. This set reminds me of the Back to the Future movie with Michael J. Fox. The whole gallery is at Brickshelf, there you can find a few more pics. I hope you enjoyed this review.

I enjoyed seeing this review. Nice to get some different angles on the components. Sorry to disagree with anyone however, but this was not a great review. I appreciate the effort Sandra made but a great review would include more details such as what are stickers and what are printed pieces. A great review points out flaws or limitations as well as what works or is really neat. A great review would have analyzed the price per piece and compared that to other sets/themes. One might look at the recent reviews of the Indy sets or the new Spongebob sets as examples of really good reviews. The pictures are good but a great review, above all, should provide the reader with some new information, perhaps even answer questions posed in the pre-release discussion thread. I learned nothing new about the set from this review. That said, it was a good review for someone who had not seen the pre-release discussion and she did a good job of showing said person what they could expect in the set.	positive

First off, this is a truly lovely set that many people should own, even though it's SOLD OUT on the S@H :'-( . now lets start off with an overview. *Note*: I was missing a few of the pieces (the rabbit, the trike) when I toke the pics. The figs and a cat. The engine: I really love this thing. It's a beautiful 0-6-0 steam engine with a tender. This is probably the most detailed steam engine Lego has given us. I loved it so much, I made a non-holiday version for my town. The flat cars: I like these, but they seem a bit simple. Their cargo is good for Christmas or a birthday party. The passenger car: It resembles the green passenger car we got a while back, but I like the interior in this one a bit better. The caboose: a simple caboose like the one from 2001. the sad thing about it is thats there is no interior and it's hard to take the roof off. Overall: I like this set, but it is kind of hard to use during the non winter months. The price is kind of good, but with that price, it should have came with the motor. I give it a 9/10 Happy New Year! Edited by AgentRick57, 04 January 2008 - 12:00 AM.	positive
NO I need it! I lost my rabbit in the great void known as the large old brown box of doom(L.O.B.B.O.D for short)!!!!! *sing* *sing*	neutral
Thanks for the good review, I wish I had bought one when it was going for only ?24.99 on LSAH instead of the usual price of ?50!	positive
I got that set from my grandma on x-mas. She ordered it early. I really like the presesnts and that blue thing. 3 wheeler? Here in america, It's 100$$. Ouch. I like the rabbit. Whats with the rats in the trees and the cargo train? Nice review. Edited by ~VBBN~, 04 January 2008 - 01:31 PM.	positive
I was fortunate enough to get one along with the Hobby Train. They are the first trains I have ever owned (mainly by virtue of them having been half price). It's a fantastic selection of parts with the Holiday Train, as well as it really looking the part as a set. I'm happy not to get a motor; as I think the 9V setup would prove expensive, and the IR control system for the RC setup seems a bit poor. I got some "dead" track for with it to have just as a push train for now.	positive
Hey, Thanks for the review! I think I will definately get this set! DP8 Edited by darthperson8, 05 January 2008 - 03:30 PM.	positive
Sorry Yoda. I think it might of been my problem. :-$ Either way I edited my first post. Dp8	neutral
I totally like this set *wub*! I bought it some days ago ,it looks really nice together with the MTT. And I am going to get the AT-AP today. *sweet* Edited by Stealth Hunter, 05 January 2008 - 04:44 PM.	positive
Wout, on Jan 5 2008, 09:27 PM, said: a druid battle pack would also be a nice idea for the castle sets. May I ask what you paid for this? My first (and second) idea was that 25 euro was a bit to much for this. :-) X-D whatever :-P Bloody typo I say. However, the upcomming Castle Advent calendar might include druids :-P I paid 30? for it ;-) (dang 1 cent more expensive as S@H :-D ) Trudop561, on Jan 5 2008, 11:21 PM, said: They released the battle droid commander in 2000 :-| Yes, another nice tone, meessa so happy !! First, you are very welcome for my review of a set present in your wishlist. Then the Commander you are talking about has a tan body with oreange markings only (check !!) and the commander here has a full YELLOW body like in the Spiderman set Doc Oc's hideout (4856) !! Therefore those 2 Commanders are 2 different MFs. *yoda*	neutral
Yeah finally *yoda* got his SW :-D I got 2 of them after X mas - they are really cool - especially the Spider Droid! 2 of them On! & Happy *yoda* On :-P Edited by aayla-secura, 05 January 2008 - 10:38 PM.	positive
great review very precise. as for the spider droid construction, i have already worked it into a moc: http://www.brickshel...ry.cgi?f=290980 stryker-single gun hydra-seven guns hammer-missile pods. steel...	neutral
Great review, as we've come to expect from *yoda* *y* Nice to see that TLG is finding new and interesting ways to get around the "no minifig only" sets restrictions with Hasbro. Clearly, this is another army builder with a minimal vehicle as we're becoming accustomed to. Heck, even the diminutive Hailfire is technically a droid as well, thus making this all minifigs, from a certain point of view. Only negative: It is a bit overpriced. I'll have a better feel for that when I get one. Treads/links always drive up a price, so it might just be fair. The spiderdroid is a winner, even with the unusual parts assortment. I like it when LEGO thinks of different ways to use things, I think it promotes the same from us. I'm not sure what I think of the new battledroid commanders, but at least I can make extras easily if I need to, as I bought a bunch of yellow droid bodies off Bricklink once, thinking I might want to make some kind of new droid out of them. They were cheap at the time, now I expect the price to go up just because of this potential use. Between those and the grey ones, it's good to see more becoming available. Hopefully we'll see black and a few other colours produced for some nice customizing possibilities. All in all, a nice little set with a great army building potential, especially on a buy-one-get-one-half-off or better type of sale. Until then, I'll grab one or two and be glad to have them.	positive
I got this set for a few months [1 or 2].. And i agree that it is small.. But still.. It looks great on plates, clone troopers [Just for fun..] >:-)	positive
Great review Yoda. Thanks for sharing. I wasn't real fond of the postal truck at first. It's so different than those in the US. But after seeing your close-up images (esp. the back of the tuck), it looks really neat. I also like the mail box a lot. It looks good in red. Too bad for the stickers, but it's still nice. The plane reminds me a lot of the design used in the Jurassic Park set. As you've said, it's similar to 80s designs. I really like the brick-built design too. It's just real Lego - that's about all I can say. Very nice sets that are a must together. Thanks for the review.	positive
Thanks for the review! I was always going to get these two sets, so you haven't swayed me at all!! X-D I reckon Lego could enhance this sub-theme by releasing a post motorbike (with or without a sidecar) and post office. Obviouly the office would be the hub of all the activity, while the post bike would take care of the postal run. This would free up the van to take or recieve bulk mail or parcels to or from the airport. It could then also do the parcel deliveries around the city. The office would also serve as the reciever for all the parcels the new goods truck might deliver. Just some thoughts, that's all!! *sweet*	neutral
I need to do some catching up here :-P Matn, on Jan 5 2008, 05:16 PM, said: Could you tell me how much you payed for them? I think I'm gonna buy them tomorrow if they have it already (or if I don't see any cooler sets). I paid a tad more than the S@H price: I paid 15 for the plane and 8 for the van (sure its a tad more expensive but I didn't want to wait for TRU to get them) Freddie, on Jan 5 2008, 06:10 PM, said: Am I the first one to notice the new doors used in the back of the van. Not only is it using the popular new frame, but the old container doors have been redesigned to fit with the new frame as well. Pity they're not yellow, though. Great remark there, I guess I totally missed that one :-$ And I agree that yellow doors would have been better but those dark bley do not look that bad !! Mr Hobbles, on Jan 5 2008, 09:10 PM, said: Can you tell me though, the wheels on the van, are they rubber or plastic? They look a bit tacky... Rubber off course ;-) They do look a tad tacky but its because they are the thin type (like with the racers) and I am not a fan of those |-/ phoinix, on Jan 5 2008, 09:35 PM, said: cant wait for your next one Tks ;-) Me neither though :-P marvinblue, on Jan 6 2008, 03:31 AM, said: I reckon Lego could enhance this sub-theme by releasing a post motorbike (with or without a sidecar) and post office.

At one point I was thinking of a impulse set with a yellow bike, postman, post and letters (that would rock !!). I hope TLC adds to this sub theme and keeps that retro feel *wub* A yellow dirtbike with sidecar would be a sweet 5? set !! Also a small town feel post office would be so cool: like a 20/30? set ;-) We can be sure of one thing though, this year's advent calendar will have a postamn and small post office ;-) Post On !! *yoda*	neutral
While the plane does look nice, I don't particularly care for the van. But the van does have some good parts, which is the only reason I would by one: yellow mud guards, the new windshield, and the small door on the rear.	neutral
Well first off, thanks yoda for the great review. :-) Hmmm... Well, i have to say, i'm not at all impressed with any of these sets. I mean, there nice and all, but the van just seems way to small. It would have been nice if you could fit more than one package in it. I guessi'm one of those that are more of the fan of the 6 wide trucks. And the plane.... Hm. this has a "cute" factor and all, but i mean com'on... You have to open a hatch on the roof to get your packages in?? And what about getting them out? You have to flip the plane upside down? :-| Weak. They should have had a hinged rear end or a hatch on the side.	negative

I guessi'm one of those that are more of the fan of the 6 wide trucks. I see your point that more cargo capacity would have been better. Nevertheless, my personal preference is for smaller "classic" scale City sets. The mail van is nice and small, and should fit well with my road plates and 1990s cars from the 4561 train. On a side note, did anyone notice the message on the back of both sets' boxes, "designed for easy building and instant play"? It surprised me a little, since these sets seem no less complex than any other City set of late. They look like quick builds, sure, but not as though the designers went out of their way to simplify them.	positive

Beach House Reviewed by Dunamis Set 4996 522 Pieces $29.95 from Target Build time 90 minutes Yet another interesting Creator theme house. This one comes fresh of the 2008 line of sets and promises 3 different models. Packing 522 pieces (albeit a lot of 1x1 plates) for only $29.95 it was hard to pass this one by as I was foraging for the new 2008 Star Wars sets at the local Target. Plus, I was itching to do another review since I had finally fully recovered from my marathon UCS Falcon review which took the better part a month to complete. The Box: The box is pretty standard Creator type box which shows off the three models (beach house, Caf? and ?towering? apartment building.) The back of the box shows some of the features of the three models. Interesting features of the three models prominently displayed on the back include: - Food counter complete with coffee (espresso) maker and food warmer (with chicken leg!) - Home office complete with laptop (and the ubiquitous coffee cup.) - Flip up roof granting access inside of beach house. Note the satellite TV dish and even rain gutters along the roofline! Opening the box is a matter of breaking two seals. We?re back to the reusable cereal box type tab system that we saw so often in 2007 sets. Note the parts inventory is on the side of the box as well. This is a nice feature. Once inside the box, we are greeted by eight sealed bags plus two yellow 16x2 plates and a green 32x16 baseplate. Thank goodness there is no DSS (dreaded sticker sheet) but alas there are no minifigs. In addition, there are the three manuals (one for each model) and they were stuffed into my box with the care of kid trying to put 10 gallons (or liters if you prefer) of candy in a 5 gallon bucket. But hey, we?re not collecting manuals here so who cares if the manuals are all bent and warped? The Manuals: The three manuals are 74, 72 and 48 pages in length. They are laid out well and are pretty standard with all the usual trimmings: - Piece call outs for each step - Parts inventory at the end of the primary model build - Page numbers Color separation in these manuals were fine for me. Plus, we get the usual verbose LEGO instructions on not dumping all your pieces outside in the grass and not to dump all your pieces into a single pile. Thanks for the tip, TLG! Parts list The Pieces: Pretty standard stuff here and as I mentioned, lots of 1x1 plates and tiles (at least 100.) However, we do get quite a few windows and a couple of doors. A majority of the color is black and yellow. I did see a few pieces that I was not familiar with so I?m going to show them below. Keep in mind I?m not a parts jockey so bear with me if I think a part is brand new for 2008 and it was actually released with the classic space line. 2x2 Window (fixed) and 4x3 window that opens: The follow photo shows the window glass (same as in Corner Caf?), door glass and new black parts. Turns out these black parts are used as wheels. I showed the window glass because it still contains the molding circle just like they did before. It is hard to see from the photo, but it is there. The door glass I think might be new: I don?t recall seeing these 2x2 round plates with clips before and I thought I would show the mail only because it is printed and not a sticker: I know these are common, but didn?t they have four studs on top? These only have two: How about this sloped 4x3 window that opens: Overall a nice assortment of parts with nothing juniorized. The Build: The build was fun and was fairly straightforward. Once you figure out which of the three models to build, it goes pretty quick. Here are a few shots: See how the inside is made: Look at the detail with the flowers and even the outside water faucet! Outdoor seating area: Upstairs being built: Upstairs with opening roof (notice the satellite TV dish): Check out the patio on the upstairs complete with outdoor light and rain gutters! Here?s my favorite, the BBQ grill. At least we know where those new parts go: Finally, check out the tree. No juniorization here! Here is what is left over: So far, I have only built the primary model. The others look interesting, especially the caf?. The Design: The design was well done. Very rich in detail. I love how there are no juniorized parts. The house is accessible by taking off the top floor (like Caf? Corner and Market Street). There is an internal staircase as well. There is no interior to speak of in the beach house, but there is in the other two models. The only real negative is that it is kind of small when you get it done. It would be nice if it was about 50% bigger. Here are a few views of the beach house with a few minifigs thrown in: Check out the close-up of the caf? which I think looks great: Also, here is a photo of the interior of the apartment building where you can see the office and computer: Overall Thoughts: It is a really nice set. A tad on the small side but it has some great detail and lots of features. Quick enough to build all three models and would fit real nice into an existing town plan. Is minifig scale, but does not come with any. Lots of window parts and black slopes. Is a nice diversion from the onslaught of Clone Wars ships that we can?t remember seeing from the movies. Final Rating: 84% Build 9/10 (Pretty quick and fun.) Functionality 9/10 (It is a Creator set so you have multiple varied builds. Diverse enough to keep the kids entertained.) Design 10/10 (Excellent and well thought out. Outstanding detail for such a small model.) Parts 6/10 (Fair, nothing earth-shattering but lots of slopes and windows.) Price 8/10 (Price ratio is good but you get a lot of little parts. Would be better with minifigs.) Edited by WhiteFang, 23 May 2009 - 06:38 PM. Indexed	positive
Nice set and review. What I really like is that this set gives You a lot of ideas for Your own houses (MOCs)? KimT	positive
Love this set now more than ever. *wub* I knew I wanted it from the first leaked boxshots, especially with my love of yellow buildings (just ask Hinckley ;-) ). Great review, especially nice to see the closeup parts shots. Those new 2x2 white windows are very much like replacements for the classic 2x2 windows TLG stopped regularly making a while back, so it's great to see them. The wheels are trolley wheels, common in sets including stretchers and handcarts. The holder for them is a fairly recent part I think. I remember a couple coming in a little single minifig jet engine repair set I picked up in a S@H order within the last year. Oh honey, be sure to wrench that chicken before it burns! *wacko* Thanks for another excellent review of a set I'm even more excited about than before! *y*	positive
Thank you for the nice review with many pictures. *y* :-D I already wanted this set, but the pictures make it I want even much/more.	positive

Nice review, very detailed. *y* As for the spare parts, mine didn't come with any. Both dark grey 1x1 round plates are used on the weapons rack (one for the armour, one for the helmet) and I only got one robot hand for holding weapons.	positive

Thanks for this excellent review Vader! It seems you are succumbing to the Castle side of the force. I love the new helmet, and the new Orc torso is fantastic as well, which is great to see that the Troll Faction has many ranks too. The Troll himself I love, I agree with you in saying I prefer the sand green version. The battle wagon is cool, one of the better wagon designs, and the flag is a great touch which improves it. Sadly the back is rather empty, but a few mods'll change that :-) And of course this set includes the infamous chicken pole! One pic request, if you have time Vader, could you please post a few pics of the new helmet on its own, and on a human soldier please? Batbrick is Back! >:-)	positive
Thanks for the review *vader*! The first picture of the troll is great, the gold armour really shines!

You are an excellent reviewer iamded Redman, your pictures show all the details included in the set and your thoughts bring new light to features and bits I hadn't noticed or thought about before *y* I love this little set, I will get two I reckon, because I want all the Wizard bits in a minifig box as well. Nice little humorous pic at the end too. One improvement I think could be to include the pics of the back of the box and other side of the instructions anyway. Honestly, there isn't much to improve, you are an excellent reviewer :-) Redman ON! Batbrick is Back! >:-) Thanks Batbrick! :-D I sometimes flick from the minifig view of things to a person's view of things, but no one seems to notice, so it's okay. X-D And I didn't include pics of the back of the instructions and box because they were included in some one else's Knight review, and there's no change. But I will include them in future, in case someone hasn't seen any of the other reviews of the set I'm reviewing.

I look forward to more of your reviews :-) I just went to Toyworld today and got a wizard and 4 knights :-) And on top of that, they were having a 20% off sale *sweet* I might go back and get some more tommorrow. Thanks! 20% off, what a bonus! If only Toyworld's sales were nation-wide. :-D I wish I were in Wellington, the guy at the Toyworld their is really cool, and into Lego to!

Howdy how , my Batman fellows! Today i was in a toy mart - and i was looking for a SW set - but all were that expensive! Then i saw this Batman set ! FOR -> 13 ? Yea ! 13 Euros! :-P I had to pick it up! As i came home i started building! Figs: I really like them both cause they are new to me ! The green dude X-D looks cool! Batman is also very cool! Building it : FIrst there was this speeder boat from this green dude :-P , it looks really cool and these Shark eyes ( or what are that) look also really nice! Then there came Batmans speeder boat - its a nice little ship! Then the boat : its really cool the simple makes it that good ! At the end i got that : Ranking : Figs 10/10 Parts : 8 /10 Playablity :8/10 Price 10/10 -> 13 Euros there .. thats a good price! Overall ranking of aayla : I think i got Batman feever - am guessing wich set i pick up at next .. any ideas wich is good - or wich you can say me .. was good is good?! Batman collection deffinitly ON!!! Aayla	positive
Thank you for your wonderful review! ) I was done very well.... ) I suggest that you will find "Two-Face's Escape" set a very interesting one to build.... It also provides great playability and is not very expensive for what you will get. ) Good day to you. )	positive
It is a tie between Two Face's escape and the batcave... but I would go with the cave... over 1000 pieces, nifty submarine, penguins, alfred, mr freeze, and and and.... it is wonderful...! especially for 38?!! :-) ol' style Batman ON! (yep, this is a lil' rant on 2008 batman.. :-P )	positive
6258 Smuggler's Shanty Overview Smuggler's Shanty was released in 1992, it consisted of 69 pieces, 3 minifigs (two pirates, one Imperial) and it cost $9.25 (USD). The set itself is a small but rather sturdy den for the pirates! Review: The minifigs consist of two pirates and one Imperial. The minifigs are not all that rare, which is disappointing, I would of liked a rarer fig! But still it is a good cheap source of pirate and Imperial figures. Here is an overall shot of the set, which includes the three figs, the shanty which is made using palm leaves pieces, and a nice grey shark nibbling at the soldier's oar. A close up of the soldier rowing hard in his boat. I would have preferred to have a normal soldier with shako hat, as I have more officers than normal soldiers now!: And a close up snap of the main structure. Note the wine glass, which was a nice touch! Funnily enough, only 4 pieces of treasure were included in this set, compared to the usual 8 gold coins in other sets. A view from the back, which also gives a good view of the pieces used to construct the shanty mainly simple black 1 by 1 bricks: The Shanty looks good from most angles but their are a few where the roof construction looks rather odd, but that is just a minor nitpick! Yet another view from the front,, this time at a slightly different angle. The yellow base plate looks rather nice too, I prefer it over the tan pieces we trend to get nowadays: "Attack!!" The Stupid drunk pirate in the background does not even notice! Overall I think this is a rather good set, despite some shortcomings, such as the lack of treasure and odd roof from some angles. The shark, Imperial soldier and useful parts make up for it, and of course the price is cheap on most auction sites, I got mine for a mere ?5 ($10), with the cheapest price on Bricklink being $8. Rate the set then leave your comments, thoughts and opinions!!!	positive
I'd give the set a 3 1/2 out of 5. It needed 1 more Imperial to get a 4. A bigger basplate would have been nice as it appears to hard to fit all the minifigs on the island. Thanks for this great review	neutral
Laurinator- I don't mind an occassional old review coming back to life for discussion, but it seems you've replied to many old reviews that have been stagnant for years. Please try to refrain from "bumping" a lot of old topics as it pushes down new content that should really be the focus of discussion now.	neutral
Hi guys. I picked these up the other day, but it's taken me this long to get round to posting the reviews. So, here we go: Tub comparison with a minfig (thanks Brainbox): The lighting changes a bit throughout the photographs, as it was going dark outside, so I only really had my desk light, and I kept getting in the way. 4837 Mini Trains Now the box I really like. It's no different to those of last year's sets, but the colour here is simply fantastic, and really seems appropriate for the theme. So this is what you get inside. All the pieces are still inside the bag, the optical illusion was accidental :-D . No pieces of particular outstanding interest, but the dark green cheese slopes are rather nice. Look out for those later. 1 2 3 This is the main model, and uses all the pieces in the set (bar these two, which according to the inventory are spares, but as with all my other Creator sets, I'm cheating and leaving them in). This is far and away the best model of the three, and evokes the iconic version of a steam train. The green looks superb, but I'm not sure whether that's due to the model itself or the actual colour. Moving on, we get to the second model: 1 Leftovers (yes, I admit, I was using a piece of paper) This isn't actually a bad model. I don't think it's quite as nice as the previous one, but it's not bad. It's different from the first model as well, which is good. Too muich of the same can be a bad thing. Finally, we come to the third model: Leftovers Now... I'll be honest. I don't really know what this is. It's not that good a model compared to the other two. That's all I can say, really. And of course, all the pieces fit into the tub. Overall: I have to say, I do like this set, despite the weak third model. The strength of the primary and secondary models make up for any weaknesses in the third, and I can imagine the pieces being fully usuable in building other trains. While the basic idea of these tubs isn't quite as good as the X-Pods with regards portability and general 'niceness' they aren't bad. And for a fairly cheap price (?3-4) as well. 4838 Mini Vehicles This is one of those set boxes that you see because of the ridiculously loud colours. Sound marketing scheme if you ask me. I've managed it again. There are pieces outside the bag. Or are there? Now these I like *y* . 1 2 (I don't know what the clip is for, there isn't one on the other side) 3 4 5 This is the main model of the set, and again all the pieces are used bar these three, the spares. It's quite a nice model, although the car's a bit odd. Still, I like the ramps, and the colour scheme reminds me just a little of G1 Ultra Magnus. Hmm, I think that boom arm could do with refixing... 1 2 Leftovers This is actually quite nice as well. It's that classic breakdown truck, and the boom arm itself is quite nice, with quite a bit of movement. Another solid model. 1 Leftovers I'm surprised by the amount of detail here actually. Not only have TLC included a spare wheel at the back, but also what looks like a trailer hitch, which all adds to the 'realism.' Another nice model to round out a nice set. And in the tub. Overall: I'm not sure which of the two I like better. When I bought them, and on the way home, I much preferred the train set. But after building this set, I'm not sure. This is another good set from the year when TLC seems to be giving us so many. There are some good pieces in here too, and while there's nothing unique, they're still good. So, thanks for reading, hope it helped someone, and if there are any requests, I'll see what I can do. That's requests for pics, not songs ;-) . Edited by WhiteFang, 23 May 2009 - 06:56 PM.

Tks for that nice review, brainbox! I recieved the construction diggers set like this last year. Gee what a nice parts pack. I like that orange lidded set, the truck. So nice. I won't get it though.	positive
Thanks for the review Brainbox. *sweet* These look really nifty* I might pick up a couple of these as for the parts, I'm sure they could come in handy for something. And so cheap as well. I still miss X-pods though. :'-( *Do the kids still say nifty these days? *wacko*	neutral
Thanks for that very fine review, Brainbox! *y* Lovely little Creator goodies, with very neat alternative models as well. :'-)	neutral
Brainbox, on Feb 20 2008, 02:55 PM, said: You're welcome guys. :-D Sorry, that just made me laugh. I did some research and re-read tyour review. I will pick this up this weekend. Quote Yeah, so do I. They really were a neat idea. I had all the x-pods. They were awesome. I haven' collected all of these though.	positive
Mmmmh, I *wub* love the train... Great review. It looks like each model can be connected to the other to make a complete train. *y* *y* It makes me want to get 3 of them (or more) to make a long one. :-D	neutral
Thanks for these fantastic review. It's the first time I take a good look at these sets. There is a good chance I'll buy the Dwarf's Mine Defender, especially for that price.	neutral
This set didn't come with the new jail door piece? I'd have guessed it would have, since there is an orc in prison. Nice review. I'm looking forward to picking up these sets. Steve	neutral
Thank you for these fine reviews, metalandi. *y* There?re really some nice playable features in the Tower raid set, and all these great Orc torsos, just sweet! And it even looks like that black Orc-armor?s a new piece, lovely.... :'-)	positive
Cheers for the reviews. They're both nice sets, and I think I just may have to buy both. Or maybe I'll get two of the dwarf set? The figs in each are really cool as well. The dwarf, well, they're just cool anyway, but the troll with the golden helmet and armour, that's just *wub*	positive
Thanks for the review, I personally think the siege tower is probably the best one which Lego has ever produced.	positive
*sweet* WOW!! Another excellent review! Haha, that tower does reminds me of KK II of Mistland Tower =x Well, overall, i love these 2 sets very very much *sweet*	positive
I got myself today 3 Dwarf's Mine Defender and I have to say that sets does suck big time: the plastic rubber band doesn't do squat, and 3 wheels i really not enough. I only built 2 of those and changed the front of it with 4 wheels and no plastic rubber band and I changed the 2x2 dark bley plate. Its still looks good but the crappy rubber band system is really not well thought off. Anyhow my Orc army is growing >:-) *yoda*	negative
xwingyoda, on Mar 1 2008, 06:32 AM, said: Its still looks good but the crappy rubber band system is really not well thought off. *yoda* i totally agreed with your comments. The rubber system is not effective at all. I bought 2 defenders recently and i found out that when the wheels move, the rubber just stuck there without rotating the blades at the front :-/ I have not really found a solution for mine yet. So far, i only took out the rubber band, placing the blades on the ground, removing of the red technic part on the left side. In this way, when the defender is moving on smooth ground, the blades will move too ;-)	negative
Green Grocer Reviewed by Dunamis Set 10185 2,352 Pieces $149.95 from The LEGO Store (Glendale, CA) Build time 6.5 hours Holy guacamole! Almost exactly one year after Caf? Corner was released we get the third installment in the increasingly popular LEGO exclusive town series. Combined with the famous 10182 Caf? Corner and its trusty companion 10190 Market Street this trio makes the foundation for an amazing city block of LEGO goodness. For those new to this series of sets, check out my reviews of the two previous sets in this line: Cafe Corner Market Street I would not necessarily recommend reading too many of my reviews in one setting as you might experience loss of brain cells and/or drowsiness. You have been warned. So, how does Green Grocer stack up to the two previous sets you ask? Well, follow along kind reader and I shall attempt to unravel this question. The Box: The gigantic box is pretty standard and looks amazingly similar to the Caf? Corner box. The back of the box shows some of the features of the green grocer as well as a lot of the cool interior that was absent from the previous sets. In addition, we are shown an image of the three sets together and a small insert image showing how they connect together (as if we could not master that difficult maneuver?) Opening the box is a matter of breaking two seals. As it seems to be the norm now, we have the reusable cereal box type tab system that we saw so often in 2007 sets. However, upon opening the tabs we are pleasantly surprised to find a cardboard tray! Have not seen one of those in a while. As you can see in the photo, we have two 32x16 green base plates, three instruction manuals and a bunch of bags that are broken into four groups: Group 1 has 12 bags and goes with the first manual and builds the first floor. Group 2 has 9 bags and goes with the second manual to build the second floor. Group 3 has 14 bags and goes with the third manual for the top floor and roof. And one bag that is not numbered and hence you can open it whenever you feel like it. There are no stickers ? Yay! Moving right along, we get to the three instruction manuals. The Manuals: The three manuals are 55, 47 and 47 pages in length. They are laid out well and are pretty standard with all the usual trimmings: - Piece call outs for each step - Parts inventory at the end of the second manual - Page numbers Color separation in these manuals was fine for me except dark bley and black. We get a nice photo of all three sets together: Plus, we get a nice tip showing how to split up the bags and what goes where. Those additional pieces you see in the photo just below the numbered bags are the pieces that come from the single un-numbered bag (along with the base plates). Parts list Random manual shot The Pieces: Upon opening the first set of bags, one thing is clear; there are a TON of little tiny pieces! The minifigs are included in this first section as well. Interesting to note that there are a handful of printed pieces and as I mentioned previously, no stickers. We also get a host of new and exciting pieces to add to our collection. Keep in mind my scope of LEGO sets is generally centered around Star Wars, Technic, Creator and the occasional racer set so what is new to me might have been around 15 years. At any rate, here are some of the more interesting pieces: Again, note the printed tiles. This time around, LEGO has decided to include 33% more minifigs than the Caf? Corner and Market Street sets. Yes, we get four minifigs instead of three! Here are the cast of characters: Pictured (left to right) is Sir Top Hat, Miss Jenny Blue Overalls, Patti O? Furniture and little Timmy Cub Scout. I?ll leave it up to the minifig aficionados to decipher which torsos are new and to tell us all about the hairpieces. I can say with reasonable certainty that the four yellow smiley heads are not new (somebody check that?) Don?t forget the lovable little cat named ?Tom?. He is the arch-rival of the mouse ?Jerry? that lives downstairs: Overall, there are a lot of pieces, large variety and wide range of colors. The Build: If you have either of the two previous sets, you will feel right at home here. Just like in the previous builds, it seems like the first ten build steps are consumed with laying a bunch of 1x1, 1x2 and 2x2 tiles everywhere. Almost feels like 30% of the pieces are used up right away (see below). There are several sections where you build various parts of the interior. Take a look at the cash register/counter below: And the beverage cooler: And the produce stand and everything that goes in it: Looks like someone has mail: Looks like someone just had a baby: This set is incredibly well done and gives inspiration to go back and add similar items to Caf? Corner and Market Street. As before, the average builder is introduced to some new building techniques like using the hinge plates to make the angles on the front of the building as shown below: Also the top of the roof shows some interesting ideas: Overall, it is a really fun build that kept me entertained the whole way. The Design: This is a great set with lots of little details. I especially like the little mouse hole in the wall leading to the Jerry the mouse?s area. They even included a little slice of cheese! It seems the designers can?t get away from the ?usual? staircase which I always feel is way too big. Maybe future designs can incorporate a spiral staircase to save room for other things in the model. One welcome addition is the fire escape as seen below: I?m going to show a bunch of examples of various items in the set so you can get the feel of the amazing detail in this design. Take a look at the lamps (torches?) just outside the door: And the streetlight with fire hydrant: Brickwork and archway: Awning: Here is the back side of the building. Note the trashcans and yard tools: Here is a close-up of the railings on the second story balcony and the second photo is the finished product with curtains in the window. Nice use of cups to make the banister on the second floor: Here is the fireplace on the second floor: Second floor staircase with Tom?s hiding spot: Check out the radiator on the third floor: More third floor: Nice grandfather clock and rug (third floor) Check out the deck that is up on the roof. Complete with two chairs, table, umbrella, flower pots and grill: Interesting use of minifig hammers on the roof: Finally, here is what is left over when we?re done: A couple of shots of the front: A shot of the back: And here are all three together: Overall Thoughts: This is an incredible set and the best of the three in my opinion. It is hard to top Caf? Corner but I believe Green Grocer just did. I absolutely love all the details and building techniques that went into making this set. There is a ton of different parts and wide color selection. As usual, we get a bunch of tiles and small plates, but that goes with the series. Also, we get four minifigs and lots of minifig accessories. I?m giving this set a score of 100%! I thought about it and I really don?t know how they could have made it any better. In short, RUN don?t walk to go pick this set up! Final Rating: 100% Build 10/10 (Excellent - Lots of nice interiors, details and accessories to build.) Functionality 10/10 (Outstanding. Raises the bar with interior and detail. Think Caf? Corner on steroids.) Design 10/10 (Excellent ? can?t say enough good things about it.) Parts 10/10 (Great selection and diverse colors. Great minifigs.) Price 10/10 (Price ratio is excellent but lots and lots of little parts. Well worth the price.) As alway, feel free to comment, complain and question what you see here. I'd like to hear your feedback on this amazing set.	positive
Wow! That's a great review I'm glad you took so many pictures, this set is far better than I ever expected it to be, the detail inside is great. Is it the first set you'e given 100% to?	positive
A great reveiw dunamis *y* . You have only backed up what i thought when the pictures first appeared, if you are a lego fan there is no excuse not to buy this set. It is a must have! I love the mouse hole and the mouse and his cheese *wub* .	positive

Great review. Thanks for taking the time to do this. This has been a great line. At the risk of abandoning my Castle/Adventurer loyalties. I've got to say this is rapidly becoming my favorite line and this set looks to be the best of the lot. While it still hurts to shell out $150, I think I'll still be happy to do so. Steve	positive
Thank you sooo much for this amazing review Dunamis! i absolutly adore this set and you've review has prompted me to certainetly start saving! (i have a bit left over form christmas that will come in handy! :-D ) I love the little fridge downstairs, the fire escape and the mouse hole, alot more good ideas that we can all use in creating our own buildings! This line is by far my favorite lego line ever! (yes even beats starwars, but only just ;-) ) Hooray for Dunamis! X-D	positive
I?ve got something, I want to share with you. A beautiful dream came true: #1: the box: Top: Back: the alternate model is also very well done. The pneumatics dump the bucket and open the flap (?). Open: you can see a diagram how the pneumatics work. Just a happy kid playing. The plastic inlays (?): All: #2: the parts: As you can see, 8854 offers a very large variety of different parts. Loads of Technic bricks, gears and even plates. Also note the threaded axle 10, 5 large pulleys, a big turntable and the 1x20 Rack. #3: building: The mechanism for the outriggers and the rotation of the turntable: The turntable: The pneumatics are finished: The mechanism for the telescope: The finished model: #4 random shots: You can see how the turntable will be rotated. Thanks for reading- erm? viewing the pictures! Please comment if you want to!	positive
Really cool set! This has convinced me that I really want it!	positive
Great pictures, especially the perspective from overhead. This is one of my favorite Technic models because it packs so many features in a relatively small space. And I'm working on documenting this one in Technicopedia right now! Thanks for the photos, Eric	positive
simonwillems, on Mar 10 2008, 01:32 PM, said: That threaded axle never stopped intriguing me... It was use in so few sets (I believe 8851 contained one as well?) and I still don't know why it's better than any other axle. The purpose of the threaded axle is to carry tension. Regular axles are used primarily for carrying torsion (for gears), sometimes for compression (8855 landing gear, helicopter skids), and sometimes just for looks (roll cages, canopies). But used in tension, connectors will usually just pop off. With the threads and the corresponding nuts, this part can be used to squeeze parts together (like the pen in the plotter of 8094), or to hold heavy assemblies onto turntables (like 8862 and 8851). With the power crane (8854) reviewed here, that is the complete list of sets which used this part. I wrote about it here: http://www.ericalbre...1984.html#Parts Eric	neutral
Blakbird, on Mar 10 2008, 09:45 PM, said: I wrote about it here: http://www.ericalbre...1984.html#Parts Eric Thanks for that information, it opened my eyes as to the function of the threaded axle! :-)	neutral

Thanks for reviewing this classic set. I got it when it first came out and still love it: the suspension, steering and robust look of the model haven't been done that well ever since. This set puzzled me though, back in the days. The rear suspending part containing the differential and some gears was shown different on the box from the instructions. In the instructions it showed that the (grey part of the suspension) in the back had to be made using a 1x2 smooth tile and 4 cornerplates (2x2) in grey. The box however showed a much sturdier solution using a 1x8 tile and a 1x8 plate. It is also visible on the cover of the instructions. The pieces I mean are in this picture: BerndDasBrot, on Mar 9 2008, 07:05 PM, said: Otherwise, great set!	positive
I've seen a few cases like this where the box pictures are slightly different from the actual model. The Airtech Claw Rig compressor is another one that comes to mind. The changes sometimes seem pointless and make you wonder why they bothered. :-P Quote the only original stickers are the front headlight-patterns on the 2 red 1x2 bricks. The others have been destroyed - must have been the bad decaying sticker quality that breaks when you'll remove it - so I printed them. I didn't print the flag for only the alternate model needs it, although it's a neat idea...! The other stickers on mine have held up pretty well, although I didn't try to remove them after I put them on. The flag started to break after a year or so and just fell off its axle at one point. I taped over it and it's holding up well now, although it's a little frayed along one edge. This is actually the earliest set I've seen that uses this crappy sticker material (which is unfortunately very common today). Even other Technic sets had good stickers for many years after that.	negative
I read blackbirds technopedia page on this truck the other week, went onto ebay and picked up a MISB copy for £25 GBP Bargin, great to get old sets unopened, peeling the plastic off of the specialist parts was always cool! Love the front suspension	positive
That price is exceptional. It's less than what I paid for mine 9 years ago, and is even less than the original price of the set. Note that the stickers in this set are the bad variety that will crack and peel over time. If you want to preserve them (the Technic flag in particular), you will need to tape over it.	neutral
Somehow I also managed to get this set in very good condition (including box, instructions and all stickers) for a mere €22 a few months ago. This is indeed a very special set, and was a pleasure to build. The only flaw I noticed was weak support of the rear drivetrain, which was easily corrected with a few extra plates.	positive
A nice review, well done! *y* The set itself doesn?t look quite interesting to me, compared with some of the newer ones like 7647 or 7648.... the way the driver fits into the cockpit looks not very clever and pretty uncomfortable as well.... X-D	negative
My friend has this set and the alien ship's wings are wobbly and overall :-X He may have built it wrong, I'm not sure, I didn't see the build. Anyways, nice review! *y*	negative
A great review for a great set. *sweet* I too own it and it's still in one piece. ;-) Kliq, on Mar 13 2008, 05:20 AM, said: The only negative for me is the cockpit of the mining unit. Not really because it isn't detailed, but because mine is top heavy, and keeps falling forward.

Finally, after a very frustrating incident with the Internet Explorer 7's 'Back' button, I present to you my very first review. This is a review of set 8158 Speed Racer Vs Snake Oiler, it's also the first review of a Speed Racer set on EuroBricks. Also you should know that I didn't put the stickers on as they can be quite valuable later on down the road, so I'm sorry for the lack of stickers. :-$ So without further ado I present to you my first review. He He, that rhymes. :-D EDIT: I just finished resizing the pics and uploading them to BrickShelf after having a heated argument about when my bedtime is with my mother. So, I will be doing a complete redo of the picture portion of my review of set 8158. I'm going to work on that as soon as I finish typing this message... EDIT 2: Review fully redone now, *sighs*, that took forever. EDIT 3: Almost forgot to put in a new link to its BrickShelf folder. This is V.2 of my review of set 8158, enjoy... Theme: Speed Racer Set:8158 Speed Racer Vs Snake Oiler Price: $19.99US Pieces: 242 Minifigs: 2 First off pics of the Box, Instructions, DSS, Minifigs, and New Parts: There are so many stickers they had to number them! X-O SO's sunglasses are chrome Gold. 8-? Close-up of the hemets. New parts include, First System Lego hubcap, new more curvy fenders, curved windshield, and a S-shaped connector piece. Now onto the Build, First Speed Racer's Mach 5: Back part of the car. The cockpit of the car. They connect with the new S-shaped piece. Front part of the car. Front and cockpit also connected using the new S-shaped piece. Side view of the car, so far. Underside of the car, so far. Adding more detail. Ground level front view of the car. Side view with added detail. Underside with newly added axles. Demonstrating how the new hubcaps are put on. Now on to building Snake Oilers Orange-ilicious racer: Back part of the car. The cockpit of the car. They are connected using the S-shaped piece. Front part of the car with seemingly random color choices. *wacko* The front and cockpit are also connected using the new S-shaped piece. Adding Orange-irific fenders. Side view of the car so far. Adding more detail. Smoothing things over. Ground level view with Lime Green "eyes" and white "fangs". Side view with more detail. Rearword view of the car with newly added cuve-acious windshield. No hubcaps!?! :-| Now onto finished views of both cars, First the Mach 5: Side view with sweet hubcaps. Up close and personal with the Mach 5. A rearend shot. "I got hubcaps, I got hubcaps!", Speed racer. Now SO's Snake Racer, yes thats what I'm calling it. :-P :-D Beautiful! Blurry, :-$ rearend pic. "Watchout it bites!", Snake Oiler He's ready to take on SR, Hubcaps or no hubcaps! >:-) Racin'! Now for some comparison shots: Hope you all like V.2 better then V.1, I know I liked it better. X-D Seriously though I even learned a thing or two doin' this last version. ;-) Now it's time for my summary: Overall a very well designed and executed set. It's only downfalls are that there are way too many stickers, 32 to be exact, :-| and there are no cool contraptions on the cars to take out the other racer. A great buy for $19.99, I reccomend this set to everybody because of the reasons I staed above and because even I, who is not a big fan of Speed Racer, X-O was drawn to this spectacular little set. Price: 10/10 Pieces: 8/10 Too many stickers. Minifigs: 9/10 Needed some accessories. Playability: 8/10 Needs some cool contraptions on the cars to take out the other racer. Overall: 35/40 General Tarful Edited by imperialshadows, 01 June 2008 - 12:07 PM.	positive
You're wrong. Lego has made a hubcap before! Here it is: Look at the wheels (click).	neutral
I'm sorry, but your review has only served to further enlighten me that these sets are a pile of cack! Absolutely lazy design and the only reason I'd get one is for the windscreen so I can build a proper landspeeder from Star Wars... M.	negative
The more I see these sets the more I want them... but I fear a $40 AUD pricetag... :-/ GeneralTarful, on Mar 23 2008, 03:44 PM, said: Sorry Hinkley, I keep forgetting that everyones computers are as fast as mine. X-D I'm resizing them all right now. :-$ Oh my computer is fast enough, but even fast internet in Australia is slow. :-| Thanks very much for going to the huge effort of re-uploading the pictures. *sweet* Matn, on Mar 23 2008, 09:39 PM, said: But that 'S'-shaped thingy does already exist, doesn't it? Yes, I have a few of them. Great pieces too! *wub*	positive
Sinner, on Mar 23 2008, 11:55 AM, said: Yes, I have a few of them. Great pieces too! I don't think I've seen them in a set for years though. It's good to see them back. But... 32 stickers? That's more than any of the first wave of EF ever had! Still, the set itself is very nice, with some nifty new pieces, and the minifigs are pretty cool too. I may not be familiar with Speed Racer, but I still may get this. I'll go and see the film as well, to fill in the background (of the set).	positive
Yay, finally! Thanks for the great review. It confirmed that I am most definately getting these *wub* The orange racer is absolutley beautiful! Once again, awesome review! *sweet*	positive
As I said elsewhere I couldn't see this reviewed anywhere so here you are! To start with, a couple of box shots: The contents and the parts laid out: The instructions: This is what was left over from the build: And here's the kit complete. Build time, about ten seconds if you pick your nose whilst you are doing it. :-D I love the little robot, it reminds me of that weird machine in the first Wallace and Gromit adventure, in fact, give it some skis and you are away. Oh, and it has a metal detector thingy which I might have to borrow for a future episode of Grunts (I'm not sure if I have any already...who knows...) Cost - £2.49. Value for money? Erm, no, knock a quid off and I'd say yes. Dr. S.	positive
I want that set so badly. I went to a LEGO store last weekend and they only had the fire and police ones. :'-( I want it for the metal detector. Serious whackin' instrument >:-) .	positive

I don't even see why you reviewed this set... it didn't tell us anything that isn't perceivable from the box, being so simple. Though I do appreciate the effort.	negative
As I mentioned elsewhere, I couldn't see a review for this and though it's only small, let's strive for completion! Here's the box: The contents: The parts: Leftover bits: And the set: Not much to it I know, and not much of a review, but there you go...quite a lot of stuff with the copper though. Dr. S.	neutral
Ah, what a very fine classic set.... and all these lovely Technic beams with studs! *wub* Thank you very much for that excellent review, Bernd, and you did a fantastic job with all these great pictures! :'-) *y*	positive
Thanks for the review. It looks beautiful. My father was a backhoe driver, so understandably I used to drool over this set in the catalogs. I never did get it though as Lego was so expensive in Australia then; I had around 2000 pieces and I thought I had loads! :-D Anyway, last year I bought 8455, which I love; it works great with a compressor I made too! *sweet* I wish mine had a real cab though... :'-( Do you have 8455 as well? I'd love to see how they compare side by side... It looks bigger than 8455 but I don't own any of the big old chuncky tires so I find it so hard to tell. By the way, I have been reading all of your reviews but I have been a bit busy of late so I haven't had time to comment. I hope you have more planned; any chance of a supercar one?	positive
Another nice review. The slow shutter speed pictures are great. I think that was the only set with 8 distinct functions for a very long time and was only displaced by the 8455 Backhoe in that respect. The turntable on the back doesn't turn very well though, as the weight is all distributed on one side. The screw axle prevents it from popping off but there is still a lot of friction in it. I don't have mine built anymore but it might be worth trying to put a weight brick or something on it. Quote Do you have 8455 as well? I'd love to see how they compare side by side... It looks bigger than 8455 but I don't own any of the big old chuncky tires so I find it so hard to tell. Yeah, it's quite a bit bigger. When everything is fully extended, it becomes something like 26" long. Although the 8455 actually has more/better functionality. Edited by CP5670, 24 March 2008 - 08:15 AM.	positive
A great review for a great set! It even had the old technic T-pieces and bevels, which I actually prefer to their modern counterparts.

The screw axle prevents it from popping off but there is still a lot of friction in it. I got mine for £20 in a second hand shop; it said complete, but one of the screw knuts was missing! X-O So it's practically impossible to keep the back arm on with only one |-/ And they're rather rare on BL too |-/	positive
yeah, I meant they're rare. ;-) but I can imagine that a normal axle with the old half bushes will help. Sometimes these are really strong; if you put 2-3 in a row? EDIT: I just tried it: a normal 10L axle with 2 interlocking old half bushes type 1 on each end. (I chose those who only can be moved very hardly along an axle.) I slewed the BJST / back arm a few times tried the pneumatics parallel to it and it didn't loose. Edited by BerndDasBrot, 24 March 2008 - 06:06 PM.	neutral

This is a review of Speed Racer set 8159 Raxer X Vs Taejo. This is my second review and the first review of this paticular set and the only one on EuroBricks... at the moment X-D So without further ado I present to you my review... (I like that saying so much I decided to use it again in this review, it's originally from my review of 8158, which can be seen here.) Note: Sorry that this review got delayed, but there was a hostile takeover of the computer, X-O don't worry everythings fine now. X-D Set: 8159 Racer X Vs Taejo Theme: Speed Racer Price: $19.99US Pieces: 237 Minifigs: 2 Note 2: I did not take photos of just the new pieces this time because they're the same "new" pieces as in 8158, just in diff. colors. If you want to see a picture of them click here. First off pictures of the Box, Instructions, DSS, and Minifigs: Not quite as many stickers as set 8158, but there still are quite a few. Can you guess which ones which? :-D Yes, Taejo's hair really is Red and Black, for Racer X's head TLG just reused the baddie's head from 7620. |-/ Now onto the build: First Racer X's X Racer :-D (Thats not it's official name.. I think.) :-$ Back end of the car. The cockpit, and yeah there are no seats for Racer X's hiny, just a flat 2x2 Dark Bley plate. The cockpit and rearend of the car connect using an S-shaped connector piece. The front part of the car. The fornt and the cockpit are also connected using an S-shaped connector piece. Adding some details including Yellow fenders. The underside of the car, so far. Adding some more detail. Newly added motor vents and smooth details. Adding a front bumper, amongst other things. Side view of the car, so far. "No backseat driving, wait a minute, there's no backseat!" The underside with newly added axles. Demonstrating how hubcap piece is put on the car. Now onto Taejo's GRR (Glorious Red Racer) :-P Front part of the car. Cockpit, regular seats... check. Cocpit and rearend of the car connected using S-shaped connector piece. Adding some detail. The front part of the car. Front and cockpit connected also using the S-shaped connector piece. Adding some fenders to the car. Underside of the car, so far. Adding some smooth details. Taejos is the only car with an actual hood. Side view of the car, so far. Underside of the car with axels. Now some finished shots of both cars: First Racer X's fine Black and Yellow racer Reminds me of an older Ferrari from this angle. Up close and personal. I'm guessing the 3 holes are exhaust outlets. Racer X rollin'. Now it's time for Taejo's Red racer "I could've sworn I ordered some hubcaps!" -guess who... Taejo Racer X admiring Taejo's fine red automobile. Up close with 'Big Red'. Rearend shot of the car. "I challenge you Racer X!" -Taejo Racer X bein' a complete badass and smokin' Taejo. >:-) Now for some comparison shots: (The Silver pocket knife is just to hold up Taejo's car.) Now a shot of the extra pieces: Now if you combine 8158 with 8159, you get this: "Go, Go, Go!" Now it's time for the summary: This set is an excellent buy at $20 dollars, it's well designed and has lot's of details, it also has very unique minifigs. (Which are always good in a set.) It's only downfalls are the lack of acessories for the minifigs and that there are no cool contraptions on the cars, and by "cool" I mean lethal to the other racer(s). Now to the scoring of the set: Price:10/10 Pieces: 8/10 Too many stickers for such a small set. Minifigs: 10/10 Unique and creative. Playability: 9/10 Would have been perfect except for the lack of acessories and cool contraptions on the cars. (But both are easily modified/fixed hence the nine.) Overall: 37/40 A great set! Bonus: Try and count how many times my Silver pocket knife appears and win... the knowledge of knowing how many times the Silver pocket knife appears. :-P :-D This concludes the review, more pictures of either set 8158 or 8159 or both available through request, via PM-ing me. ;-) See ya' next time folks... of course I don't mean that literally X-D ...

Thanks for the review, mate. I may get this as well, so I can get Racer X.

Thanks for this review, it's a nice set with some cool pieces and nice techniques, I like the way the roof pieces are used to make the spiders back, for instance Lasse D, on Mar 26 2008, 09:48 PM, said: Alternate models: 3 It is hard to come up with alternate models with so many small pieces and plates that are only 1 stud wide.

I picked up this set a few weeks ago (along with the smaller sets that come with the Mach 5 and Racer X's car), and I was pleasantly surprised. The commentator's stand is nothing to write home about, but the assortment of figs is great (numerous new face prints in flesh, I believe), and in spite of the large amount of stickers, the three cars are each unique and very well-designed. My only gripe about them is that Cannonball Taylor's car (the black and yellow one) was a missed opportunity, as in the movie it's yellow and purple. I know TLC is dropping purple for the future and had a bunch of problems with it in the past, but it would have made for a great looking car IMO.	positive

Hi! I've promised a lot lately. I'll review 8868, 8880, Space Police II, Blacktron II... And I WILL. It's just the time that is blocking me. And my university. And the fact that I just picked up 8460 in original box for only EUR 36,50...! *sweet* The other reviews will follow - please bear with me. And this set review is also a gift to this nice fellow who gave me the title! That's what I'm talking about: #1 useless information with high numbers: This set contains 841 parts and was released in 1995 in the TECHNIC / Tech Build / Advanced (sub-) theme. The bricklink price guide displays for “Used” a Qty Avg Price of $125.85 and for “New” a Qty Avg Price of $212.82. I got it for $56,98. Still can’t believe it. :'-) This set was rereleased two times (8431 in 2002 and 8438 in 2003). #2 the box: Front: Back: Open: The box is higher than other Technic boxes. Why? I don’t know. 8460 doesn’t have any real large parts. Whatever. Inlay: I wonder why TLG doesn’t make inlays anymore… They’re noisy and brake easily but are great for (pre-) sorting. #3 building instructions: I will quote myself from the 8862 review: Quote Wow these instructions are used! I'm not used to this after all this sets with unread instruction booklets... Triple-wow! ‘nuff said. This is the “first” page. (Fortunately Peeron offers scans!) The last step for the alternate model and a few nice photos showing how the pneumatic pump will be erm- pumped. Yeah. Random page: I forgot the overall thoughts to the instructions: These are Technic instructions as we’re used to them: part count, easy to understand (okay, the string part at the end was too much for me) and the color distinction is okay too. 100 pages long and if I can trust my eyes the pneumatics page can be fold out. (I don’t have this page but I assume it.) #4 the parts: #5 building: An easy and fun build. Okay, this could take some time. My longest building review up to date. The front steering: The rear steering. The axle pin between the rear steering is for the axle which rotates the crane. The two worm screws in the front are for the outriggers (they’re not linked. One for each side.) The small wheel in the back is for the rotation. Adjusting front and rear steering. outriggers are finished. You can notice a 8 tooth gear that will rotate the Technic Turntable. A steering wheel has been added. Could be the same stickers like the alternate 8880 used to have. The steering can be operated with both actinic lights (?) No. We’re far from finished. I’ve got a lot of parts left at this point. Wow. A 4x4 corner plate! Pneumatics and a winch: If you can’t recognize it on the photo: The Technic Beams are the erm- wrong/other side up. The 1x6 Technic Beams on the left side are normal. The axle that will extend the crane: 7 gear racks 1x4 the 1x6 Technic plate will keep the two pneumatic cylinders straight. *sad* 8-| Huh? Did you blink? You missed a special part: The whole rotatable thing will be attached to the Technic turntable using two long Technic pins. The pin on the right side should be in the middle of the three “turntable holes”. On the right side, it’s the first hole. Asymmetric! Why? Because we’ll add a cute cab! #6 functionality: You can find the features in comparison to other Technic cranes here. Technopedia, of course. I made one "sentence" out of it: (please don’t find any mistakes.) :-P “two axle rack and pinion steering, pneumatic luffing and gear driven telescoping via crank for the boom which can slew 360° on turntable driven via gear, crank driven hoist and gear driven outriggers at four corners which snap over center.” #7 random shots: Comparison to 8854: uuuh… once again a depth of field. I tried to make it look authoritarian like 8858 but I failed. Somehow 8460 looks cute. #8 comparison to 8421 Mobile Crane / Crane Truck: I feel that a question concerning this will be asked, so I deal with it right now. First of all: I don’t own 8421 yet. I know. A Technic freak really should own it. Anyway: 8421 has more than twice as much parts as 8460, is motorized, features a V6-engine and a very neat mechanism to extend the crane/boom twice using a braided string with end studs. Try to find out how! Of course 8421 features (far) more than 8460. IMHO 8421 should have been a copy of 8460, a set so successful that it has been rereleased two times, but the designers overshoot the mark. 8421 is a (breathtaking) monster. Compared to it, 8460 looks cute - not pale! #9 final thoughts: I got it on eBay in kind of good condition, for about 50 dollars. I know that it has been worth the money in any point of view. *wub* I didn’t use the word “old-school” for now. I’ll change that: 8460 belongs to the favored few of old-school Technic sets! thanks for reading and viewing the pictures, I hope you enjoyed it! Please comment if you want to!	positive
Somehow I competely missed your review when you first made it, I saw your pics on brickshelf and wondered about the review... You have managed to review my all time favourite technic set! It was the first large Technic set I was given by my parents, when it first came out in 1995. I played for hours with this set, making minifig seats in it (it was so huge there was room for four minifigs to sit next to eachother in front....) I made various applications for it, a bungee-jump system with a large rubber band, and lots of containers to be lifted. The first changes I made included the inverting of the wheels and the disabling of one of the flashlight-steering wheels because they obstructed eachother. By the way, the nob for your winch is yellow instead of black (I know this set by heart, so watch out :-P ). I always liked those nobs. I do own the 8421 and I can tell you: this 8460 is much, much stronger, it can carry more weight because the boom is lighter then the 8421: they are powered by the same two pistons... You know when you made it right: when the crane is in upright position, fully extended and you release the brake from the winch. Does the hook lower without having to pull it? If it does, you succeeded in constructing the set right. The alternate model was great fun too, the pump is cleverly hidden and the crane folds up great between the cab and the loading platform. You could easily mod it with a pneumatic claw on the crane, a motor to turn it and a compressor. The only flaw was the loading platform which had no floor (only some axles). Thanks so much for reviving my memorie concerning this great set! *y*	positive
A great review, thank you. I do not know these old sets like this one, but it is very cool to see how they were made. I have an un-opened 8421, maybe I should do a small review of that when I get to build it. btw. boxes are expensive, so at a given price point, it's a choise between more bricks or nicer boxes. I have no doubt what most people would chose. Front Edited by Front, 06 April 2008 - 10:21 PM.	positive
Set ref: 7624 Name: Jungle Duel Number of minifigs: 3 Number of pieces: 78 Price: 11,90€ It’s the smaller set from the last Indy movie, “the kingdom of the crystal skull”. Here we go! A general view of the set: We have a tent, some food ( a chicken leg is always welcome!), a fireplace, the things with all the swords, a bench with a broken table, 3 ants, a map (printed tile) and other accessories. Don’t make that girl hungry or... YYYYAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH! Ho no! Our diner, a giant ant, has gone away! Those giant ants are made in a smooth plastic, in dark red and trans black colour: And here a closer view on the two new hairpieces: The new girl hairpiece is really cute, and I’m a bit disappointed by the new man hairpiece…Those hair lake some volume… But I’m really happy to see that TLC has made some new moulds for hairpieces! It’s the good part of the theatre lines! So, it’s a really interesting set because you’ve got a lot of useful pieces for a city Mocers, with the two new hairpieces without spending a lot of money!

Actually they are ants. Spiders have 8 legs while ants have only 6 like these. The two thing that look like legs in the front are the antennae. Back on topic, I think this set looks great and I can't wait until I can get my hands on it and the other new IJ sets. Edited by Erdbeereis1, 15 April 2008 - 09:26 PM.	positive

There are six legs, 2 antennae, and 2 mandible. And they most definately are ants, to those still in doubt. Thanks for this great review, Alex, this is most definately (well, in my opinion anyway) the best set. Lets face it, in motorcycle chase you really only got 2 bikes and 2 crates as the big parts of the set. In this one, which is the same price, you get those ants, a neat tent (Hurray!), a [b]printed[/i] map, a chicken leg, a Castle sword, EF sword, and Pirates sword, a dagger (now in light bley) and a silver frying pan. This set is packed with useful pieces, I'm definately getting this one. And I for one love Mutt's hair piece. I sense my sig-fig will soon have a new hair style. Thanks again Alex for the sweet review! ~Peace Edited by iamded, 16 April 2008 - 05:07 AM.	positive
Mhm...I really need this set! There are various things I’m interested in: the minifigs (hey, I still have no Indiana Jones figs!), the new hairpieces, a gold katana, a dark bley pirate cutlass (is this the first one?), a dark bley knife (could be useful..), those giant ants, yet another silver broad sword (you never have enough of those).....great parts pack indeed.

Great review Alex After seeing these pics i'm really looking forward to getting this set, i really like how lego has designed the gas tank that's just so good. Finally a different shade of green for the croc, it's about time and more than welcome. The vehicle looks good and a fun build, though i'm not that fond of that commie tree	positive
Merci Beaucoup for the great review Alex !! Where did you get the sets ? That set is called River Chase This is a great set !! I love the amphibious vehicle with all the darj green part !! I agree with you that the the dark green croc is fantastic !! I'm also happy to have a dark bley Zodiac and a new Marion Torso. That "tree hut" is a fun feature where the playability doesn't screw the design !! I really love the commies !! Its fun how Lego reuses those fleshie heads and I really don't mind at all. So its evil for evil since one of the commie has the zazi face I also love the ptrol cans !! ingenious !! I still have rants on that set: * Why oh why another similar Indy !! Arghhh I can't stand it !! * Why oh why the same Marion head !! Can't wait to have those sets !!	positive
im glad they change the torso form the prototype	neutral
Set ref: 7626 Name: Jungle Cutter Number of minifigs: 4 Number of pieces: unknown Price: 39,99€ A general view of the set: We’ve got 5 giant ants, two Russian soldiers, a General, Indy of course, 3 trees, a small entrance of a cave, and the debroussaillor vehicle (I don’t know the English name of it…). You can’t enter into the cave, because there is a spider web with its spider…Unless… Unless you know how the mechanism works and the spider web go up… And reveals a case with diamonds and accessories. A closer view on the mechanism (which is simple but works well), and you can also see the difference, or maybe the same, size of a spider and a giant ant! And I’ve always thought that those spiders were very big compared to the minifigs! So those ants are really giant! Poor small frog! The three trees with the entrance make a nice jungle layout! Don’t speak too loud, you will wake up the soldier… Don’t worry for him, he will be waken up by the vehicle before being eaten by those giant ants! A front view, making the vehicle really menacing! A back view: Push the red part from the back and there are two parts that fall down from the vehicle. I don’t know why… The movie will clarify this I think… And here you can see how the two big circular blades turn when you push the vehicle… Simple but effective! Run Indy, run! This set is really nice. The playability of the different elements is great, the colour scheme is nice too (I like those dark green tree parts!). The vehicle is really impressive without being too big and its very well details! In general the designers of the Indy sets have made a really nice works, with a lot of efforts in all those details everywhere! I’ve got some project for this set, to integrate it in my city... I’m a city mocer, and not an Indy fan. So I don’t have bought the temple, the bigger set of the series, because it has nothing special for me in term of part selections or in the design, in relation with the town theme, and because my supermarket doesn’t have it yet! So, we are waiting for a member to review it and make the part 4…	positive
Excellent review Alex. Thanks for sharing. I can't wait to buy this set once available. I really like the dark green leaf pieces. I like the cave/temple which will look great in my Jungle Diorama. Blending the dark green and light green works well for the vehicle. Overall, a neat little set.	positive
Great review, thanks for that. I love almost everything about this set. The ants, commies, general (can we please get a shot of his face?), dark green, treads, foliage and other creatures. Great stuff, i'll have to get it on sale though. Batbrick Away!	positive
Great review, thanks a lot for all the pics. I agree that this is probably the nicest set of the Indy 4 wave. So much dark green and I love all the plant pieces. It's been ages since we've had enough pieces in a regular release to build nice forests so it's great to see 11 of the dark green leaves in one set and all the vines! The design of the cutter looks very solid and brick built as well. Giant ants are great looking too.	positive
A great, detailed review for an excellent set! I love the Jungle Cutter vehicle itself, and all the dark green! It's great to have the trees and cave entrance; you can never have enough extras! The figs are nice too; two Russian soldiers, the cool-looking general (I think his name is Dovchenko or something) and the repeated-but-still-nice Indy with RPG. Thanks again, looks like I'll be picking this up along with Jungle Duel. (By the way, I think this set is called Jungle Cutter).	positive
Wow those trees look so weak compared to those enormous blades. Anyway, a high-possibility-and-appeal-to-us-compulsive-LEGO-shoppers set, so, I'll try to get it, which means I'll obsesively look until i find. Deforestation of puny trees, ON!	neutral
Thanks for the review alex I agree that this is the best set of KotCS sets (although the airplane comes quite close..). Although I'm not too fond of the trees, the cave is good, and the jungle cutter is brilliant. Plenty of great features, and very detailed, with much of the engine showing and a decent cockpit (if that's the right word..). The general and the two Soviets are great too (could we have a close-up pic of them please? ), good to see that neither torso has exposed fleshy skin like the Nazis. As said though, it is quite a pricy set, I was expecting it to be just over the price of Race for the Stolen Treasure. Great set, thanks again, alex!	positive
Ahhhhh now this swamp vehicle looks great to me, when i first heard lego were making it i was worried that it would be a poor version. However im pleased to see that it's not, even though i'm not a great fan of those treads. The trees don't really add anything to the set which is a shame, still the parts are welcome at least. The entrance is good though it could do with being bigger, but i guess we can moc that. I really like the commie general, he looks like a real bad megablocks	positive
Great review again Alex !! Same question (in case you didn't se it in my reply to the other set): where did you get those new sets ?? I really love that set !! Its called Jungle Cutter The trees are really cool and make a great adition to it IMO. That temple entrance or monument is really cool !! Those Bionicle parts do make fantastic vegetation !! I totally forgot about that green frog !! Thats cool , those are so cute !! 5 more ants is great !! The vehicle look really sharp (ah ah ah). 2 more commies yeay !! That officer is really freaky actually !! Could have been a high rank under Pol Pot's regime in the S21... Yeay looks more asian than russian IMO Now its time for my grips: * same bloody rant about Indy !! * I haven't read the instructions before but once again there are so many parts in crap colours that need to be changed Look at all the crap red and yellow in there !! I will need to look for those parts before buying the set like I always do !! Mod while building On !! I am really soimpressed with that Indy line !! I sincerely hope it will have a long and healthy life !!	positive

This is the 3rd review, that i had read. It's very tempting to fly over and get those sets from there. Because, i may need to wait for some months before it arrived. It seemed we will have a new small little creature to add into the ranks. These "Red Ants" is cute and of course looks nasty too. Haha. I love those trees, foilage and plants very very much. It can be used for my MOC and is good for any "Green" project related expansion. I love it. About the vehicle, i find it abit wierd. It seemed too big in the set-up. Hehe, but still i love this set. Mainly, i will get it for the green parts	positive
This is around the time that many consider the decline of castle, in which point I somewhat agree, but admittedly it still looks like a very playable set, and the tree is very well done. Thank you for the review!	positive
this was the last castle set i got before my dark age.. really liked it although the big rock parts looked really bad ( i am kind of used to them now) unfortunately i lost the little wand.. and i never understood who is "good" and who is "bad" does the wizard own the dragon? well they dont seem to be enemies but isnt the dragon supposed to be evil??	positive
I think the green motocross bike looks great. I like the use of fairings on this bike. The only thing I really don't like about the Technics bikes in general, is the "clumsy" design of the chaindrive. It sticks way to much out to the side. If they made a really big bike model, it would be more in place with this chain drive. I'm not sure if it wouldn't be possible to design a shaft drive to the rear wheel, ala BMW style. But the green "Kawasaki" look great with the front and rear suspension. I have the Street Bike, 8420, a somewhat larger and more complicated set, and will probably add the motocross bike to my collection soon. It would be great if Lego could make a line of bikes, like they do the Ferrari line. Front	positive
A very good review, thanks, Sinner. That´s really a pretty cool model, very detailed with useful parts too.... hmm, perhaps that one´s gonna get the first Technic set I´ll buy, beside that 4481 Hailfire Droid.... um, thank you, Sinner....	positive
I have just finished building this set. I was a bit disappointed with the amount of bricks when they were out on my table, but the final model is really nice and totally makes up for that. I like the small details like on the handles and fuel tank and the only real negative thing I can say is that the cog seems a bit oversized in the rear. I don't know if the designer frequents this forum, but I'm sure he will be happy about how much you like it - it took quite some time/prototypes to get to this design: (Sorry about the size of the picture - it isn't mine)	positive

I know that alex54 had already reviewed this set beforehand, but I wanted to give my 2 cents (it is really more like $1.50) on this set I bought from toys 'r' us on friday (guess what, the price had not been increased by a dollar like all other sets, ). This is my first review of a set ever, don't be too mean. 1) Box It captures the potential (I don't know how the scene plays out... for now ) action of the scene nicely and is very pleasing, good job TLC . On the back it shows some of the play features of the set and a net little comic. Indiana Jones seems to be surprisingly calm considering that he is about to be captured under a net and attacked by a snake (the thing he fears most). 1a) comic not much to say on this... 1b) screw up At the top of the box, both "Russian Guards" have the same grining face, in the set one has the generic bad guy face from 7620. 2) Contents The box opens up to reveal a quartet of bags, an un-crumpled manual (YAY!), and a sticker sheet (BOO!) 2a) DSS Yoda said every for of rambling imaginable about this accursed item, I have nothing to say. Meh... 3) Minifigs The only thing that has not really been discussed about the figs that you get in this set is that Marion has a slightly new torso. 4) Parts of interest When I opened up the baggies, these were the components that grabbed my attention. A DARK GREEN alligator, a net piece that I Know has appeared in sets before hand ( I needed it for a MOC I am working on), some raft part that is probably very old, a ladder with two pairs of hindges, and a DARK brown version of this part. 4) Build (amphibious vehicle) This I one of the more enjoyable builds of the new line. But that is just my opinion. You start of with some thing very simple... By the end of the next page, it starts to bulk up More detail... Beginning to look like a car... 4a) Build (rear attachment) Bulk it up and add Taillights... Done... Slap it on to the main vehicle... 4b) Build (Front attachment) I am running out of things to say... Bulk it up... Add some detail... Add a gun and headlights... And attach to the rest to get the completed vehicle... Add stickers... I honestly think that the amphibious vehicle looks much better with the stickers than without... 5) Build (boat) This build goes by rather quickly and adds to the playability of the final set. Base... Apply clamps... Add more to engine... Build more detail and a gun base... Finished boat... Plus stickers... I love how Lego slips in the product number into their stickers. 6) Build (tree fort) This is the weakest part of the whole set. But I find my self liking it more and more for some odd and inexplicable reason. That tan 6x6 will most likely see use in a pirate themed vinigete soon (not mine ). Install net-launcher... You spend the next two pages building this... And putting it on... A tree branch that is an ugly mix of brown, dark brown, and frown... (our commie friend seems to like coffee a lot) Second branch... 3rd... (a wee bit to much on the coffee there, don't you think?) Final step... The only redeeming value of this section is how well the net launcher works, fantastically. The rest is just utter fail. 7) Spare parts Very little in terms of what is left over... Finished set... All in all, this set is a fine build and an excellent parts pack for dark green components. I recommend this set strongly, despite its few weaknesses.	positive
Nice review! Although you need to use the Macro setting(a.k.a. the Flower setting) for better pics. Are you using a digital camera? You really need Macro...

I'm glad this one also comes with the new Uzi; I wanted an extra...	neutral
Very good for a first review! I bought this set and Jungle Duel at Target the other day (I was going to wait and buy them when I go to Downtown Disney this summer, but how could I pass up saving four bucks that I can spend on store-exclusives? ) and I have to say I absolutely love them. The amphibious vehicle (don't they call it a Duck in the movie?) is definitely my favorite LEGO vehicle I've ever built. Everything about it is wonderful- the size, the colour scheme, and it's accurate to the one in the movie. And Irina Spalko's hair is to die for. On a side note, I don't get why they made Marion's arms white in the set. The shirt underneath her vest in the movie is obviously blue. I switched the arms out for light blue ones and it looks a lot better, and it makes Marion's eyes look great. -Ryan	positive
While i truely fell in love one more time with the older lego city sets, i thought, why not make a review of one of the, in my opinion greatest city sets of all time. Let's not talk too much, here we go! Set Nr.: 6395 Name: Victory Lap Racetrack Number of minifigs: 13 (!!) Number of pieces: unknown Release Year: 1988 Starting with the beautiful old Legoland box: Front: Back, with some cool alternative models: Inside: We continue with the great minifigs, which are not less than 13! I don't think there is any city set with more figures, is there? Civilians: Race Crew & Assistant Personnel: Drivers: All: Here's a overview of the whole set: The "Rescue Rig" (don't exactly know how to call it) with trailer: The score board & Traffic Lights, which would be one of the details i love the most about this set: The next sweet detail, the Camera + Cameraman! Of course we have a doc, if there is some kind of accident: The pit stop boxes, i love the small tool-holder with the axle and wheel behind it: The control room high above the racetrack: Ready to go?!! That was it all in all,all i can say is, if you see this set anywhere on ebay ore somewhere else, get it!	positive

Hello all, I don't believe there has been a review of this set yet, so I wanted to take this opportunity. Up for review today is 8160 Cruncher Block and Racer X as part of Batbrick and iamded reviews: Here is the box, I have to say I love the art on it. It's very colourful and makes the truck look a lot less crap than it does on the box. Plus, you have to love the "Missile launching action" bit right, am I right? Why are you all staring at me? And here is the back. Pretty generic, but shows some nice details and so forth. Oh dear! In turning around the box have I killed myself AND iamded!? Okey dokey, up first is the best part of the entire set: the minifigs! Racer X is wonderful, though coming with a boring Bruce Wayne face. But it is Cruncher Block, his lady Driver Taejo that really shine. Look at those awesome suits! The cool faces! Taejo has a ripped shirt! Now up is the first building part of the set, with me and iamded looking rather slick in X's car. While I'm not a big fan of yellow, it is very nice, and slopes in an underused colour is better than no slopes at all: Front view, the new windshields are fantastic: While a very cool car, it is rather silly of TLC to give us the exact same one we got in the smaller set. I didn't get the smaller set with this car, so I'm still happy, but it is a bad marketing move: Sorry iamded, I know it's your birthday, but......VROOM! Now for the second part of the build and my favourite, the front of the truck: Annoyingly enough, this part opens up to shoot a pointless rubber projectile: To do this, you open the roof (a nice detail btw) and pull back the mechanism, here: Thus blowing the front part open and launching it.....well, not far really The wheels and covers are pretty cool, and the front is nicely designed, the red looks good and the rear vision mirrors are a great touch. And now for the most disappointing part - step three, the trailer: (Note - Clicky joint piece not part of set, just used to hold it up!) That's right, almost the entire thing is open, even the "filled in" side has holes! I'd certainly be cared to be back there, one bumpy hill and back you go! I didn't put the lame computer stickers on, and the control area is pretty lame in general. Not to mention Taejo (who is depicted on the boxart as standing at the desk, would most likely just be sucked out the back at those speeds! There are some pluses too though, like the ridiculously awesome minifig paintings I'll be using for Wayne Manor. Also note the "control" on Cruncher's desk that when turned, turns the gun at the bottom. It's an alright feature: Here is an example, I've shot iamded on his birthday. What? It's a love ray! Haven't you seen the Care Bears? And though I'm not a massive fan of stickers, this is just too cool. The little aquarium is very simple but very clever, using a printed piece between two clear windows to create the illusion of a tank: It looks much better in real life, trust me, and here is a side view to better explain: Now, to connect the two is a good thing, I like the way a simple technic piece assumes the job. Oh, and behold my hand! The completed truck, which, while a mixed bag, still doesn't look too bad (I guess): Now the completed set, which, despite its unbelievable large flaws, still looks cool. (Warning, the kickass iamded and Batbrick figures do not come with this set): More pics here: http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=3147324 All in all: Minifigs: 5/5 - Racer X is beautiful, Cruncher Block and the Driver too, and Taejo has a ripped shirt, damn! Design: 2/5 - Pretty poor considering the best part is available in a cheaper set, and only the front part of the truck looks cool, but still not truly awful. Build: 3/5 - Despite having a bad trailer, it was a fun build and sometimes you need something that doesn't take ages to make. Price: 2/5 - Overpriced easily, but Rogue Shadow is worse! Fun: 3/5 - The mere concept of such an open truck kept me playing with this baby for hours! Total: 15/25, not as bad as it would seem. Overall I'm really glad I bought it as the minifigs are fantastic and the paintings and fish tank are cool. It's fun, stupid and downright ridiculous, but while not a great set by any means, certainly isn't as bad in the brick as it looks in photos. Until next time, Batbrick Away!

Awesome review Batbrick! I don't see any appeal at all really in this set, but that's okay, as I want to stick to Castle anyway. The car is the best part IMO, which you can get in a different set with another cool car and for a cheaper price. But the main downfall to this set is the fact that the truck's trailer is half blown up and the survivors are magically staying inside and not being sucked right out of there, as you have mentioned. I would have thought TLC would at least included some sort of cover that you could take on and off easily (kind of like the modular buildings). Having said all that though, the front of the truck does look incredibly cool, and those minifigs are sweet. Too bad they all have flesh tone printed on them. So, while this may not be my set of choice, I can see the appeal... well, really I can't, but it's just my opinion! I'm sure there are plenty others who would love to scoop this set up. ~Peace	negative
I'll be passing on this set, thanks for the review anyway, is everyone supposed to be bald in the film? it looks weird	negative
Thanks for that fine review, Batbrick. The most interesting part of the set, for me, are the neat MFs.... the trailer looks really pretty skeletal. However.... it´s a nice little play set and´ll fit its purpose I guess.	neutral
Nice review. Good pictures, thanks. I think I may get a couple of the smaller sets, as I think these will become collectors sets in years too come, Not sure this range will be that popular? Love the minifigs though.	neutral
Thanks for the review. My wife wanted me to buy this for the fishtank, and I came close! Untimately this set didn't offer many good part to me so I bought the smaller set with the same car. The trailer is just too insubstantial...	negative
Thank you for the nice review	neutral
I bought this set a few days ago and agree with what you have said about it. The trailer is fun to play with but just so plain. Overall great review.	positive
I enjoyed the review. Some cool fleshie heads and parts, but it does seem a bit lamer even than I imagined from the box (the "airy" truck is rather slyly disguised on the box art). I would like to get it if it is ever on sale, 50% off would be nice :) Speed Racer Lego doesn't seem to be selling too well in local shops here.	neutral
Nice review--I'm surprised these are out already. I'll probably end up passing on this one. Even with the surprise. :)	neutral
That is a very nice and quick review! Thanks for giving us a quick summary. Not much comments on this set, as I do not really go into Batman theme yet. However, the ice cream truck in the set interest me. Apart from that, nothing much yet. Who knows, maybe I will change my mind in the future.	neutral
Must...Get...!!	positive
Oh wait, Is that torso dark grey or light grey?	neutral

trooperdavinfelth, on May 16 2008, 11:11 PM, said: Although I know you don't take many pictures in your reviews(IMHO, ) but can we see a little more about the Tumbler? I'll get some set up tomorrow in better light. To be honest there isn't a lot to see, most of it is just basic technic blocks underneath with all the slopes built up on top.	neutral
Thanks a lot for the review brickbitz. I really love this set, sure the figs are annoyingly not new, but the ice cream truck is fantastic and the Tumbler is a marvel of black slopes. I see now that it is far too huge though, I reckon I will either keep it that way as a "mega tumbler", mod it to become another Battank, keep it as a model Tumbler, or pull it apart and use the bits to make a Tumbler like Wetwire's awesome one. Love those popsicles though, and those wheels are very nice, so overall as a loyal Batfan I love the set, even though it could've been better. Batbrick Away!	positive
The Tumbler is massive! I'll struggle to fit it into the Cave, but never mind. The figs are nice, the Tumbler is pretty accurate (or at least, it will be after I've MODed it), and Joker's tainted ice cream van is so very Joker. Thanks for the review, btw.	positive
Excellent review, Dunamis. This set looks great. The designers really though the kit out, it seems. The internal organs have got to be my favorite part, but everything is good. Now all we need is a UCS Obi-Wan with a laser pistol to finish off Grievous in a totally anti-climatic way!	positive
Deinonychus, on May 16 2008, 09:21 PM, said: Hey Dunamis, think you can get a straight-on shot of the face? The red pieces inside the eye sockets are topped with trans-greenish-yellow studs which make his face look eerily alive and very close to his screen appearance. It's a nice little detail that seems to not show through on pictures I've seen of the set. The legs are a little wobbly. I'm scared that he'll be leaning too far forward in about 5 years Sure. I'll get a few photos tonight and post them. The eyes are a nice effect. You are right about the legs as the model does wobble a little. I forgot to mention that the base does turn which is another nice feature.	positive
Thanks for that fine review, dunamis. I really like that set.... GG´s an interesting and well designed movie character and that LEGO version of him´s indeed well done and very detailed. And although I would wish for a some more functional (or playable ) feature of move- and even splitable arms I guess it´s an already very cool UCS version of that grumpy old Kaleesh....	positive
Quote Since there were links posted to the .pdf files of the instructions online, I’m sure you can all get an idea of the manual and the parts inventory. However, for those of you without access to the Internet here are photos of the parts inventory pages: Luckily for me I have access to the internet to read this review in the first place Seriously though, nice review! My girlfriend has told me that I can't have this one after we just got through a 3-day build of the 10030 Star Destroyer... but I'm sure I can turn her around eventually... :)	positive
An excellent review with superb presentation dunamis . When the time comes i hope your able to get your hands on the other new SW sets and review them just as good.	neutral
This is a very nice, i never gotten to chance to own or buy one of the SW big sets. I'm definitely getting these one.	positive
nice review i hope to get this set for my birthday!	neutral
Thanks very much for the review brickbitz! I love this year's Mars Mission line, and though this is the weakest set, it is still a major improvement. The mech is very cool and well made, and the Commander is one of my favourite alien figs ever. The alien ship is pretty good, better than last years ones but not extremely good either, but i still like the set. Batbrick Away!	positive
Thanks for that interesting review, brickbitz. The alien fighter looks pretty nice, nothing special but streamlined and fast nevertheless. That transforming feature´s a nice addition for sure, and these new flicker missile with its launch apparatus.... hmm, I hope I won´t spend quite some time in search of that little 'rocket' piece.... However, there´s still something I miss with these alien crafts.... I don´t know.... I like some more organic looking design, and they even come in some nice and different shapes, but still.... perhaps a real space fighter just needs a solid cockpit, cool windscreens and controls to satisfy my odd likings. That 'exo suit' looks really good and I wonder why it´s a little underrepresented on the box art. The jet pack/space scooter´s a really good idea, and the only thing I hate´re those darned studless technic beams.... it could look so much better with a studded version of these parts. But of course that´s only due to my personal preferences.	positive
Thanks for the review brickbitz I don't normally come into the space forum but this set it tempting me, on the basis of you review I think I might aquire one at some point.	neutral

LOL your sig is awesome! The little power suit is well done, I would like to see articulation some how jammed into the little legs though, and we all now exoforce 4 finger hands would look great on his arms. Edited by Rayskull, 18 May 2008 - 04:51 PM.	positive
My first impression upon seeing this set was "no thanks", but now I'm warming up to it. Still, I'll skip it if it interferes with my Hypersonic Operations Aircraft fund. :P	neutral
Thanks for the excellent review Oky! Judging by this set, the line is going to be promising. I really like the figs and I'm glad to see that robot arm is actually a new arm mold. Awesome!! Can a minifig hand fit in the end or just the chainsaw attachment? Could it fit an Exo-Force robot claw? There's a lot of detail in the torsos and I like that the Agent's suit is like a moto-cross uniform. I love that the snowmobile has a working tread. Copmike, Ras and I tried to build a snowmobile with working treads, but we ended up using chainsaw blades in the end. Great work Oky!	positive
This set looks wicked! Thanks very much for the sweet review Oky Wan! The pics are perfect, great quality and the perfect size, well done! This sets got everything, a new hairpiece, tank treads, a gem, well, I could go on but you can all see everything from the great pics. Thanks again Oky! This is one set I'll definately be getting! ~Peace	neutral
Huhm .. i like the idea of the agent-ID .. but offcourse all they want with that is that you buy all six sets .. but it can be a good idea for children, they wouldn't think of "hey they get all money only because i have a little card with stars" or something. Well, not to rant, i think it's good. Also, can you make that name yourself? maybe set 5 comes with a extra stickersheed with all letters, that would be nice "Agent Rupee" A very nice review Oky Wan Kenobi. =Rupee	neutral
Oky Wan, thanks for this wonderful review! I really have mixed feelings towards Agents set. Haha, but I love the Agent mini-figure. The double-sided face is great and I love the sunglass look. It's nice that they made use of Mutt's hairpiece which is personally my fave hairpiece at the moment The jet-pack is neat. Making use of the additional secure backing onto the mini-fig is really very smart.	positive
I kind of like the set. As said it has a very cartoonish style to it so I'm guessing the kids are going to love it. And as a parent I'll love it if the construction isn't to fragile. ;) I'll probably be getting a few for myself but only as parts pack. copmike, on May 18 2008, 11:29 AM, said: And the excaustpipe is a new peace also I think? Yeah and it's all over this years releases. From what I've seen so far it's found in: racers, Speed Racers, Mars Mission and Exo-Force sets. I just wish that instead of a 2x1 plate with an exhaustpipe in each end they would have made it an 1x1 plate with a single exhaust. That would have been a lot more useful.	positive
OMG OMG OMG. Im coming to the US in just under two weeks, really hope I see them somewhere! Does anyone know what NY Times Square Toys R Us is like for new sets?	neutral
Good review! Thanks Oky Wan. Hmm, although I really like the villain (not just the new arm, I think the color is very... villanous, as all Bond-villains with class have minions in uniforms. It's even possible to fill out their numbers with Exo-force grunts of the same color) I'm not that hot for the agent himself, his uniform... nah. It doesn't even look like clothes, just give the man a suit or some nifty leather. I think I'll try to grab some sets from the agents line just for the new parts (to begin with... MOCs may follow, who knows?) when they are available in stores here in Sweden. Haven't seen them yet, though Indiana Jones just got here so there might be some further waiting for me. Now I want to see reviews of the other sets :)	negative
What a lovely set, thanks for that fine review, Oky Wan Kenobi! The MFs´re wonderful, that helipack looks solid and well done and I especially like the slightly asymmetrical design of the neat snowmobile. A very playable little set for sure, and the most interesting part´s for sure that new cool MF arm....	positive
Thanks for the review! Do i see a little Indy hint on that map? Oh and btw., the map looks like it actually is printed am i right?	neutral
That would be great! I still wonder why the instructions aren't up yet, though..	neutral
Great looking set! I’m determined to get all the Agent sets this summer. Comments: Swamp Tower-The barbed wire is cool, but it seems like it’s only for looks. Bike-Cool looking, but doesn’t seem to have any controls. Cybercrocs-Wow, haven’t seen any of these pieces for a while, and in dark green, awesome! Agent Charge-Sweet head, definitely cool. Break Jaw-He looks like the result of some animal testing on humans gone horribly wrong. I hope they come out near me soon.	positive
Wow, thanks for the great review, SirNadroj! The overall set is what attracted me in the first place, that elevated hut and swampy setting just sucked me right in! It all looks really nice to me, a definite buy. That Agents head would make a great Indy, for those opposed to fleshies. And that monobrow, I mean, villain guy looks very... er... well, the monobrow is unique, thought I noticed the suit looks a bit skin tight in the crotchal area. Don't look at me like that, you saw it too! Anyway, the helmet's the best part about the villain, great for Warhammer 40,000 Orks. ~Peace	positive
Great review and a good confirmation of exactly what I suspected... this is a parts line for me. Much like Exoforce before it, this will be the theme I pick up when I'm out of other things, or it's on sale. Plus those dark green alligators bring tears of joy to an old pirate. Alice, on May 22 2008, 12:43 AM, said: I always joked that our house would have a moat around it with mechanical alligators. You were joking? What about the monkeys and the miniature golf course? Don't ruin my dreams ...	positive
Why do all of the reviews that we have for Agents sets have the agents getting hurt? Is this a new trend? Plus Unibrow man doesn't have a unibrow. His eyebrows are really close together and bushy!	neutral
Thanks for an interesting review, ???theriddler???. The set´s cheap and very useful to get two fantastic MFs, a great Mr. Freeze and a very cool new Batman. But I have to say that these two small vehicles just look plain ugly IMHO, without any inspiration nor orginality.... Sorry, TLC, but you can for sure do better than that, and even with less pieces....	neutral
Nice review, thanks! I really like those little go-kart thingies, they've got a fantastic Mario Kart look to them	positive
Like many others, I'll buy this just for Mr F, quickly recycle the parts, and pretend this set never existed. The flame detail is indeed terrible. The Bat is back - and he's flatulent! This third Bat-wave isn't really doing anything for me. I'll get the Penguin set as well for pretty much the same reason - although the sub on that is pretty cool - but skip the others. Maybe Batbrick can make us all nice alt-mocs to improve these sets... Thanks for the review though!	negative
Thanks for the review ???theriddler???. This is a neat little set, a bit overpriced in my opinion, but for a new suited Batman and a Mr Freeze fig in a set other than one of the most expensive Bat-sets released, it's worth my money. ~Peace	positive
Pretty nice review for a first time ???theriddler???. Next time though, if your camera has it, use the macro function (little flower icon) and perhaps a tripod. That should get rid of any blur and provide you with better pictures. Apart from that, a good little review. Keep up the good work!	neutral
Neat little set. I do like the parts a number of hard to find bits all in one pack, depending on how much it costs in USD I'll have to consider it. And while the buggy designs kinda suck, I'm a little happy to see them, its been years since TLC made any small go kart style vehicles. I guess Tiny Turbos have been overshadowing that market?	positive
The pics as promised. Extra part:	neutral
Thanks for the extra pics, I don't think you could have gone into much more detail than that! Nice pics of the Joker van too, will you do a review of that one? Batbrick Away!	positive
Thanks for the review. I dont know if I would get this set though. The cars are not that great and the price is a little too high.	negative
Looks cool, one of the best in this line. Cant wait for review!	positive
Chrome..... Can't wait for the review, Deino!	positive
Thanks for the review Deino! I love going back through the old "Agents" thread just to see how wrong we were about these awesome sets! I actually really like the gate, those portcullis pieces people may know i always find nice uses for, and I really, really, really want that awesome sound brick. The figs are a bit disappointing in numbers, but agent Chase is very cool, generic henchman are great, and Spy Clops is one of my favourite minifigs ever! The helicopter is wonderful too, I love that it is customised for Spy clops to winch him down. The colours as usual for these sets are fantastic, the dark blue, orange and chrome silver! The car is the best though, I love all the functions. How does the ejector seat work though? Batbrick away!	positive
Deinonychus, on May 23 2008, 09:12 PM, said: The rear has two cones sticking out. I'd like to think they're smoke nozzles or oil-slick sprayers. According to page 14 of my BrickMaster magazine, the left cone is for smoke screen and the right cone is for oil slick.	neutral
Wow great review thanks! This set looks absolutely great!!!! But I'm afraid of the price Oh weel I'll just get the 2 smaller ones. I'm really liking this theme! Well done TLG	positive
Great review deinonychus I really like it! can someone record the sound os the sound brick(maybe on youtube?) I really want to hear it. This sets are really cool deino can you post a picture of the agent card it comes with?	positive
Great review and fantastic pics, Deinonychus. And a big thank you to whoever pointed out that you could use the sound brick for Arkham Asylum, my addled brain didn't make the connection. The car is just beautiful, and with a good use for the most expensive part of the gate, this is on my wish list for sure, just have to see how much cash is left over after buying the new death star in a month or two. Agents has to be the biggest surprise from Lego for ages, without any pics it sounded so-so, but they've done a brilliant job with it, love those metallic coloured pieces!	positive
Great Review Thanks for sharing	positive
Hello all Eurobricks members, I will present to you a very short review on the recent Castle Battlepacks. This time, I will be reviewing Skeleton Battlepack, and I hope everyone of you do enjoy viewing it. This was a request that put up by hollisbrick in the Castle thread. Initally, I thought it was a very simple set to do a review. However, for the love of Castle, I decided to whip this up for every Castle fan out there. This is an image of how the Skeleton Battlepacks look like. I have bought 12 last packs of these in total so far but none of the Crown battlepacks yet. There were snapped much faster, that I imagined. Do pardon me for the poor lightning. Today is a bad weather, it's hard to get natural light. The Skeleton Gang For a single battlepack like this, with an attractive reasonable price. You obtained a series of 5 skeleton mini-figs with tons and tons of useful castle accessories. To me, it's a very very great buy, and it's a MUST to stock up for my army building! Some add-ons! However, I was not very satisfied with my Skeleton armies standards. Therefore, I decided to make some slight modifications with some additional castle accessories that is stocked in my Castle warehouse. After the makeover, Ok, this is what I called a real skeleton army. This is mainly my opnion and it have to be aligned with my standards. I felt this improved battlepack gives a punch to the exisitng battlepack. The two soliders on the right, is able to align with the rest of my Castle Chess sets armies. While the one on the left, it gives me a great archer back up with the quiver and helmet attached to him. The ones, on the center especially the armored guard which equipped with the black nose cone helmet is my fave. It is able to illustrate the "Elite" among the rest of the guards with its armor and helmet which was featured in my Castle Deep Forest Expansion MOC.. Promotion On! In addition, the one which was hastly done with a modify mace, it looks rather simple. In time to come, I will change it and gives a better equipment and look. These are the remains. I can use the axe for my dwarf in my dwarf mine defender. In that set, there is no weapon for my dwarf and I have to get it from other sets. The rest of the accessories, makes a very good stock up for future upgrading! Overall: 9/10 This is not a playset. It is mainly bought for its abilty to mass recurit any armies, and is a main love for all Castle Army builders such as me! This set mainly have no major faults, and I love it so much. Although, I have done some slight modifciations, but this set is a must for me to buy more and more! Meanwhile, I will need to wait for the next shipment! Hope everyone have enjoying viewing this simple review of mine! Edited by WhiteFang, 25 May 2008 - 12:52 PM.	positive
Thanks for the review WhiteFang. I love these sets, and I wish they were available in NZ. So far, it seems they may never come here... But I can sit and hope. I like the look of them after your make-over, a real skeleton army there! Did you say you've bought 12! Tht's lots of Skelies. Are you planning a big MOC or something?	positive

No problem! I had bought it last month. I thought it was so simple to do a review for this. Was looking through the thread, then I realised there is a request for it. It was an unexpected shipment that send to Singapore. It came in very limited quantity. Most of the battlepacks were snapped within a day or two when it arrived. Well, I am thinking of building something big in the future. It's just a plan that I have not decided yet. For me, I always love to see the beauty of a big army with different battalions, forming a kingdom. That's why, I always buy many many sets that have figures that attracts me. And for this battlepack, it served a very good purpose for it!	neutral
Thanks for the review!!! It wasn't "really" a request but more of an imply to do it Anyway great review! Can't wait til these come to Aus. probably when the rest of the castle comes out in September though	positive
Thanks, WhiteFang! Castle Battle Packs.... simply wonderful! Finally a dream came true, well done TLC!	positive
Thanks for the review Whitefang! Your additions look great, I like your mace much better than the use of a small technic cog, your looks much sturdier. And that helmet looks really great on skellie soldiers, I never thought to use that before. Very cool indeed! ~Peace	positive
TheBrickster, on May 28 2008, 09:41 AM, said: Thanks for sharing these close-up images of this battlepack WhiteFang. I actually had this set in my hand at Legoland Cal. and could not decide if I wanted it. I'm currently out of "castle-mode" with my large Indy Jungle set up on the table, and creating Ghost Train MOCs that are starting to line up on the bookshelves. Once I buy the Troll Ship, I'll want to start collecting these great fig sets. Thanks again for sharing. Brickster, you should try and get back into "castle-mode". There are so many great stuffs waiting for you such as Dwarf Mine, Tower Raid and etc. However, I can understand that the problem of space is always the key issue. Without space, it is hard for us to keep it on display for big-scale MOCs or for storage purpose. I will be waiting for you to get your Troll Warship too. Hope one day soon enough, we will be able to view a Castle MOC from you too. ExoBuilder, on May 28 2008, 09:42 AM, said: Thanks for the nice review WhiteFang! I got the Knights BP just for the scared face. Thanks ExoBuilder! I did not know that the Crown battlepack has a mini-fig with the scared face. I hope it will reach my shores soon once again. robbo, on May 28 2008, 10:07 AM, said: Sorry to be going a little off topic here but personally i have just bought 40 crowny battle packs for the only reason that i am running out of space to store the left over blocks. About 500 of my crownies came from sets (mentioned above) on sale which would have been cheaper than the battle packs. Thanks for the review Whitefang but i dont think i will be buy any skeleton battle packs, that army is large enough. That's lots of battlepack. Share us some images on your collection too. I love to see such big army. TheBrickster, on May 28 2008, 11:21 AM, said: For those of you who buy so many of this and the other battle pack with Crownies, what do you do with all of them? Is this simply to create a large-scale army, or do you plan to build large castle scenes with all the figs. I'd love to see some pictures (on the "share your castle army" thread). For me, I will use these battlepack for army building purpose. I always feel that every kingdom needs a considerable amount of soldiers to defend their kingdom. Therefore, most of the time, the amount of soldiers will dictate how strong that kingdom is in my collection. In the future, I hope to build large castle scenes, combined all playsets, armies everything together and developed a kingdom scene. Of course, that is just a dream for now. I am still currently not able to afford much space and time to do such big scale project at the moment. Meanwhile, for this great castle theme, I am storing them at the moment and take it out when the time is ripe. One day soon, I hope I can post an image or two of my armies.

Hi gang! As you all know, Indiana Jones IV has just debuted, and TLG has released a set depicting the Incan temple (7627) from the film's climax. But Lego beat Harrison Ford, George Lucas, Steven Spielberg and company to the punch by nine whole years with Johnny Thunder's adventures in the Amazon Ancient Ruins. The Vitals: Year of release: 1999 Parts Count: 453 MSRP: $80.00 The set included eight figures: (from left) Two skeletons, Dr. Lightning, Gail Storm, Gabarros, Achu, Johnny Thunder, and Señor Palomar. On the far right is my new sigfig, el Conde Voltio Villar. Construction begins with Dr. Lightning and his jeep. It's a sturdy Adventurers-style vehicle, with fatter tires at the rear for better traction. Next is Gabarros and his unusual boat. The hull is from Belleville/Paradisa sets, where it is usually pink or white. TLG ought to have put it in the Pirate theme, as it is a nice, intermediate size. In this set, it is a small steamship. The temple is built on modular 8x8 green bricks which fit into square holes in the baseplate. This is the "treasure room." This square has a nasty double-spear trap. Careful... This is the top section of the temple, crowned by Achu the (mummified?) Incan. More modular sections (these are from the front of the temple site, across the river from the main building). El Conde: "You are too beautiful a woman to be wandering alone in the jungle, Miss Storm. Please, allow me to accompany you." Gail Storm: "I'm with Johnny, and I have a cutlass." El Conde: "I'll be on my way." Here's the finished temple, with all parts in place. Now for the traps... "Hmm, a giant ruby to bring home to the king." "¡Uf!" "That was embarassing. Miss Storm saw me fall..." "And now I've fallen again!" "I had better rest here before something worse happens." "¡Chispas!" "That's it, I'm leaving this place!" "Why me? Why?" The Verdict: This is a fine set, a set whose bare parts/price ratio does not accurately reflect the intricacy of its design nor the rarity of its parts. I had to buy replacements for some of them, and let me tell you, they are PRICEY! That green baseplate? $14. The little dark gray saucepan near the fire? Not available on Bricklink at any price. The brown boat hull? VHTF. With this set, parts quality trumps parts quantity. And the minifigures are wonderful! There's not a dud in the bunch with the possible exception of the very common Dr. Lightning, and even he is not bad. When you factor in the coherence of the color scheme and the brilliant traps, it is obvious that 5986 is a classic. 10/10 Edited by WhiteFang, 27 November 2008 - 05:33 AM.

Thanks for this great review, voltio! I never knew of this set 'till now, and it really looks great! I never paid much attention to those Aztec/Incan style sets, which I now regret. I love the bright colours used here, and all the great traps, there's so many of them, which is exactly what we can expect from an old Incan temple like this one. I'm surprised there's no catapult. Anyway, the minifigs included are also great, and am I right in guessing those bricks are printed? That would be fantastic, as they look amazing. That boat hull is new to me too, although I guess the fact that it's mainly in Belville sets explains that pretty well. Thanks again for the sweet review, do you have any other Jungle Adventurers sets you plan to review? ~Peace	positive
I've always wanted this set, ever since it came out in '99. I have never seen it close up (unless you count driving over it in Lego Racers 2), so thanks for the pictures and the great review. voltio, on May 26 2008, 04:43 AM, said: El Conde: "You are too beautiful a woman to be wandering alone in the jungle, Miss Storm.

A real classic, thanks for that nice and funny review, voltio! A well designed set, very playable with a lot of nifty traps, a very good use of that raised baseplate and really nice crafts. The MF characters´re excellent too! And although the color scheme´s great and original, especially with all these neat printed pieces, it´s perhaps the only part of that set that looks a little out of date today.... Nevertheless, the set´s plain charming and shows clearly that TLC don´t need licenses to do some distinct Adventurer sets.	positive
Thanks for reviewing this rare set! Since it came out in 1999 I have only seen this set in a toystore one single time, one single copy as well... It was in the summer of 1999 in Belgium (Arlon) in a store called 'Maxi Toys' (Belgiums TRu, I think). They had the three biggest Junglesets for sale there: these Ancient Ruins, The set with the beautiful black boat and the zeppelin. Being into Adventurers at that time I had never seen the entire Jungle theme (not even in a leaflet or catalog) and surprised as I was I bought all three sets. That was one happy Dutch boy in Belgium! Surprisingly the two smallest sets made it in very small quantities to my local stores in Holland (except for the pontoon plane and small raft which was my very first Shop at Home order). The spider's secret I bought off BL, which makes me the proud owner of the entire Jungle Serie. Back to the set: This was the first time in a long history of collecting Lego that I had a deformed piece: an 2x8 red plate was twisted, I twisted it back and it still serves it's purpose... I loved the whole steam-idea in this Jungle serie: the two boats both (including the one in this set) had nice steamengines and a very cool mechanic (yours has the wrong hat/hair btw) to come along with them. The skeleton falling down on the end of a chain was the most intriguing part of this set for me, it worked really well and when you were done scaring minifigures you could winch it up again ready for the next go. The only thing I did not really like about this set was the difference in wheelsize on the car, front small, back large and the way the palmtree consisted out of just three parts... All in all a great set that is becoming more rare and expensive as we speak/post. Get it! Edited by simonwillems, 26 May 2008 - 07:59 PM.	positive
The printed pieces are the real gems of this set. Beyond them, there isn't much to this set, though the boat hull is nice. The model itself, isn't all that great. The new Akator temple is definately a superior model (at least in piece count), but those printed pieces are hard to resist. Steve	negative
I absolutly love this set. This is in my opinion the best Adventurers set. It has it all; the falling bridge, the falling skeleton, the spear trap, and the classic trapdoor. It is a must-have set. Thanks for providing such a nice review.	positive
Wow, good review! I used to love this old sets, as I was greatly fascinated by Inca and Aztec cultures, and the Mayans technological marvels astounded me. I was thrilled to death when Lego released little Aztec figures, so of course I jsut HAD to buy some Your narration with the sig fig was hilarious, and the review was all around wonderful, keep up the good work mate!	positive
Thanks for the awesome review Voltio. El Conde is the man!	positive
I had one of these! It was awesome, it went well with the zeppelin. I can't remember if the box was one of those fold up the lid ones though. Can't tell from the picture.

Great review, 5150. Although, you might want to resize your pictures before posting them so they don't take forever to load. Quote Wow. I was skeptical of this Coast Guard line. I was actually the complete opposite. Ever since I saw the first pictures, I fell in love with the whole line.

All stickers i'm afraid. Though i'mnot a fan of stickers myself. Some sets (like Ferrari for example) take longer to put on than building the actual set. This one is not as sticker heavy as it seams though, and the ones that areon there really give the set that extra touch. Printed would have been preffered of course, but in this case i didn't mind it.	negative
5150 Lego, on May 29 2008, 07:12 AM, said: Thanks everyone for the nice coments! Its nice to finaly have a camera that can take some decent photos! makes doing reviews much more enjoyable! There is no real way to lift up the stretcher. Due to the crane arm being in the way there really isn't any room for any kind oflifting straps. The set does include a 1x2 plate with a hinge for the diver to stand on so at least he can hold on to someone, the crane lifts them up and then he can put them in the strechter. Thats my guess at least. As far as the motor, i don't believe it uses bateries since you pull out the motor, and all the button does is recoil the winch line back in. I have to say it does a very good job of that, and is very smooth. (as long as you don't have anything to heavy) One detail i forgot to meation is the shark. Its nothing new, just the basic shark lego has had around for nealy 2 decades, but it was a detail nothing less. Thank you very much for that information, 5150 Lego!	neutral
That's a very nice set. I'm having my doubts about getting it though still. The overall shape and size of the helicopter remind me of the real-life CH-53 military cargo helicopter. A very nice review. You've got the photography down very well I feel. Perhaps a bit of nitpicking but at the end where you assign a rating, if you do a rating with faces (which is fine by me) you may want to seperate the faces by a line. Otherwise it may become too crowded to the eye.	neutral

I'm rather fond of helicopters and have built many different types. This doesn't really remind me of any particular model, other than perhaps an EH. 101 Merlin and even that resemblance is very superficial. Just for the record: this is a Sikorsky Sea King and this is a Sikorsky MH-53 (a derivation of the CH-53). The only resemblance I see with the former is the colour scheme and with the latter the fact that it's got a fat rear-end, sponsons and six blades. It doesn't matter though, because I really like it. The colour scheme is great, the shape is nice, it's got quite a bit of detail and I just have to get my hands on the cockpit window and those new rotor blades. When I first saw the large aircraft pieces a few years ago I figured they were very much single-use parts, but the tail end doesn't look too bad. Pretty clever. I like the raft too. It really does look like the real deal. That the helicopter can't lift it really isn't an issue, because in real life they wouldn't lift the raft either. They'd use the rescue hoist to lift the occupants of the raft into the helicopter one by one (or perhaps in pairs). Imagine a storm with a helicopter hovering over tall waves with a big fat raft strung from a cable underneath it. The raft would catch a lot of wind and flop around quite a bit, causing it to loose all its occupants and also yanking the helicopter around, possibly causing the pilot to loose control and crash. Bad idea! Cheers, Ralph Edited by Ralph_S, 30 May 2008 - 11:09 PM.	negative
Thanks for the review! This set looks great and I really wish I had the money to buy the entire line. But unfortunately, I don't. I love the way TLC used the wing parts to the Jedi Interceptor for the life raft - very well thought of. Anyhow, great review!	positive
Thanks for the review Riddler. Your pics are a bit blurry though, if you want them a bit better you should sit your camera on a hard surface so you don't wobble it as much I love the Tumbler, though it is quite massive, but either way I'll be glad to get it.

Sinner, on May 28 2008, 11:35 PM, said: Care to explain why? Personally I think that aside from the colour scheme the new one is far better. Why? Suspension, more enclosed cockpits, bug-like appearence.... I suppose it's a matter of personal opinion though. I Just thought that the MT-101 was very skeletal and couldn't really steer that well, although I do like it. Also the MCM has a better design, in my view, as the wheels are closer together, making it look a lot more tankish than the MT-101. Also space in the rear isn't wasted on having a shuttle. CP5670, on May 29 2008, 02:52 AM, said: As for the hose/jetpack things, I always assumed that they were either welding torches or flamethrowers. Take your pick. Hmm....

Fluyt, on May 29 2008, 03:56 AM, said: Anyways, M:tron is one of the greatest space factions, with mega core magnetiser as my favourite set of these guys (even though I do not own it ). The only thing that bothers me is the lack of (reachable) controls for the minifigs to drive their vehicles (but iirc it is the same with a lot of other space-sets as well) yeah they could have used the normal levers instead of the pronged two piece things at the front of the cockpit. But there is certainly a lot to mod. Joebot, on May 29 2008, 04:25 AM, said: But the old M:Tron round magnet pieces are presumably discontinued.

CP5670, on May 29 2008, 08:55 AM, said: It looks like you're right about the old magnets. I got a few off PAB two months ago but they no longer have them. I guess I should grab some while they're still widely available on Bricklink, as they can be useful in a number of situations. On a side note, one interesting thing about this set is that it seemingly had two US/Canada names, Mega Core Magnetizer and Multi Core Magnetizer. Brickset, Lugnet and all the other sites I've seen call it Mega, but I have some North American catalogs from that time period that call it Multi and the box also says Multi on it. I actually didn't know the Mega name at all until many years after the M:Tron line. Hmm... I've never seen it listed as Multi, but now I guess it has three names, strange that M:Tron is basically the only Space theme that had different names depending on region... Clonecommando007, on May 29 2008, 10:11 AM, said: This does look alot better than the new MM drilling tank. Great work! Yeah, I should take a comparison, yet the boxart on the MT-101 was pretty cool.

This super set contains many of the city sets you can get for your mini city hospital. The smallest set is the 7902 car with a doctor. I thought it looked a bit too slow. Here is a car you can build with the same bricks. The instruction manual for the ambulance does contain a picture of an alternate model, but it is actually quite hard to build something significantly different. This sets lacks some SNOT-bricks, so I had to be a little more creative and came up with this ambulance. It is more a hearse than an ambulance. The helicopter has a lot of slopes, so I built a speed boat for those special emergencies. Unlike the first two sets, I used far from all the bricks in this. This set does really have some great parts. The brickshelf gallery with some more pictures. Is anyone up to the challenge and build some alternate models of the last set in the super pack - The hospital?	positive
Brilliant, a huge amount of creativity there. To do what you did with such limited piece counts is exceptional. They're at least as good as most of the alternate models Lego show on sets.	positive

Quote Looking forward to the review, this looks to be the best of the new Batsets. *gasp* Are you kidding me? Honestly, I hate this set. The batbike looks far too blocky, and that Hammer Truck looks super shoddy and thrown together. The only real reason I'd get it at all would be for the Harely Quinn figure - but I'd probably just get her separately on Bricklink. Besides, the Tumbler and Robin's Jetski sets look far better to me. They actually seem to have great vehicle designs. No new villian figures, I know, but still some great old ones. Er, wait a minute... oh yeah, hope your review gives the real scoop on this kit, Deino.	negative

The '08 Batman sets look like a step up from the somewhat lackluster '07 sets. This looks like a very fun set with a whimsical sense of style very fitting with Harley Quinn's character. The price isn't great, but I guess you gotta pay for that Batman logo. On the downside ... I am so over the good buy vehicle vs. bad guy vehicle concept. I really wish TLC would get over this.

Hi all, so I was at "The Wal-Mart" yesterday and had the munchies and was looking for something to eat. Somewhere along the line, I stopped caring about food and decided to browse the toy department to see what they had Lego-wise. Usually, they have jack squat, but on this particular day they had a lot of new sets. I impulsively picked this set up, along with Harley Quinn's Hammer Truck and the new little campsite from the Indy 4 line. I must say, when I first saw images of this set I wasn't exactly thrilled or anything. I mean, I didn't really see anything particularly special about it, but after purchasing it, I must admit that I would consider it a must buy for any Lego fan. But enough babbling about myself. Onward with the review (my first of an official set)! In this picture, you can see everything you get with the set. I thought the box-art was pretty nice looking. The manual, on the other hand, took somewhat of a beating within the box, a common problem with most more recent sets. I do have to say that I wish they would at least make some effort in fixing this. They could just make a little thin cardboard "folder" to minimize bending and tears. For Batman minifig collector's, the highlight of this set are the Robin and Penguin figs. Previously, you could only get them in the pricey Bat-Cave set, but this set provides a much cheaper alternative. One thing you will notice, however, is that Robin's hairpiece is a new mold, as it is actually a black version of Mutt's hair (from the Indy 4 line). Personally, I think it actually looks better than the hairpiece used on the older version of Robin. As the Batcave had before it, this set comes with some bricks to make two cute (but deadly) penguins. They help add more charm to an already charming set. When you're finished building, you'll end up with a nice little assortment of extra parts; 1 black "cheese slope," 3 1x1 tile (black, yellow and white), a revolver, a technic pin, and a 1x1 red round plate. Here's Robin's Scuba Jet. It's nice and sleek looking. Notable parts of interest would probably be the green turbine engines. My only complaint on this one would have to be the use of decals on the 2x2 round yellow tiles. For that type of a part, printing seems as though it would have been the best way to go. Now for, in my opinion, the best part of the set...the Penguin's sub. This set has more decals than Robin's Scuba Jet, but they seem more necessary in this case. I actually wanted to put the decal's on the sub, as I think the it looks great with them. Obviously, it looks like a penguin, but wow, does it ever do it with style! It has a lot of interactive features, the first of which I will mention, being the periscope which raises up and down. And for the collectors of parts in new colors, it has a few parts in medium orange?, such as 2x2 tile. Here's a shot of the bottom of the sub. Another nifty little feature is how you can lift the top off and fit the penguin inside. And there is enough room inside, so that you can firmly place top on again, and without interference to the movement of the periscope. Another little feature is the rear spring-loaded missile. You just tilt the small lever toward the front of the sub, and it fires. And the last small feature are the flick-missiles on each side. Overall, this is a great set with a lot to offer for a decent price. A lot of fans might view the only drawback to it as being the use of decals, but if you plan on keeping the kit together they make it look really fantastic. Buy it if you can.

Though you really seem to like this set, and it probably is a great one, I'm not a fan of the penguin sub, or at least I'm not from what I see. It's not for everybody.

I´m glad that you changed your mind, a review of a burger wouldn´t be half that interesting for sure. It´s just a mediocre set to me, but of course it´s always cool to get important MFs in less pricy sets. I like the Penguin´s sub from the Batcave more, just because they did a fine job on resembling a penguin without using a sticker.... Robins craft looks fairly nice, but the most useful parts of the whole set, for me personally, would be those indeed very neat green engines. Yes, it probably would have been nicer if they would have at least done a brick built beak for the front of the sub. Unfortunately, I never got my hands on the Batcave set, so I never was able to build the original sub.	negative
Thanks for the review! I love this set, i didn't think it was much at first either, but i really love it. Another cheaper Robin and Penguin is great, and those nifty mini penguins are awesome. The spare pieces are even nice! I love Robin's little scuba jet, those green engines are very nice and I love it compactness. Penguin's sub is even better, at first I was annoyed at getting two subs but now I realise it means I can have a fleet of them I'll be sure to mod over those cannons though, but the details are very slick. Thanks again. Batbrick Away!	positive
Looks like a cool set, but the hairpiece for Robin is vary disapointing, I would be so glad is they used the regular hair you see all the time. I hope lego will not make a habit of using that hairpiece on other figures.	negative
Set: 8635 - Agents - Mobile Command Center Pieces: 1154 Price: $US89.99 Those dedicated Agents. They've fought chainsaw-armed villains, battled radio-controlled cyborg crocs, chased pallets of badly-stored golden loot and wrestled killer sharks with vicious, toothy grins. Finally they've caught the notorious Dr Inferno and imprisoned him in their cavernous Mobile Command Center. But Dr Inferno won't go down without a fight! Can the Agents stop the evil Dr 'Disco' Inferno fleeing? Will Spy Clops laser gun burn through the door in time, or will Dr Inferno simply use the lovely Agent Trace's enormous ponytail as an escape ladder to freedom? More importantly, will there be a riot in the streets of Lego City as AFOLs go apopletic at the thought of a 12 wide truck roaring through their ordered town layouts? Stay tuned! Part 1: The Box, Instructions, Parts As the largest of the Agents sets (so far), the box is easily the biggest. Trainee agents, examine the following three pics and see if you notice anything odd. Box front: Box back: Box middle: Spot it? That's right. The printed cardboard which has supposed to be the bottom half of the fold out middle section is on the back, slicing the ultra-large set image which would form the foldout in half . The way the cardboard is printed as one piece before it's folded I think this would be very hard to do 'accidentally' so suspect a major stuff-up somewhere along the production line. I bought this set off bricklink so would be very interested if anyone in the States who has seen these boxes actually on the shelves can tell me if this is common or rare. Basically I want to know if I should be annoyed that the bricklink seller didn't list this in the set description, or are they all like this? The instructions come in 4 booklets. The parts list comes in at 5 pages, which is a lot even at half-size pages ! Large images of the parts inventory are in this folderwhen moderated for anyone interested. Here's also some cute Agents-type artwork at the end of one of the books. Instructions show piece call-outs and are divided into sections according to numbered bags. As you'd expect for a set with 1100+ parts, this baby comes with a lot of bags. It's a treasure trove of dark blue. As well as the obvious large slopes and wall panels which make up the body and the roof, there is a wealth of smaller navy blue pieces as well - small 1x1 bricks, 2x2 bricks, 1x1 plates, 2x2 tiles, heaps of 2x plates, some slopes, 22x cheese pieces... basically anyone wanting a lot of dark blue should think about this set. The roof panels alone, for example, could provide a dark blue sea for a modernised Pirate MOC. 2 DSSs (Dreaded Sticker Sheets). Quelle surprise - stickers! The grey parts of the stickers here are metallic silver ink, which is a nice touch. Actually, as sticker sheets go, they're not too bad. Fairly subtle for the most part and the navy blue actually matches the bricks themselves. However, after looking at the sticker sheets I thought I was missing something. What about the pieces used for the projection screens showing Dr Inferno and the sharks - why weren't they on the sticker sheets? There must be another one! Frantically I checked and rechecked the box and flipped through all the instruction manuals to find the elusive 3rd sheet. Where was it? Ten minutes later I noticed something which had honestly never occured to me - THERE WERE ACTUAL PRINTED PIECES IN THIS SET! So obvious and yet so unthinkable. It's horrifying how years and years of Exoforce and Speed Racer set releases can mentally condition people's thought processes. Tut tut, Lego. What have you reduced us to? Here they are, folks - ACTUAL PRINTED PIECES. (Yes, I do believe this news deserves the caps.) I also noticed this nifty modification of the usual 2x3 cupboard - you can now fit drawers in it! Very clever. This may have been around in Belville sets for years for all I know, but it's new to me. The drawers slide in and out very well and the top one sits on slight indentations in the middle of the cupboard. Part 2: The figs! Our trusty agents - Charge, Chase, Trace and Fuse. (High powered agents don't have time for names of more than one syllable - that's why the bad guys always lose ). Chase and Fuse have the Mutt hair in black and dark orange. The lovely Agent Trace has an exquisite new hairpiece in dark brown, perfect for 'Rapunzel' themed MOCs. As you can see, her ponytail is loooong. Makes it hard to sit down, the poor girl. I feel sorry for all these female figs with such intricate hairstyles that they can never relax in an ordinary Lego chair. However, at least she has two breasts unlike the recent Harley Quinn fig. Compensation indeed. Seriously though, it's great that there's a separate torso print for the female character and this attention to detail is typical of the set as a whole. Three of the agents have reversable heads - nice touch with the headsets and I like the ID cards on their pants. Obviously the agents security system is based on some kind of crotch measuring device. This would make sense considering the conspicuous bulges in the pants of Dr Inferno's men (see the other Agents set reviews.) The villains - Spy Clops, Dr Inferno, Gold Tooth. Dr Inferno's hair in all it's glory. This is a great piece, although the orange colouring is a little rough on the front. It's so 3D, it deserves a back and side view (and indeed EB thread) all of its own. As mentioned elsewhere, this is different plastic to the normal minifig hair, but it doesn't quite feel as soft as the Exo-force hair. It doesn't fall off as much, anyway. The figs get 10/10 from me. Awesome hairpieces in great colours for the Agents and a sleek navy blue/ neon green uniform. The villains' faces are great and they are all very distinctive. The attention to detail is outstanding and it's great to see a Lego in-house theme with characters as memorable and cool as figs from the licensed themes . Part 3: The build The build is divided into three stages - the small vehicles, the front of the truck, and the massive command center section. (a) Small vehicles First up, all the small vehicles. We have a small flyer, 2 buggies, jet ski, and a speed boat - all in glorious navy blue with little bits of silver detailing. Top view. These vehicles are all simple, small and well-designed. Probably the weakest is the flyer, only because the cockpit looks a little large. In fact, the small flyer is probably the weakest element of 8365 overall, which tells you how good the set itself is! In various threads here, this set has been heavily criticised for being way out of proportion. There's a reason for that, as we shall come to. However, the existence of these small sets should appease some people. With the new coast guard sets, for example, all of these save the flyer wouldn't look out of place on a City beach with a little modding. Here's an example - agents beach party! (Spongebob couldn't help but crash.) The villains only have one small vehicle, but they've been well-served in the smaller sets, and this one is a unique and clever design. I love the triangular shape and the simple but clever technique of making the arch slopes meet up around the propellers. It's sort of insectile in black and orange, and looks very different from the usual assortment of helicopters etc. (b) Truck front This thing is a beast! Seriously, look at it. It's chunky and mean looking. You don't want to mess with this baby. The build is really nice. Like a lot of Star Wars vehicles, it's all based on technic beams pinned together. Unlike a lot of Mars Mission sets, underneath isn't ALL technic beams with some plates slapped on like a facade. The majority is a lot of plates and bricks which all fit together solidly. You can see from the detailing of 'cheese grater' slopes and silver pieces on the front how effort has been made to give this vehicle a distinct feel different to other Lego sets. Sure, the silver slope mirrors might be a bit too much for some, but this baby is all about attitude. You can imagine it roaring down the road en route to Dr Inferno's diabolical lair! After all, these sets are 'Agents' sets - nobody said they were *secret* Agents (c ) Command center - whole assembly Here's a view of the whole thing assembled - inside and cool details to follow at the end. It's kind of hard to show here as it is extreeeeemely long. This is indeed a big set. The build for the trailer part of the command center is fun and very satisfying. Yes, there are large pieces but there is also a huge amount of detail. It is also solid as a rock. I remember being annoyed building the big Ferrari truck a few years ago - everytime you looked at it, an 8 x 16 plate fell off. The Mobile Command Center is solid - even with the hinged roof and special features, it is not delicate at all. Kudos to the designers, again as it is mainly a brick build rather than a technic one. I also like how the command center part connects to the cabin - it's not a special piece at all, just a technic axle going through two circle plates, but it works and it's solid. (Please note I've been selective about which stickers I've applied during the build.) Top view: The rear: Here's an example of why I like the build: (a) the designers have enough sense to put a ladder so a minifig can climb up to the interior when the command center is open (b) notice that although the ladder clips at the top, there is an *extra* clip there in the middle purely to hold it in place so it doesn't flap around and holds firm. I don't know if most designers would even think to put a ladder there let alone go the extra mile and put a mechanism to hold it in place. Pure class. Oh, and notice the greebly detail stuff to the right there too. The other side. This is probably the other weak part of the build - the bricky gaps at the top where the hinge to open the roof sits. It's a little gappy but the set is so big you don't really notice. (d) And now for the fun stuff - inside and neat details! OK, so we've built the thing. It's big. It's blue. The top of the trailer itself would make a good warehouse MOC for a harbour layout. But what about inside? Is it any good? What about all those small vehicles from the start of the review? Where do they go? Well, I'm glad you asked. Because the solution is superb. The small flyer folds slightly and slides into place here: Lift off the roof and you're away! The large buggy and the speedboat go under here: The jetski slides out of the rear here, attached to its own little platform: And the small buggy goes inside the main cabin. There's even a crane so you can lift it down. So now we know why this set is so large! To fit everything in! It's amazing that this functionality doesn't affect the aesthetics of the set as a whole. But we still haven't finished on the details. The front section has a very easy-to-swing-open roof section and missiles: There's also a command section underneath the bit where the flyer lifts out: And now for the interior. I have to say I really like this space. Not only is it packed with great stuff, there's also enough room for minifigs to move around. I hate bases where the figs only have about 2 studs to actually stand and walk. Aquabase Invasion is a nice set, for example, but the actual functional space inside the base is teensy. Claustrophobia! You know within a week they'd be fighting to toss each other out of the airlock. No such problems for these suave Agents, who have plenty of legroom *and* the ability to launch missiles from their ceiling. The whole of the interior: Zooming in: Moving from left to right. First off, the medicine cabinet. Looks like someone's been leaving secret mission dossiers lying around. The projector area for mission briefings. Dr Inferno recently changed his hair colour from purple to orange, it seems. Why are all these minifigs so obsessed with their hair? The projector folds down when the trailer is open. Push the button and the light glows on. Now Dr Inferno's hair is orange again! This is one of my favourite parts of the set. It works a charm. The batteries for these lightbricks can also be replaced - instructions are in the manual. Agent Charge considers shark-fin soup for dinner. Did I mention these projection panels are printed? The detail is very fine too. The tool section. Laptops sit in the middle compartment. You get some flippers, yellow scuba tank and various implements. I'm so impressed that the helmet is pearl silver with a different coloured visor too - there's so much variation in the parts in this set, you don't get the sense the designers are using the same thing over and over to save money. It all feels luxe and top-of-the-line, just like the Command Center itself. Two laptops - yay! The aforementioned rooftop missiles: The Dr Inferno cage. Nasty electric shocks! Bzzt! (You can see my reviewing skills are burning out now - sentences.... truncated...) Another example of detail - nowhere else in the set is a 1x1 transgreen tile used - they could have used a 1x1 trans green cheese wedge piece as there are others in the set, but they didn't. How does Dr I get out? Flick that lever on the right hand exterior and the door pops open. Spy Clops the loyal minion awaits his master on the other side. And there we have it. Take a bow, guys! There's a lot of spare parts. A suspicious amount of dark blue small slopes but I checked the instructions and didn't see anything missing. I have to say, I do like the new policy (since Speed Racer I think) of including these small slopes as extras. Part 4: Overall Rating If you've made it this far, you've got more stamina than Dr Inferno's army of cyborg animals themselves! As I said earlier, this set has drawn criticism for the size of the truck. However, large vehicles do exist - I grew up in a wheat farming area and as a kid the size of the lorries that thundered past carrying grain was probably intimidating to me as this monstrous espionage machine is to the good citizens of Lego City! On top of that, it *does* contain a plethora of 4-wide vehicles inside ! Criticism of this set on the basis of size to me also seems misguided as this is basically a playset - and it is a very good one to boot. As you can probably tell, I love it to pieces and wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone, whether for parts or for play value. Check out the parts list in this folderwhen moderated and you can see just how many excellent pieces it contains. A light-up brick, a flood of navy blue, metallic silver bricks - we're spoiled. 8635 is also an enjoyable build, with fantastic figs and top-of-the-line detailing. In a year when I've found City a bit disappointing after the run of great sets in 2006-2007, the Agents line has been one of the surprise hits for me and I can't wait to see what the designers come up with next.

Yay! I was waiting for this to be reviewed! Can't wait to see how it is, I love the look of this set EDIT: Wow! Fast going on the review there svelte-corps, I love the look of the instructions. Batbrick Away! Edited by Batbrick, 31 May 2008 - 06:10 AM.	positive
Man, tohse mini vehicles and minifigs are sexy as all heck! I love Dr.Inferno and the female pattern for Agent trace (is it just me or she almost "busting out"? ). I love the Dr. Inferno hair, and the reappearance of Spy-Clops and Gold Tooth is simply gold (yes yes, pun intended!) I have to say this is shaping up to be one of my favourite sets, well, ever! Batbrick Away!	positive
can't wait for the kick @$$ trailer review :D	neutral
Me want this set	positive
That's an AWESOME review. And a great set, it seems. With all of this year's Star Wars (I still haven't got Rogue Shadow) I can't afford Agents too, which is a shame looking at this.	positive
Thanks for another wonderful review, svelte_corps A very fine set indeed, I absolutely love the way all of the vehicles fit into the command centre, very clever. The projector is really cool, it looks very nice. It's great to see these light and sound bricks in the Agents sets. All of the little nooks and crannies in the centre are great too, I really love the amount of detail featured, mixed with all of the playability of this set. The minifigs - as usual - are brilliant, the uniforms look fantastic. Dr Inferno looks especially great, I love his white suit with hints of orange, and who can forget his hair? I'm really tempted to buy this beast now, though I'm not sure my wallet will forgive me for it. I suppose I'll have to cut back on Indy and Castle multiples for now... Thanks for the truly great review, svelte_corps, nice work	positive
Wow this set looks so amazing! Amazing! Genius! Da'vinci art I say! You've done an excellent job reviewing, and really, this is the review I've been waiting for. So cool! So classy! I love the mission briefing feature. To think that lego could go so high as to put something ingenious like that in there! Too bad Lego figures don't have fingers to make shadow shows, eh? Genius! The Jet lauching feature is pretty slick, and they even put a control center in there too! That's beast. Loving that. The bottom...I don't see how that big buggy can get out or in there, but, Awesome too! The back of the truck could use more detailing I think, but the jail pop-open feature is pretty cool, as is the speed boat storage rack. Cabin; it's great! That roof opening feature is a great part of this set. Also I think you can have multiple figures up there...maybe you can mod it to put a bed in there! It certainly looks big enough! Inferno plane, wow that think is smooth, baby! I love how the wings contain rotors inside of them!!! That's awesome detail right there. That is a sweet ship thingy, so slick. The rest of the command center is pretty awesome too; we get a 4x4 wheeler and a crane, and lots of room! Wow! Just wow! Great review, great set! You are well worthy of your custom title! I'm gonna go buy this for only $90!!!! WOOT!	positive
Wonderful review - one of the best I've ever seen on this site. Man, we thought this might be the weakest set in the line, but it turns out it may be the strongest! Everything about this set - from the color scheme to all the details to the minifigures to the piece selection - is just wonderful! I think this set has finally confirmed it: Agents is everything Alpha Team wasn't, and is how they should have done a spy theme from the start. Kudos to TLC for finally getting it right - and I sure hope there's a second year!	positive
wow, excellent review, thanks. That set sure looks fantastic. It's incredible how much features they've managed to pack in while keeping it roomy. I'm really impressed by the quality of the design. TLC is sure getting back on track with great design. ow... 2008 is going to be expensive...	positive
7645 - MT-61 Crystal Reaper Piece count: 600 Price: $AUD79.95, 49.95 Euros (in most countries), 39.99 GBP, USD 49.99 It's happened in the wider world, and it had to happen to Lego - yes, the 80s are back. Space invaders, holograms, compulsory seat-belt wearing legislation, and the return of classic Space. Ok, we don't have a fully fledged classic space theme back yet, but if 7645 is the way of the future, I think Lego is ready to do it properly. I wasn't a huge fan of last year's Mars Mission sets and only picked up a few on clearance, but this set is light years (excuse the pun) ahead of 2007's offerings. This mining vehicle is solid, compact, and well-designed. It looks impressive, and even better, it has fantastic Power Functions operability! Behold 7645 - MT-61 Crystal Reaper! (PS I wasn't joking about the holograms or seat belts.) Part 1: Box, Instructions, DSSs (Dreaded Sticker Sheets), Parts Front of box: Back of box: 2 x instruction booklets: DSS numero uno - for the Reaper DSS number two - apologies for the blurry pic but I wanted to capture the sweet shimmy of the metallic holographic background on this sheet The way it catches the light really makes a difference to the small alien craft and makes it look much more interesting from the plain stickers of last year. There's heaps of spare silvery stuff once the stickers are applied for those who use the leftover sticker material for customising. Parts bags - 4 numbered with one extra with larger pieces Parts everywhere - woo! I know the Lego instruction books scold me if I mix bags, but I'm a devil-may-care kind of guy. In your face, TLC. I love mixing all the parts together before I build, it reminds me of my youth when the days were long, anything was possible, and I didn't need strict instructions not to build on grass or poke my eye out with a technic shooter. Interesting parts - these may or may not be new, my technic knowledge is not that detailed. The little scoop parts are so cute and have a heap of potential uses. I love 'em. They're like Smurf hats at Miniland scale. These technic wheel things in orange are also cute. They kind of remind me of marigolds. Giant Fabuland marigolds! The track pieces - you get 70 of these - here's the section of track for one side - as you can see it's about 52 studs long. These hold together better than the small ones on the Hailfire Droid/ Jungle Cutter. Part 2: Minifigs, small mining transport, alien ship I have to confess - I forgot to take an individual snap of the astronauts . It's the usual bunch though - Scaredy Face guy, Sunglasses in Space Man and a third one I can't remember. You don't really care, though? You're only interested in the alien commander and his matching arms/ legs combo deal. As brickbitz noted in his review of the smaller set, the glowy eye is just a 1x1 cylinder. The set also comes with 2 normal jellies - one pictured here for size. You'll see what happened to the other one soon enough... The alien craft is nothing exciting, apart from the gorgeous glinting stickers. Here's the road safety angle. The commander actually clips onto a 1x2 plate with handle so he can't fall out! Then the lime tentacle thing descends on top of him to keep him firmly there, like a baby seat. Not very brave for an alien commander, is he? I mean, did Darth Vader ever use a seatbelt? Tssk. With cradle up: This part of the build also includes the small astronaut mining buggy - small and effective. (Please note in this build I've applied stickers to everything bar cockpit pieces.) This comes with radio and saw piece. Part 3: The Reaper! The first part of the build is the detachable shuttle. I really like the retro aesthetic of this with the angled wings and the side hoverpod things. It is much better than the comparable vehicle from 7699. The new flickfire piece is a waste of space - it's fairly limp. I prefer the simple flickfire technic pin to be honest. There's also a very nice little side workshop as you can see. I really like how the control unit is 'plugged' into the wall via 5 1x1 round plates (third pic, it's a bit dark). Great detail. [The technic pins on the back are there to connect the Power Functions battery box. It's odd they're included at this stage of the instructions - maybe the intention was to release it originally with all the necessary motors etc but the price point was too high and they scaled it back] The base. The shuttle sits on that bley technic axle in the middle when the Reaper is fully assembled. The little vehicle scoots down the ramp at the rear, which folds up to hold it in place when the Reaper is in motion. You can see there's a crystal container here as well - another nice small detail which I found the 2007 sets lacked. There's also an alien here - thankfully not in those horrendous trans-orange tubes so prevalent last year. The complete assembly. Isn't it snug? It's just the right size too - not massive but large enough to be a serious mining vehicle. The ominous black treads contrast nicely with the white/ orange colour scheme of the vehicle itself. The trans detailing - blue for weapons, neon green for energy - is carried nicely through the whole set. The blades and the scoops whirl nicely as the machine trundles along. Top down view: Tread detail: Whirling blades of death! The buggy descends: Probably the most disturbing aspect of the whole set is this pic: The jelly has an orange pump plugged into its heart which is connected to an energy supply on the left hand side! This vehicle runs on alien jelly juice! Either that or it's milking the jelly in some equally disturbing fashion. How amoral is that! I know there's been debate about this - the jellys aren't innocent, they're evil energy crystal thieving maniacs etc - but I find it a bit odd that the humans respond by chaining the jelly up to the bowels of their mining vehcile and suck energy from its heart. People debate about violence in Lego as represented by realistic minifig weapons, but I think the moral lesson here is even worse - it's OK to exploit foreign life forms for our own gain if they treat us badly first! (Who-fans, I think the Ood should have a word with the jelly Commander ) That aside, this set is well-designed and fairly good value at $AUD79.95. It's definitely a notch above last year's Mars Mission sets overall, with improved detailing and more useful functions. The holo-stickers are fab and it's nice to have an alien commander, even if he is a bit bulky and his fingers are identical to his toes. However, if all these reasons by themselves weren't reason to recomend this set, the following is.... Part 4: Power Functions The best part of this set - and the reason I bought it, really - is the integration of Power Functions. Bizarrely this isn't mentioned at all on the box and I only found out about it from the instructions when they were posted on Eurobricks! (Instructions for book 2 which has the Power function stuff available here.) This is a great idea and hopefully we will see more new sets take this kind of approach (especially with the new Train sets). Luckily I got Monster Dino 4958 on sale for half price earlier this year so already had most of the necessary motors etc - the only one needed was an extra small one. What you need is listed in the instructions below with redirections to Shop @ Home to buy the motors. Note there's actually a mistake on this page. The 2 small motors you need are both 8883 not 8882 (which is the large XL motor). Way to confuse the kids there, Lego! Attaching them was a dream and only took a few minutes (In contrast to 4958 where it was almost impossible to remove motor elements without dismantling the model). Basically the back platform and some plates and orange slopes come off, you attach the motors, and then the smaller plates go back on. These parts are now left loose: Overall the look of the Reaper isn't badly effected as you're mainly viewing from the front anyway: Sadly I can't show you how it moves, you'll just have to trust me that it does ! The way it is steered is demonsrated in the instruction pages above. Basically each motor is controlled by a corresponding switch on the remote. Move them both forward to move forward, move one right to turn right, move both back to move back etc. It zips along! It's a speedy little thing! Personally I wouldn't want to be in it's path as it comes roaring down the Martian canyon! (My cat was scared as it was.) It is oodles of fun and definitely worth trying if you have the motors or can get them cheaply, and adds a whole new dimension to the 'play' aspect of 'playset'. It is also as I said very quick to switch between modded and non-modded Reaper in contrast to the more fiddly Dino creations. The only problem I had is that if it moves too fast, the weight of the battery box at the back tends to pull the whole thing back and it rears up. It does correct itself though. I only trialled this on carpet last night so it may behave differently on other surfaces - I will need to experiment! Part 5: Summation This is a great set made even better with the addition of Power Functions. At $AUD79.95 it's well-priced. Buy it! Buy the motors as well (K-Mart still has stock of 4958 at $89, wait for a 15% off sale)! You won't regret it. Buy 2 and make competing battle machines! The only thing is... just don't torture that poor jelly Edited by Sinner, 24 June 2008 - 03:25 AM.	positive
Another great review. I'm looking forward to getting this set sometime soon. I wasn't aware of the power function aspect, similar I suppose to the old technic sets which had an additional instructions for those with the relevant motors. I knew those dino's I got at clearance would come in useful. Nice to see the recent "bulldozer" treads appearing in black. Grey seemed a slightly unusual colour choice.	positive
nice review the power functions is a nice idea and i ownder if it will appear in any other new sets? regarless if i get this (i decided to just to get what ever looks good in the shops from now on ) im defianltey picking up some of the white visors off bricklink	neutral
Isn't it a lovely set? I too have one. (modded, of course )	positive
Well I guess its nice that they're making the story background a little more clear. With that jelly plugged into the power cable... Hmmh, both Jellies and crystals can be used as power sources, think theres a connection? both of them are transparent and greenish... Maybe Jellies hatch from crystals like eggs? or need them as food? or something important like that? Yay for evil humans.	positive
Really Nice review! I love those sweet looking power functions on it, if only the orange bits could be replaced, then you could have a futuristic and motorized Jungle Cutter Anyway, the alien bit was disturbing, but the overly-tall new commanders look very, very cool! All in all, a great set, but I won't be able to buy it, because, in a few days, S@H will become 600$ richer and my wallet will writhe around in pain on the floor.	positive

Thanks for the review. I really like all the Mars Mission sets this year. The usage of the big wing is a bit annoying, but you can't blame LEGO for re-using the mold. I've been considering doing the same with mine! Mr. Mandalorian, on Jun 4 2008, 02:19 PM, said: So, that's all folks. Shall I include one last "bar" joke? I wouldn't have a bar of it...	neutral
Thanks for the review, Mr. Mandalorian! This is an, er, interesting set. Lots of frontal fire-power. Very big too, and I like the idea of those two little craft that attach on the sides. Sort of like little escape pod things. Anywho, not one of the things on my to buy list, but I do like that radio-active sticker, that could come in use. Looking forward to seeing your modifications, too! ~Peace	positive
Thanks for the review Mr. Mandalorian. The Alien craft is a bit small in my opinion could have done with being just a little bit larger. The main craft however despite its few minor flaws looks very good. While space isn’t my normal theme I’m certainly being tempted this year.	positive
Thanks for the review. I have to concede this does appear to be the weakest set of the summer MM lineup. I've noticed a trend that the larger sets have plenty of parts potential but when assembled the model is not more than the sum of the parts... Eagle Base certainly didn't seem worth the asking price, at least this is one large model. On a positive note the lame aero tubes, darts and martian carrier pods have disappeared. Don't get me wrong, I love MM and most of the lineup is great, this one just seems to fall a little short of the BAR.	neutral
I don't understand why there's so much negativity... this is actually my favorite of the new MM sets. The finished look is very sleek and not very gappy at all. The deployable landing pad is great, and it'll make it easy to put on a shelf without taking too much room. Lots of greebles... although I will concede that it's just begging to be modded. Still, though, I'm definitely buying this one. :) It has a really great look to it!	positive

Hello all Eurobricks members, I will be presenting my first review on one of the Harry Potter's set. Firstly, I must emphasize that I am not a very big Harry Potter fan or owned many Harry Potter sets. For this review, I will be highlighting what is the beauty of this small little set, and the reasons to own multiple sets of it. Comments and critics are strongly welcomed. This set is featured in the Harry Potter movie, Prisoner of Azkaban. This set is orignally released in 2004, align with the Harry Potter's movie. This was actually one of the movie scene where Buckbeak the griffin is appeared in the movie. The group of students are supposed to be having up close and personal with him. However, Draco decided to disturb our lovely Buckbeak. Enough of this movie synopsis, I am sure fans of Harry Potter will know this better. Box art Featured mini-fig/creature Background scene The scene is a simple garden, which had a very good mixture of spare parts for your MOCs building. On its own, there is nothing outstanding about this set, except for the griffin. You can buy multiple sets for the griffin alone and for Draco mini-fig. Well, you don't need lots of Draco. But for Castle lovers, black cap are exceptionally useful, at least from my view. Now, I will point out the following why this sets is so great for other reasons. Hidden cover Note that, this is the only mechanism which you can find in this set. It looks rather simple but quite useful. There are some little things hide in it too. Greens, Foilage and Brown parts Needless to say much, it offer 3 foilage, a green plant, 3 brown slopes, 2 ideal bricks and 1x1 brown brick for building a tree. Great for jungle building, forest building and etc. I am sure there are many builders will look out for these. Interesting parts It comes with a wizard book, owl, 2 printed tiles with a spider and stone prints on it. The far right, seriously I don't find any good use for it. Can any EB members enlighten me on that gray thing on the right? Grey parts It comes with a good 10 x 4 green plate. Useful for adding as a platform. Some more grey slopes for your MOCs. There you have it, Draco encounter with Buckbeak comparing with Deep Forest Ambush As you may remembered recently, there was an impulse set competition. One of my entries, which is under the History theme. The Deep Forest Ambush was firstly inspired by this set, and made an improvement out of it. Look at the improved tree compared with the orignal. Summary review Playability: 4/10 (Not much to play with, except swooshing around the Griffin) Design: 5/10 (Too simple and its defintely not related with the movie scene) Parts: 10/10 (Great for parts, explained by the review. A great deal of green and brown parts) Price: 9/10 (An inexpensive set based on the 2004 pricing) Overall: 7/10 (A must have for all Harry Potter fans and collectors whom needs a great use of green and brown parts) Hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine.

I own about 6 copies of this set!	positive
Thanks for the review, you made me very jealous... I want it also in multiple... But I don't own any of it. Oh, well for later then...	neutral
Thanks for that nice review of a really interesting and pretty cool set. At least, a Griffin, I guess, is pretty close to an unicorn or a dragon, huh?	neutral
Thanks for the nice review - it was one of the first ones I got when emerging from my dark ages . I bought two of these, just for Buckbeack - I thought he would make a good statue in a Persian temple type MOC. I also liked the minifig head pumpkin and plant part in bright green - both new pieces to me at the time. All in all, it was a good castle or forest building set with a nice selection of pieces for rocks, grass, plants and trees. The dark bley plume piece also now appears in the 10185 Green Grocer set as detailing on the roof of the turret.	positive
great review. nice set for plants, huh? too bad i didnt get thus set... but luckily my neighbor did! that griffin is nice for castle MOCs, and that orange head (pumpkin, i know) seems rare to me. not much else to say...	positive
Guys, thanks for your comments! Glad you find this review useful! And be sure to watch out for more old sets reviews. Mr Spielbrick, on Jun 12 2008, 12:28 AM, said: This Draco is the best TLC has made, if you ask me. The new one (also doubling for Belloq and "guards" in the Indy line) doesn't look quite as hautain as this one. Buckbeak looks cool. Looks like his neck/head can be moved, right? Rather similar to LEGO horses. Well designed. Mr Spielbrick, thanks for pointing out some important highlights for the review. I have overlooked it earlier. I strongly agreed with you, that this Draco is the best TLC made. I pretty like the face compared to others. Furthermore, I used my multiple Dracos, for my castle armor guards instead. One could not have too many Dracos. Buckbeak design is well made. The head can be moved upwards and downwards. The mechanism is similar to the horse design. In addition, Buckbeak wings can be removed. Similar to the typical green or black dragon wings that we used to see in the past. Well, the main reason for me to buy this set was in fact Buckbeak. You don't often find a griffin lying around except in Harry Potter sets. Mr Spielbrick, on Jun 12 2008, 12:28 AM, said: The orange brick doesn't have a pumpkin face on it, right? Unlike the one from Philosopher's Stone in the set with the troll. Sorry to said, there is no print on that pumpkin face. It's pure orange.	positive
Yay! The Monster Book of Monsters! Now I want this! I also love the Buckbeak figure! It looks very realistic for a LEGO version of something, usually they are much worse (Look at the goblins, for example)	positive
Hello EB! Yes, I'm cranking out the reviews! The other day I picked up this gem for an okay sales price at Devonport, Tas, while searching for the new Batsets. I informed iamded of this as he is a Spidey-suckup ( ) and he informed me this was the only set he didn't have of the Wave 2 of this theme. So I ask you great EB members to please remind him of this when commenting! Here we go with the review of Doctopus' lair: Anyway, unlike other reviews, this stars more people, the Batbrick-iamded-dragonator-Daisy review! (Daisy is the mouse that came in the set) First up re the figs, and I must say they are great. I love fleshies and these are excellent to expand my Batman world, plus having a Spiderman to beat up is good too Doctopus is great, though his tentacles are annoying to keep in order. Peter Parker is a nice addition, I love that torso. Eve though Harry Osborn was totally absent from this scene, I welcome him as he is a good fig also. Best of all is Mary Jane, fleshie females are hard to come by and I love that hair, my very first one! Oh, and even better is bley Daisy on the far right: Another fantastic thing is that by mixing MJ with Doctopus you get a far more deadly and real villain than anyone could've forseen - The Hippy! Oh c'mon, tell me that ain't cool? Anyhoo, here is a pic of Doctopus showing his might: Random fact: Did you know I influence both dragonator and iamded in their sigfigs? dragonator adapts his from my IA series while iamded added Mutt hair when I had him like that in a pic I posted. Now onto the box, sorry about the lighting. The art is good and the cartoon spidey in the corner may have beenthe inspiration for a similar style in the new Batsets: Back of the box. Again, sorry about the lighting and blur, it was gtting late and these were the last pics: Finally we get to the first part of the set: The catapult. Is that movie accurate or what? I love the part in SM2 when he uses his homemade genetic spider powered catapult to launch himself to the scene! Oh well, it does comes with a cool spider web an trans blue spider, so it gets some points: And it is really fun! I launched spidey several metres once, I don't think he ever recovered. Infact, he almost certainly webbed himself Slightly cooler extras are these two. This awesome little boat is great for city, as is the simple but nice bouy, Daisy approves: Naturally dragonator ruins everything when he found out the "dragon" that would be riding with him was our nickname for Daisy Now finally, the main attraction - Coctopus' Dock. iamded and I threw dragonator in the water to see if he could swim. He er, couldn't One Sweeney todd later, we continue! The overall construction of the building is very good. I know a lot of people hated stickers and i hated applying these, but they do look spectacular and perfect for any City setting, like a bank, a Gotham Bank As iamded has already noted below me the black lifesavers a very cool as are the web piece and log pieces: The inside contains the neutron copperplate triple bypass humdrum holy hum 5000, which does does, see movie. Anyhoo, it is very cool, and includes a little control thingy on the yellow brick next to it. Unfortunately, the inside is plain but for that: The other side has no wall too which is a bit of a letdown really, but atleast it allows Daisy easy access. one gripe is those yellow 1x1 bricks, they serve no purpose and break up the colour scheme: Better shot of the thingy thing. I quite like it, the use of technic parts actually works, and the whole set is worth it for those purple flames and dishes alone It closes up pretty well too, unable to hit the dish which is a nice feature: Me and iamded liked it so much we threw a revived dragonator into it. Unfortunately it disagreed with him, but it was fun: Another shot of the dock. I like how they have gaps in the jetty, I know the movie version was pretty wack, and although the set isn't very faithful to it (looks more like a seaside library to be frank) it still is very nice. This is my first large blue baseplate too which is wonderful, though funny how the set only uses about half of it: The roof is a well designed and fun feature, it uses some technic connections to render it flexible of any degree, as you can see here by my opening of it: Better shot of the roof design, it can lie flat or at any angle. I might use the design myself in the future: As much as I love the building this feature bugs me, for in order for it to work this wall has to stick out, which not only looks ugly but makes you be able to see through the corners. Still, easily modded, and log pieces are fantastic for mocing. It also means that there are 7 windows all up for a good, sizeable building: By pulling out the piece in the center the walls both collapss sideways outwards, which is actually pretty fun and works everytime: Overall view of the set including characters: Now for the story that makes no sense....at all: Spiderman is dead after falling down the wall mechanism (see above): Only Daisy can save the day! For dragonator is being held by the evil Doctopus! And iamded and dragonator are too busy not caring! And Brainbox is too busy complaining that this goes against all Marvel continuity! Unfortunately Daisy is on a lunchbreak so tough luck dragonator: And Daisy goes on a search for fortune and glory: Okay, this is what I think of the set: Build: 3/5 - Fun, but those stickers ruin the experience somewhat, and if you don't apply them the instructions are a bit hard to follow. Playability: 4/5 - Great little gizmos and bits, not the kind that keep you going like with the 2007 Aquabase, but good fun still. Design: 4/5 - Not very movie faithful no, but still a great little building and a smart design for certain aspects. Minifigs: 5/5 - Great figs with all different faces and very useful bits. Price: 2/5 Far, FAR overpriced even on sale sadly Total: 18/25 - A good set that could've been better with a few minor changes. Nothing wrong with it, but it doesn't really cross the line to greatness. That said, it has a lot going for it and definitely worth buying or atleast a look! Thanks for reading Batbrick Away! Edited by Batbrick, 13 June 2008 - 12:21 PM.	positive
Lookin' good so far! Though I must say it's Doc Ock, not Dok Ock... The catapult is, well, ridiculous, but the boat is very spiffy, and the buoy is a nice addition! I actually like the stickers on the window pieces, perfect for this building, and great for post-Apoc scenes. Black life-saver rings are a nice addition too.Anyway, hurry up dragonator and Batbrick! And Daisy! I want to see the rest of the review! ~iamded away!	positive
Great review as always, Batbrick! ) I always enjoy reading them because they really make my day! )))) I hope that we shall see more and more.... Good day, gentlemen! )	neutral
I got this set in 2006 in a 'Byrnes World of Wonder' toy shop. I dont remember how much, but it was a deal. The box was all battered but it had everything. Good review Batbrick.	neutral
Thanks for the review, even if it is a number of years late. I picked this up whn it came out, and thought it was a rather cool set (besides the catapult). Plenty of cool pieces, and the baseplate has found a use in the Batcave. Although I think my dad managed to spill some beer on it at one point. That was awful to clean off...

Great review Batbrick, I was curious as to what the interior of the building looked like, I still think that there should have been a few random chains or something lying around as they may add to the abandoned feeling that the ware house had. Though I have to admit that I really like the roof dock and minifigs as some of them make good average civilians that are somewhat hard to come by in todays sets . Great comic as well it seemed to add a lot to your review, hope you can review another Spider man set soon . BTW as Adam mentioned I believe you owe me a bar of soap, for reading your review ...

Wait... dragonator's not caring that he's being held by Doc Ock? What are you doing? A very nice finish to the interview, now I really want this set! The story at the end was neat (except for Spidey dieing! ) but my favourite part was the exploding dragonator.

You're right though - it wasn't movie acurate, as the actual movie dock was far shabbier and more trashed than this. Ah well, I guess TLC couldn't do everything. Thanks Grevious, it is a great set. The hippy is awesome, it was hard to take him apart. iamded, on Jun 15 2008, 08:46 AM, said: Wait... dragonator's not caring that he's being held by Doc Ock? What are you doing?

Nice review, but I have to correct something for you: valentin, on Jun 15 2008, 09:53 AM, said: One thing is that there's no known release of the V-wing starfighter by hasbro, nor the other well-known brands. The other thing is that being a star wars vehicle collector, I would really loved to see a replica toy of the V-wing.

Here's the 3rd of the whole batch of complete reviews done back in 2006. Hope you guys enjoy them so far. Product: 6206 Tie Interceptor Theme: Star Wars No of pieces: 212 Release Date: February 2006 RRP: SGD39.90/USD19.90 Availability: Lego Shop@Home, Target, Toys 'R' Us (US & Europe), Bricksworld (SG). Lego.com said: Challenge the Rebels! Blasting out of Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi, the TIE Interceptor is the fastest fighter in the Imperial fleet! Open the cockpit canopy and fold down the instrument panel to put the TIE pilot inside and recreate your favorite classic Star Wars battles! Includes TIE fighter pilot! Cockpit opens and instrument panel folds down! It does seem to have more pieces than the average tie fighter, but this is actually cheaper than the 7263 TIE Fighter. Of course, there's no light-up feature in this set. :sweat: YesH!! Finally... A... Tie Interceptor!! This is probably the most anticipated for all set for all lego tie collectors worldwide, since the fighter, bomber, advanced, and even the Expanded Universe droid fighter had been released by the Lego Group. This set is near movie-accurate, since the bottom part of it ain't. :p The cockpit and pylons uses the same design as that of the tie advanced piloted by Darth Vader. Except for one minor change, that is the aft interior of the cockpit is strengthen this time. And this is indeed good news, since the older models had a problem of hard hinge and loose brick connection. There's no landing gear for this set, but it doesn't require it anyway. This tie interceptor balances perfectly on its wings. Standard instruments panel and, of course, standard imperial pilot. The "swoosh-able" or play factor of this set is definitely very high... Just take a look. :D *Camera view from own craft* *Camera view from Tie-Advanced* *Combat simulation of Endor's Battle from the archives* No bomber, since I started late in re-collecting. :p To conclude, for a typical lego fan, this set is a 60/40, 60 due to it's good design, and for a typical star wars fan, this is a must-get. The only flaw for this set is the same flaw for any lego set in SG, the price. :doh: Comment(Current in 2008) Being a starwars fan... no... being a typical toy collector, space is definitely a premium... so much so that I turned to lego starwars to sate my appetite for more starwars products when I already have no more display space. For the next few non-lego pictures, they are the crown of my starfighter collection in 1/18 scale. So just view them for fun, eh? And no, I haven't had the chance nor the time to do up a scene of my lego starfighters blowing up spectacularly since the pieces would be very hard to put back... Hmm... then again, isn't that what lego is about. "doH".	positive

Ahhh bag building... that takes me back. I suspect that if I didn't do my bag building topic my EB life would have turned out very differently. For the negative nancies, I suggest you try it. I bought a set just so I could, and I found it fun. (Not fun enough to do it again though!) Thanks for the interesting review.	neutral
Great review Indexing it, as I write this. How come You think the CTT is the AT-ATs predecessor? Do you mean the motorized AT-AT or AT-AT's in general? I think this is a great set and I am very fond of mine. It's one of the few SW sets of mine that is on "parade" at all times. Most are packed away in the attic.

10143 Death Star II Production year: 2005 Pieces: 3441 Minifigs: 0 Price: 299 USD peeron.com 10143 Gallery The Review Ph4tDuD3:"DS review!!!?!!! - u 2 kewl 2 do diz" Me:"Yes" Ph4tDuD3:"Kewl..do u have pix of the minifigs?" Me:"Erhm..what minifigs?" Ph4tDuD3:"The ph4t figs from the DS!!1" Me:"This is the other Death Star" Ph4tDuD3:"OMFG there's more than 1" Me:"Yes" Ph4tDuD3:"keeeeewl. must have!!" Me:"Goodbye" [pushes the incinerator button] Ph4tDuD3:"wut?! nooooooooooooooooooo..........." and on that note, let's start the reivew of the UCS DEATH STAR II. Now this is an older set (2005) and I've only gotten around to buying it a short while ago. It took me around 2 evenings to build it and I must say that I am fairly impressed by this set. Time for a box pic: The Build: Since I started building this huge (small moon size) set at Morten's appartment, I wanted to keep as few polybags open at any given time as possible. With this set it is actually possible to have a minimum of bricks scattered over a table or two while building. Not sure why, but the division of bricks in the different polybags just work very well. And that is great with a set this size - 3441 bricks. The building of the set is divided into several "Build this times x". For example the upper and lower part of the "unshielded" DS are completely alike. This is difficult to see when looking at the model, but heaven when building it: And this is how they solved the problem of having the wings connected to the buttom of the Death Star - geniously done IMO: Note that in the first pic the "skeleton" is easily seen. "The skeleton" holds the X to which both the upper and lower part is "clicked" on with technic pins. Also there's a steering wheel (I'm sure there's a pirate name for that ) like the one in the bottom, in the top of the model to hold the upside "wings". So after having build duplicate wings (upper and lower), the "belt" (all the way around the star) and the upper and lower part of the "unshielded" side, it was time to step back and watch the Death Star II in all it's glory: Such a great UCS set. Now I did have a few "huh's" during the build: HUH! #1 In the instruction the technic lesser-dragon-head should be dark grey, but I got it in light gray. Go figure and thank you replacement parts. I've experienced this before and apparently TLG uses different colours when "out-of-stock". All one has to do is call them and ask for the right colour and it's on it's way Still a HUH! experience. HUH! #2 Again it appears that TLG changed the design of the technic axleholed 1x2 bricks. The bottom has changed and I got the set where it was mixed up between "old" and "new" version. Not that annoying, but still got me perplexed as to: "Am I doing this right?" Kinda stressing to consider taking most of the star apart to check the remaining 231 technic bricks 1x2 with axlehole. Now for a verdict: : 1: looks great 2: even my "wife" likes it - female appeal 3: it's a great build 4: the polybags work for you 5: it's Star Wars 6: the design is awesome : 1: it wobbles if you touch it 2: very small parts come off, if you touch it 3: parts come off when you try to move it somewhere safe 4: zero swooshability So in short (yes even shorter]: The DSII is a well designed UCS set that has a great design. Like most other UCS sets, it is not meant for play - hence don't play with it. UCS verdict (the numbers) 5/10 (design++/instructions+-/bricks+-/sturdiness--/colourscheme+-) design: awesome look and great greeble set instructions: easy to follow steps with bricks mentioned hard to see wether it's black or dark grey bricks: loads of great bricks a zillion bricks of the same type sturdiness: DON'T TOUCH colouscheme: grey in grey with a little touch of black Need a missing instruction? Then click the logo	positive
Thanks for the review KimT - it comes at a... confusing time You can take off the top disk and lift it like the Millennium Falcon from the top Now. I actually don't like this set that much. It takes about 5 hours and 15 minutes to build if you do it in one go, but the repeating sections makes this built the most tedious I have experienced. It has way too many holes from which you can see the colorful skeleton and is overpriced compared to the older 10030 ISD. I remember thinking it was too expensive when it was 50% off at S@H! Even the Snowspeeder was "kewler" to less than half the price:	negative
Thanks for the review. Eh, honestly, I though this was awful ever since I first saw the pictures. To me, an incomplete grey ball doesn't really work as a special UCS kit, for the sole reason that it's BORING. Extremely so. Now, the new Death Star playset is a whole different story. They should have done that in the first place. Edited by Grevious, 24 June 2008 - 09:12 PM.	negative
Lasse D, on Jun 25 2008, 06:04 PM, said: Here are some advantages that makes ISD win for me: - A lot more fun to build with less repetitions - It is easier to build alternate models from it! (How many alternate models of the DS2 have you seen?) - The bricks are more varied. - You get magnets! - It is a larger set if you look at the size - It's more intresting to look at - It's got more variety of nooks and crannys	positive
Dang! So much negativity on a such spectacular set! This baby provides an amazing backdrop to any Lego inspired Star Wars diorama. And lets face it Lego tends to be a rectangular brick and somehow we now have a sphere!!! Guys... its a UCS. It accurately depicts the on screen icon and put plain and simple is a wonderful sculptural piece of work in its own right. I agree with KimT in that the removal of the laser and Super Star Destroyer gives it more authenticity but to call it a gray golf ball or ignore its inherent accuracy is simply to miss the point. It proved to be the best build to share with someone, be it family or friend due, to its repeated sections and impressive finish. Its a clever build and to criticize it for lack of playability or (I suspect for many) its absence of minifigs is just absurd and possibly why Lego has not released a proper UCS in nearly two years. I reckon many out there would love a UCS Tyderium, Imperial Walker or Slave 1 with a spectacular piece count be it minifig scale or just darn impressive in its own right. Sadly for those who love these sculptural masterpieces we're stuck with simple toys with 'play features' and cute minifigs. Clever in their own right but lacking the clout and purity of the old UCS line. Let's hope some diversity of product is just around the corner else 10179 was the last of the truly brave financial gambles of the Star Wars line....	positive
I decided to re-read this review because I just got this set today. I dont really have a concern over the design or repeating build process because owning this set was never an option for me as I collect UCS sets... But I am surprised to see an almost total lack of positive posts. I really hope that I enjoy this build.	neutral
I bricklinked it too back in the day. It was an interesting build - just thought building the "unfinished" hemisphere was kind of tedious.	negative

nice review, i bought a couple of these for parts, the only thing i dont like about the ship itself (not the lego version, it does fine) is why is the Grand Droid General flying around in in a small fighter like this, i prefer the battlefront interpretation witch uses it as a bomber. anyway, great review! -York	neutral
Great set, great review! I have it too and I am very glad to own it! It will probably be the cheapest and best way to get a Grievous fig for a while (even though it doesn't come with a cape ). You guys know that you can use the new robot/skeleton arms from the Castle sets to make him hold his lightsabers horizontically, right? I always have him with two of each kind of arm.	positive
Ah, sweet! Thanks for the review, WhiteFang! I hope this set shows up in NZ soon, I can't wait to get my hands on it! Troll Warrior ON! ~Peace	positive
Nice review, i will definately need a few of these!	positive
This is a nice way of building up orc armies, but I do wish it was designed like the Knight impulse set. There you have a minifig, enough weapons and armor for two figs and a weapons rack made out of basic pieces. Add a generic fig from your collection and you have two knights and the pieces from the rack can be easily used in MOCs. The pieces that make up the siege weapon in the Orc impulse are not as easy to use in other creations. I'd rather have seen a "Orcish" weapons rack (different from the Knights rack, but like it, using basic elements) with a second helmet, another weapon, the Orc armor and a shield to put on it. Still, although not as good as the Knight impulse, it's a nice little set. WhiteFang, on Jul 4 2008, 03:43 AM, said: Tom and Jerry is reflected as a cartoon. Children associate Jerry as a mouse, since its supposed to be heart-warming and make us laugh. In real life, there are many different pets we raised. One of the possible pets we considered is a mouse. Mouse are supposed to be shy and friendly creatures that live in harmony. While rats lived in packs, hunt food in the dark and is widely regarded as a "pest". Where I come from people keep both as pets. However, if either are found in the house uninvited, they are considered pests. And if you look at the Chinese zodiac, rats are very well thought of and are symbols of prosperity.

Hello all Eurobricks members, I will be doing a continuation of my Impulse set reviews. I was pretty excited when I laid my hands on these new impulse sets yesterday. Hope to give most of you a good insight for this set. Name: Street Cleaner Theme: LEGO System / Town / City Year: 2008 Pieces: 22 Minifigs: 1 An image of a 5620, Street Cleaner Let the cleaning begin The Street Cleaner has a job to do. It is to clean the rubbish on the streets, after a New Year Countdown. It seemed the cleaning agency have a new equipment to use. It's not as big as the previous street sweeper machine. The cleaner will need to operate the equipment manually, by pushing it. Look at the mess After sorting out Look at the pieces offered. It's not a very complicated set, since it's an impulse set. There are some pretty useful parts lying around such as the broom, spade. However, I was quite surprised when I could not find the lid of the rubbish bin. I can't used this rubbish bin to place it around my town, without a lid on top of it. I believed it is not a norm, by not including the lid. Look at that bin Well, that rubbish bin seem to be containing his equipment in it, instead of the rubbish. The cleaner's face looks pretty sad. I think he wants to have a change of job. Front View I love that blue brush very much. Quite fun to play with, especially pushing the rubbish aside. That's why a spade is there to help him to dig out the litter and the broom to brush it away. Ok, now I know why his face looks so sad! Where is that Street Sweeper machine? Summary review Playability: 6.5/10 (Not bad to play with) Design: 7.5/10 (The design is relatively interesting, with the use of the technic part, to be its foundation.) Price: 8/10 (An inexpensive set to get another cleaner and some neat accessories.) Overall: 7/10 (Not a bad set after all. Pretty average, but still quite good to buy if your towns required more cleaners.) Hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine. Comments and Critics are strongly welcomed.

Thanks for the review . Not a bad price (of course, its impulse) for a fig, a little cleaner thing, and two accesories. The brush, fig, and spade i dont have yet, so i might just pick this up.	positive
Excellent review; I like how the new coast guard sets blare out NEW when you see them.	positive
Thank you for the nice review. The set is nice, the pieces are nice. And the grey helmet is great for an additional Star wars rebel technician.	positive
Thanks for pics. The Hawk, it seems to me, lacks a cockpit, theres not even a seat to keep the pilot from falling off. Perhaps it they'd redesigned it to be a backpack jetpack sort of unit using similar pieces, it'd at least make some sense? Based on the other MM impluses, Can we assume this goes for 3.5$USD? at that price it seems to me, that the Astro Fighter at 5$USD was already a superior impluse set. Guess I'd buy one on clearance, for the minifig.	neutral
I really like the look of this Impulse set! even though i sold off my MM sets to buy SW i kept my Astro fighter and this impulse set really appealed from the moment i laid eyes on it. I feel the swooshability and cool extras like the double sided face far outweigh the lack of cockpit. Thanks for another great review Whitefang!	positive
I like this one aswell, It has a couple of parts i need for an MOC train locomotive and I don't have any of those space guys yet. and a double faced guy is always a winner in my book	positive
Once again, another outstanding review by svelte_corps! I am not a very big fan of Agents, but this theme defintely offer plenty of useful parts. This Volcano Base is simply fanastic for parts usage, especially in doing up landscaping, with mountains, by making use of the brown BURPS. I must admit that the exterior looks real cool, but the interior looks rather empty. These orange slopes certainly make a great illustration of the larva, which gives the Agents a hard time to infiltrate within its compound to save his comrade. I am quite sure, this set will defintely attracts lots of kids to coax their parents to buy it, since the bright colors will defintely caught their attention. With all those hi-tech, sleek weaponary, I am sure this is the next big thing for kids out there. Well, I am not sure if this theme works for me as well. But this set defintely works well for landscaping project.	positive
Thanks for another great review! I definitely like this set. Sure, the interior might be a bit bare, but I think that the outside of the base with all of the great lava and rocks more than makes up for it. It is a bit weird that on the one side there is nothing on the inside. But that's easy to fix. Anyone know when this will be out in the U.S.? Thanks again for the fantastic review!	positive
droool Must buy!!!!!! To Svelte_corps: How on this wonderful planet, did you get that??? I thought it was coming in september!!!	positive
Excellent review SC. Thanks for sharing. The figs are awesome. I really like the female villain - an excellent face. I also like the agent uniforms. The laser gun is perfect. It has that Peter Sellers/Pink Panther dooms day device look that I envision when I think of laser destruction. The volcano has some neat features as well, like the trans. red/orange lava. It is a bit heavy on stickers though, as are many new sets/themes. But overall, I think this set will really appeal to the kids. - A great review of a neat set.	positive
Honestly I'm too much of a Space fan to be interested in this set. I'd rather have the sub. Good review though. :D	negative

Great review and such a nice figure! I consider Rock Raiders space too. I also consider many of the diver themes space as well... I've yet to own a Rock Raiders set. I have tried to buy a few off eBay, but they always went too high...	neutral

The Rock Raiders are very sci-fi, with the best Lego Space storyline. The Aquazonies would be inner space rather than outer space though, but they look very 'spacey'.

7663 Sith Infiltrator Year: 2007 Number of Pieces: 310 Number of Minifigs: 1 Price: 29.99 USD Brickset Hello everyone, and welcome to my second review on Eurobricks, the Sith Infiltrator! Lets start with a pic of the box, shall we? As you can see, its a Limited Edition set, meaning the fig and set could be worth a lot in the future. This set takes about 20 minuets for the seasoned builder. An overview of the Infiltrator (also know as the Scimitar): As seen in the picture, this ship is very sleek, with very few studs on top (SNOT= Studs Not On Top). Basically, Its the cockpit with two wings (with two "fins" on each wing), attached to the hull. Heres a side view of the Scimitar: Very cool- looking! It lands on two "feet" in the front while the cockpit rests on the ground. Rear view: The back. The outer cockpit is beautiful, a printed piece on the back (no dreaded sticker sheet! (DSS)) and a large printed disc on top: Heres a look at the middle: There is a flick-fire missile (trans-red cone attach to Technic pin) on the inner wing, a trans-red lightsaber blade in the back of the hull, and a trans-red lightsaber blade in between the fins on either side. All of those lightsaber blades may come in handy... Hey, look: the fins open from the wings!: The fins open due to double hinges on each fin. Unfortunately, you have to hold the ship up in order for the bottom fins to open. Now, lets have a look inside the cockpit: To open, you lift the back printed part, which is attached to the printed disc on top, which is attached to a hinge. It opens pretty smoothly, but is somewhat loose, so sometimes it closes on its own. Also, the disc isnt secured well enough to the door, and often breaks off, even with the smallest movement to it. Inside, there is an elevated control panel and two sliding pieces near the floor. This ship also comes with a small speeder bike: Its very cleverly built, and is a really neat addition. See that clear disc on the bottom? It fits perfectly into the sliding pieces in the cockpit: Hmm... whats this?: A hidden compartment! Now this was a very cool idea by TLG, a secret compartment found by taking off the top slope of the hull contains Darth Maul's weapons and tools which include: A (CHROME!) lightsaber hilt, a pair of electrobinouculars, and three probe droids. A closeup of a probe droid: Just a plain, black minifig head with a black lever on top. Finally, the fig: Darth Maul in the flesh plastic. A good fig altogether, with a black hood and lightsaber blades taken from the ship. He did come with a crisp, new black cape (packaged in a small, white cardboard box), but I am currently using it for another fig. Note that this is a limited edition fig, so stock up. A comparison pic of the two Mauls: The 2007 version is on the left, and the 1999 version on the right. Note a few key differences between the two: the new one has smaller red tattoos and a smoother torso. Also, the new one has bigger eyes and a more cartoony look. Maul on the speeder bike: Of course, he fits perfectly in the cockpit wile sitting on the bike, and he can reach the controls: Well, thats about it, here is the... FINAL VERDICT: Build: 8/10, easy and fun, breaks every once in a while. Playability: 7/10, this set has many features, but is very fragile between the cockpit and hull and between the two cockpit pieces. Swooshability: 1/10, too fragile to fly around, plus the flick fire missiles fall out. Minifigs: 9/10, a great fig with a chrome hilt and a double sided blade. A little cartoony. Design: 7/10, very clever techniques, very sleek, but very fragile. Price: 8/10, fair enough, could be a few dollars cheaper. Overall Score: 6.5/10, a very sleek ship with clever building and play techniques, but very, very fragile, and shouldnt be picked up off of the shelf too often. And with that, my review is over, but all of yours are not: comments and thoughts very welcome!! Edited by JimButcher, 15 September 2008 - 02:59 AM. indexed	neutral
JimButcher, on Jul 10 2008, 09:44 PM, said: A hidden compartment! Now this was a very cool idea by TLG, a secret compartment found by taking off the top slope of the hull You're supposed to slide the front of the hull off, rather than lift the top piece off.	neutral
I'll be honest - I don't like this ship at all. It's one of my least favourite ships in the PT and I have to yet buy either one of those sets. I also found it funny that this set was meant to be a Walmart exclusive yet never appeared on the shelves at my Walmart. Anyhow, thanks for the review!	negative
Led ZePPelin, on Jul 10 2008, 04:46 PM, said: You're supposed to slide the front of the hull off, rather than lift the top piece off. yeah, I was looking at the construction booklet and it reminded me of that (I forgot about it), but that makes it more fragile.	neutral
Trudop561, on Jul 11 2008, 06:30 AM, said: I got this set last year. And I think you made a mistake when you have remove a piece to access the probe droids and equipment, you just have to slide the entire main part. And I have a question, is this equipped with the new flick-fire missiles that don't fall off? Yes, I realized the first part . as for the flick-fire missiles, the do fall off very easily.	neutral
A very neatly designed Sith Infiltrator, though I think it lacks the size of the older version. A fine ship, but not what I would call a Sith Infiltrator. It should be bigger. Thanks for another fine SW review KimT	negative
Hey all! So I purchased the remaining three Agents sets I needed, and saw that there was no review up yet for this set! Heres the first batch of parts, and the first instruction bits. The mini figures. The first small vehicles. Heres a mistake that I found in the instruction booklet. There is no difference between steps 2 and 3. The team Inferno boat. This is a nice chunky boat, that looks fairly heavy duty and evily. Its nice to see the smooth disks on the bottom, that LEGO seemingly havnt done in recent boat/plane sets. And the Agents Submarine! This is a nice build aswell. Nice and long, with a few hidden compartments. One for missiles. A place to put the treasure! Some final shots of the completed set! The spare bits! Another special mention has to go out to Slime Face. I think he is my favourite ever LEGO character. The detail on his unique torso is brilliant! His head is fantastic! And his costume just looks great, with the black and green (Plus green is my favourite colour!) Check out the back of his torso, with the slime pouring down! Deep Sea Quest was £34.99 Price ; 9/10 - This is a pretty reasonable price for a fairly substantial set. Parts ; 8/10 - A lot of nice bits, few nice boats bits, and a lot of smooth disk things. Minifigures ; 10/10 As I said Slime Face is my favourite LEGO character, and the details brilliant! Vehicles ; 8/10 Both very good, with some interesting features. Build ; 8/10 A pretty fun build. Overall ; 9/10 Its gotta be, if just for Slime Face alone, but this really is a great set!	positive
He does look a bit different though...although it hasnt come out well on the photos, there is some green printed slimey bits on his head aswell. He honestly is amazing.	positive
Nice review ReZourceman, I wanted to see one of this set. It seem's there isn't much to it other than what it looks like in the official pictures, but I may well get it. I like Slime Face!	neutral
I feel like a N00b asking, but what is the USD price? I didn't see a price in the review.	neutral
Great review. This set totally OWNS Alpha Team Deep Sea. The sub design actually LOOKS like a sub, the figures are way better, the acessories are better - everything is better! Agents may have my vote for the best theme of the year. Quote I wonder if it will last longer than one year (unlike other recent one-and-done themes). Oh don't worry - a second wave will be coming next year. This was confirmed by both legomilk and in an interview with an Agents designer.	positive
Batbrick, on Jul 19 2008, 09:53 AM, said: Is it impossible or just very hard to mod? Nothing is impossible to mod! Probably the easiest part to change would be the front where the missiles are and the treasure chest slides out - you could make a sizeable compartment there. However the middle section is so narrow and the end fins are just that - fins - that it might be harder to expand without changing the shape of the sub. You'll find out soon when yours arrives! Batbrick, on Jul 19 2008, 09:53 AM, said: The octopus sounds great, thanks for that, is he meant to be on any side? I'm guessing he's a mutant Inferno creature. About Slime Face, is his head much different to the Joker bombs? I know he has slime marks on his head, are they very apparent? It's not really clear but since all the other mutants are evil (or at least controlled by Dr Inferno), it's probably a safe bet the squid is too. Slime Face's head is different to the Joker bombs - different eyes and teeth (although the smile is similar I guess) and the slime marks are much more apparent in the flesh (or ABS) although they don't photograph that way. Joker bomb face below for contrast:	neutral
Wow, thanks for the review, that is one awesome set, Slime Face is excellent! I must add him to the collection, I think we need some new agents, there's so many Inferno minifigures now... Maybe next year? thanks again!	positive
6927 All Terrain Vehicle Year Released: 1981 Piece Count: 167 Minifigs: 2 List Price: $14.50 A very unique vehicle in the Classic Space collection was this "All-Terrain Vehicle" which I always considered more along the line of a Mobile Lab. The set introduced/infused white and black bricks with classic blue space pieces. The result was this great classic vehicle. The set includes two figs (still red and white): Here's a view of the vehicle which is really two components, the vehicle itself and the lab section: I absolutely loved the the blue windshield slopes (2 included), and the unique upside-down large blue slope: In the back of the vehicle is the blue lab: The back section of the vehicle has hinges that allow the jets sections to open: The brick design fits perfectly into the lab, and when opened, the lab falls to the ground: NOTE: the little round trans. red 1x1s allow the lab to slide up and forward when the jet sections are closed. I tried taking off the red 1x1s and the lab does not lift as easily with them. The design is very clever, esp. for a classic set. Here's a shot of the stand-alone lab: Unlike earlier Classic Space windows, this set has train window frames with yellow windows. The top of the lab lifts up for playability: Inside the lab are several computers and a swivel chair: Back to the vehicle, here's a shot of the cockpit with white steering wheel: The left side has an upside-down wrench and black antenna: The right side, a walkie-talkie and another antenna. The antennas can be used as breaks to keep the middle wheels from moving: Here's ashot of the under carriage: And a final shot of the complete set: For those of you following my Classic Space reviews, this is review number 9 of 10. My final review of an-all time favorite will be coming soon. Hope you enjoyed this review. Comments are always welcome.	positive
Quote Great buy on this one. What did it cost you? It was $30, which was a pretty good price given the condition. It had no box or instructions though. This set is actually fairly common on ebay though, considering how old it is. I see them pretty frequently on there. Quote It's a real nice set. However, there is one thing I don't understand about this design. Why is the driver seat has a wide back with no cover behind? And, the command center has no door at the back? I understand that these Space guys are always carrying their helmet around, for oxygen supply. I wonder if there is a better answer to it. I just modified mine to make everything fully enclosed: Edited by CP5670, 11 July 2008 - 06:39 PM.	neutral
Awesome review Brickster! I didn't you are also a Space fan Oh how I love Classic Space The all time perfect LEGO space related theme Everytime I see one I want to buy them more and more, when compared to modern fang dangled sets with detailed figs and cool new accessories, they have nothing on Classic Space, simple beauty Maybe its the blue/grey/trans yellow color scheme Classic Space Forever Edited by Piranha, 30 August 2009 - 07:51 AM.	positive

I ordered the set via S@H and it cost 34.99€ in Germany, 37.99€ in Belgium and 50$ in Australia. It looks like it´s a exclusive set, but without the 2limited edition" sticker on the package. In the USA it´s not aviable, now. I think it costs as much as the rocket ride (30$). @ Mrs Pegleg: He has the same, short pants, like in the other sets.	neutral
Nice review, the set looks promising.	positive
I never have buy a Sponge Bob set but this looks so cool so maybe... (Just maybe) I will buy it . I am curious of why TLC haven´t done the Flying Dutchman ship, it was in the first rumor list of Sponge Bob sets, that surely will be a must .	neutral
The official name for this Lego set is "The Emergency Room". I have all the other SpongeBob sets, including three Krusty Krabs, two Bikini Bottoms, as well as one of everything else , now all I need to do is wait until next month to buy this set if I find it at my local Toys "R" Us. That SpongeBob minifig looks cute.	positive
I'm not a huge fan of spongebob, but this set I might want also have. Maybe I can combine it with the city hospital.	positive

Excellent review! It's nice to see how... it's nice to see how ... ... it's nice ... Okay, I can't get over the sex in the bedroom and the unattended baby crawling into the oven. I didn't read anything else except, where does the puppy sleep and my daughter made me build this. You are sick and twisted and that's why I love you! It seems you are coining the Belville edge. Now will you please stop sitting around eating clams and get that baby out of the oven or make the fun in the bedroom a three-way? Please! Thank you PS. OK, I read it. I want the baby toilet and I think the jellyfish is supposed to be a jello-mold. I bet you knew that. The fireplace lattice look like the Harry Potter one and not the Fabuland one. Boo!! Wienies.

Now as for the kiddies, in ovens, make sure they are not over cooked they can be stringy , and as for the couple up stairs, now we at least know what you do with your mini figs when no one is looking/ lego sets in public places , just following your name sake i guess And i must say Lego, shame, shame, that catapult needs reviwing, hardly even make a dent in a castle wall!

hmmm.... i probably would not have bought this as a kid in 1987, unless i had money to spare or the shop had no other set from space or castle, the two other big lines in 1987, and no better set in the town section. i think it's a great parts pack, but the model itself does not look very attractive. I never really liked those wheels, honestly. They're from the basic sets, mostly, and they work pretty well in those, but i'm just not a fan... the roof, on the other hand, was very popular and the blue modified bricks at the front were quite rare in those days, but generally speaking, this was not the star of 1987. gave it a "3"	negative

I had saw the earlier image just now. It looks very nice. Just to share some information with you guys. Vestas, an global company which is an expert in "Wind Energy" This is a tie-up with LEGO.

I recently got a few still sealed and new sets from the 90' on ebay, and after the Rock Raider's Hover Scout this isthe second one i'll review.

Set Nr.: 6455 Name: Space Simulation Station Number of minifigs: 3 Number of pieces: 240 Release Year: 1999 First again a few pics of the boxes and the instructions: The main box: This theme had a kinda strange seperation of the pieces, the parts for the control center and the shuttle are in seperate little boxes, and the others are in polybags with the models printed on them. Also seperate instructions for each step: A general overview: We got 3 lovely minifigs here, from left to right the control engineer, the mechanic and the astronaut: The -i dont know the english word for it- testing-thing, the astronaut is being tested to hard nerves there The mechanics little car, on the back an extinguisher and a radio device is attached: the take-off station for the little shuttle with the shuttle itself on it: And without it: Tools, tools, tools! The shuttle as stand-alone: i think that would be fuel tanks, i like this little detail: And finally we have the controll room, would have been better with seats, but it's alright: A really sweet mid-sized set if you ask me, a few juniorized parts, but it fits perfectly with the set. The theme itself is also great, and i wish that TLG brings it back, i could see stunning sets with the quality city sets have right now!	positive
My sister got this from our grandparents once when she was interested with space but it fell into my hands later. I had a lot of fun with that. By the way, the name for the test thing is called a centrifuge. It tests a person's ability to withstand high g-forces. Edited by filefolders, 15 July 2008 - 03:55 PM.	positive
*mini-bump* Wow, I'd completely forgotten about this theme, which is suprising since I absolutely loved this theme as a kid (minus the sound n' light brick, which I thought was pretty big and ugly). Sure brings back memories of looking at those little catalogue booklets that came with the sets.	positive
I had never seen this set or this theme before. It was released during my dark age, and I had missed it. It's nice to see such sets, surface once again, to educate members like me that there are some good sets we had missed during the dark age. And, I must admit that this is a very good set. It's comes with 3 mini-figs and Staudie with it. Geez, I never thought he was an astronaunt back then. The testing facility is great, and I love to see it spin, by putting Staudie in it for a "test-run". The buggy is cute as well, but somehow, I don't really like the white frame at the back. It looked a little odd to me. The tools, are simply wonderful to have. Furthermore, these are grey tools. The last time, we had so many tools are the aeroplane mechanic. The shuttle is nice, but does the shuttle supposed to come with a cover as well? I guess, since this is a simulator, they must have cut down the budget for it. The control room is good, and it will be even better with chairs included. metalandi, thanks for the wonderful review!	neutral
Do the manga guards heads fit on a regular minifig torso?	neutral

UPDATE: I WILL BE MERGING REVIEWS AS THEY GO IDLE, THIS IS NOW THE DINO ATTACK REVIEW THREAD "What, Jay's not doing Viking reviews!?" Nope, I think Christopher110 took care of those just fine. Instead, I have brought you what is most possibly the HIGHEST-ANTICIPATED set of the year (;) :D) - the T1 Typhoon. And I gotta say - Dinos apart, it's actually really cool. The Dinos Let's get the worst over with. Yes. Those are ALL the parts in that 'dino'.	negative
As unexpected as it was, this was very helpful! ;) Three questions, though: 1. Is the front green rubber missle a traditional launchable missle, or does it have another firing mechanism? 2. Concerning the guns on the side, are they fixed in one postition, or does it have any functions? 3. Why did you decide to buy this set? (Just curious!)	neutral

In response, it's an upside-down launcher, so the switch is on the underside. So no, no special mechanism. 2. The gatling guns can be raised, but not turned. 3. I found it in Toys R Us, and was after a few of the figs, but after seeing the box up close and personal, decided 'what the heck! It's a good break from Vikings!' :-D	neutral
I really want those figs.....damm you Bloody Jay!!!	positive
sam89, on Jul 25 2005, 01:11 PM, said: That looks like a really great set, although I don't think I'd have anywhere to put it. I don't think I'll ever be able to get the set anyway, since it doesn't come out over here. sam, missing your point. The set _should_ come to Europe, as 7298, but without guns (large crate instead).	neutral
Hmmmm . . . . interesting. It's a shame though, because I really like the guns. Any idea when it should come to Europe? EDIT: I've just scene the Official DINO Attack site, which says they're coming to Europe in October.	neutral
Does anyone have photos of the ones being released in Europe? I'd like to compare the ones here in the U.S. to the ones in Europe...	neutral
No, there aren't any pictures yet.	neutral
I guess we'll have to wait for the photos! Officially announced by LEGO, the Dino Attack line is going to be made available in Europe in October 2005... EDIT: Check out the official Dino Attack site here!	neutral
Yeah, I picked up another one. I really liked the chopper! Let's cut straight to the chase. Dinos: First the worst, of course. These things are so horrible, they don't deserve more than one photo. They're rubbery, one piece, and the only things that remotely indicate that they're made by LEGO are the holes on the bottom of their feet. They're unrealistic to an extreme unmatched by even the previously reviewed Dinos, in that they are waaaaaaaay too thin, one is pink, and they're all grinning. Fig: One interesting thing to note is that this one has the same torso as the iron-masked dude in the chopper, not his own bare-arms torso. Pic for the sake of comparison. Now, I don't consider this fig as good as the others because the other heads are useful for Vikings and assorted castle-type people, but this has sunglasses. All in all, you'll probably find it useful, but I don't. Still, great torso for special ops stuff. Hummer: Those headlights - while stickers (yes, all prints are again stickers, although there are much less than the chopper) - are great pieces. I can see using them as furnace covers or stove burners. The windshield/hood area. Not much to say about this one. Driver's side. My question? When this is brought to Europe, will the steering wheel switch sides? ;) Seriously though, I love that little steering wheel piece more than I love taffy. And I'm a man who enjoys his taffy. Left side in its entirety. ... and the right side. View through the right side - no seat here. Could've done with another fig to fill the nonexistant seat, as well.	positive
The... weapon. Whatever it's called. This uses the same mechanism as the longboat (for those that don't have either, you snap the little sports stand thing, which hits the 'missile', which fires, and since there's nothing holding the technic beam up to that height any more, it drops down so that the next missile drops into place. Pretty cool, if unrealistic.). The two on the side do NOT fire, I think they're mainly there for 'extra ammo'. My biggest problem with this set. Open bed. This could have easily been remedied with a few plates. Interior opened. The Fire Hammer next to the T1. They look very cool together, don't they? You can also see my curio shelf. FINAL SCORE: 7.4/10 Dinos: 1/10 Fig: 8/10 (but that's just me) Hummer: 8.5/10 Parts: 9/10 I'm a harsh reviewer. I still think that if space/vehicles are your thing, you should buy this. However, if you're a bigger castle fan, or just like to get all sorts of LEGO, I would still suggest buying the Viking Catapult before this. However, I do think that these are some of the coolest sets of 2005. This is something you will eventually want to get. Until next time, Bloody Jay	positive
Thanks Bloody Jay! Any chance you could be reviewing the other Dino Attack sets?	neutral
Sorry for the double post, but I just had another question in mind: How long/high/wide is this "badass" copter? (including rotors). I have heard of as long as 25 inches for the length, but is this true or is it just an exaggeration?	neutral

Wow, i think this is the first time i'm the first to have a new set (at least here) and review it. Got it 2 days ago, thanks to a fast shipping from S@H this time, and i found time now to review it now. Enough of the babbling, let's let the facts and pictures speak, which actually turned out pretty well this time. Set Nr.: 4210 Name: Coast Guard Platform Number of minifigs: 4 Number of pieces: 469 Release Year: 2008 A few shots of the box first: 2 Books of Instructions we got here, first one for the helicopter second one for the rest and the platform itself: A general overview of the platform from above: The 4 minifigs, 3 rescue guys and one oil rig worker (?). The pilot seems not very happy that he has to work in the middle of nowhere at sea Right beside the entry of the tower we have the diving equipment holder: Next, the guy can jump in this little speedboat... ...and another guy brings it down to water with the crane: If somebody is rescued from the air, he arrives here and is brought to the tower with the little moving platform than runs on "rails": Down under we got a buoy and several life belts and extinguishers: With the lift somebody who is rescued by the boat can be brought up. I think it would been better if they would have made a mechanism there to bring it up, but it's okay: A few floors higher the sea is being observated and watched: On the ground level we have the medical station/warm-up room: The helicopter as stand-alone: All in all for me this is besides the police station THE city set of this year. It's got great features, and looks fantastic and also has many useful pieces. You can't do anything wrong with buying it, 10/10 for me! That's all for now, hope you liked my review. Edit: Oh damn, i forgot to write "review" in the topic title, can a mod please add this? Thanks!	positive
Thanks for the great review. I'm loving this set a lot - it looks well designed, and the helicopter is awesome! Plus, I love the new worker figure with the beard. Quote I agree, this is a great set - one of the best of the CG line for sure, way better than the boat set with the tower on the Bionicle baseplate I wouldn't say that at all - true, this base is bigger, but the other set was well designed as well - plus the included boat is wonderful.	positive
Is there any way to order one of these if you don't live in France or one of the countries where S@H sells it?	neutral
I don't know really. In which country do you live? I haven't been to my local stores for a while now, so i don't know if they have it there, but maybe i'll find some time tomorrow to check it out.	neutral
I think it looks good on the real set. I thought, the darker glass might be good on the ground level so the rescued guy has it nice and dark in there	positive
I agree with both of you. First, i have to add, that a few of the stickers were a bit annoying as it comes to put them on espacially the ones on the helicopter, where you have to put them on round parts. But i didn't really see this at a bad point, i really can live with it. Second, it was a very hard decision, believe it or not, on which new set to buy, cause i got a huge 2008 set-wantlist. I guess it'll take some time before i can get most of the other sets i want	neutral

Paramedic Unit Set #: 6364 Year Released: 1980 Piece Count: 140 Minifigs: 2 List Price: unknown Well, let me first say that the English name, "Paramedic Unit" is not really a good name for this set. The function of a paramedic is to take a patient from an emergent situation, and deliver them to a hospital for treatment, generally an Emergency Room. This is a rather small "clinic" that I would imagine is more for family care than an Emergency Room. In addition, the car looks more like a doctor/nurse's car rather than an Ambulance or Emergency Response Vehicle. I would call this a "Clinic" rather than a Paramedic Unit. In any case, it's a great set, esp. for Table Towns that need medical services. What I like is that this set is small enough to place anywhere in your Lego City or Town. Starting with the instructions: Like all the classic town sets, alternate models are pictured, although i never tried building one: I like the little medical bus/van. The set includes two minifigs, that include a female Doctore or Nurse, and what I presume is a patient, based on the torsos: I really like the vehicle. It's a 4-stud wide two seater: The colors work well and I like the use of the white bar between the seats (and the 1x1 blue plates for lights). Unfortunately, the emblems are stickers. Here's a shot of the neat little "Clinic": I like the use of the blinds for the exam room. It shows that Lego considered patient privacy when making this set. The interior includes an exam room, desk, and two blue swivel chairs: And a neat little eye chart: Although the letters L E G O would have made a nice touch. Lastly, a picture of the complete set: I must admit that I remember buying this set back in the 80s and I regreted it after taking it home. I'm not sure what I didn't like about it (perhaps the "girl" back then), but now I really think it's a neat set. Well, there's a line of patients waiting to have their eyes checked... Comments welcome.	neutral

Thanks for all of your encouraging comments! I am glad most of you love to view our classic reviews. Do stay out for more upcoming exciting classic town reviews! I appericiate greatly by all of your words. There are many outstanding reviews from Brickster as well, especially those classic vintage LEGO sets, that I had never seen before, except browsing it in Brickset. Therefore, I will encourage EB Members, to take some time off to view these truly wonderful classic reviews. Trust me, it shall be an eye opening experience for each and everyone of you, whom had never seen Classic Town, in such an up close personal experience before. Lasse D, on Jul 19 2008, 12:22 AM, said: This is one of my favorite town vehicles from the old time, and for one specific reason: The truck is on the guys shirt! It didn't matter that the color was wrong, or the hook was missing. I thought it was awesome beyond imagination... for some reason The torso is just lovely! I felt the 6641, 4 Wheelin Truck is almost identical with the torso, except for the front color combination. Click onto the picture for an instant review.

Another great review, Whitefang. This is a wonderful 80's vehicle - and I think it might be one of the first - if not THE first - that had the spring suspension system. I know of at least one other set that had that: the biggest Extreme Team set from 1998 had a vehicle with those pieces. Quote This tow truck is pretty useful. As you can see, current City sets hardly have any tow trucks available to tow new cars design. This tow truck is catered for 4-studs vehicles for Classic Town. Can you imagine yourself this truck towing a Speed Racer car? I think it looks really out of proportion. Firstly, Speed Racer cars are out of scale even with City vehicles. Also, I have hope that in the next few years we will get more Octan sets to go with the wonderful gas station - and I suspect that a 6-wide tow truck will be at the top of the list. It wouldn't be a hard set to make, and I bet it would sell well. Edited by Grevious, 19 July 2008 - 05:31 PM.	positive

Great review of a classic set. Man, this is sure a wondeful kit, even today. The level of detail is astounding for the time, and the whole kit is really cute. You know, I honestly don't get why some people have complained about the CITY gas station's figure count - the majority of lego gas stations had no more than three figures - including this one and the wonderful Gas and Wash Express (which I actually own!). I also don't get why people complain about the stickers so much - because even older kits often had a lot. Personally, I think stickers are okay, because printed pieces can't be used in as many places if the stickers are really specialized.	positive
Thanks for the fantastic review of the Esso Petrol( ) station! I like this set, a nice contrast to the shell ones, it adds a bit of variety to a Lego town. The cowboy hat is a nice addition too.	positive
Brickster You need your own sticky review section, I love looking at all of these old sets, As I have said before you take me back to a much simpler time. Thank You And on to the set. I love this gas station Lego really needs to look to it's past on some of these sets for the time the level of detail is great. I wish I still had this one in one piece as well.	positive

Wonderful review. I'd die if I had to upload that many pictures... Man, this is it: the pinacle of Mars Mission's second and final year. Man, this baby is flawless. There are so many indications that the designers took care in designing this kit - like the space for the pilot's backpack, the compartment for the mini flier, the sturdy leg design - etc etc etc. Kudos to TLC for making Mars Mission go out with a bang.

Looks like a great set, i may consider making this the first mars mission set i buy. Nice review also. But Quote Lol, thanks. I just wanted to claim my place for the review. Personally i don't think you had a place to claim. Somebody else could have also gotten this set and had a proper review ready before yours but felt it was wrong to post because you had posted a placeholder ( ClubNinja in this case). I think placeholders should be banned and if you are not ready to post a full review you should not post anything. Simple really. Either that or what is the policy on here regarding more than one review of a set being posted - then you could have both posted reviews and it wont really matter i guess. Just my 2 cents worth Thanks for the review though.	positive
Sweet review, metalandi! This set always looked a bit too busy for my liking, I guess I just didn't expect to see a set so tall. After seeing your review though, it is growing on me. I like all the play features, and at the very least it's a great parts pack. Two things I'm confused about though. In this pic, is that dragon being used as a swing set? And I don't get why the area where the witch casts her spells on the second floor is green. Green in Castle means grass (or Forestmen... ), and having grass on the second floor of a building is just weird. I understand that it's modular and thus it would make sense if it were placed on the ground, but dark grey would make just as much sense, and would look much better than the green there IMO. Anyway, I'm just fussy. Thanks again for the cool review, will we be seeing any more? ~Peace	negative
Very nice of a very nice set. The revolving fireplace - I wonder what movie that could possibly be from?	positive
I read this review not long after you posted it, but I'm not sure why I didn't comment... If Dragonator is the one to post everytime he sees a dragon related topic, I would be the one to post if I see a Fright Knights topic. Fright Knights is one of my favourite Lego themes, and this review is really good! I got both of the castles in the theme and loved them, and your review presents Basil the Batlord's castle well. I too thought it was a bit weird that there is a green base when it could be grey, but I guess it's a useful piece to use in other things. Fright Knights On!	positive
Wow, what a cool castle and set in general! I had no idea that this set existed (long dark ages) Thanks to you metalandi for such a great review! The figures look really nice and the set is full of lots of little trinkets , details, traps etc! I have already had a look on ebay for this set. Looks like a great set for parts too. I give the review 4.5/5 evil witches. Cheers ISC	positive

Fire Station Set #: 6382 Year Released: 1980/1981 Piece Count: 368 Minifigs: 4 List Price: approx. $20 Lego's third fire station was this little gem, 6382. The set offered new design elements not previously offered in previous sets. What really stands out for me is 1x3 car doors and torsos with printed designs. A decal was used for the large sign on the building and the #1 on the hood of one of the vehicles. I think this was also the first set to offer the sliding garage mechanism, a feature that added a great amount of realism and playability. The set also included two blue doors and the new fire hose with pre-connected faucet/spicket. Getting on to the pictures. I saved the cover of the box for this set but lost the instructions over the years. I was able to download some instructions from the web. Here's a shot of the box cover: And the back of the box: The set includes four figs, three of which are fireman, and a lady who can serve as a dispatcher. As mentioned above, the torsos are printed on: My favorite of the two vehicles included, I love the design of Fire Engine #1: I always loved the fire hoses included in this set. No string to have to tie or freyed ends: Engine #2 is this much larger engine with ladder. I like how it contains an oxygen tank and fire axe: On the other side of the engine are two shutter doors that reveal the hose and ladder controls. These are stickers: The ladder is much wider than previous Lego ladders and extends a good length: I like the baseplate of this set which has the numbers ONE and TWO marking each garage: The building is simple but has a nice design. I love the sliding garage doors: NOTE: Notice the two windows of the 2nd floor. The actual set should have blinds on these windows. I've lost one of the stickered windows, so placed the single blinded window on the 1st floor. Each of the two sides of the garages are the same. Here's a shot of the right side: On the first floor is the dispatch area and a classic blue Space computer: The 2nd floor has a bed and a chair: Here's a shot of the entire backside: And lastly, a shot of the entire station: This set is one of my favorite fire stations that offers a great amount of playability. Hope you enjoyed the review.	positive
Great review again it's nice to see old sets reviewed. I love the control stickers there's a great level of detail this is really the second best fire station in my opinion.	positive
Great review. I love tis set too, the best firestation ever made by lego. Mainly because the '80s sets are the favourite with me. Only I miss a helicopterplatvorm, well I made a little modification:	positive
I must agree great fire station, I love the fact that in the classic sets you were given a base plate and some other great idea's. I do miss the addition of base plates and alternate building idea's.

I love the use of the red and yellow colors: The front opens to allow your fireman to quickly climb in: In the back are two round yellow 2x2 bricks for the water supply and a hose connected on each side. Unfortunately, I lost one of the hoses. And the entire set. Isn't she a beauty? 6685 Fire Copter 1 is a great supplement to set 6382 Fire Station released one year earlier.

Well its ok but its not great voted 3 Seems the classic town hater has voted a 1 AGAIN!!!! Will the madness ever stop!?!	neutral
I vote outstanding because it makes excellent use of the pieces that were available at the time. That cockpit makes excellent use of an inverted windshield.	positive
A truly great set. I always loved the mobile crane and was gobsmacked when this popped up using some of the great features from the crane but also making it an emergency vehicle too! Great classic firemen and - in your version - a suspiciously blue fire extinguisher Great review of a great set - Just a pity I no longer have it... So many sets I used to have got lost during the period at the end of my childhood before I rescued what was left from my Dad's house once I realised what I had left behind!! Hindsight is a great thing?? Cheers again Rog	positive
One of my all time favourite I still love it even after all these years, though it did always seem a bit out of place as when I was a child I’d never seen a similar looking fire appliance in the UK.	positive

I just got this set Sunday, and it's so HUGE that I can't put it anywhere. It is pretty sturdy and heavy, that's where the handle comes in. I'm pissed that you only get 2 clones. Rex has to fight on the ground while you need more clones to man the guns/cockpit. The legs were the most annoying and time consuming part of the build. And yea I agree, that if TLG had made numbered bags, it would have taken only 2 hours rather than 4. Edited by iH Master 13uilder17, 14 October 2008 - 11:38 PM.	negative
I bought this a few weeks ago and absolutely loved making it. It's amazing how the paneling comes together to make such a tight fit, but can easily open up. The legs could have been a bit more poseable, and the guns don't launch easily unless you push hard and fast. I'd like the firing mechanism to launch more smoothly. But it looks absolutely amazing. About price, it was ¥13,000 where I am, but I'm used to Lego being expensive in Japan, so it was good value.	positive
Funny minifig actions there. I do love the AT-TE, a definite buy for walker fans.	positive

I got this set in the spring during my "buy every new Castle set available"-season. Granted, I couldn't afford all of them, but I do have most of them now. Anyway, I love the action elements to this set, and the siege tower really does look wicked. I'd like to attach the Crownie tower to the King's Castle to see how it fits, but I unfortunately don't own that set (yet). I also love the turning head of the soldier, and I've used it in my Princess Quest-comic as well, along with the turning head of the princess. The Troll Leader brings good variety to the army of trolls, but they still could use another face type and more torso options. It's a nice review, in any case, although the set pretty much speaks for itself.	positive
Hey, good review and good photos. I also got this set just recently, and I wasn't very enthusiastic about it at the beginning, but after I built it I could appreciate it. The siege engine is very nice, but my complaint has do with the proportions of the knight's tower in respect to the trolls' machine - it's a bit smaller, and less bulkier. That complaint has to go with some other sets too. For example the troll warship is really humongous - it feels like it can load the evil wizard's tower and sail off. Other than that - a good set, I like it, 4/5 from me.	positive
Excellent review and your pictures are very good, I look forward to seeing more review. I really like this set I got it some time ago and keep meaning to post some pictures of it going up against some of the older castles.	positive
Very nice review Pedro! You beat me to it. There was a review done about January, but i wanted to have a go, just haven't opened the box yet..... Great pics and well demonstrated action elements too. I rate this as one of the coolest Castle sets just for its playability and 5 figures. This will def add to my Orc army, and i may purchase more of this set if they dont release a Orc BP. Keep up the good work!	positive

Great review! This is an awesome set. Besides knocking down the wall at the side, can the battering ram do any other damage to the tower (ex, reducing it to rubble bricks)? And why can't the orc just jump out of the hole in the back? Do they need to do that much unnecessary damage to the tower?	neutral

The Coast Guard quad, because I live in the Netherlands, and we don't have the 'dino attack theme', we have dino 2010, which have a diffrent quad.

Interesting that the gun was removed from the European sets, or added to the US sets. I sort of like the chain. I also notice a big difference in the boxart. Destroyed city to prehistoric volcano.

Price: 569 kr Minifigs: 2 Pieces: 592 Stickers: 9 (My sticker sheet wasn’t curled up) Overview: Before I start I will apologize for the bad quality of the pictures. It is getting dark here right now, so some of the pictures are a bit dark. 1) Minifigs: The set comes with two of the new Clone Wars clone troopers, which in my opinion are pretty cool. It also comes with two short blasters and a bag of clone accessories. Figs with helmets: Figs without helmets: 2) The tank: This thing is HUGE (25cm long and 22cm wide), and far oversized in my opinion, but looks great nonetheless. I very much like the white and dark red color scheme, mixed with a bit of lime green (even though there is no lime green bricks ;) ). Left side: Right side: Back side: Both of the wings contain a hidden compartment to store the blasters and a part that rotates to reveal three flickfire missiles. The front opens up as well to reveal the engine. The side guns and the gun on the top rotate. Inside the cockpit is space for two figs; one seated in front of two computer screens and one placed in a moveable seat, which moves up and down, allowing the fig to pop up the top hatch and staying hidden while the hatch is closed. This function is triggered by opening the backdoor. Hidden compartment and missiles: Engine: Top hatch (open/closed): Interior: 3) Rating: Build: 9/10 Not much to say here. Minifigs: 7/10 An extra fig or two would have been great; eventually a Jedi or a commando. Design: 8/10 This only looses a couple of points for being oversized, but it’s a great looking model. Parts: 10/10 At 592 parts, this is one of the CW sets with the best parts/price ratio. Price: 8/10 Sure this thing is great, but I think its overpriced at 569 kr. (approx. $120). When build it feels more like a 450 kr. Set. Final verdict: 9/10 Despite some flaws this thing is definitely recommended, and it looks great on your shelf, too ;)	positive
Nice review , for Portugal it costs 60€. I also consider it oversized, it shold be the third of that size... Portugal and Spain may have good prices but 90€ for the V-19 must be a tippo.	negative
Finally a review of this, thanks! 120 bucks? This tank looks tiny and though it's amazingly detailed it should have been smaller and only 40/50 bucks at most. It just doesn't play that big a part man. Good pieces and mechanisms but no one's going to both buying a 120 buck tank, no offence, not unless it it's the AT-TE.	negative
Thanks for the review! I think this is my favourite Clone Wars set, behind the Republic Gunship.	positive
You lucky turd. Seriously, good job with the review.	neutral
Thanks for the review, Christian, I was hoping for one soon . This set really looks good, but as you said, rather big. The figs are good, and I agree that Ki-Adi Mundi should be included. I like the hidden compartments for the blasters and missiles, and the cockpit is really cool, considering it seats two (I thought only one). I will surely pick this up sometime.	positive
Nice review, thanks for taking the time to share your thoughts. Looks like a really nice set and I'll be picking it up eventually when it makes it to the US.	positive
This is my favorite set in the Clone Wars wave, and I'll be picking it up without a doubt... that is, whenever the folks at LEGO decide that it's okay for us to buy their sets in US.	positive
Thank you for the first ever review of the fighter tank. I like this set and every features it offers. But I think that the engine could have a better look than just four green cylinders in a grey piece.	negative
This set costs a S$100 in singapore.I went to Hng Kong too see lego and the shops there are more expensive by a few dollars.However,I went to Australia before and everything there is the same price but when there is a sale it becomes very cheap!Anyway, thanks for the review!I was wondering about the details of this set.The clone's faces look a lot like anakin's face.Why is that so?I thought it is supposed to look like jango's?	neutral
4478 Geonosian Fighter review Parts:169 Figs:4 Price:?15.00 (I think) Here is a review of the amazing Geonosian Fighter set, it was my first ever Star Wars LEGO set! Here go's... 1. Manual Not much here although it's an old style manual cover. Random shot. Back. 2. General set and minifigs A pic of the entire set, it has 2 reddish tan Battle Droids Geo pilot, Geo soldier, Geo Star Fighter and Geo turret. The 4 figs, the droids come with backpacks. Geo soldier. I prefer this gun. Give him a cane to become Poggle the Lesser the Geo leader. Detailed legs are always nice. The bodies are a little fat for Geonosians I guess but nice printing on them. The head. The wings. 1. 2. 3. Voila! All done 3. The Star Fighter It has a landing gear type thing. The detail on those plates. The pilot in the cockpit. Cockpit with canopy. 1 of 2 ball joint things, this is the engine. 2nd ball joint which is the front gun. 4. The turret The turret by itself. Turret with the soldier. A printed round plate. 5. Overall Build: 7/10 A little repetitive but enjoyable. Minifigs: 9/10 4 that's pretty good for a set this size. Design: 6/10 The fighter dosen't really look right nor does the turret but they are both strong. Parts: 8/10 Lot's of interesting parts and comes with two of the ball joint things as well the minifig parts being good. Price: 10/10 Cheap (for the UK) considering the amount of minifigs and parts. Playability: 5/10 not much but you can have mini battles with the turret and starfighter. Overall: 8/10 I gave it 8 because of the design which was not accurate and the low number of parts. Thanks for reading and hope you liked it as much as I did . Edited by KimT, 04 August 2008 - 11:42 AM. indexed	positive

7263 TIE Fighter Review Parts: 159 Figs: 2 Price £20.00 (not sure) My 2nd review today! This set came out about the same time as the ROTS sets and included the first minifig to have a LUL. 1. Box & Manual This is the front of the box, it has a try me slot for the LUL Vader. A close up of the try me slot. Luckily I got mine form Argos so no little kids have been playing around with it. The manual cover. I'm not quite sure why it has a pic of the figs on the front but it doesn't deface it so I don't mind. Random manual shot. ROTS set preview at the back of the manual. 2. General set and figs The contents of the set. # The minifigs. A normal TIE pilot and the first ever LUL fig DV. (Also my only LUL fig) No helmets. TIE Pilot torso. The LUL is made of 3 parts. Lighted up. The LED for the blade. 3. The TIE Fighter Just a pic of it. Cockpit with controls. TIE pilot sitting in the cockpit. By the way the hinge brick is the wrong color it is supposed to be grey. The cockpit shut. I wonder why TLC never printed those cockpit glass things correctly. Jet out the back. Top plate has some nice printing. 5. Overall Build: 5/10 very repetitive...well the ships symmetrical! Minifigs: 4/10 1 TIE pilot which is okay but a LUL Vader he can't even fit in the ship. Design: 6/10 strong but the wings are all wobbly if that makes sense. I don't like the blue either. Parts: 6/10 Lots of blue grills thingy's not much else but it got 6 because of the wings plates. Price: 5/10 Could have been more expensive. At least it had 2 figs. Playability: 1/10 Can't do much as a stand alone set. Overall: 4/10 There just isn't enough here. It could at least have a better color scheme and instead of DV it could come with a Stormie like the old one did.	negative
Great review! Really shows off the main aspects of the set. Wish I had picked up a TIE when they were around... DSR	positive
This set was on my wanted list for a long time and the sales at S@H came just in time I also loved the set, and like you only put the stickers on the toll both (it looks great on a town layout with almost no modifications). The racers are great. The trucks and the limo are the best in my oppinion. The sticker sheet is huge, but I've seen bigger. Stickers over multiple pieces are the worst The slammers are ok, but not great. I played with my 4 years old son and we tryed to do what shows in the box (the cars passing the toll, jumping the ramps and crashing the trucks) but it is very difficult to get it right. But the crashes are very fun.	positive

As my summer holiday was kinda wet for 2 weeks, I decided to shop some sets. I crossed the German border and bought me this one mainly for the parts. To get time going, I built the models and made this small review for you to enjoy (or hate) High resolution pics can be found here when public. Set# 4994 Title: Fierce Creatures Price: 9.99 EURO / 12.99 USD Pieces: 193 Minifigs: 0 The Box: The box looks awesome! It has some great animations of the 3 models in the instruction. The rear of the box shows some nice up-close-and-personal drawings of each model. I think it works better having the models drawn instead of a mere photo of them. Somehow it allows the great colour-scheme to really show. The Instructions: The instruction is easy to follow and shows which pieces are used in each building step. That makes it all a lot easier, especially with so many small pieces as in this set. The bricks are divided into 3 polybags and the instruction is a fine small book, which can be easily stored along the rest of your ever-growing amount of booklets and pamphlets printed by TLG. The models: Model 1 is a spider and it’s nasty. The 2x2 modified brick with the hole would allow one to hang it from a string. This beast is sure to give you several nightmares, were it hanging from a string in your bedroom. – So I wouldn’t do that (plus the fact that my wife threw away the box and ordered me to take the spider apart when she saw it – She’s an arachnophobian and does not take spiders lightly). It looks real, in a brickish-non-real-way. Model 2 is a snake. There’s not much to say other than the head is awesomely designed and the rest is bad. The body is poorly designed and does not live up to the coolness of the head. Build the head, ignore the rest. Model 3 is a flying scorpion or something. Not as realistic as the spider, but still a great model with a cool head. The tail is a bit poorly designed, but it’ll do and it does offer some good ideas on how to use bricks. All in All Verdicts: This is an ok Creator set. It holds a lot of fine pieces and the models are an ok inspiration. Given its size, it’s an ok set. But it’s nothing more than that. I’ll give it an average score. I enjoyed building the models and fumbling with the bricks in the shade during a “siesta” on my vacation. And that’s what it is, an enjoyable build and a little inspiration on a hot day with a Erdinger Dunkel Weissbier in my other hand. KimT Edited by WhiteFang, 23 May 2009 - 06:29 PM. Indexed	positive
4500 Rebel Snow Speeder review Parts: 214 Figs: 3 Price: £20.00 EDIT: New box pics added sorry they're a bit blurry because of the light I took them in. This is the original trilogy edition version of this set but there aren't any differences to the normal one. 1. Manual & Box The front of the OTE box The minifgs on the box top. The back of the box with some alternate models and overview of some of the functions. The manual cover. You can see it is the OTE version of the set. Random shot. 1 of 2 posters in the instructions. The second poster. 2. General set and minifigs The built set contents. The three figs with the included weapons. How I like to customize the pilots helmets. Luke from 4500 and Luke from 10178 Motorized AT-AT. The three helmets included with the set. 3. Turret Here's the turret with the Rebel gunner standing next to it. The controls for the turret . The turret can rotate and tilt two fire at those pesky AT-AT walkers. I put a spider web sort of radar dish thing on like on the original 7130 to make it look more like the one from TESB. 4. The Speeder A front view of the speeder. The pilot controls with a AT-AT print. The seats for the pilot and rear gunner. The rear gunner's tow cable. A detailed printed plate next to the engines. Printed plates under the air-brake things. More printed parts, there is no DSS with this set. Got tie up those walkers. We might need some more tow cable . 5. Overall Build: 7/10 Pretty symmetrical build but it's fun. Minifigs: 8/10 3 figs in a £20 set is pretty good I think. Design: 9/10 Very strong and close to minifig scale. The turret could have some work though. Parts: 8/10 lot's of variety and includes some interesting ones such as the cockpit and rear air vent. Price: 7/10 3 figs and 214 parts not to bad I guess. Playability: 6/10 Could be better if it came with a Snow Trooper. Overall: 8/10 The set comes with 3 figs that only come with more expensive sets, also it has a variety of different parts as well as the build being enjoyable.

Thanks for the review. This is another good SW set. A true classic. I especially like the colourscheme of this set. The rebel gun is crappy though, but overall the set rocks. KimT	positive
I once bought a entire Lego collection including this set. However, I never have build it. Seeing this fine review has given me new motivation to do so. Nice work again Skipper!	positive
My review gave you motivation to build a set. My review was better than I thought.	positive
Skipper, thanks for doing up all these SW Reviews. It certainly had given me some valuable insights on these sets especially on the Snowspeeder. It kind of making me regret to pass off this set. However, I had bought the hoth base instead but had never built it. I am just wondering if the snowspeeder had any difference? Keep up the good work and always strive your best to make each upcoming review a better one.	positive
Great review! I bought this set when it came out but sold it a couple years later for some extra cash. I have no regrets selling this one, as I was never really impressed with it (different story for the 4483 AT-AT - oh how I wish I still had that one). The snowspeeder was alright, just didn't have any sort of "wow" factor to it. The best part of the set is probably the Rebel Trooper. Looking at the last photo in your review, looks like you're about to have a major battle in your hallway. Apart from the snowspeeder & motorized AT-AT, I see the ARC-170 Fighter, Grievous's starfighter, and is that a podracer I see -- and what is the set with the treads? It's not Star Wars, but looks like a pretty cool set (maybe a Mission Mars vehicle).	positive
Nope there is a guy sitting there. He's there because on Dine 2010 there were no guns like on Dino attack, so so I made a big gun like on the Dino attack set. I can see where you got the pod racer idea from now.	neutral

Thanks for the rewiev! A nice set indeed, to bad i din´t buy it when it still was in the stores.	positive
I had this set (£15 RRP actually ;-)) and agree mostly with your review, although on the wheel bike itself two legs can be placed at the front end and two at the back to enable it to 'roll' properly. Boga is very juniorised, and the set itself is very simple and contains many large pieces. The minifigures are good though (I traded my GG however ). Just to offer my personal thoughts; Build: 5/10 Minifigs: 10/10 Parts: 3/10 Price: 7/10 Playability: 10/10 Overall 7/10 -- (not an average) TK	neutral
My brother had this set, and I think it isn't the best set, but great minifigs. Could use a Star Corps Clone or 2 from the BP.	neutral
Thanks again Skipper for producing yet another review to go into the index. I like this Slave1, but sadly I must admit that I like the really old version better. Boba Fett's Slave1 that is, even though is grossly undersized I think it's better than this one belonging to his father Jango. KimT	neutral
I have all three of the Slave I ships, and I agree with KimT...although it is a very small, compact ship, the first Slave I (Boba Fett) is still the sturdiest. The newest Slave I (Boba Fett) is not bad, and is of much better construction than this Slave I from Jango Fett. Even though I like the size and scale of the Jango Slave I and the newest Boba Fett Slave I...when you pick that very first one up, it had the feeling of....."You can throw me against the wall, drop me off the roof of your house, or let 4 two year olds play with me...I'M NOT GONNA BREAK!" At least thats's my opinion. Good review	positive

I never got the original Boba fett's slave 1. I wish they would make one to scale with the minifigures. I would be so cool. I am also putting up a review of the Clone Turbo Tank probably tomorrow. It is a different variation to the one in the index. Edited by Skipper 24, 03 August 2008 - 07:12 PM.	neutral

Very good review! There's only one thing you did wrong: [quote name='Skipper 24' post='337180' date='Aug 3 2008, 08:46 AM']The controls. I got this set for a very low price as well, and for that, it's a very nice parts pack with 2 neat, exclusive figs!	neutral
Very good review! I have he newest Slave I and I like it more than this one. DSR	neutral
I really want one of these, if only it wasn't expensive. I probably won't buy it because it'd be scraped for parts too quick. Great review though.	neutral
Good review. I always wanted to know how it was different to the Boba Fett Slave I. I would probably only get this though for Jango Fett. The newer one looks sturdier and proportioned better IMO.	neutral

The Kid, on Aug 4 2008, 08:20 AM, said: I got the original version of this set with the LULS Mace Windu figure. When TLC released the non-LULS version I managed to swap - they sent me the new version (and a Clone Trooper IIRC) and I mailed them back the old version. This was a great set; the suspension worked great and it rolled magnificently. Nice review with good photos, but again your price is a little off: £69.99 is the RRP (unless the price you paid was £80). TK That was a great idea. I never even thought to send it back and get the new one with the other clone and the non LUL Windu.	positive
I voted "above average" as well, but back in 1983, I would have probably gone much lower. Sadly, I wasn't as interested in minifigs at the time. I appreciated the ones I had, but I really just wanted ships or bases, and would have gladly passed this by for something with one or two figures and a small moon rover. I skipped all of the classic minifig sets, space, castle and town. It was only upon coming out of my dark ages that I went minifig crazy. For me, this is above average because of the accessories. Without them, it's an average set. With a small brick built droid or a rover, it would be outstanding. That said, I'd buy at least 10 copies now, though I'd rather have a 4 figure set with one of each colour including blue. I never had blue back then. I think Castle lured me away. Thanks for an interesting review! It gives me a chance to further explore why I changed from ship/set to minifig fan and bore all of EB with it.	neutral
An ancient set revived from KimT's collection! Just take a look at the box art. This is one classic space minifig pack which deserve high rating, and I gave it above average. I never had any of these classic space figs before. If TLG could ever released this again, I am pretty sure I will grab multiple packs without a glimpse. You need to build your space agents/astronauts with a little bit of accessories added to explore the unknown space. I love this pack very much. Thanks for sharing!	positive
I wonder why this set had no blue or black astronauts? Whatever the case, I always loved the small minifig sets that Lego released, as I could never get enough astronauts. My favorite was the set of Futuron astronauts. Why would the yellow astronauts freak you out, Sinner? Is it because they look nekkid? ;-)	neutral
I voted below average since I'm not a very big fan of Classic Space.	negative

Great review simonjedi -- I really like that you included lots of photos of your build. I put together my V19 Torrent last night, and I was surprised by how heavy the completed ship is. It has some real heft. Once it's finished, WOW! it is a really cool ship. I was disappointed that the central wing doesn't really lock into place once it flips down. It just kind of droops there, so I attached a technic pin to the locking arm so it could plug into the 2x4 brick that's on the underside of the starfighter (this brick can be seen in your photo of the bottom of the ship). Overall, the build is one of the more confusing that I've seen (I had to dismantle and re-build the first engine after I realized I'd left out a piece) and I kept thinking of the poor 7-year-old that gets this set as his/her very first LEGO set ever.	negative
The V-19 was my first TCW set. I buyed it, when i was visiting my father. I just wanted to build it there, and I do so. But how do you will get sth.big like this with in the train?? So I had to destroy him. When I was still home again, I had to build it 3 times, because the mechanic dont works I only can say that the V-19 is one of the best TCW Sets. Thanks to you for the review simonjedi , I just wanted to make one in German. But now I needn`t to make it	positive
Hydraulic wings! I am very impressed and am now considering getting this set purely because of this funciton. I am just curious as to know why are there sand green parts on the bottom of the V-19. Is it visible when the model is completed? I am also pleased to see TLC giving us a printed cockpit computer this time around.	positive

First the price is a bit steep. I know all the CW sets are expensive but this one just seems more so to me. I mean there is only 1 fig in here.

Actually we should care that there's only one fig in it since it's kind of expensive (though that's my opinion) , but the ship is really awesome . It's too bad there's not a battlepack that includes clone pilots. Edited by BRICKLANTA, 30 November 2008 - 06:15 AM.	neutral

It's great to see someone reviewing a TRAIN! This set is definately a FIVE! Lego hasn't made a complete train SET like this in a long time. The Metroliner is really a legend among classic trains. The great level of playability and detailing makes it a terrific model. Specifically, I was just noticing the details of the passenger car. It has a sink! - How cool is that? And 11 minifigs - when was the last time Lego included 11 figs in a single set? A truly outstanding train set. Thanks for sharing images as I've always wanted to see it up-close. It would be awesome if you could share some single side shots of the cars.	positive
I'm not normally that big into trains but this set has a real coolness factor that sets it apart from most of the others. The color scheme is the same one that Amtrak and many local subway systems use. I picked it up along with the club car expansion when they were re-released in 2001. I have made various modifications to mine, rearranging the car layouts and adding a second train motor into the rearmost car along with another set of lights, so that both ends light up. As you said, it would be great to have an 8-stud version of this, so you could fit in two rows of seats side by side. That might make a nice mod project at some point.	positive
Outstanding train set. The LEGEND of the entire train series, is the Metroliner. This is a "Super 5" set. The color, design, minifigs is just so perfect and lovely. It resemble the trains which we see on our rails in our daily life. I can't find any flaws on this at all. The only flaw I noticed is my mistake of not able to buy this set at all. In fact, I had never seen this set in the shops before in my entire life. TheBrickster, on Aug 5 2008, 09:23 AM, said: How cool is that? And 11 minifigs - when was the last time Lego included 11 figs in a single set? There is another set fufil the criteria above, which is also a well known LEGEND. It has 12 minifigs which is the 10159 City Airport aka Century Skyway Airport.	positive
Ahh, the good old train theme. How i wish TLG would make such great trains today, now that the quality of city sets has improved so much. That really brings back memories, even if i didn't have this one, but a cargo train that came out about the same time period, maybe plus a few years. I don't have any trains myself at the moment, mostly because i'm afraid i haven't got enough space to put in on display with all the rails and stuff.	positive
I also voted "Outstanding", for the simple reason that I've owned this set for a long time, but for most of the time it's been an anonymous heap of bricks mixed with all the other bricks I have. So about a year ago I started rebuilding it, and it now sits proudly next to (also rebuilt) 2150 on my shelf. IMO; It's an excellent set, best of the 9V passenger trains, no doubt. And it combines the best of the 80's trains with that of the 90's - it's not some futuristic panorama-glassed low-slung train, but an honest, realistic-looking train that captures many of the features that passenger trains used to (and in some cases; still) have.	positive
Panda9001100, on Aug 16 2008, 07:37 AM, said: Only strange they named it metroliner. In Holland when we speak of a metro, I need to think at short distance trains only used in big cities like Rotterdam. It was only named Metroliner in the US, because of the color scheme is similar to the real-life Metroliner. I believe in EU it was called the Euro-Express, and probably just "passenger train" wherever that would be suitable. The product-number 4558 is universal, though. Hairy Ruben, you don't have a review of the double-decker/club car on the way, do you? I myself never got it, and I am seriously considering buying one from Bricklink, plus it is more-or-less an requirement for this train (one of very few double-decker cars to actually stay within the general outer dimensions of the train).	neutral

I got my Indy exclusive in the mail today. Packaging Front: Back: Instructions: Mini-figs This set comes with 1 mini-fig, the standard Indy with hat and whip-no satchel: The build I am really happy with the amount of frown headlight bricks that come with this set. 12 in all: The mudguards are cleverly built with 1 x 2 panels and 1 x 1 panel corners in dark green. In the first 2 pages of the instructions, there are a lot of great pieces. This set would sell like mad if it were released for sale. Parts monkeys alone would go insane buying these up for the dark green and frown pieces: The body of the car consists of black plates, brackets and modified bricks with curved tops that allow the dark green mudguards to just peak out. Cool technique: The grill looks cool using only six pieces. I wish all small sets were this unique and cool: Here's the completed jeep. It looks a little small for an actual jeep, but for a brickmaster set, it's awesome, IMO: Some more detail shots of the set with Indy in the driver's seat: I hope they take BrickMaster exclusives overseas because it'd be awesome if everybody could get these. My buddy CopMike would probably love to be the first to review this set, so I've dedicated my review comic to him: My rating Playability: 8/10 (You need to add some other sets and characters to really play with this set) Design: 9/10 (Great techniques and inclusion of rare parts, but loses a point for being an unrealistic size for a jeep) Price: 10/10 (Part of the BrickMaster package, it is a reasonable prize for an exclusive set and everything else that comes with the subscription) Overall: 9/10 (Great, but not perfect and definitely needs to be offered overseas. LEGO would make a ton of money releasing this for sale, IMO as it really is a terrific small set.)	positive
I really enjoyed getting this set in the mail. Its such a great small set and a good example of how smaller vehicles can have great details on them too. The only drawback is that I didn't get another satchel for my various uses for them.	positive

6804 Surface Rover Review Set#: 6804 Set Name: Surface Rover Released: 1984 Pieces: 16 Minifigs: 1 (white classic space minifig) Brickshelf Gallery Peeron.com Bricklink Brickset.com Introcomment: I have to keep my fondness for space going and since I'm no fan of the still "new" Life On Mars Mars Mission theme, I've decided to give you another review of a small Classic Space set. More to come in the following days. The Box. Unfortunately I haven't got the box for this set. But peeron.com was kindly enough to support me with a proper pic. And as usual this is a small easily brought home sized box. Oddly TLG doesn't add the "flip" on top anymore. I remember standing in toystores, pulling 6 or more sets down from the hanger before accesing the one I wanted. It gave buying LEGO sets that threasure hunting touch. [snaps out of his daydreaming]... A small box with a picture of what you get. I've got no rear pic, so I can't tell if TLG did the same as on the 6701 set (split up the inventory). The fig: One single white classic space minifig. This is the worst one in my opinion. I never liked those white guys. And they get easily damaged by the sun. Nah! Give me a red or yellow instead (later blue or black). The Surface Rover: BOTH I am the lucky owner of two of them. (Yes this is a small showoff ) SIDE Though small, I still think this is a neat little set. Compared to the modern "impulse" sets, this is high competable. I like the simplicity of the small classic space sets and this is no exception. The SR is made from very usable bricks, that can easily be used for making ship/base/craft MOCs. REAR As you can see, one of them has been used for surface exploration for many years. It could do with some replacements, but I haven't had the time, yet. The verdict: A fine little classic set. Not much more than that. It holds some useful bricks and worked fine as an "impulse" back then. The classic children's birthday presents during the early 80's. I got quite a few space and town sets back then. Remember to vote your opinion on this set. I gave it "average" for the bricks, the price (back then) and as an all in all conclusion. KimT	positive
This set easily is above average for me. I had this as a little child, and whenever any of my relatives came to visit us, they brought me some Lego. Usually it was either this set or 6844 The really nice thing about this set are the alternate builds. For the low price you got a nice range of parts and cool ideas what to build with them. You could build a fleet of Rovers, or the alternates, and everytime it was huge fun :)	positive
Outback Amazon Crossing G'day Mates! Another fine review from the Legoland's Desert Down Under. This set makes for an excellent addition to your jungles, deserts, outbacks, or other wild and untamed places. Set #: 6490 Theme: Outback Year Released: 1997 Piece Count: 117 Minifigs: 1 List Price: $15 (USD) Starting with an image of the box, one can conclude that this doesn't look like the Amazon at all, but rather the Outback: On the back of the box are some great alternate models, including a creative idea for a crocodile zoo scene: The instructions have the same images on the front and back: The set comes with one Outback fig, a man dressed in green with a bright red cap - I call him the Crocodile Hunter. Also included in this set is a crocodile, some bones, a skull, backpack, pan, and a few extra trans. round 1x1s. The tools are pictured on the truck: Now here's a great desert/rugged terrain truck: Ready for some 4-wheel'n fun. I love the liftable top window/sun roof and the windshield. I like the use of these colored trans. blue pieces that contrast against the yellow, rather than hide like regular clear pieces: The truck has a few hooks/clips to attach a pick, rifle, antena, and camera. Also attached is a water/oil can and an extra tire that just rests in the back section: The front end of the truck has a great winch and hook to help the truck out of hard places: Working suspension helps the vehicle travel on rough terrain: The truck is just half the fun. This set also offers a nice bridge/creek bed for the truck to drive across: I like the use of six fence/ladder pieces for the bridge. The two in the center have double open sides. Here's the left side: And the right side with a single burp as a mountain/hill: I really like the use of the tan and brown baseplates representing desert and water. The complete set as the Crocodile Hunter tries to climb back into the truck after attaching the winch: Final Thoughts: I've always liked this little set. It offers a great amount of playability with the wonderful little 4-stud wide truck and bridge scene. A few years ago, Playmobil offered a Desert Racing Theme and had this set as my favorite of the collection: Desert racing and adventures through dry creeks and rough terrain make for a great theme. Hope you enjoy this review and consider picking up an Outback set (or two) if you can still buy at a reasonable price. Happy Outbacking!

Thanks for this review, if you'd only know what memories you brought back! I think i remember this set better than any other i had, when i was a child. Some time after i got it, i decided to disassemble it and combine it with the jeep from 6552 Rocky River Retreat. It came out pretty good, though. As it became the main attraction point of my town (beeing the car of my favourite minifig back then, and, and, and... looong story ), i kept it assembled that way from this day on until earlier this year, when i finally disassembled it because i needed the parts.

I had never thought about mixing the two sets, but they do have components that would compliment one another nicely. If you still have the pieces, you should try restoring the sets - it's a lot of fun. simonwillems, on Aug 6 2008, 04:37 AM, said: This is by far my favourite Outback series set! I loved the fact that you can bend the bridge in different directions so that the suspension of the car really worked to keep the car levelled, like you placed it in your last picture. I had lots of fun with this when it came out eleven years ago in 1997, the bridge scene could also be used in the Adventurers serie of 1998. I think I may like the Outback Airstrip a little better, but it's close. I agree with you about the bridge. The moving pieces are a nice feature, and makes it harder for the jeep to cross. The bridge does make a nice addition to Adventurers.

Ok, this is the big one. The controversial one. The one everyone either hates or defends... What do I think? Read on. The Figs: Bandana Man Masked Dude Dude with Shades Good figures, I miss Scarface. Comes with his torso, though, which is my favorite (the one with the ammo strap across the chest). One figure short of the figure-to-price value, but we can deal with that. The Dino: The Dino. It's the one that comes with the chopper, in green. Any questions? The Tank: And so it begins. I think it looks a lot better in person than on the box. The left side. Good time to mention that the treads run pretty easily, and this is a very playable set. Right side. Keep an eye on that flap in the center... ... and we have a folding ladder! The back. Probably the weakest point of the set, apart from the dino. The turret, turned and tilted. The mechanism works extremely well, and the gun seems to work better than others for some reason (or maybe it just seems that way). The front of the cockpit. I'm at a loss trying to figure out how those TINY windshields defend them against 40-foot mutant tyrannosaurus rexes with radioactive breath, laser eyes, and what have you... Anyway, another one of those neat steering wheels, some Viking horns, and some stickered control panels (oh yeah, this set has a good amount of stickers. Probably around 20-ish.). The back of the cockpit. I love the little gun, it turns 360 degrees and tilts up. Oh yeah, and those green barrels they've been using are awesome, I can think of tons of uses for them. The Verdict: 7.6/10 Playability: 9.4/10 Pieces: 7.5/10 Figures: 8.8/10 Dino: 3/10 Value: 4/10 The MAIN DOWNFALL of this set is the price. I would easily pay $30 for this, no questions asked. But $40 was a hard sell for me - I gave in merely to see what I would think of it, and also to help you guys find out the same. This is a great display set, and a great play set. The pieces are good - lots of nice blay beams used in the construction. But the price, people. That's the killer. Pick this up only if you have everything else or you find it on clearance. And thus ends my Dino Attack review series. Hope you enjoyed them! Until next time, Bloody Jay	neutral

Here we are, my first Clone Wars set, and my first Star Wars review. Here we have the wonderful Droid gunship, one of the cheaper of the Clone Wars sets. This set is exclusive to Wal-mart, and its one of the better Exclusives out there (I'm looking at you, Twilight ). First off we have a Shot of the entire set with the Box. A random Page shot, along with pics of the Parts list. The build is split up into three sections: The Back, The cockpit, and The Missles. The back has a lot of nice dark blue plates, and is the only part of the set which uses stickers. The bottoms shows Various technic systems, which I'll get to later The cockpit has many details (Mostly guns), and the Rotating Guns are a nice touch. The cockpit can fit a battle droid, but not a Minifig. I'm not sure why a Droid would want leather though The last part is loading this baby with the missles There are four Black(small) and two Dark Bley (large) missles which are loaded in groups of three as SLS. the middle mechanism is for the missiles, and the back part with the Bionicle teeth are used ad landing gear The knob on top turns... to release the missiles on the Clones ... Leftover bits and the used SS(not so D this time around) The gunship versus a time traveling Agent Charge . OVERALL Build: 8/10 A basic build, but at some points repetitive. Minifigs: 10/10 Just your basic droids, you can't go wrong. Design: 7/10 A basic design, with some Interesting techniques. Pieces: 9/10 A mix of old and new pieces, along with the return of THIS lovely piece which hasn't been seen for almost 10 years Price: 8/10 $30 for a Gunship? I'll take it!

I got this yesterday on sale (only 5500 yen>>>$60 American) and was a little disappointed. I'd avoided it, but all the new sets are at least a month away here. It looks a little weird in photo, and the actual build is worse, just a flat little disc with a cockpit. Only special points for the color, which will probably just look better with those 2009 sets.	negative

I am a proud owner of this set. Like others, I got it discounted and couldn't resit the parts pack. This is the type of lego sets that bothers me. When you look at it now, you'd be tempted to say "hey not bad", but at the same time, some years ago, it wasn't good enough to buy it full price. I was kinda disappointed because usually sets using that kinda baseplates are excellent (castle, paradisa), and this one is just "ok". One really minus point would be the lack of any opponent faction in the set	negative
Another outstanding review by the "awesome set reviewer"! I enjoyed reading this review very much and I felt that you have redress Twilight in an approriate manner. I have very mixed feeling about this set especially with its design. It seemed I will need to watch the Clone Wars movie in the theatre before I compared with it. Most of the time, when this LEGO set is used in a movie, you will tend to compare it and what is the actual purpose for Twilight, same as the rest of the SW vehicles and aircraft. For a high price like this, I can actually top up a little more and get the AT-TE, with the same batch of minifigs plus Commander Rex. If there is a special figure such as the V19 Torrent (Clone Pliot), it will be a much ideal scenario. At the moment, I have not bring in any Clone War sets into my collection, and I am quite sure Twilight is not in my priority list especially when I am not a full-pledged Star War collectors or I have strong intentions to complete the entire range in this recent release. Therefore, I need to prioritise my purchase, and likely to get two RGS, since that is my favourite ship in Clone War era. I am not comparing it with RGS. Both sets defintely have their pros and cons. Oh, I love that postcard you made. Certainly looks very nice! svelte_corps, thanks for doing up this superb detailed review which had given "Twilight" the neccessary attention it should have.	neutral
Thanks for the review. Now I thinnk I will buy this set. BTW, I really like what you did to the back. I might do the same to mine....	positive
Wow certainly much bigger than I would have thought, thanks for the great review and pictures =] Well for some reason i was drawn to this set, but with the lack of interior and quite a bit of technics, i think I'll pass, or at least get the At-te first! Thanks again!	neutral
Hopewell, on Aug 11 2008, 11:24 PM, said: I read the Visual Guide recently and learned a bit more about the Twilight. I won't get into spoilers but it seems that the ship becomes a sort of endearing family van for the characters which is neat. Big bulky, uncool, but it gets you from one place to another. If it factors into more than just the 90 minute film, I may pick this up. It seems that there's room for a lot of personality in this ship once you see the film. It is a Corellian freighter smuggling spice for the Hutts. That's cool right? Lol the Minivan of the Galaxy =] What a selling point If i am really impressed with it in the film i suppose that would change things, but i will have to see =]	positive
Oh no! Anakin has gone over to the green side of the force! Well, I guess someone had to review the Clunkadunk eventually. And you did a good job at it, svelte corps! I liked the punchline with the Ahsoka-hairpiece swapping. The "Ugha warrior upgrade" is an interesting way of creating male Togrutas. And Ahsoka looks even hotter with Inferno's hair!

Thanks a lot for a very nice and entertaining review! Your photos were really nice and there have been some reviews lately that have such blurry pics... cough.. cough... it was a pleasure to see you can 1. put lego bricks together 2. write a review 3. handle your camera! I think this ship is underrated, it is really nice! I love the playing features like landing gear and back door, perhaps just cause I had to get along with so called landing gears in the past, that did not work at all (7140 for example..). And I simply LOVE that there is space inside. You said there is not really some cause of the landing gear mechanism, but it seems it should be easily fixed. Do you think there is enough space to put some plates over the landing gear and add some beds, kitchen und TV? I think this set is so perfect to mod it into a Clone Wars mobile home, your back garden ist just perfect for this. I prefer this over the AT-TE and over a 2nd gunship! Thanks a lot for the review!	positive
Thank you svelte_corps for the review! I like the inside, nice and cosey! I also like your little garden! For me, this put the twilight different in a better perspective than my first perspective of the twilight. I voted outstanding. Greets The-Force!	neutral
I will not be picking this one up. The main thing is that it simply looks akward. It is big and bulky, and seems to have random pieces on it with not reall streamline feel to it. I also agree that for an exclusive that it $100, it needs more than just 3.5 mini figures. Anikan and Ashoka and Rotta already come in the AT-TE, which is cheaper and has more figures. R2-D2 is a figure that I am sure everybody has at least 4 or 5 of. For that kind of money, I expect something with at least one unique figure, and more than 4. I also want just a cleaner and better designed set. This is probably the letdown of the collection so far. Every collection needs one.	negative
Thanks for yet another awesome review. Quote Seems like TLC has done a pretty accurate representation of the ship. The real fault for the ship's messy design has to go to Lucasfilm, not TLC. My guess is Lucasfilm is trying to recapture that "what a piece of junk!" magic of the Millennium Falcon. I guess we'll have to wait to see the movie to see if they succeeded or not. This sums up my opinion exactly. I can easily admit that the design of the kit is spot on - but unfortunately, the actual design of the ship in the new movie is garbage. Actually, despite the Millennium Falcon's odd design, I really think it's a pretty appealing ship - and its really cool! I can't say the same for the Twilight, though.	negative
Looks fine... but still that designs quite a downer.	neutral
Thanks for the review. I for one will get this set. I collect and therefore I need it. I vision something like this: A: I buy the set B: I built the set C: Pics for my BS account D: Set taken apart. Sad, but true. It's not much, but super for parts. I agree (from what your review showed me) that this set is a little too much technic. A thing that's been invading our beloved brick built sets in the past years. I really have no need for a retractable front or functioning landing gear. What I need is a kick-ass ship with neat design and cool interior. The Twilight does not offer that. "Look at the size of that thing"	negative

I bought four of these sets. I guess this was the best selling Impulse set so far. Great idea to have weapons and helmet choice. As for the price, I'd say 7090 is surprisingly cheap!	positive
Hard to find (in Italian shops); I had a friend buying one for meas soon as the set was available. I always wanted another one, so while in Switzerland (see KimT's 7009 review for the full story), I bought two. For 5 €uros you get two knights, a skeleton and a skeleton horse, some hand weapons and a shooting device (please remember, don't aim at the eyes!) Just great.	positive
This little bugger brought me back from my Dark Ages! As a movie fan, I just couldn't resist the thought of making an animation with living LEGO skeletons (I'm referring to Ray Harryhausen's work on the classic Jason and the Argonauts here). Buying the Indy sets stopped me from getting a lot more Castle sets. Though in time I added the Final Joust, the Wizard and the impulse Knight to my collection, as well as buying more unique figs (King, Princess) from expensive Castle sets off Bricklink. So yeah. Great little set. Two crownies, a skeleton and a skeletal horse, you just cannot resist that! Even if you hadn't been buying LEGO for 5 years. As far as I'm concerned, this set is One For The Ages! I love it!	positive
I've been waiting to hold this set in my hands for about a year and a half. Thanks to a silly TLC decision, 7009 was not available in Italian stores. I finally decided to buy it on the net (2x , plus some other sets) and those morons at the Custom charged me quite a lot. After I bought it, while waiting for it to arrive, I found out it was available in a store in Switzerland, not far away from home... That's for the storytelling. As for the set, I thought it was great, and still think so. A good army builder (as quite a few sets in the 2007/2008 castle line), and a time traveller (6021 being my first Lego Castle set ever). Rating? 5/5! Edited by The Cobra, 13 August 2008 - 09:04 PM.	positive
Lovely set. Nice collection of weapons. Cool horse-accesoires for the white knight, cool black skeletal horse on the dark knight's side. Loving the printed armours of both knights! And, as opposed to KimT apparently, I really dig the black helmet. I feel there's a Lord of the Rings-flavour to it with those curves. Well designed!	positive
Another small set my local Target doesn't have. They don't have the best castle selection, they only really have dwarven mines and Castle Seiges. I'll buy this if I see it there though, because it looks like a great little set. I could use the awesome knight, and a skeleton that has a regular body so he looks like he is in armor!!!!!	positive
I should really get one more of these for the figures, shields, and weapons. This set is the only one with the scythe in pearl-grey, by the way. "The only thing that puzzles me is; why would a Crown Knight joust a Skeleton?" Good question. For a joust to make sense, this set should contain two human knights instead -- which would be fine with me so long as they had differing armour and colours. Edited by Tenorikuma, 13 August 2008 - 03:51 AM.	neutral
I'm not a huge fan of this set but it is a great way to nab a fully mounted knight complete with a very attractive barding. Given that in prior years it wasn't possible to get a barded horse in such a small set, this set is actually a decent way to build a mounted cavalry for your kingdom. Looking at bricklink, it would probably cost as much to buy the Knight, horse and weapons separately, and that doesn't take into account the skeleton or the extra bricks. Despite my indifference to this set, I actually have purchased four of them in the past year simply because there isn't a cheaper way to acquire a mounted knight. (A quick question about the poll: are we voting on the quality of the set, or the quality of the review?) Later. Edited by blueandwhite, 13 August 2008 - 05:50 AM.	neutral
KimT, on Aug 13 2008, 05:00 AM, said: The quality of the set. Feel free to comment on the review and/or set also. Thanks . The set is average. It's useful for picking up a few knights, but I'm not really partial to the skeleton. The idea of a knight and a skeleton tilting just strikes me as being odd. My biggest issue with the current castle line is that most sets force you to purchase a mixture of skeletons/knights orcs/knights orcs/dwarves etc.. This is fine for those of you who love your fantasy, however it makes the line a bit underwhelming for the rest of us. Still, as mentioned earlier the set does have an upside so it is worth a purchase. The review on the other hand is aces with great photos and a detailed description of the set and its contents. Nice work.	neutral
First things first. The knight's helm does have a spot for a plume. Now, I really like this set and it was the first one I dug into when I got my collection in the mail. It has a great selection of equipment for good or evil figures and the barding for the horse is outstanding. My only wish was for one of the long chrome swords for the knights. I think the new knights with the tall shield and chrome sword look excellent on foot and on horseback. It would definitely be neat to revisit this set with another human knight instead of the skeleton. Make that change and add a lady to joust for and it'd be bang on.	positive
This looks like a really great set! I wasn't around in '88 to get it but I like it! It actually has things inside the interior! Thanks for the review.

Nice set what a great find, This is one thing I think the TLG has forgotten about, The creator houses are nice but they are not really geared toward a town them (No mini figs, Cars etc) these sets were and that adds so much to a town layout it can't be overlooked.

Glad some of you like this set for the wide variety of good accessories. It seemed some are unfavour of the raft's design. Well, I think for an impulse set. The raft's design is quite good. At least, it took care of the color scheme well. It's just a simple raft for the adventurer to move onto the river stream and throw some dynamitte to blow some obstacles away. Cpt.

I got this set as well as a Res-Q hovercraft. This set is cool because of all the accessories and it come with a X team guy. Your set is also in much better condition than mine. You have made me decide to rebuild it. Another great review TheBrickster. Keep up the good work.	positive
The helicopter looks nice and the RESQ minifigs were nice. The diver minifig had once been a personal favorite of mine.	positive
Thanks for the review brickster, I do own this set in it's original form, The only drawback that I have noted previously is the lack of rotor's and the cobraesq of the copter body I wish it had a larger fuselage but I still have it and I still like it despite my criticism....Which I am sure is in my eyes only. Thanks again Brickster. I wish I had bought some of the other Res Q sets but of course I only bought three.	neutral
What exactly makes you feel this set isn't realistic? It has got nothing what wouldn't be on a real helicopter, imo. and for the futuristic design, yes, it looks modern, but it works. And actually, most of today's real helicopters also don't look like in the 70's anymore.	positive
wow. I loved this set, I still have it actually... in pieces though, i took it apart quite soon after i got it, then managed to lose the instruction manual	positive
Very nice review. This is another set which I had never seen before when I am in my dark age. Quite an useful set, especially with the accessories and the minifigs' torsos. The speedboat is able to hold the car and the rubber rescue boat. How can the driver steer this boat with so many things blocking the way? I can't seemed to find its control though. Thanks for doing this review.	neutral

About the rarest one up there is that black ninja. I only have one ninja and he is dark grey. I also have five samurai. The witch may be fairly rare but I am not sure. I didn't really collect much in the Fright Knight era.	neutral
Quote even though many people don’t like frightknights. I don't really like Fright Knights either I just happened to have this set.	neutral
This is a pretty nice set. I really like the torso and its "genericness" so it can be used for other factions. And at least this set has 2 shields (althought I prefer the triangular ones) instead of just 1 shield you get from crossbow attack (from the wrong fraction, I'd have liked a crown knights shield 100x better). Some improvements for this set would be a normal bow and a sword instead of 2 of the 3 crossbows, smaller wheels and triangular shields. 4/5 from me (actually 3,5 but I'll round it up)	positive
I have had this on my Bricklink wanted list for ages, and yet noone with my criteria has it. Nice review and brilliant set.	positive
You think it's not a great thing that we get a Yoda fig in an affordable set like this?!? That was the main reason why I got this set! And what do you mean by "another"? Wasn't this the only one that was ever released except for the one in the Dagobah/X-Wing set? Sure, he is not the best fig with the unmovable legs and all, but still: It's Yoda! Besides, he doesn't move his legs a lot in "real" life either. Nice review, though, and thanks for telling me what that liftarm-thingy was meant to be for. I never got that and thought it was supposed to lift up the speeder for some reason. I got two of this set, and the printing on those blue parts were off in the second one I got. Edited by Oky Wan Kenobi, 18 August 2008 - 08:45 PM.	positive
No, Yoda was released in no less than 3(4) sets. Ok, so I remembered wrong. I just have plenty Yodas and one is more than enough For the set list click here Thanks for pointing that out.	neutral
I think this is a pretty lame set. It came with Dooku, who I think only came in this set, plus a unique Lightsaber. Still, they could have made it much bigger, added Anikan and Obi-Wan, and added structures and made it more like the scene from the movie. Also, the speeder doesn't seem very accurate.	negative
I missed this set.But i reallly like the yoda and count dooku.I especially like count dooku's lightsaber.One thing though,is it me oris yoda's lightsaber blue in the picture? Edited by pr0visorak, 20 August 2008 - 12:21 PM.	positive
Great review, KimT! At that time, it was still in my dark age and I hated myself not to get this set earlier. This is quite inexpensive and you are able to get two greatest characters especially Count Dooku. The minifigs are excellent, especially the unique design of Count Dooku's lightsaber. I have no problem with the speedbike, as it looks quite alright to me. As for the elevation of Yoda's jump adds some playabilty, but that does not work well for me. Nevertheless, the main attractive factor is Count Dooku and I have to rate it a "5". I never own a Yoda, except for the magnet version.	positive
Cheers for the review KimT! Of the initial Episode II Lego releases this set was the least inspiring, but the minifigs were must-haves. You can't go wrong with Count Dooku and Yoda! I like the design of Dooku's speeder in the movie but Lego missed the mark a bit with it here and gave him a dodgy flying boat instead! The speeder cradle/Yoda jumping mechanism was just a waste of parts unfortunately. I'd like to see Dooku's speeder re-imagined by Lego. They've come a long way in the way they design a lot of the new Star Wars sets	neutral
I know we have another review of this set, but since I just got it, I thought I would share my comments on it. Set Name: Droid Gunship Platform Number: 7678 Pieces: 329 Price: $29.99 Before we begin I will say that I like having a droid gunship, but I still hope we get a MAF: HMP Droid Gunship: MAF Droid Gunship: On to the review. Here we have the box. It is really shiny, and smooth, and fits the set's size okay. It has a clean, bright look, and is truley outstanding. The back of the box, which has the features of the set, as well as the other three CW sets. The contents The siticker sheet. No to bad, and the stickers have clear backs, which is always nice. Instructions Here we have the figs(two new droids and one older armed droid for the cockpit), and the extra parts. The build starts with the flat base. Pretty simple. The bottom. The side lasers. Next is the head: It starts pretty soild. The side buble laser turrets. Loveing the detail. On the ship: The "lid" and eyes. The finished cockpit. Cozy interior... Would have had more room if it were the MAF though. The front landing gear. Simple and effective. The back landing gear. The rockets. The clips are annoying. But it make the rockets work so, I guess it was nessecary. Mounted on the bottom. Not very secure, but that's why they are meant to be dropped on the clones.... The finished ship. --------------------------------------------- Let me say that the droid gunship is a nice set indeed. Final rating: 86% Hope you enjoyed the review!

One thing you have to consider: when lego sees pics of the star wars universe, they have to decide which would be the easiest set to make with the most playibility. Therefore, they chose the HMP. Thanks! One thing I belive is this: Lego is starting to make the blue droid faction(aat, vulture droid, etc.), but sometimes makes brown ones(MTT). So maybe they will make a $50 MAF in brown later, like the brown vulture droid last year. Let's hope! Edited by ~VBBN~, 18 August 2008 - 10:12 PM.	neutral

It took a long time, but now here it is, the Review of the X-Treme Team Set 6584 Extreme Team Challenge. TheBrickster asked me a few weeks ago to do this, since he unfortunately never owned this great set, so here we go! First i have to say, that i really love this late 90's Town Theme, and i wish there would have been produced more sets. This is the only one i own, well, beside that i also still have 6572 Wind Runners, but the car is missing. Anyway, let's face the facts and let the pictures speak for themselves! Sub-Theme: X-Treme Team Set Nr.: 6584 Name: Extreme Team Challenge Number of minifigs: 4 Number of pieces: 354 Release Year: 1998 Let's start off with a few quick shots of the box & instructions: Inside of the box: We got some ideas for alternative models on the backside (the same ones are also on the backside of the instructions): Instructions: Here's an overall view of this huge set: We get 4 minifigs, each with different heads and color patterns, which i really like: ...and also a good amount of equipment for them: Let's move on with the cool vehicles, there are 3 (!) completely different ones in this set, first is the neat little trike: Next, the not less neat "4-wheeled off-road-thing" (don't know what's it called really ): And finally the huge Monster truck, i love the chrome sidepipes and the wench with the hook in the back, which adds a lot of playability: Oh, i almost forgot our brave adventurers also have got a raft to ride the wild mountain waters: Now let's focus on the many details of the mountain base. We got a bridge over troubled waters, but be aware, it's very unstable! Love the wood patterns on the yellow 1x6 tiles: On a corner a camera is mounted to document the wild life: For the evenings we also got a little campfire: Down by the river sits a grey falcon and watches the guys on their challenges: What's that? Seems not very safe, to be honest..be aware when you pass by these rocks.... ....cause it will collapse! Let's move up again where the tent is placed, inside is plenty of space to take a rest for the figs and to store their equipment: But i think they should have built the tent on another place cause the ground isn't very good there: When you pull the mechanism, a trap door opens: Will the guys all come back home safe and not injured? You decide! All in all this is a really great set, ome may say it is a bit juniorized because of the baseplate, but it really isn't. It's got a LOT of playability and some rare parts, the biggest beeing the baseplate which is only available in this set. I hope you liked my review, let me know your opinions!

Metalandi, thanks for doing up this review! This is a chance for me to gain some insight for Extreme Team theme. This is a very interesting set that can be used for so many purposes. 3 different vehicles, wide range of accessories and nice minifigs. What I love the most, is the mountain, bridge and tent. It provided so much playability. I am very impressed with it. Thanks for sharing.	positive
Cool set! I like the tent and monster truck the most.	positive
I have never seen this set before but the minifig head would be perfect for a Solid Snake from MGS 2!	positive
I always thought that this set was under-rated. It contains a really interesting collection of parts, a decent fig, and introduces an odd theme in only one set. Very well designed for one of the 'not greats'. God Bless, Nathan	positive
Hello all Eurobricks members and Classic Town Lovers, *** Editor's Note: To mark the celebration of Classic Town, this set which is released in 1994 and re-released as a LEGEND in 2002. Pizza to Go Review, is dedicated to Classic Town's opening cermony and members such as Hinckley, Brickster, ImperialShadows, Sinner and many others whom have contributed to the final success of Classic Town! Thank you so much for inviting me to be part of this wonderful project, and I wish all the best to the success of Classic Town! I urge everyone of you to check out Classic Town and take alook at the cool stuff we have done! *** Today, I will be doing up a review on Pizza To Go set. This outlet is one of the most favourite eatery for any LEGO citizens living in their town. When they are driving on the road, they are sure to look out "PIZZERIA" signage. They offer the best pizza in town. No one in town can resist the delicious aroma of Pizza, coming out from the red chimney. Let us find out why is this shop so popular among so many LEGO citizens and was one of the famous sets that is re-released under the "LEGEND" theme. Pizza To Go is my favourite set of all time. I believed there is no other pizza outlet lying around in any LEGO city apart Pizzeria. It seemed there are the sole outlet that is selling pizza for many years. This set was re-released in 2002 and it is part of the LEGEND theme. This is one of the few sets that are highly demanded to be brought back by many fans of LEGO around the world. I owned the 6350. Any members whom had owned both sets before? Is there any difference between these two? Because when I searched through Peeron, it shown 144 pieces instead of 194 pieces for the 1994 set. Name: Pizza To Go Theme: LEGO System / Town Year: 1994 (Re-release: 2002) Pieces: 194 Minifigs: 3 An image of a 6350, Pizza To Go Let the delivery begins! Pizza To Go is the regular pizza outlet that sells nothing but pizza. They deliever pizza to every household in town, with their trusty delivery van. Walk-in are welcomed too. There is a stand for customers to dine in their pizza quickly before making their way to their next destination. In my opnon, no town can ever survive without the Pizza Tradition! Devoted "PIZZERIA" staff Every outlet comes with 3 dedicated staff, making sure that operations will run smoothly. On the left, we will have the Pizza Boy, whom is wearing the regular blue dungarees and its white cap. I wonder who is that boy? On the middle, we will have the Pizza Girl. She looks like any typical sweet girl in town that the boys will look at. She is wearing a suntop strapless on her. She reminded me of one person though, I think her name is called Alice. Taking a careful look, I wonder if ImperialShadows is the Pizza Boy back then, without that black patch on its left eye? On another note, this mini-figure was my favourite. Female mini-figures are very uncommon back then. I am glad I have this figure, adding to my town population. On the right, we will have the hardworking chef, preparing the pizzas in the oven. He wears the regular white chef outfit, but he wear a grey pants instead of the usual full-white outfit in most resturants such as Breezeway Cafe (6376). Let's take a closer look at the Pizza Boy's van! This van is very very small looking and very fuel efficient. It is able to cut lanes very fast due to its small size. The pizza van is made up of 4-studs wide design. No doors by the side. However, in this vehicle, I think the doors is not a must to be included in this design. Our Pizza Boy will need to leave vehicle pretty fast, and ensuring that the pizza delivery is on time. Common mechanism This van has the regular rooftop that can be lifted up to place the Pizza Boy into the driver seat. There is a sun roof on its top, which enable him to let him have some sunlight from above! The logo on the side of it, is actually a transparent sticker, which have the PIZZERIA itallian logo and a tasty looking pizza on both sides of its van. I like that sticker very much. Mine looks quite worn out over time. If its a printed piece, It will be a terrific bonus. Nevertheless, I can still accept the sticker. Our pizza van can deliever up to 2 pizza at a go! At every trip, 2 piping hot pizza will be stored at the back of the van. The pizza is fitted in perfectly in each compartment. Furthermore, the white window shutter, is terrific in this design. You don't see this kind of design anymore. I think, I have not seen much delivery vans on the street anymore too. Base of the van From the base, you can see that it is using of the regular red car base that is common in most 4-studs vehicle design. In fact, this car base served as a foundation for its vehicle design. Back of PIZZERIA Alice and the Chef will be showing you around at the back of the kitchen. There is an oven on the left, a water tap and a holder for the oar stick. Looks pretty empty right? Look below for a surprise! My favourite feature! This oven can be used to heat up 2 pizzas at a go. Now, I understand why, this set is named "Pizza To Go". I have been using their slogan unknowingly. This feature is superb nice. Now, we know that the pizza is prepared from the outlet instead of using delivery van to collect it from a factory. Alice, what are you waiting for? Help the Chef quickly! PIZZERIA! The signage sure looks big from far and catches their attention easily too with its pleasnt looking design. As you have already noticed, this is made up of sticker. I don't mind, for this set, it contains sticker. Sometimes, I do hope they can give us spare sticker for us to change, after a long period of time. Distinct red chimney This is the front of the oven, and that is where the smoke comes out. Using only bricks to construct this, is simply wonderful. I like the use of their white bricks to construct the wall layout, and a combination of red parts, especially on the top. I like the look of this very much. Another picture on its side Printed parts In this set, you will get a total of 5 pizzas! And, I believed no other sets offer so many pizza. You can placed up to 4 pizzas in the van and oven. Alice will be carrying the last pizza around. The green and red round dish is a printed part. Most Exclusive part in 6350/10036 The most unique and important printed parts that is only exclusive in this set. It's at the front of the Pizza van. It is none other, but the Pizzeria logo, standing at the front of the delivery van. (Forgotten to take a picture of this piece, took it from Peeron.) Different views of Pizza To Go outlet Another bright sunday day in Pizza To Go! Summary review Playability: 10/10 (A lot of playing by doing up the pizza process. From preparing to delivery) Design: 9.5/10 (Outstanding design, with great use of bricks. I like the structure of it very much) Price: 9.5/10 (An inexpensive set based on the 1994 pricing. It comes with 3 mini-figs, shop, a van, and a exclusive printed piece) Overall: 9.7/10 (I am not trying to be bias. In fact, this set is absoultely filled with minimum flaws. Look at my review again, if you are not satisfied with it, or tell me what you don't like!) I gave it a "5" based on my Review Score Card. What about yours? Hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine. Comments and Critics are strongly welcomed. Pictures can be found in My Brickshelf(When moderated)	positive
Thanks to all of you whom had showed great liking towards to one of my favourite childhood sets. Fluyt, on Aug 24 2008, 06:36 PM, said: I hope I still have all the pieces from mine, unfortunately, my stickers are in pretty bad shape (took them off because I needed the bricks, stupid stickers covering multiple parts , only downside to this set). Flyut, if you need decals for the stickers that are featured in this set. Hang around here until ImperialShadows drop by to give you a little surprise if he is free. Sandy, on Aug 24 2008, 07:33 PM, said: For the review, I just have to point out a few things, to give you constructive criticism: first of all, it's chef, not "chief" (entirely different professions), and secondly, the scale you give in the poll isn't very even. "Above average" jumps to "outstanding", which is a too big of a gap in my opinion. You should've used "Good" or "Great" in between them. But these are only minor faults, this is a good review anyway! Sandy, I appericate your constructive comments in order to improve the quality of my review. I had amended the word "chief" to "chef". You might want to check it. I did not notice that I was using the wrong word. As for the poll definitions which have been used, for 1 to 5. We used "Poor" to represent value "1" while "Outstanding" to represent value "5". We need to use clear definitions to illustrate and demostrate non-bias towards the review for the readers to cast their vote depending on their individual liking. Therefore, we used a common word which is known as "Average". In surveys, for measuring its sample size's liking, we have to use words which is neutral such as Strongly agree, Agree, Neutral, Disagree, Strongly disagree. That's why, we used this rating approach to represent the terms. The Cobra, on Aug 24 2008, 07:37 PM, said: I rate it a full 5 too. And I wish Lego would make a set like this in 2010. A town needs pizza! Edit: don't always trust Peeron. Sometimes they miss some pieces, and sometimes they just can't count them! I am hoping to see a pizza outlet again, maybe in 2010. Well, Peeron can sometimes be not very accurate but it can served as a very useful guide in most areas.	neutral
A very good set indeed, we have at least 3 of them, but we like them all.	positive
One of my greatest lacks in my town...I can remember going to the store to buy this one, and ending up with another set (pirates) at home :p Thank you for the review, it might put me on track in finding this set on the web and purchasing it to correct my childish change of mind, so long ago ;-)	positive
Great review! I really like this set and plan on getting it on bricklink. It would certainly add something to my collection!	positive
Wow. Great review!	neutral
I remember having this set when it was originally released a good few years back, but I don't think I have it anymore. I remember I thought it was really awesome though. I thought the oven and pizza storage in the back of the car were the greatest parts, the little sink on the inside was cool too. Didn't realise they had made a Legends set out of it... I'd love to own this set again, but MISB examples on Bricklink go for an extortionate amount of money. Ah well, se la vie...	positive
Thanks for all of your kind words and great support for this once famous LEGEND set, which got a second chance to be re-released again for people whom had missed it before. Indeed, this is the kind of LEGO sets which is great addition for any LEGO Town or City. TheBrickster, on Aug 26 2008, 02:26 PM, said: Excellent review White Fang! - and a great set to commemorate the establishment of Classic Town.net. I almost ordered this set back when it was re-released by Lego, but passed on it. I'm so mad at myself! This has all the terrific qualities that Classic Town sets exemplify. I love the delivery truck and the pizza oven. A great review from one of the "Master EB Reviewers" - outstanding! Hope you managed to find a good deal in the Internet. That last comment of yours certainly makes my day bright. Thanks Brickster. You are one of them as well.

Hope you are able to find a good buy on the Internet. ImperialShadows, on Aug 26 2008, 04:53 PM, said: Surprise? Free? I'm not even close to free, I'm rather expensive, but I do have a surprise for everyone! I think you'll be interested in the companion article to this fine review, my first set restoration project. Geez, you twisted my words "free" Indeed, you are "dear". Lastly, thanks for that lovely surprise. I really enjoyed viewing that sweet decals of yours. Looks tasty too. ImperialShadows, on Aug 26 2008, 04:53 PM, said: Again, great job WhiteFang, excellent review, and TLG, this is a star amongst your sets. Think about that when you're designing new ones. Seriously. Actually, this is one of my surviving stars among my sets. Well, I will need to find better sets for the new ones. Section8, on Aug 27 2008, 10:07 PM, said: I got the original version as a surprise one Christmas. My parents liked the design so much they got it for me. This is one of the best town sets. If it didn't have the delivery van it would have been on par with 6683 Hamburger Stand, a great set in its own right. The van, and they way the back holds the pizzas, is ingenious and bumps this set up to the highest levels. I agreed with you. In fact, recently there was a hot topic created by K.D on what is your favourite takeaway. Look at here for more discussions and views.	positive
Definitely one of my favorite sets from my childhood; I still remember my sister getting it for me for my birthday and me building it that same day. Too bad I had it displayed all these years on my windowsill so the pizza delivery van and pizzeria have become yellowed.	positive
Thanks for the nice review of this great set, WhiteFang! I always want to grab one, but the price to buy it now is too forbidding... I also always think the girl minifig is supposed to be a customer... LEGO is really up to everyone's own imagination... Edited by Alywin, 15 May 2009 - 06:27 PM.	neutral
Thanks for this great review, baby I like the clarity of your photos, and the description is well written. I'll try and see if I can gather the money for this one (fingers crossed) LuxorV	neutral
They have made a special middle piece in this 4+ set: http://www.brickset....aspx?Set=7075-1 The only problem is that it's red.	negative

Very nice review of a set that I've been dying to get, but my friendly neighborhood Lego store never seems to have in stock. The yellow seat is most definitely not a new piece. I had two of those in my old Beta-1 Command Base, almost 30 years ago!!	positive

Just like dwarve's mine is exclusive to target. Holodoc, on Aug 28 2008, 04:16 AM, said: Nice review, VBBN! I stumbled upon your yellow seat as well. Didn´t you have one already or what made you think it´s new? The big letdown on this set is the big canopy. I would have preferred single bricks for that. And for this truck there is no real need for a hollow canopy - it could as well have been made of solid bricks. Maybe we get another set with different use of the canopy. This is one of the reasons I didn´t buy it so far. And I´m especially NOT interested in another forklift, I have plenty of those... I agree it´s the best one we have seen so far though. Thanks! I have a yellow seat, but I just thought it was interesting. As for the canopy, it really looks good on the finished truck; I like it. And that forklift could be the official one, and the rest could become parts...	positive
As I've told you before, this is a great set and now it has a great review. Thanks for this	positive
A very original and perhaps even a little weird design indeed, but nice and creative for sure! Thanks for that good review!	positive
The Y-wing is the work horse of the Rebel Alliance. It’s well armed and heavily armoured, but you’ll need it because you’ll be moving like a sleepy hut! – General Rieekan Set Name: Y-wing Starfighter Set Number: 7658 Number of Pieces: 454 Figures:2 Released: 2007 List Price: £39.99 Lets us begin with the box. The front shows it in all it’s swooshing glory. http://tdy.org.uk/images/7658-02.jpg The back shows some of the many features of the set and also others you might like to buy in the Star Wars range. After opening the box we find a single instruction booklet Now we come to an important aspect of any Star Wars set the figure, here we’re provided with an anomalous rebel pilot and his faithful R5 droid. The pilot comes with the fairly standard Lego Star Wars non-hero helmet printing. What’s he going to do with the blaster taken on the entire Empire? One of the more interesting parts is the assembly of the engine, which if like me you don’t pay enough attention to the instructions when building you can end up getting wrong. The key detail I got wrong. Just before fitting the last engine. If we look carefully on the side we can see a missile launcher. I didn’t think torpedoes or concussion missiles were fired from there but I may be wrong. After fitting the engine the models looks like this. In all it’s glory. Manning one of the Alliance’s fighters. Not so ready to take on the empire was he? So overall we have a well designed model, which is in my opinion far superior to the original we were offered with Darth Vader way back when Lego Star Wars was new. This Y-wing is sleek and looks great in my opinion, the firing missiles are also a great touch. The Rating System Figures: 5/10 (for the same price the last X-wing had far more figures) Parts 6/10 Swooshability 9.5/10 Design 9/10 Price 3/10 Grand Total 32.5/50 Not to shabby. Conclusion. So finally the answers to the questions you’ve no doubt want to know is the set worth the price. I’ll be frank £39.99 is too much for this set. Despite this I currently have a squadron of three Y-wings, the reasons is this set has been on sale a number of times at £30 it’s certainly worth the money. Lego recently placed them online with a price of £20, this I think was a great price for the set and well work picking one or more up if you wanted to start your own rebellion.	neutral
Thanks for the review. I'll add it to the index. The Y-wing is one of my favourite Rebel fighters and this set justifies the coolest fighter	positive
A wonderful set and a really charming design, well detailed and pretty smooth at the same time. Perhaps that small gap at the cockpit´s an a little weak point, but we can always MOD a little. Thanks for that very neat review, Cardinal Brick!	positive

For the truth go here. Now can we get back on topic or a you just dying to become Sarlac food?	negative
I've built the Y-Wing and the Imperial Landing Craft (7659) more or less at the same time and, for about the same prices, I think the Imperial Landing Craft (ILC) is much superior to the Y-Wing. The Y-Wing doesn’t have much functionality besides an awkward dropping bomb device and a moving cannon. The missiles firing system is … your fingers. The ILC has an awesome missiles firing system (I wish I could get it individually for MOCs), a clever bomb dropping mechanism, 5 minifigures with weapons, the wings fold up together and the “cargo” can be detached as a play set. I’ve built the ILC first so I got quite disappointed with the Y-Wing.	neutral
I like the model, it is one of the best rebel sets out there. But I don't like it that there is no landing gear. When you set this one on the floor/ your rebel base it looks like it crashed or something and looses its look of superiority actually quite fast. It needs to be at least 2 studs high, if not more, from the ground. TLC is in these days afraid of flimsy landing gear, as they gave to us in the early SW time. Now they want something sturdy for playability. But I think there should have been some details on the bottom, especially a landing gear that unfolds. I also don't like the mistake of TLC (that they changed this year with the release of Indy hopefully) to give the pilot a usual smile face. The old yellow version of Gold Leader even had a headgear. I hope TLC realised this year that we want more detailed faces. Well, the licenced sets we got proved that, but who knows. The upsides of this set are the amount of pieces and detail, especially the engines were fun to build and perhaps the most interesting construction I have seen in years. Also it is big, bulky and looks sleek at the same time, just wonderful. And next to the 4502 X-Wing it looks in the perfect size! I gave this the highest rating, even if the underside disappoints. But whatever, it is lego, you can add some landing gear on your own! Thanks for the review, your pics were really really good, next time make more of them please!	positive

I came here to look at the review even though it is a few years old. No images to go with the review. Bummer. I'd like to see a more friendly tolerance on dated threads being bumped. Again, we know next to nothing about the new Y-wing. It wouldn't be possible to say whether 7658 is worth the money relative to the new one until we know what the new one looks like, what its minifigures look like, how much it will cost, etc. Also, note that yodalikespie has been banned.	negative

I don't really care why he was banned but this isn't the only time I've seen this type of behavior and discourse here on EB. Not a threat at all - I was simply pointing out that yodalikespie made the mistake of inquiring about the new Y-wing before we had any information on it. To my understanding, it's not so much the fact that he bumped the thread as the fact that he bumped it for no good reason. I'm not certain where the Moderators stand on this issue, but I feel that yodalikespie's question would have been better received had he posed it after a substantial amount of information had been gathered on 9495 - as I've said, there simply isn't much one can go off of at this point to determine its value relative to 7658.	negative
Maybe the thread should be locked or taken down since the pics consist of broken links. Kind of a pointless review without the pics. And for the record, there are other websites with preliminary images of some the new 2012 sets that are not on the Eurobrick Star Wars 2012 rumors thread. Perhaps that banned fellow was hoping some of the Lego insiders had some knowledge about it. I guess we'll never know now. Edited by sharky, 22 September 2011 - 09:22 PM.	negative
And lo! It came from the east (Denmark) the set which had been foretold the cheap army builder and there was much rejoicing amongst the castle fans. The Cardinal then asked was all the rejoicing justified….. Set Name: The Knight Set Number: 5615 Number of Pieces: 21 Figures:1 Released: 2008 List Price: £2.00 Lets us begin with the box. The front shows us are knight and his rack of arms. The back shows us two sets from the Castle range. Moving inside the box now. The contents of the box, it doesn’t look like much. The instructions to help you through the build. Now the reason you probably bought the set, well at least why I did the Knight. This features the new torso for 2008 and is the height of fashion. This brings the number of printed torsos from the Crown Knights to three, which allows for a greater variety in building your armies. A new fashion sensation and all the must have accessories for this season. With a more heavily armoured look he’s ready for anything. The rest of the set is a weapons rack, I assume that once you’ve got a few of these set you’ll probably like me give up building them and part them out. But anyway here are some pictures of what the rest of the elements are spent on. A long and complex build begins. After 360 hour finally it’s finished sadly five minfigs were hurt in the construction of this rack. Now the money shot, where we can see it all come together. It looks great even the rack doesn’t look to bad. Sadly are hero wasn’t ready for other themes just yet. In total we have a good army builder which castle fans have wanted. However there remains a question in my mind as to if this set is good enough on it’s own. Without any other castle sets I can’t see it being to much fun so it’s not a good present. The Rating System Figures: 9/10 (Great new fashion for this season ) Parts 8/10 (Shield, sword, spear, helmet and armour what more could I want? Well two shields.) Fun Fun Fun 3/10 (Sadly it’s rather dull on it’s own I can’t think or to much else to do.) Design 7/10 (Yes it’s the army builder I’ve wanted design, well apart from that Pirate one.) Price 9/10 (At £2.00 what more can I say.) Grand Total 36/50 (Let down by being to small to stand alone..) Conclusion. So let’s answer the question, is it the army all castle fans have wanted? Well yes and no is the answer. While it is a great set and at the now reduced UK price of £2.00 amazing value. I still think it’s inferior compared with the army building capability of Cross Bow attack, I much prefer army building both factions at once.	positive
Nice review and I especially enjoyed the ending. I personally think it is quite a good set for the price considering it comes with a fully armed minifig along with enough stuff to suit up another. I just wish Amazon carried this set.	positive
Do we really need more construction works? Legoland is just one huge building site. Theme: City Set Name: Mini Digger Set Number: 7246 Number of Pieces: 36 Figures:1 Released: 2005 List Price: $3.50 (USD) 7426 Peeron.com 7246 Bricklink Catalog Diving right in let get some photos of the box The digger at work. The back just has more of the same not to inspiring. Once we open the box we find two poly bags and some instructions The total contents of the box, well minus the air Instruction booklet short and simple. Now the single minfig of the set, nothing new of special that I can see. …got a job working construction for the Johnstown Company. Moving onto the digger itself, it’s one of those builds where all you really need is a quick glance at the instructions and off you go. Side view of the finished product. Alternative view, it doesn’t look to bad. Now lets add our construction worker. Looks rather good, though the lifting action isn’t smooth. It’s nothing special, it’s not the greatest construction set that Lego have ever produced but I think it is worth the money. The arm action really does bug me though. The Rating System Figures: 5/10 (Just another construction peon.) Parts 4/10 (Nothing novel and I dislike the new digger arm system.) Fun Fun Fun 7/10 (I think the playability is high and you can get a good load of bricks in the bucket.) Design 6/10 (Not the best designed digger but not the worst.) Price 7/10 (A reasonable price for what you get) Grand Total 29/50 Still halfway decent but nothing to write home about Conclusion. This set is yet another in a long line of Lego digger and to be honest it’s not the best in my opinion. I still hold nostalgic memories for 6504 which I still think is a great digger. From my point of view the set sits to high off the ground and make me wonder how the worker gets in. I really don’t like the digging arm action it will never be smooth and while it poses better I just think it’s inferior. Despite this I still think it’s not a bad set, I’d just like it to be so much more.	negative
Another fine review! I love the last (action) picture. Thanks for sharing! Btw, I am so looking forward to that 384 London Bus review.	positive
Thanks for the review, ~VBBN~. I have to say, EF has never really caught my attention, but this set seems alright. To be honest, when I saw the topic title, I was expecting a tiger- looking mech. The mech itself is cool, except for the huge leg pieces. I think the minifigs are great in EF sets, with the dark colored outfits, like dark red or dark green.	positive
Nice to see a well done review. This set is one of the few Exo-Force sets I haven't built myself yet, but I will get it on sale, guess soon. I'm do not like the use of Slizer-style ball-joints in Exo-Force, even though they are modified to 2x2 bricks. In this particular set I think the arms look weak, and they lack elbow joint like the "green 2008 mech" set. (forgot name of this years green mech). Quite a shame, I find it really hurts the functionality of that "green" set and could imagine the same with the "Tiger". I guess with the new pyramide brick as cockpit, the cockpit is still open from the sides and the back. I modified my "green 2008 mech", which use the same cockpit design, with a few green bricks, and it is now completely closed from all sides. I rate the Tiger at average, but I may change my mind when I get to build it myself. Front	positive
I voted "average". I think this is the least attractive among the 2008 Exo-Force sets. I saved my money to buy some of the 2006 Mechas.	negative
Good review. I got 2 of those. Wheels are very useful, especially if you don't have any :) As for shields - I don't imagine trolls use them too much. I think that they fight berserk style - all out assault. One complaint is the piece that the wheels are attached to - its a single piece, with smaller than the standard pin connection. So you cant change the width of the cart for your MOCs using the wheels. I don't know if a piece with such a connection only on one side exists though ....	positive
Wow. I like this set. But have no money to get it. Guess I need to be fast and get it before it was sold out.	positive
I'm not really impressed by this set as much as other impulse sets. The Knight impulse set #5615 offers more in my opinion since it gives two helmets, two weapons, a shield and an armor piece along with the weapon rack. I'm not a fan in the slightest of flickfire missles and projectiles like on the cart, and the previously mentioned one piece axle limits the wheel usage in other MOCs. I would've liked to see an added chest armor piece at the very least and a shield would've made this great. Those things are so rare and it would've bumped the piece count up to 21 to match the Knight set. Since both are showing the same price on S@H(in US dollars at least), it would've made sense.	negative

KimT, on Aug 28 2008, 09:52 PM, said: I'd rather get another impulse set than this. Except the other Life On Mars Mars Mission impulse sets. Actually I kinda like the Crystal Hawk impulse. The default model isn't that great but you get a few nice wing plates to work with (after rearranging it looks pretty good). I guess this one though, is good for some nice parts, tho its pretty limited in what you can rebuild it into, and it seems less value because the astronaut has no vehicle... Best impulse set has to be the Troll Warrior... feels very 'complete', and Space Orcs are always nice to have...	positive
I saw two stickers next to the window. One said "Whack him" but I can't make out the other one. Can you post a picture of it? Good review, by the way!	neutral

Cues the Indy theme song Let's follow Indy on his pursuit on the stolen ark. Indy rides full speed ahead on his white horse, but the Nazis are pulling away! Will Indiana Jones be able to grab on to the truck and reclaim the treasure? Or will the Nazis and their high-powered Mercedes trucks prevail? Let's find out! 7622 Race for the Stolen Treasure Set Info Set Name: 7622 Race for the Stolen Treasure Theme: Indiana Jones Released: 2008 Price: 29.99 USD 34.95 Euro 24.99 GBP Pieces: 272 Minifigs: 4 Price Per Piece: About 11 cents And now, the main event! First, the box shots The front shows a nice image of Indy on his horse, trying to make it on to the truck, and the attack truck taking aim. The back This side shows some of the features of the set, in little pictures on the left. Instruction manual Not much to say here, as it's the same picture as on the box. Inside the manual On one of the last pages we have a nice picture like the one on the back of the box, showing some features of the set. Random manual pic Here we have the nice piece call-outs that we have come to expect lately. The bags were numbered as well. The pieces A nice selection here, especially if you like black, dark bley and bley. "Cool" pieces The golden treasure chest has a really nice sparkle to it. The set also has a good assortment of coins and jewels, and some wonderful silver 1x1 dots. The canvas covering This is quite nice. It has a nice dark tan color, and some nice detail on it as well. The minifigs First comes Indy's beautiful white horse. I always like LEGO animals and this one is no exception. Here are the figs On the left Indiana Jones, and his nice stubble, printed legs, side bag and the best LEGO hat in history. And the Nazis, Peter, Hans, and Klaus. Their torsos are very nice and the hats are amazing. They look really nice with all of their tan. The extra parts Here you get two of the nice silver 1x1s, some clear 1x1s, and the usual technic pins and levers. Now the finished set! First we have the attack truck The truck looks very good. It looks very military like with the colors and the design. It is designed wonderfully with really nice mudguards and a well-detailed front. The only fault of this is I think the top part where the gunner stands is a bit bare. The front Here you can see the front, which has a nice smooth look with some nice details as well. The front ridged piece works well here. The gun This is well made. It is built by attaching a lightsaber hilt in a sort of videocamera piece. The actual area where the guy stands is pretty bare, but not too bad. Backside of the truck The spare tire here is a simple, but nice touch. A side view The mudguards are smartly built by clipping wing flaps on to handle plates. This part gets a bit tedious, but the end result is worth it. The big boy cargo truck! This is another really well built truck. It has a lot of the same design elements as in the smaller truck, such as the mudguards. Front view The front of this truck is as nice or better than the other truck. It uses good SNOT building, and everything fits in well. A close-up view of the tire area Just behind the tire you can see those silver 1x1s being used as the suspension. This is a really nice addition and it looks great. NOTE: It's only visual suspension. It is not supposed to work. The canvas cover in action Now the canvas attaches by putting the holes in the canvas, on some little blue technic pins and then clamping them down with the hinged pieces. It looks really nice and curves nicely. The windscreen Treasure! My favorite piece in action. I took this picture with the flash on, so you can see how it sparkles. I think we have waited far too long for this great piece. The complete set! Everything all together. Indy is chasing fast! Indy's got it! Brickshelf Folder Now, for the ratings! Price: 9/10 (Not bad, but could have slightly more pieces. At least it has 4 minifigs and that makes up for it.) Parts: 9/10 (A nice selection of parts, lots of greys and black.) Design: 10/10 (The trucks are really well-designed, the mudguards are excellent.) Playability: 8/10 ( I always like rolling the trucks across the floor. ) Build: 9/10 (Pretty good, but gets a bit repetitive in some parts.) Overall: 45/50 Brickset Bricklink Entry Peeron Lego S@H Even after intense fighting, everyone always gets along when there's food to be eaten... "Hey Indy! Vant some mustard?" "How about some Ketchup?" Summary This, and all of the other Indiana Jones sets are some of my favorites. They all have nice colors, good design, and great minifigs. Although I need Indy in a different outfit pretty soon. His outfit is starting to smell a bit ripe . This set in particular is very well designed, and I can't wait for some more Indy next year. Thanks, and happy building! Edited by Erdbeereis1, 29 August 2008 - 03:47 AM.	positive
Very good, informative review. I really want this set but I never got around to buying it. I thought all of your photos are great and of good quality. keep it up!	positive
Another Great Review Erdbeeries! I have to give it a I have thought about this set long and hard and your review might just force me to pick it up. The vehicles look nice and the Nazi's are great figs. Bravo.	positive
This set is nice it looks like a DHL van	positive

It's an ok set. I just don't really like the look of the van much. Too rounded for my liking. What happened to the box like cars??	negative
rriggs, on Aug 31 2008, 02:55 AM, said: I actually like the use of the old style car base and mourned the day that these became exitinct the first time round (c1990). I don't hate the piece, but I did object to the way this set fills in the middle recessed area with a 2 x 2 plate that is nearly impossible to get out again without doing some damage to it. What's more, if you fill in the recessed area, you've eliminated the only rationale for using the car base in the first place.	negative
Welcome to another sunny day in LEGO city! The sun is shining, the birds are singing, minifigs are drowning.... Wait? What?! The Coast Guard rushes to the scene and deploys the Coast Guard 4WD & Jet Scooter to save the poor minifig from drowning. Let's take a look at the Coast Guard's buggy! 7737 Coast Guard 4WD & Jet Scooter Set Info Set Name: 7737 Coast Guard 4WD & Jet Scooter Theme: City-Coast Guard Released: 2008 Price: 9.99 USD-9.95 EUR-7.99 GBP Pieces: 130 Minifigs: 1 Price Per Piece: About 8 cents Now, the review! The Box Here is the front. It shows a nice image of the buggy on the beach with the ocean in the background. The Back The back shows some of the features in the set, such as the extra equipment. Manual The picture on the manual is the same as on the box as usual. The Parts The set has great colors. I love how the orange, blue and white look together. The part selection is quite good, but unfortunately uses the large car base. Coast Guard Minifig This is a great fig. The torso print is very nice and matches the buggy's colors well. New Tire Mold Here are the new tires. They look very good. In-Manual Shot Color separation is not a problem here, and since it is a small set, the piece call out is not a necessity. Extra Parts It is always nice to get extra cheese slopes. The Finished Set! The design of the trailer and jetski is great. The jetski is very smooth looking and the color scheme is fantastic. The sticker on the roof is nice, but it's actually too big for the piece. The corners of the sticker flap where the piece curves. Jetski Close-up Here you can see how it attaches to the trailer. I didn't add the sticker that goes on the front which is a little sign that says BB-03 or something. Attaching The Trailer This is where the trailer connects to the main car. It attaches simply with a ball joint. Car Front View The license plate is a nice sticker, and the top lights look nice. Say cheese driver! The Back The back is very similar to the front, it has the same sticker. The Equipment Rack A very welcome addition to the set. It adds quite a bit of playability. The orange fins are great. All Decked Out He looks pretty spiffy in his diving suit doesn't he? Brickshelf Folder The Ratings! Price: 10/10 (You can't get much more in here for $10) Parts: 9/10 (Nice selection and great colors. The big car base is a bit annoying) Design: 9/10 (The jetski is a prime example of something with a small amount of pieces that still looks amazing) Playability: 9/10 (You can drive the car, go diving, and jetski across the bay) Minifig: 7/10 (The one it comes with is great, but it could have come with one more. Perhaps a citizen of some sort) Build: 8/10 (Simple, but looks great) Overall: 42/50 LEGO S@H Brickset Peeron Bricklink Even in the face of danger, this member of the Coast Guard always has a smile on his face... Summary Simply put, for $10 you have to buy this set. It is one of the better sets in this price range you can buy, and one of the best small city sets. The colors are great, the design is great, and the fig is great. I don't normally think small sets are worth heavy praise, but this one definitely deserves it. Thanks, and happy building!	positive
Great job! I will want to get this set soon. It's a lovely set, with some coast guard saving on the jet ski. What I don't like about this set, is the lack of doors. Everything about this is nice, but I still have to give it a "4". As for the entire flow of review, I agreed with Brickster that your introduction is very good. With the little amends I had added earlier, it turns out to be very good. Keep it up.	positive
A very good review of an especially charming and lovely set, thanks! The whole CG theme looks very nice to me with a good and detailed set design, and this one´s no exception. Although it would be nice to see more car doors and some new MF faces, though.	positive
Thanls for the review, I was looking at this set last time I went to the Lego store, but in the end decided not to get it. Now you’ve made me really doubt my decision. One question though do you think the jet ski is as good as previous ones?	positive
Erdbeereis1, on Sep 2 2008, 09:15 PM, said: I meant the piece call outs during the build that show which pieces you need for that step. Oh! Cardinal Brick, on Sep 2 2008, 09:05 PM, said: One question though do you think the jet ski is as good as previous ones? I have to agree that the jetski is an awesome little piece of design.

The Coast Guard sets are very eye catching. The color scheme is making me want to pick up the entire line, although the off-shore platform hasn't been released State-side yet. I've had my eye on this particular set for a few weeks now and is near the top of my To Buy list. With instructions provided on LEGO.com, I build a Dr. Infero version of the jet ski to replace the one used in Mission 2: Swamp Raid. It's a very sturdy design, bulky enough to make it feel like a real vehicle. Great review, too. Thank-you for the closer look at the set.	positive
Arrgh me hearties! Let's join the Pirates as they try to steal the sacred treasure from the Islanders' hands. It won't be easy, King Kahuka and his loyal warriors closely guard the treasure 24 hours a day. Will the Pirates with their trusty pistols and cutlasses be able to defeat the Islanders' spears, pet alligator and powerful leafy skirts? We will find out! 6262 King Kahuka's Throne Set Info Set Name: 6262 King Kahuka's Throne Theme: Pirates-Islanders Released: 1994 Price: ??? (I don't know the original price. I got it from Bricklink with no box for $17. Unfortunately, I was not able to locate the Euro or Pounds price.) Pieces: 123 Minifigs: 5 Off we go! Unfortunately, I don't have the box because I didn't like the idea of spending over $50 for a set with under 200 pieces. So sorry, no box pics. Instructions I think the image on the front is very good. It seems less setup somehow than the instructions these days. It looks more like someone snuck up on them while they were going about their duties and snapped away rather than something that was planned. The Parts A nice selection here. There is a pretty good amount of printed pieces in this set which is always nice. For example, the zebra print tile, as well as the pirate flag nowadays would almost certainly be stickered. The set also comes with a nice dark grey BURP and a red boat for the Pirates. The Minifigs The main buying point of this set for me were the minifigs. This set comes with 5 of them which is quite good for a small set like this, especially when compared to the sets of today. The set comes with 1 alligator, 2 Pirates, 2 Islander Warriors and King Kahuka himself. I really like the Islanders' torso and leg prints. The leafy skirts are a nice touch and the make-up on the faces is superb. Some Parts I Liked These shields have a nice design on them and I always like the treasure chests. A Picture Inside The Manual This is a feature that I liked in the manual, it shows an overhead view of the baseplate so it's much easier to find where to put the piece. I certainly could have used this feature in last year's Aquabase Invasion set. A Close-Up Of The King The face print is nice. I wonder who Kahuka's make-up artist is.... The finished set! First, The Pirates' Boat The boat is really nice. The sail is made out of a nice cloth, and connects simply to the mast. And now, the main part of the set, the throne! This is a really nice model. I think the colors and the design make it really feel like a different part of the LEGO world. The rock sculpture looks fantastic as well. The throne, which is sort of a stretcher thing attaches here. It connects on a 1x2 tile with a stud in the middle for easy removal Here is the treasure that the Pirates seek The treasure rests on tiles inside of the rock. The zebra print tribal drum This is simple but nice. One thing that's great about this which I mentioned earlier, is that this and all of the other pieces with designs on them are printed. That's right, no stickers to be found here! I have used these zebra-print tiles many times for MOCs, as they make a great exotic detail piece. The lovely rock head I think this is wonderful. It really adds a lot to the set. It is well built with grey slopes, curved pieces for the mouth and nose, headlight bricks for the eyes and feathers and horns for detail. The backside The complete set! Overall, this looks great in my opinion with great landscaping and some fun parts. Well, it looks like the Pirates walked all over the Islanders and stole their treasure... In fact, it looks like it was pretty brutal. Brickshelf Folder Now, for the the ratings! Price: 8/10 (for $17 not a great price per piece value. But when you add 5 figs in, it makes it a decent price. Plus this set hasn't been in stores for 14 years so that adds some cost) Parts: 9/10 (The set has some really nice printed parts, as well as a baseplate, which in my opinion, is great) Design: 9/10: (No flaws that I can think of right away. The rock face is very well built) Playability: 8/10 (Not really anything to play with, although you can sail the ship and steal the treasure) Build: 9/10 (Rock face uses nice techniques and the rest of the set is simple but looks good) Minifigs: 10/10 (The minifigs are just fantastic. Great prints, and just overall fun. Overall: 53/60 Bricklink Entry Peeron Brickset It looks like the Pirates have picked up a new recruit from the island... Summary The older LEGO sets have a really different look to them than the new sets, and I think it's nice to have a mix of new and old. This is definitely a great set with a nice build and great minifigs. Add to this the great printed pieces and that old Pirate charm, and you get a very nice set that I can certainly recommend. Thanks, and happy building! Edited by Erdbeereis, 17 August 2009 - 02:39 AM.	positive
What a wonderful review with smart (showing the right parts) and clear pictures. Fantastic job Erdbeereis1! This set is interesting for several reasons. First of all it contains a large amount of (very) useful minifigs. Not many sets of this size contain so much figs. Secondly, the throne itself can be easily combined with the other Islander sets or even with other pirate and non-pirate sets. I'm going to see if I can get this one for a reasonable price on eBay.	positive
Thanks for the great review. This set is pretty standard as Islanders go, but it is such a cool subtheme that I don't care a bit. I totally agree with your comment about old and new sets. I don't think I would enjoy Lego as much if I didn't have a decent amount of kits from pre 1999.	negative
An outstanding set because who doesn't love islanders. Outstanding review as well.	positive
An outstanding set, too bad that I couldn't get this set set when it came out ...	positive
Very solid set. 5 minifigs and plenty of weapons to go around, adding up to great playability, what more could you want? (aspecially from a set this size) Only I would have liked another cutlass, a musket (instead of 1 of the pistols) and for 1 of the pirates to have another head, but those things are no big deal, it is still a lot better than sets nowadays.

Those Indians look useful for Indiana Jones in the future {As long as the have the new skin color} I wish I could have picked one of those up when I could.	neutral
I do not like the fact that the clones have pure white legs. It looks weird to me. It was also weird that they included Shock Troopers, but it was probably a way to get people to buy it. This set also seems like one of those that was kind of thrown in with a mix of other sets like the Tie Crawler. I never picked it up, and with the new Clone Wars sets out, I won't.	negative
I switched my shock trooper legs as soon as I got this set. As for the new pieces, I'm pretty sure that they were also featured in the Striking Venom set. Nice in depth review!

I like this set, but I don't like the pure white legs for the Shock Troopers. It looked better with the black leg joint piece. I also think the set looks like half an at-te.	negative
I could have gotten this set if I wanted to but it seemed like a waste of money to me. I don't like the shock troopers helmets that much. I feel they should have printed visors instead of cut out ones like they have in my opinion it would make it look a lot better. The AT AP itself sounds like it has a lot of holes in its cockpit which drags the set down and make it seem like they haven't exactly put a lot of effort into it. Great review!	negative
Wow talk about a bumper! Nice Review baby! This set is quite nice, I would have goten it if I had had the money but didn't back then so didn't get it. It has a nice parts selection! Why did Lego do the shock troopers with White hips? And the BP ones have Black hips. Confusers me. CommanderFox	positive
I did enjoy it Thanks for sharing your thoughts in this set and reviewing it. I'll add it to the index. Maybe you should consider joining the Reviewers Academy and rule the Galaxy (or something )	positive

Valentin, nice review! I was thinking of doing this review, and realised there were 3 reviews being done for this lovely set. I must admit this is an amazing set, after buying it in TRU for SGD$49.90 (15% discount). I like the comparison of both spider droid even though one is not LEGO. Thanks for doing this lovely review. It's enjoyable to read.	positive

Alakazam! The good wizard is the wisest minifig in all of LEGOland. He is a master of the wand and can see the future. With these abilities, he helps the knights predict where the Trolls will strike next. Because this set is not in stores in the U.S., I was luckily able to buy this set on my vacation to Germany. It is interesting that it is a Euro exclusive. 5614 The Good Wizard Set Info Set Name: 5614 The Good Wizard Theme: Castle Released: 2008 Price: EUR 2.95-GBP 1.99 Pieces: 16 Minifigs: 1 The Review Unfortunately I don't have the box, because in got smushed in my suitcase on the plane, so needless to say, it was not in top condition... The Manual The manual is an extremely small fold-out. But the image on the front is nice. On the back of the manual, there is a picture of some of the 2008 impulse sets. This is a nice feature. The Parts For an impulse set this has a pretty good selection. A very nice owl, and an interesting clear ball piece. All built This set took me forever to build. I had to take numerous breaks as it was the toughest, longest build I have ever faced! For an impulse set, this actually looks pretty good. The owl perch is nice, also the crystal ball table. The wizard is a very nice fig, with great printing on the legs and hat, and I love his beard.

Summary For an impulse set, this is very nice. The wizard is an excellent fig, and getting an animal in a cheap set is always great. I would definitely recommend this set. Thanks, and happy building!	neutral
Kudos on a well presented and written review. I think the reason this set didn't release in US was because it didn't have any warnings about choking anywhere on the box, therefore no lawsuits in US for LEGO. Cheers ISC	neutral
Worst set of the year? Worst set of all time? The pictures say it all, no ratings necessary. A waste of paper for box and instructions, and waste of plastic for bag and jelly alien. The little alien ship that comes with the Switch Fighter beats this one hands down, as well as any other LEGO spaceship I have ever seen and I have seen many. Thankfully this set isn't available in my country, which is something I never thought I would say. Anyway, I hope TLG makes these awful jelly aliens disappear forever after this year.	negative
To be honest, I am going to give this set a "1"... That is my lowest rating I will ever give to a set in Eurobricks. In fact, this is the only impulse set which I do not have it at all. After looking at your wonderful review, I am going to give it a "2" and actually consider it to buy at least one to complete the entire impulse set series. I don't really like the design and the alien at all. In fact, I prefer the Mars Mission astronaunt more than the aliens. I don't really like the set but I like your review.	negative
Impluse sets are made good by using parts well and minifigs. This has either. I give a low score. I really dislike the alien figs. Worst Lego fig ever.	negative

7670: Hailfire Tank and Spider Droid Number of Pieces: 249 Number of Minifigs: 4 Price: 19.99 USD/ 25.99 EUR/ 19.99 GBP Brickset Hello everyone, today I will review the extremely underrated Hailfire Tank and Spider Droid set. I hope this review does it justice. So, let's start with the box: NOTE: This picture is not mine. Standard box for Star Wars in that time. The background on the box looks like it's from Geonosis, indicating that this set is from Episode II, and not III or the Clone Wars. The back of the box (not shown) shows the playability functions and some other sets that were released at the same time as this. Overview Here is an overview of the whole set. It comes with one construction manual and no sticker sheets ( ). This is a very simple set, but with not much to it, it is still a very important part of the CIS army, especially if you are interested in army building. I like to call this set a "super battle pack", and you'll find out why soon. Let's get right to it, and look at the feature of the set: the Hailfire Tank. Front A front view of the very cool tank. Here you can see two triangular shields on the hull. The main body is very simple, but altogether very effective and clever, and making it really look like a hailfire tank, although a little bit sized down from it's movie version. The trans-red stud used as the "eye" makes the tank look more menacing. Side The side view. The wheels are very easy to make, but it's a real pain to connect all of those chain links together. I don't see what you could use the links for, except for another tank, but maybe someone creative will find something for these. The dark tan is nice though. The wheels are held on by Technic poles, and the tank rolls on the wheels fairly well on carpet or a hard surface. Back This is the back of the tank. Here you can see eight flick-fire missiles (four on each side) of the new type, so they don't easily fall out. Also note the modified 2x2 with extended hole piece sticking out of the back. This may be used to easily push around the tank. I just wish you could fit a droid in the body for the cockpit... Now we move on to the Spider Droid, or what I like to call "The Dwarf Spider": The front. This one is also simple, but very cleverly built. The main body is two semi-spheres connected together for rotation, and an antenna, a cannon, four legs, and eyes made out of a useful telephone piece. The picture speaks for itself as far as how the gun and eyes are built. Side A side view. You can now see the legs better, which are more sturdy then you would think. Each one is made out of two pearl bronze Exo-force robot arms, a useful bley handgun piece, and a dark bley battle droid body, all connected to the under body (a big knob-like piece). Back The back. Not much to say here. I like this spider droid because it is very sturdy, and the legs are easy to adjust. Finally, we look at the minifigs: There are four minifigs in this set, which is quite generous for a set of this size. It comes with a yellow battle droid commander (I really like this one), two battle droids, and a super battle droid. All three battle droids have the new blaster pistols and one twisted arm. That's about it for the review, so here is the FINAL VERDICT: Build: 8/10, Very fun and easy, besides the chain links. Should take the seasoned builder less than 20 minutes. Playability: 7/10, the flick-fire missiles are fun, as well as just zooming around the tank. Could use some clones for a battle. Swooshability: 8/10, you can roll around the hailfire fairly well. Minifigs: 9/10, a generous amount of figs, and all are pretty good. Design: 9.5/10, a really simple and clever set, although a little too small for the movie version. Price: 10/10, a very fair price considering the price-per-parts ratio and the coolness of the set. Overall Score: 8.5/10, a very neat set to have, a great army builder, and great for display next to all of the other CIS sets. The price is fair, the figs are good, and the build is very clever. That's all for now, folks. Please feel free to give some feedback! Edited by JimButcher, 15 September 2008 - 03:08 AM.	positive
KimT, on Aug 30 2008, 04:21 PM, said: Thanks for sharing this review with us. I think this one of the sets. In Europe this thing is waaaay overpriced and thus makes it a crappy set. We pay nearly double the US price. So I rated it poor. Also because the figs included does not make it great. The Hailfire is well designed and looks great, but that's just about all there is worthy of a positive mentioning. Sorry. [on a side note: As a bronze-awarded student, where's the price in EUR and GBP? And where's the poll?] [Nevermind the poll, I've added that one for you ] Oh yes, I will add the other prices, and I was going to make a poll for it (I made one for the Homing Spider review), but you beat me to it. Thanks!	negative
This is a great set, I have 2 of them now, and I plan to get more. It is much better than the droid battle pack. For 10 bucks more, you get better battle droid arms and some canon "vehicles", good enough for me.	positive
This is a must have set for AOTC fans and I really love the hailfire droid but it costs like $80 or more now that its discontinued.	neutral
I just bought this set the other day and I must admit that it gets a "Below Average" from me. The price is not corresponding with what you get. Which would be implied, had Jim added the EUR or GBP price in the info[hint hint ] The spider droid is flimsy at best. Making it stand or even move without tumbling over is hard. Also why the brown cylinders on the legs? Keep the colourscheme clean, please. The figs are fine, except that I dislike the clone headgear and the fact that the helmets now have holes in the sides, allowing the flesh head to show within = Goofy looking. I am soo replacing the clone heads with black ones. Great review of an acceptable set	negative
Thanks for the review. I really do like the first year of EF. Nowadays they mecha are perhaps more cleverly designed, and use ball joints for playability. But I really love the blocky bulky look of the first Drone's machines. And somehow the older ones seem a better value of parts. I'm more inclined to buy duplicates of them than the newer models.	neutral
This is Polar-1, OVER... It's day 5 at Arctic Research Base 76. We are experiencing radio difficulties since discovering a number of strange radioactive arctic life forms which seem to be effecting our signal, OVER. We have encountered a large polar bear which by all account appears to be friendly and playful. Our food supply; however, has diminished quickly, and we have to venture North from the base to a frozen lake in search of fish. Our cordinates are currently 46Â°45â?²4â?³N, 741Â°21â?²7â?³W. We do plan to take the snowmobile to the lake after we get our provisions in order. This is Polar-1, OUT. Polar Explorer Bonus Pack Set #: 6569 Theme: Arctic Year Released: 2000 Piece Count: 76 Minifigs: 2 List Price: $10 (USD) In 2000, Lego introduced a new theme called Arctic. It was something completely new and different for Lego as no mini-fig scale sets and/or adventurers had ever ventured to the Arctic. The set offered new orange pieces and combined elements of blue and white pieces to provide a number of sleds, vehicles, a mobile outpost (6520), and even a large polar base (6575). The theme was unfortunately short lived and did not see 2001. This particular set is a "value pack" that combines sets 6578 (Polar Explorer) and 6586 (Polar Scout) at a reasonable price of $10 (USD). I may have even paid a few dollars less at a discount toy store back in the early 2000s. A picture of the "Bonus Pack" with the two sets combined within the box: The backside features an advertisement for the Lego Club and pictures of other Arctic sets: Starting with the smaller set, The Polar Explorer (just a tip of the iceberg ): Instructions Front of Box Back of Box Both sets include the same minifig, an Arctic fig with glasses and a thick arctic coat: Here's a shot of the fig with his hood on. I always thought the hood is a nice piece that would work well for Hoth Rebel snow scenes. The set includes a few nice accessories: The set actually creates a small ice/snow formation that can even be placed on water to represent an iceberg: Here's a close-up with the blue ice spider: The complete set: Next, the Polar Scout: Front of Box Back of Box The Polar Scout instructions picture the same image as the box: But I really like the real arctic imagery on the backside: The set includes a small sheet of decals: Included are some great arctic accessories: And some interesting arctic creatures, like this neon orange scorpion in a ball of ice: I love the polar bear, a great addition to snow scenes: But the best part of this set is the orange and black sled: The back sled attachment (U-Haul) has some tools and a removable storage cover: The top comes off easy to store tools and equipment: Here's the arctic fig with a great metal detector (or other snow research device): And the sled itself: Lastly, a picture of the complete Polar Scout: Final Thoughts: I'm a little disappointed that Arctic was a short-lived theme. At the time, I wasn't too interested in the Arctic, but I still regret not buying the large Polar Research Base after seeing it at a discounted price. I was able to pick up this set and the Mobile Outpost that I never opened. I'd be interesting in reading your thoughts in regard to this set and the Arctic Theme.	neutral
Hi! Great review on one of my favourite themes! I never realized how cool it was until just now, when you did your review. Anyways, I remember my one set of the arctict expedition, The Arctic Expedition pack	positive

Thanks very much for this great review TheBrickster! I love the Arctic sub-theme, but unfortunately i never got my hands on any of the sets, since this theme had its time during my dark ages.

Great review, I hope TLC does another. I rember reading a book once based on the theme which stated the scorpions and thespiders and such were aliens .	positive
Wasn't there some years back a film based on aliens in the arctic? Can't remember the name and i think it was really old, but there certainly was going on something with strange creatures and a polar base	neutral

ImperialShadows, on Sep 1 2008, 06:57 PM, said: And, let's just take a moment to get sentimental. A year ago, today, Staudie had a lame idea: Interview the members of EB. He flailed around with it for a few interviews, including the infamous one where Hinck attention whored Sinner into a corner and Sinner were featured, reprising their roles from the Whacker and the Walrus. It was quite memorable, but then, a short time later, someone new joined the team, bringing it to a new level of polish and bad jokes. Still, this tribute isn't dedicated to that genius of the written word, nay, it's dedicated to the whole staff, including the new guy who is still a secret so don't bother asking, I'm not telling! Ha! I salute you, EB News, it's been a damn fine year! That is some fine history from the EB News. I wonder how Staudie can keep up with his sanity, asking questions around.

You already know how I feel about the review. As for the set, I'm not entirely sure. It's a fine witch, but you've already gotten her in the Witch's Windship and a few other sets. I vote average on this. A good minifig (though one does not have the need for more than one witch) and some fine additional parts.	neutral

Huzzah! The King has declared a royal tournament pitting the brave knight in his shining armour, against the feared skeleton warrior and his shadow horse. The jousting arena is set up so let the joust begin! 7009 The Final Joust Set Info Set Name: 7009 The Final Joust Theme: Castle Released: 2007 Price: USD 7.99-GBP 5.99-EUR 7.95 Pieces-62 Minifigs: 2 figs 2 horses Price Per Piece: About 13 cents Let the games begin! Box Shots The front has an image of the knight and skeleton jousting with lightning in the background. The Back show the two now fighting with an ax and ball and chain. I don't really like the box image, as I think the background looks too dark. Manual The front has the same picture as on the box. On the back some of the other 2007 castle sets are displayed. This is better than the usual sweepstakes image that we get. The Pieces Nothing really special here. But you at least get a good assortment of weapons. Shields I always like LEGO shields and these are no exception. The patterns are great. Minifigs First the horses. These are great, the knight's horse's coverings are really nice. Now, the minifigs. The knight and skeleton both have nice armor. The torsos are plain black for the skeleton and bley for the knight. The Finished Product In the middle is the jousting barrier which is simple, but serves its purpose. On the left we have the weapon rack which is good. It would have been nice if TLG had included a rack for the skeleton as well though. Extra Parts Only two extra white parts here. You can use them if your knight's horse wants to retire and look like a normal horse again. Oh! That has to hurt! It seems that the skellie has won this round! Poor knight... Brickshelf Folder Now, For The Ratings! Price: 7/10 (Not a very good price per piece ratio, however at least 2 figs and 2 horses are included) Parts: 7/10 (The shields and log bricks are nice, but most of the others are nothing spectacular) Design: 8/10 (Relatively well designed, but a bit boring) Playability: 8/10 (You can joust with it and that's about all) Build: 8/10 (Short and easy) Overall: 38/50 Brickset LEGO S@H Peeron Bricklink Strike! It seems that the horses have rebelled against their riders... Summary This set although not amazing, is still a very solid set. The minifigs are great and so are the horses, but the rest of the set kind of feels like an afterthought. Even with its negative aspects I still recommend it, especially if you are a Castle fan. Thanks, and happy building! P.S. If you want to see how I made this set a bit more fun, check out this Click	positive
Nice review. I can tell that you put some effort into it. The MOC is a nice design. Your reviews are getting better and better!	positive
Outstanding. This is (as many of the new Castle sets) a super set. You get loads of great parts, a horse barding, a black skeleton horse and for a fair price. I just love this set and I've bought quite a few of them to build my army. A "must have" - and your great review serves it well	positive

Nice review, which reminds me I must order some more of these battle packs at some point. Are you going to also review the skelton battlepack? Also I hope this is a start of a running joke about castle sets being stomped by SW sets	neutral

SWMAN, on Oct 6 2008, 07:27 AM, said: How were you able to get three small shields. I only got two in mine. I am going to check the trash just in case. I think it only comes with two. The extra one probably slipped in from another set. Sorry for any confusion!	neutral
And another great review from one of our Academy teachers, I always look forward reading them ! I think the Battlepacks for Castle are a great initiative from TLC. I like this one, but also the one with the Skellies, you get some different looking soldiers and a few weapons and shields, so that's cool. The low prices make it so that most people could build a large army/battle if they want to. A big for your review and another for TLC for making these. Edited by zorro3999, 06 October 2008 - 05:40 PM.	positive
It's an ok set, but it's extremely overpriced where I live. I simply couldn't justify paying $17.99 +tax for 5 minifigs. The fact that these figures are featured prominantly in other sets makes this set a difficult purchase. Given the price, I find it hard to look at this set with much enthusiasm.	neutral
Dear all, I found this to be a very usefull army building set. At 2 euro per minifig it is relatively cheap in my book, so i bought 4 battle packs recently. Although, it could be difficult to integrate all of them in your army. Personally, I reshuffled some of the weapons as to integrate them better. But that is a personal preference ofcourse. Kind regards, Teddy	neutral
I really love these Impulse sets at a low price point for lots of minifigs This Police one doesn't appeal too much to me at the moment, but who knows, with your reference I may need it with a future project! Hmm... It's actually a good way of getting those dogs cheaply	positive
I also love the impulse sets, but we have already too many policemen (although I actually bought this one). Our bobby isn't looking very nice is he?! We normally but policemen in a pool or sea with sharks at events like LEGOWorld, so maybe that's because of me Edited by JopieK, 02 September 2008 - 11:00 PM.	neutral
I bought this set for 2,14€ yesterday and I have to admit that for that price i'm veerryy satisfied ! I bought it especially for the dog (my first one) and for the road sign. During the construction (short!) of the set, I was wondering something... Does the speed limit has a signification in every country or some variant exists? In my country (France), the speed limit in town is 50 km/h so I understand the road sign in this set. But in other country, and especially the country were the speed limit is not in km/h, does this set had another road sign?	positive
Not a bad set altough the radar is a little weird looking.	neutral
A very nice set, but one of my least wanted impulse sets. I eventually bought it, and looky here, I got an extra doggy!	positive
Thanks for the input!	positive
Nice review, to start off. You got all the details someone could possibly need, in my opinion at least. I do enjoy this set as well, and I've bought only one to keep my minifigs as unique as possible. Despite my personal preference, I still find this a nice army builder. Good amount of minifigs for the price, as mentioned earlier, with each being different from the other. Though I would like the catapult manager to be armed with at least something, I still feel that he can just flee if he's ever in trouble. He's a good guy to use for the Castle gimmics if you have it. One more small comment. I also love those domed helmets, even if they aren't actually new. My favorite of them all, being followed up by the racer helmet.	neutral
Nice review . I still thing sets like this are the reason castle has done so well, it allows you to collect a large number of minfig for not very much cash, which I certainly indulged in. My only complaint is that you end up with the evil skeletons out numbered, however heard of the good guys winning with the numbers in their favour.	neutral
one of the best sets from the new castle theme. we havent seen a carriage in a long long time. and it looks so spooky and sceary! lots of minifigs new skeleton horses (3!) this was the first set i got from the new castle theme!! outstanding!	positive
I bought this set to have the scared minifig, but I found a lot of cool pieces and stuffs... I love this set ^^	positive
That's a super review Erdbeereis1, as usual and as we can expect from one of the Academy teachers. I gave the set a 4 (above average) because I think there are quite some minifigs included for its price (which is, I think, not that expensive at all) I also like the parts that are included, like the sceleton horses and weapons, wheels,... IMHO this set is a great armybuilder ! BTW: In Belgium I have seen this set being sold for 15,99 Euros.	positive
What an amazing review! I actually have this set and I decided to take it apart. It has a brown horse and a lot of useful pieces, so taking it apart was a good idea. Now I have three LEGO horses! Hoorah! The end of the review was the funniest... Lego12	positive
Other than the minis, accessories and animals, this set is 'Meh' at best.	negative
My first fantasy era set.. and now I have 5 of them.. really good set..	positive
This set is alright but it doesnt have that pizzaz feeling you know what I mean. I would prefered a knights carrage realy but the design is ok.	neutral
I'm a little late in the coming (okay, a lot ), but regardless, I'd applaud you for another fantastic and insightful review, Erdbeereis. Out of all the castle sets, this one remains one of my favorites. I got it for Christmas in 2007, before I intended to spend much money on the new Castle theme (that changed once I managed to get the King's Castle Siege for a very good price). It's really a wonderful set all around - the design accomplishes the spooky undead feel very well, and it contains a good piece selection and a phenomenal amount of minifigs. Seriously, this set is almost unrivaled in modern lego in the final area - I'm still amazed at how many minifigures TLC put in the kit. I also appreciate that the carriage has a far more realistic horse arangement - after all the sillyness of the one-horse pulled siege engines in KK, it's good to finally see a carriage pulled by multiple horses again. All in all, an excellent set, and well worth $20 IMO.	positive

7990 Cement Mixer Theme: Town Released: 2007 Price: 15 USD Pieces: 209 (1 minifigure) Introduction: Need a skyscraper built? A mother-in-law buried? A treasure kept? No problem, here I come ! Only one booklet for instructions without any alternative model: It's divided into two sections for two seperate baggies which the parts come in. Parts come in two big bags: A few big pieces and the stickers are loose in the box. Extra parts and sticker sheet: Dark bluish gray 1x1 round plates are meant to be used as cement. Sticker sheet is neat. A standard worker with helmet: He comes with a shovel. Colour scheme makes it easy to understand the instructions: It's easy for younger Lego enthusiasts to build the model. Building in progress: Chassis of the truck is really sturdy. Drivers seat is on the left: I wish we had a real seat instead of a modified tile. Working drum mechanism: You can turn the cement drum from a handle on the front right. Nice details on the front: Rearview mirrors are great. I love the SNOT front panel too. Control panel on the left: Cement hose hardly fits its place and the hose is too thick. Don't forget the shovel: SNOT technique is used on the back panel as well. Long & wide truck with 8 wheels: I love the 6-stud-wide design of new town series. Cement drum actually works: If you place a couple of 1x1 plates in the drum and turn the handle it pours out the little cement parts! Man at work: All this hard work gave me wrinkles on my face :( Folder when public: Brickshelf Rating: -Figures: 6/10 Nothing special with the figure but what did I expect? At least we have a face expression. -Parts: 6/10 Standart parts for a truck but the big blue drum is new. -Price: 8/10 Very nice and detailed truck for 15 USD. -Design: 9/10 It really does look great, doesn't it? -Building: 8/10 Easy to build and it's fun with a little use of SNOT. -Total: 37/50 It's a must for every town. But other players should find it attractive as well. Conclusion: I occasionally order Town sets but I felt a great urge to build this when I first saw it on Brickshelf. When it was released I ordered it right away. Ten days later I was amazed looking at this beauty by my table. We didn't have a cement mixer for ages and I'm sure every Town builder will have this set. And I have no doubt non-Town enthusiasts, like me, will consider getting this.

7040 Dwarves' Mine Defender Theme: Castle Released: 2008 Price: 10 USD Pieces: 73 (3 minifigures) Introduction: Here I am, with one of the newest Castle sets realeased in early 2008. It's a small battle wagon with blades on the front, probably to demolish rocks in mines. But in this case, our hero dwarf has to use his machine against the evil trolls who want to destroy his happy kingdom. There is only one small booklet for instructions, no alternate model: Parts come in two bags, one for small pieces and one for bigger ones: Apart from the lovely figures, the brown parts will be quite useful for any castle builder. Extra parts are not even worth mentioning, there are no stickers: Figures are detailed enough, dwarf is lovely with his beard but his legs won't move because he is short: Figures are the main attraction for adult players. We haven't seen castle army builder sets for a long while and this is closest we've got in recent years. The dwarf is a little taller than it should have been but it's not possible to do so without creating a completely new mould for figures and that would be expensive. Its beard is oversized as well but that gives him a Legoish look which I like a lot. The trolls - that's what everybody calls them but I say they are orcs - are obviously evil but they are friendly enough not to scare our munchkins. But I wish they had different torsos or at least different faces like crownies. There are not enough weapons to arm everyone but the flag pole is really nice: Unlike the Star Wars army builders, this set has very little weaponry. Only one sword and one pike creates scarcity for 3 figures - Star Wars sets had 4 figures for same price! So I hope our middle age warriors don't come across any stormtroopers :) Building in progress: When you pull the chain the catapult fires a round brick: The set has quite good playability, moving blades and firing catapult should be fun for little children. I wouldn't expect more functions for such a small sized model, it hardly covers my hand. The blades move with the front wheel on the right: There is only one little downside, there is too much friction for the wheel and blades won't move synchronized. You may come over this problem by adjusting the blade height and lining them with the wheels. Mow the little buggers! You can adjust the blade height: There isn't enough room for the dwarf: Folder when public: http://www.brickshel...ry.cgi?f=338578 Rating: -Figures: 8/10 Dwarf is amazing, trolls are great too but I wish they had different faces. -Parts: 7/10 Brown slopes are new, rest is ok too. -Price: 7/10 Acceptable but we have seen sets with more figures for less. -Design: 6/10 It looks kind of steampunkish but could be better with a little detail. -Building: 6/10 Not repeating itself, still nothing exciting. -Total: 34/50 Castle fans will definetely order this one but average Lego player may not be interested. Conclusion: Overall, it's a nice set and I'd recommend it if you like the castle theme. You'll find some good use for the figures and this is the cheapest figure set of the year - at 3.33 USD each. It could have more armory and weaponry but otherwise it's quite alright. Skip lunch today and order this little set! Links: Brickset Reviews Bricklink Entry Peeron Inventory	positive

Nice review! I just recently purchased it for our future son and had to break into to it to get a first hand account of the merchandise! I am not that big into the castle theme...being a city/town person myself but I must say that this set is awsome!	positive
I got this set last month and I can definitely say that even if you think it is one of the best sets ever, you won't fully appreciate it until you build it yourself. The elevated city station is much more complex than it looks, and the whole set is extremely detailed. The good: - As stated in the review, there's a lot of track, roughly twice as much as the last monorail made, 6991. 5 long straights too! - the designers didn't need to put in the hamburger stand or the ticket readers, but they did and made it even better - Great figure selection; airport workers as well as civilians The bad (if you can call it that in such a great set): - Hard to incorporate into an existing town if using the default track layout. The center loop would be inaccessible to vehicles and the layout is very large. - The monorail needs nearly a full straight section on either side of the city station or it will impact the corner of the station and stall if a curve is too close. - As far as I know the only town set with road plates that doesn't have a wheeled vehicle. A car would have been nice, a bus would have been incredible. But these small things in no way diminish from the fact that this is one of the best sets ever. Edited by Section8, 05 September 2008 - 01:17 PM.	positive
Best. Set. Ever. I got my copy years ago from a guy on the old rec.toys.lego newsgroup (anybody here still remember that newsgroup??). I traded him a Guarded Inn, a Black Falcon's Fortress, and a couple other small castle sets for it. No regrets on that trade. It is hard to incorporate a monorail into a town, especially if you have a bunch of trains too! I ended up making my entire monorail system elevated. There's just no easy way to make a monorail / road crossing. I also gave up on having it run in a loop. Instead, it runs back and forth between two endpoints.	positive
An excellent review of one of the jewels in the crown of the Lego town range, to answer one of your question I think the lack of people owning this set is one of the reasons that its yet to have a review. Personally I’ve only seen this set in the flesh once in my life when I was a child just before it was withdrawn from sale. It is a lovely set, well made and well produced though I think there is a flaw and that’s when the passages get of the other end of their train ride what picks them up, a bus set for the airport would have been a good addition. Apart from that I can’t really fault it and that fact it comes with three female minifigs is just stellar. As for incorporation, keeping it elevated seems the most sensible suggestion. I’ve always thought it I have it and wanted to integrate the set to a town to use it in the style of the DLR in London, but that’s just a thought.	positive
Thanks for that splendid review, Simonwillems! I clicked on "outstanding," of course! I also like those little details, especially the ticket validating machines. You're very fortunate to own this wonderful set! I hope you have an airport to go with it. Edit: And bricklink is wrong giving 1991 as the release date. You're right; it was 1990.

Great review of a greater set.	positive
Thanks for all the nice comments! Holodoc, on Sep 5 2008, 11:05 AM, said: I had to laugh when reading your comment on the minifig seats. Don?t you own many of those? I don?t know where to put mine... Well, of course I do have quite some seats (a drawer full actually), but this was my first set that had them in black... When I was young however (long time ago, you know ) I always had a short supply of seats, so that's why I noticed and mentioned it.... WhiteFang, on Sep 5 2008, 02:18 PM, said: This is an outstanding review which deserved to be featured here! Thank you for drawing attention to this review through Classictown.net, I have not been a frequent user of the boards lately and the release has mostly passed me by but I must say that it looks like a great site! WhiteFang, on Sep 6 2008, 06:45 AM, said: Are the both of you doing grading out of the academy, when he is not a student there? Indeed I am no student of the academy, I have another academy (university) to attend to, leaving little time to venture around Eurobricks latlely, a shame, I know...

Then I realized that I had probably spent enough since coming out of my dark ages to buy a MISB 6399. So I bought it, and I am going to cut back on buying other sets for the next year or so to offset the one big purchase. Those glimpses of the 2009 sets haven't made me regret the cutback.

What an amazing set and a truly wonderful review! Thanks Simonwillems for the work you spend on this.	positive
judging from videos i've seen it seems that the monorail does very well on slopes. i wonder why there haven't been more or at least an updated set? i also wonder why the trains can't incorporate some slopes like the monorail.	negative
INDEXED Name: Refuse Collection Truck Set No.: 6693 Theme: LEGO System / Town Year: 1987 Pieces: 103 Minifigs: 2 Price: unknown Special parts: 4215ap08 (Yellow Panel 1 x 4 x 3 with Recycling Pattern), just occurs in this set (2x). 4598 (Red Bracket 2 x 3 - 2 x 2), occurs only in this set and only one other set. This truck was introduced in the same year that LEGO came up with the garbage bins that of course also appear in this set. Have you ever wondered why most of the time the streets of LEGO City are so clean and neat? No litter, no garbage everywhere, no chewinggum on the streets. Even with so many different inhabitants, it seems to always stay that way. However, the older AFOLs amongst us, have experienced totally different situations: rubbish everywhere, smelly and dirty looking pavements, minifigs that were losing their standard grin. That is why LEGO came out with this magnificent truck back in 1987. Before that, people needed to put there garbage in bags or maybe barrels. From that year on, every miniman and miniwoman is happily using a trash bin. The minifig civil servants never seem to become tired and the Garbage truck comes every other day to collect the rubbish and keep the city clean. The secret behind the clean LEGO city and the always happy 'standard grin' of our minifolks are the anti-litter warriors that use their powerful machines and handy tools to just get the job done! So if you don't own a garbage truck, better try to get one, before your standard grins also fade and your streets become as dirty as Naples (where the garbage collectors recently had a strike for quite some time). An overview of the set including instructions (actually one is included in the set). Unfortunately I afraid we don't have any boxes of this set left. Another image of the LEGO items in the set. It shows the truck, two civil servants to perform the waste collection duties, two garbage bins and a broom and shovel. The two chaps that always seem to smile, even when the litter that they collect really stinks. The accessories that accompany the set. A broom and a shovel to help cleaning up in case a dustbin tips over. A very nice feature of the set is that the elevator at the back can be lifted in more or less the same way that real garbage trucks do. As you can see here, the dustbin is emptied through a red 'train window'. (It seems to be that the hinges of my version will need some 'revision'.) Panels inside the back of the truck maximize waste capacity for this 4 stud wide truck. It is nice that the designers added this simple red round brick on a clip. Presumably it should depict cylinders to let the back compartment tip for emptying or otherwise it might be gastanks. Again the complete set. It is very complete set but some additions could make it even more playable: - garbage (e.g. a green flower bottom or some round plates 1 x 1) - a place for the second worker to position himself on, when the trucks needs to drive to the dumpsite or an other street and also vertical bars for that second worker to hold himself by. This is what the truck will look like when dumping the litter at the recycle plant or dump site, the whole back nicely tilts, so that all the litter will fall out of the truck. A view on the back of the truck. Quite a small but yet effective opening. The front of the truck. Only one seat for just the driver, but I personally prefer that to a 6 wide truck that fills the total width of the streets and has problems with corners. Of course set 7991 (The orange garbage truck of last year) is also nice, we also own some of those but we never put them in our LEGO Town since they take too much room and the color scheme of 6693 is also more preferable to us. The two panels with the printed recycling pattern are a bit worn so we might recreate the recycle logo and put it on a sticker some day. Playability: 8/10 (Like I mentioned it is too bad that the set doesn't have any litter [however LEGO also saw that and has put litter in the 6693 set]) Design: 9/10 (a really nice truck with two minifigs and very nice details) Price: -/10 (I was not able to get any price information, at bricklink one can still obtain a 2nd hand one for about 25$.) Overall: 8/10 (a set that should be entitled a 'classic' in the same list as the pizza restaurants, the 7750 and the blacksmith shop) That was all the pictures I was allowed to take since it seems that those brave man still have quite some trash cans to empty. Thanks guys for doing the dirty work so our minifigs stay happy and our streets stay clean! Peeron Lugnet Brickset: Bricklink entries Additional notes on the review: My brother has always been keen on garbage trucks. However when he became aware of this truck it wasn't available in the stores anymore. Newer sets that had the 'recycling theme' we not that good. They didn't have the emptying mechanism. So after our dark ages, one of the first sets we bought, were some of those nice refuse collection trucks. Although the new orange truck has the desired mechanisms and thankfully is a decent garbage truck, we more like 4 wide trucks than 6 studs wide trucks, so for the years to come our LEGO town inhabitants will still be seeing this great truck to control their waste problems.	positive
Definitely the best garbage truck ever, the color scheme is great and the design is awesome. Outstanding, without a doubt. I must have it sometime	positive
This truck is simply beautiful! It's on my brickset wanted list! I love the colour scheme. Red and yellow are the right choice for this vehicle! The back part of the truck can be opened, so it can discharge the rubbish like real garbage trucks. You've also mentioned that in your review, and I find it a wonderful detail! Thanks for the review, JopieK!	positive
Great review, and I love the soft yellow effect to the pics IMO, the most recent garbage truck should've used the same piece for lifting the cans into the big bin instead of the droid arms	positive
6206: TIE Interceptor Number of Pieces: 212 Number of Minifigs: 1 Price: 19.99 USD/ 17.99 EUR/ Theme: Star Wars: Episode VI Year Released: 2006 Brickset Folder Bricklink Catalog Welcome to my ninth review the boards, today's review is the long awaited TIE Interceptor. But does it live up to expectations? Well, let's find out. I believe this is the first and only time TLG made this set. So, let's begin the review. The box The box is standard for it's time, with silver font. The background on the front has some planets and the Death Star II, clarifying that this set is from episode VI. Overview This set comes with the Interceptor model and one fig. The Interceptor has a very sleek, futuristic design, with four wings and a ball-shaped cockpit. The TIE Interceptor is a stealthy, speedy vehicle in the Imperial fleet. It is used for scouting missions, and not meant for attacking due to it's weak structure and low arsenal. Front This version of the TIE group is very attractive and cool-looking. It has an aerodynamic shape, giving it looks and speed. While not accurate to the movie's grey and black colored TIEs, the blue in place of the grey is just fine, and does not alter the "coolness" of the design. Thankfully, there are no stickers in this set. Cockpit Here you can see the ball-shaped cockpit. Be very, very careful when opening it; it's very flimsy and breaks off almost every time. Fortunately, both the windshield and the dish on top are printed, and not stickers. Please don't mind the dust. Cockpit Interior This is the inside of the cockpit. It is very roomy, airtight, and one of the few cockpits in SW sets that are this good. It makes up for lack of detail by giving the pilot plenty of room, so you should have no trouble there. It is also very smooth in the back and where the windshield folds down. This is by far the best SW cockpit I have ever seen done by TLG, good job! The only bad thing is the two tan bricks that clash with the rest of the color. Wing attachment This is how the wings are attached to the cockpit on each side. Unfortunately, the design on this part is not so good, and sometimes the wings break off. Plus, this part is very blocky, and there is a big juniorized piece on the base of the wings. Wings Here is what each wing looks like. There are three parts on each wing: a middle and two fins. The wings are very aerodynamic, with a diamond-like design. Note the Imperial insignias and the blue tiles lining the wings. Wing attachments cont'd Here, again, you see how the middle wing part is attached to the base (juniorized piece), and the fins attached to the base by hinges. The hinges allow the fins to fold in and out a bit, but again, this is very fragile, and the fins often break off. Gun placements This is an example of four guns on the ship, one on the tip of each fin. The guns consist of a tile with a Tenic tunnel hole on the bottom attached to a Technic pin, which is attached to a black bar. A good design altogether. Back Here you see the rear of the cockpit. You can see why the opening mechanism is so flimsy: the whole top and front is connected to the body only by a weak hinge system, as seen in the picture. Also note the small, trans-blue dish and the four trans-red studs. Minifigure Finally, here is the single figure that comes in this set, a TIE Pilot. It is an all black figure, with a life support system decal on the front and a helmet with silver Imperial insignias. An overall good minifig, with a different helmet mold than the Stormtrooper or Shadowtrooper. Well, I suppose that's about all, let's get to the FINAL VERDICT: Build: 6/10, a little difficult due the flimsiness of the ship, but should only take the average builder no more than 30 minutes. Playability: 7/10, it's fun to fly around ( ), but has no real functions. Swooshability: 7/10, you can swoosh it around fairly well, just be careful not to accidentally break it. Minifigs: 8/10, a good fig, although having only one leaves something more to be desired. Design: 4/10, very, very flimsy with the wings, windshield, and fins, but good for display. Price: 7/10: I think it was actually 30 USD when I got it, but I'm not sure... Overall Score: 6.5, an average set. Very delicate, so much that you can hardly pick it up, but good for display. The minifig is okay, and having no stickers is good. I would recommend this to a hardcore OT fan. That wraps it all up, please vote your opinion on this set in the poll, and I'll see you next review!

A nice set, my brother used to have this. I wish the pilot's helmet had a little printing on it, looks messed up to me.	positive
The Interceptor is my favorite TIE ship so i wish i picked it up. Thanks for the review, i agree about the helmet, needs some silver printing on the mouth piece and the ends	positive
WhiteFang, on Sep 7 2008, 05:09 PM, said: JopieK, I enjoyed this review very much! Your first picture, certainly capture the essence of this lovely set. In reality, I am in the Aviation line, especially aviation safety. Therefore, you re-entact the scene very well. To be honest, I have never seen this set before. This AES (Airport Emergency Service) Fire Truck is certainly unbelievable. I love it very much. It's a pity I never owned this. This is a set which give me a "5". Thanks of course for the flattery but, do you then from your profession understand what the purpose is of the front 'spouts' that even can be hide, since that puzzles me. It can be that the LEGO designers thought it was a nice touch and didn't bothered about the realistic value of such a feature but I don't suppose that that is the case here.	positive
I remember my cousins having this set. Both are in their permanent dark ages now but are not willing to give their Lego to me If you have one of those old airports, then this set is what you need to have even more fun since it makes a great addition to the airport. Excellent review! 10/10.	positive

Somehow, I had just noticed your reply. To be honest with you, the AES in my country does not have front spouts in their fire engine. I do not remember seeing this feature before. It is a possibility that this feature is included in some models or an imaginative addition from our LEGO designers. I will need to check this out.

Sometimes there's no need for a big ambulance; sometimes you only need a doctor to get there. Fast! Set data 7902: Doctor's car Year: 2006 Theme: City Subtheme: Emergency Pieces: 66 (3 extra) Price: 6 USD / EUR / 4 UKP (UK price may have been higher in the past) Building time: less than 10 minutes More info: Brickset - Peeron Box front: no frills, just the set. Box back: no alternate models, but "Designed for easy building and istant play". I still wonder if today's kids are lazier or dumber than my generation... Box content: 2 bags, loose car base, instructions, stickers. (not so) Random manual page: the evolution of SNOT tecnique on car lights. Set inventory: split into 2 pages! Stickers: Red Cross has gone a long time ago; here's Caduceus. Loose pieces: we're ready to start! Minifig and accessories: "What's up, Doc?" M.I.P. (Most Interesting Piece): it's SNOT time! Building starts: and it's fast and easy Notes: car has doors! and that black plate with rail helps so that the roof doesn't only weight on the windscreen. Complete model: top view "Container Cupboards": that's where Doc puts its accessories when driving. Sticker time: see the difference, with and without. Review and rating. Do you remember when Lego cars had doors? It seems so long ago... The car is simple; but as well as a set can be designed, this one doesn't look so realistic (isn't it what Lego has been doing over the last few years? Going realistic?) Doc is OK, but I guess many people would have wanted a female fig (and: brown eyebrows with black hair? that's odd ) As I said, no Red Cross, but a politically correct Caduceus on the roof and sides. Extra pieces: 1 small antenna and 1 1x1 decorated tile. Overall, a cheap way to own a doctor minifig and a nice vehicle to add to your town. Just above average. Rating: 3.5/5	neutral
i have this set the doors really dont much	neutral
Nice review Cobra. Thanks for sharing. I esp. like the doctor's torso. I rate this little set a 4 based on the design of the vehicle and the classic doors. BLOGGED! EDIT: I must have missed this review after it was posted back in Sep. I went ahead and kept the blog, since it's always enjoyable to look at these reviews.	positive
mhh maybe put the pizza horizontally ^^ and gimme some! It was a nice set, it's a nice little crane !	positive
This looks like a great set, I like the futuristic fire truck. That might be what I do with my Imperial Shuttle's glass cockpit.	positive
Nice classic set. Are those hoses around the engine pneumatic tubes? That Technic catalog looks interesting too. I have the catalogs for the next several years but not that one. Quote This is the model at step five. The piston is already attached. Imagine this state on step 5 in modern sets. Back then LEGO had challenging instructions, not the step madness like today The most extreme example of this was the engine step in the 8865 set, which uses over 120 pieces by itself.	neutral
great review! I really love the seat and the great possibilities with the alternate models. also congratulations for getting that set in perfect condition!	positive
A nice old classic, the driver has a nice hat and torso, and the train is well designed, except for that thing on the roof.	positive
JopieK, on Sep 7 2008, 11:20 PM, said: The chair was just loose so it should be placed on the 2x2 plate that is also visible in the picture of the middle car. That's not the one I was thinking of, it was the other two chairs towards the middle of the wagon that I was thinking of. If you try to seat a minifig in either of them, you'll quickly find that it's impossible, beacuse the door interferes with the figs' required personal space. If you move both of them one stud forward (so that the back of the seat lines up with the edge of the window), it'll solve the problem, and still leave space for a figs to be seated in the other chairs.	neutral
A great review for a great set. Thanks for sharing it with us. A like the older LEGO trains. BTW I think you need to fix this: Quote Name: Jetport Fire Squad (Light and Sound series)	positive
A set from the "golden age of Lego". It brings back a lot childhood memories seeing this review. I was 5 and just starting to play with Lego around that time. I could look for hours the Lego catalogs dreaming of sets like this one. Thanks for this wonderful review!	positive

Nice review. I got this set not long after my ending of the dark ages. It was even then already on slae for just 5 euro. I like the figs and the vehicles. It were some of my first orange pieces. The Hippie Guy is called " Snap Lockit" and the Pizza Guy is called " Pepper Roni". I think the legodesigners had a cosy evening with much beer when they thought about the names. I think this line was the only line which was made first as computergame and after that as a real line instead of the other computergames based on already existing lines.	neutral

I loved this theme, it had some of the greatest pieces ever arranged in any theme, brilliant printed parts and figures, and some good colours. Snap Lockitt (Hippie Dude ) is a great figure with a cool name, I own him from another set, but unfortunately not this one. It looks like a very good set, no stickers and good printed parts too. Nice review. Hahaha. That made me laugh for some reason... I don't know why though, I agree with it. I have him as well, I got him from the orange jet-ski set.	neutral
This is a really nice small set I think. It fascinates me that those are actual printed parts. That's something we don't see too often anymore. The figures are very good, although I must say I like the name Hippie Dude better than Snap Lockitt. Does anyone know why the Brickster has one blue hand? Thanks for the great review!

What would we do without the trucks of LEGOland to clean up our town? Well, I didn't want to find out, so I bought this set straight away! 7991 Recycle Truck Set Info Set Name: 7991 Recycle Truck Released: 2007 Theme: City Price: USD 14.99-GBP 12.99-EUR 14.95 Pieces: 206 Minifigs: 1 Review Time! Leading off, the box The front shows the recycle man loading up... The trash can? One thing here is really bizarre. On LEGO S@H and everywhere else, it says that this set is called Recycle Truck. Which makes sense as it has a recycle logo on the truck. However, on my box, it says the set is called Garbage Truck Has this happened to anyone else? Or is it just me... Here is the back of the box which shows some of the things you can do with this set. The Bags With this set you get 3 bags which are numbered. And do you see what I see? Yes, that's right, the DSS is in a bag so it doesn't get bent! Why TLG doesn't do this more often is beyond me... Bag #1 The set comes with a very nice selection of pieces. A large number of these are orange. Manual Silly me, I forgot to take a picture of the front of the manual. The picture is the same as on the front of the box. The back shows some of the 2007 city sets in a nice little scene. And inside. Minifig Here is the friendly garbage/recycle man. He looks nice but with the same head as so many other city figs before him. Come on TLG! Give us some new heads! The Sticker Sheet The stickers actually are pretty decent as far as stickers go. I like the recycle sign. After Bag #1 This is where we stand after the first bag is built. Bag # 2 The parts contained in the second bag. More nice orange pieces here. Extra Parts Some nice 1x1 slopes and 1x1 round plates. Everything Built Now that everything is built, let's check it out! The design of the set is very nice and the color scheme looks great. When you see it, you immediately know what it is. The back has a droid arm that acts as a handle to dump the trash/recycling in the truck. It's simple, but works well. Here you can see the dumping mechanism. It works by a sliding technic beam with a stopper On top of the truck you can store the worker's cart. This works really well. I think though that the top of the truck overall looks a bit jumbled up with a few too many different colors. The bottom. Trash dumping time! This is a good feature of the set. A very well built SNOT front section. This looks fantastic with the grills and number plate sticker. Someone has left a big mess on the street... Brickshelf Folder Ratings! Price: 10/10 (For $15 this is a very good deal at 206 pieces) Parts: 9/10 (Lots of orange) Design 9/10 (A very well designed set. Especially the front) Playability 9/10 (The trash dumper is fun and the added broom and cart make for good play value) Build: 8/10 (Simple, but stayed interesting) Overall:45/50 Brickset LEGO S@H Bricklink Peeron Taking out the trash... Summary This is a great small set for the price with fun features, nice colors and good design. I would certainly recommend this set, no matter what it's really called Thanks, and happy building!	positive
nice truck indeed, but the yellow one is better I think, at least if you put them on a roadplate it seems to me that those road plates are too small for that. Also it will not empty completely because of that panel. Well, for the rest it is a nice set and a fine review!	positive
I own this set and I think it's a really nice truck, but there is two little details that I didn't like : 1/ a recycle truck really Needs 2 minifig, one to drive, one to put the garbage on the back. 2/ the big hole behind the driver seat, it was easy to fill it Like this : with hole POUF ! no more little hole! but this is really a great set anyway. 4/5 for me ( above average )	positive
That looks like one of those big strange recycle trucks from new york city, i like it!	positive
