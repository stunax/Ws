4 these are my only space base plates from classic space. actually, with only 2 plates, i could not do much serious expansion with it. instead, i merged it with my old city baseplates, and used it as a docking station for scientific purposes or restricted facilities that is guarded by the police. these baseplates are very useful and is suited for creating a space command center, up in the space.  

0 these are pretty good, but i think they look too much like the standard town roads from that period. i like the black space plates from the early 90s better (6710).

0 kdog, on jul 8 2008, 09:48 pm, said: that's the problem; the instructions aren't anywhere to be found, not that i've seen. the set does seem to have some rare parts, but i doubt $350 worth. by looking at the pictures used to display this set i've a sneaky suspicion it did not come with instructions but meant for the pictures to be ideas. the whole set was suppose to teach children to use their imagination, giving them instructions would somewhat defeat this while trying to figure how to build things from looking at pictures would be a much better educational experience.

0 year released: 1976 piece count: 53 minifigs: 2 lego brought out floating boats quite early, and in many ways the first were the best. (i'll explain why later...) this set in particular is interesting as it came out in two versions; one that includes the first minifigs and another that included the non-armless type. (set 709.) the police signs are stickers, and are in surprisingly good condition considering the age of the set. (i am missing one sticker on the front though.) note the technic bush and axel; they are the old type. the position of the second figure is not a mistake; i think he's supposed to be sitting down.... the first boats out by lego needed a weighted keel to prevent them.... keeling over. (i have tested this!) i suspect this is because of the density of the old hulls and the flat bottom... but i could be wrong. (it can't be just because of the flat bottom as the new cargo ship doesn't need one.) the keel in detail. the bottom extension is for a motor. (not included, nor made by lego at the time.) the keel had longer studs. even now it holds extra firmly. this is why i prefer the old design. you can extend or shorten the hulls as you please, or even insert other lego in the middle. you can easily add wheels or any other piece to the bottom of these hulls. i wish they would go back to this idea; the 4+ hulls were of this concept but were too wide. (probably so the keel wasn't needed.) the old minifigs aside from having odd feet and no arms had a normal stud as the neck. thus when you turn the head it tends to come off. i love this set!

0 thank you for the nice review, sinner. holodoc, on aug 1 2008, 08:59 am, said: nice review sinner! the old sets... i donÂ´t know - every old set, especially equipped with the old non-moveable arms minifigs look very odd nowadays. i agree with you with the hull shape and its possibility to be extended, but every other aspect, the lack of detail, the keel itself (you canÂ´t float it in shallow water) keeps me from rating it higher than 3/10. in my opninion the best police boat so far is 4021 *click to enlarge* well, if you're meaning really old sets, than i agree with you, but a lot of the sets from the very late 1970s and onwards are still very nice. this set just isn't a good example, that's all. oh, and i also agree with you about that police boat. however, the newer one in the city line is also great, imo. the only thing that weighs against it is the giant size, which makes it feel awkward in more classic towns. edited by grevious, 03 august 2008 - 06:30 pm.

0 lol! i can't help but smile everytime i see the quote on this thread..... don't worry these police are armless! lol

4 well what to say? i got this boat late 70s, when we were on our way to italy to spend the holidays there. my parents always needed to keep my quiet during the 3-day trip, and the best way to do that was to buy me a lego set... i got this one in a gas station in germany. as far as i remember italy didn't have lego sets, so a gas station close to the italian border but still in germany or austria was very often their last chance. i often saw large quantities of lego sets in those gas stations though... i remember seeing yellow castle and... the galaxy explorer, standing on a shelf. it would be my birthday 1-3 week(s) later so i always made sure they knew what to buy for me...

2 so, you've been bitten by the classic bug too, sinner. great review; but one would think arms would come in handy (pun intended) when you are a police officer, right? it's a shame that many of the original figs must now be forced to stand looking like they have their hands in their pockets, eh? i have no idea where i was going with that last sentence...

4 nice review, 'mariko'! this set is way past my time. the baseplate is okay (though i hate those dots). the car is pretty cool too...

4 yup that is very very nice..i wish i had been alive back then :d well ill never have a chance to own something like this so this is as close ill get to it! thanks for showing me the greatness....

4 theme: hobby sets set name: harley-davidson 1000cc set number: 394 price (new): 260-280 $, 185-200 euro price (used): 14-175 $, 10-125 euro pieces: 143 year of release: 1976 links: peeron, bricklink and brickset looking at the release date of this set makes me remember the good old times when lego sets stayed in production and could be found in stores for long years. yes, i hear you younger fols say this meant we had less variety at the time, but at least we did not have to go on a frenzy to get them all in just 1 or 2 years before they disappeared (to re-appear on the secondary market at crazy prices). anyway, i also realise this set is older than me by 5 years (at least the first boxes of this set). i think my parents bought it when i was something like 1/2 year old, or even before, as my father really liked the hobby set line and took any chance to get one, you know, for the kids, when theyâ€™ll be old enough to play with themâ€¦ i am really happy my father did it, too. as a matter of fact, this has always been one of my favourite non-minifigure scale sets. i know younger eyes will look on it and wonder how we could love and enjoy a model like this, so blocky and rough. just remember this was the best tlg designers could do with the bricks available at the time. enough about memories; letâ€™s start with the review! the box front the front of the box (here cut and folded to save space) shows the harley davidson 1000cc in all its glory upon a nice town landscape. i really appreciate how tlg box designers used a real life photo of the model in a real life environment to give this hobby set a better background. moreover, the landscape does not distract the eye, even with its lights, since the focus is strongly set on the motorbike itself. back (and sides) the back of the box shows the model on a more neutral background and from another angle. we can see the stickers in place (take a good look at them here, because i did not apply them). the right side we also see a pic of the set from the front, and one with a child playing with it. in this latter shot, the model rests upon a nice black box with a harley davidson sign on it. i frankly do not remember if this was some sort of tray or smaller box within the lego one or if it is meant for publicity only. another thing we can notice on the right-most side of the box is a white band, right below the lego logo, sporting the sign â€˜designed for experienced lego buildersâ€™ in various languages. all in all, a really well done and professional job. contents inside this set includes a number of parts in mainly black, white and light grey. some blue and yellow add nice touches of colour to the total. the partsâ€™ selection is not mind-blowing, as most of the pieces had been in production, in these same colours for years. anyway, iâ€™d like to focus on a couple of details: the milky white technic axles as well as the red technic bush old 2 are among my favourite parts. the bushes, in particular, are quite useful to build more sturdy looking tubes than what can be achieved with the newer and slimmer ones. it would seem that the tile pieces appeared in the â€˜without groveâ€™ version as a standard and in the â€˜with groveâ€™ version as alternates (see bricklink inventory). notice, though that the box (above) and instructionsâ€™ (below) pictures all show the â€˜with groveâ€™ variety. as said, there are no re-coloured parts in this set. new pieces the few new molds used in this set are: black and white slope, inverted 45 2 x 2 old type with round bottom tube, black technic, brick 1 x 2 with hole type ii and red hinge plate 2 x 4 with articulated joint â€“ male and female. the most interesting piece from this lot, as many of you will have noticed is the technic, brick 1 x 2 with hole type ii. this kind of technic brick was use during 1976 and 1977 only. it would seem tlg tried a new design variant, which did not meet success and was later replaced with the standard bricks again. nonetheless, iâ€™m sure that people who own these bricks like them for the unusual design and the possibilities they offer into adding details to their creations. instructions cover â€“ as usual, the instructions are not organised in the form of a booklet, but they consist of a folded double printed sheet. the â€˜coverâ€™ shows again the same shot as the front of the box, with bigger lego logo and set number and without the other additional information. â€˜back coverâ€™ â€“ here we see the full name of the set: harley-davidson flh 1200. this makes me wonder: why is this set known as 394 harley davidson 1000cc when it is indeed a 1200cc? anyway, what really makes me love this page is the list of stats below the photo, and in particular these two lines: h.p. (?)/(not given). this calls for just one question: why did harley-davidson not release this info? my opinion is that since this is a motorbike built for the police, they did not have permission to share the specifications on the motor, which was probably customised either by harley-davidson upon request or by the police themselves. â€˜random pageâ€™ â€“ as expected, no call-outs here, but the build is pretty straight forward and does not need them (apart for one passage weâ€™ll see later). the colours are easy to tell apart (in the end there is no dark grey in this set that could be confused with black). again, notice how the instructions include the â€˜with groveâ€™ tiles and not the older ones. maybe this was changed during the long time this set stayed in production? the â€˜last pageâ€™ shows other four models included in the hobby set line. unfortunately, i own only one of them: the 396 thatcher perkins locomotive. indeed, i would have liked to have them all! building start the handle bars look a bit too squared to me, but itâ€™s just a minor feature, and the overall shape is still good in my opinion. notice the red hinge plate, which will be almost totally hidden in the finished model (see below), and the blue tiles which work as indicators. the first steps, used to build the front wheel and windshield are really easy, until you get to the wheel. in facts, the instructions do not show clearly all the pieces needed for it, and i found myself with a â€˜floatingâ€™ wheel for the absence of one of the red technic bush old 2 on one side (the one not visible on the instructions, of course). not a big deal, but something that could have been done better. motor and seat the second part of the build includes the motor, seat and â€˜saddle bagsâ€™. the technique used for the motor, or better the radiator, is very clever. to get the ridged feel, tlg designers used 4 light grey plates stuck one on the other but not completely in contact. this way, the studs, while keeping the plates in position, keep them raised from one another at the same time. the yellow round bricks add some details and colour touches to this predominantly light grey parts of the vehicle. the use of the engine, smooth small, 1 x 2 side plates for the exhaust pipes, while quite clever, still looks a bit strange to me. iâ€™m mostly used to see them in airplanes, helicopters and spaceships. â€˜saddle-bagsâ€™, a simple build for one of the iconic parts of this motorcycle. here you see them in place, as well as get a look at the finished seat. i like how lego designers managed to make its shape with just a few quite big bricks. the â€˜saddle bagsâ€™ are a really nice touch, and they work perfectly when compared to the original. this is the rear wheel. as said before, only when you get to this passage in the instruction you get a real understanding of how the front wheel is supposed to be mounted as well. careful readers will notice how this is not one of the original wheels in this set. the original ones were mounted using the technic, gear expert builder 9 tooth. unfortunately, i could only find one of them in my collection, an itâ€™s used as the front wheel. by adding the rear wheel (which is shown from a better angle in the instructions), we complete the model. notice how the two technic bricks supporting the wheel are held in position by two 2x1 plates. i think this was a bad case of â€˜building by compartmentsâ€™ mentality: if tlg designers had considered this a bit more, they would have used 2 4x1 plates instead of 4 2x1. on the other hand, this is not the worst case i have seen in a lego set, and they keep up the tradition nowadays too. finished set front and here it is our fancy police harley-davidson! indeed, the front looks blocky and quite horrible to our eyes, but again, it was almost the best that could be done at the time. i only wish they had made it a little less bulky, even though this build is clearly thought to give better stability to the wheel. the blue tiles work nicely to emphasise the indicators, the slightly unsightly red plate is normally covered by the plate sticker and the windshield, albeit being hard to see through, is nicely shaped. back the back side is less detailed than the front, but shows the red light and antenna which are typical of the police motorbikes from this period. how many times have we seen this angle in the chase scenes from tv shows like â€œchipsâ€? side all in all, this model looks pretty sturdy (apart for the antenna, which falls off all too easily) and detailed, especially considering the limited variety of parts available and used at the time. they even got so far to put a 2x2 tile as kick-stand to display it without fear of it falling on the sides! bonus images size comparison? what i never understood about this set is what scale it is meant to be. i mean, it is clearly not minifig-scale, and it could not be technic-fig-scale (those came later). but it is not even miniland scale! moreover, the only other model with the same scale is the other hobby set motorbike, as the cars have a scale of their own and the thatcher uses still another one! final comments overall, this is a great set for collectors of old models and motorbike fans, or both. it does not sport a huge variety of bricks, but was a good choice at the time, and even if the result is matter-of-fact blocky when compared to the original, it implements some good solutions to minimise the lego brick appearance and maximise the similarity as much as possible. design & colour scheme â€“ 9/10 (the design is as accurate as possible, apart for the front mudguard maybe, and the colours are completely in line for a police vehicle. the solutions and details included in this set justify the â€˜expert buildersâ€™ label and add to the appearance, and, why not, playability of the model.) parts - 8/10 (not a huge selection, and very few new molds. nonetheless, a good source of black and white standard parts for mocs and one of the few sources for the extra rare technic, brick 1 x 2 with hole type ii pieces.) playability - 9/10 (a sturdy model which can take some serious play and swoosh-ing without falling apart. the easily detachable antenna and the lack of an appropriate scale interaction with most other models make it lose one point, though.) build - 7/10 (pretty straight forward, with few nice solutions and an already mentioned slightly obscure passage in the instructions.) price - 5/10 (like most older models, especially the hobby set and model team ones, this set can be found at reasonable prices only rarely. most of the times, people are asked shameful prices for such a smallish set.) overall: 8/10 very good. as always, questions, comments, and pic requests welcome! edited by whitefang, 17 april 2011 - 06:19 pm. indexed

4 thanks for the feedback guys! indeed this is a great set, and i'm very attached to it. as far as i remember, i got it for say my 2nd birthday, i think but it is not my first lego set. you'll learn more on this in my next planned review

4 luxorv, this is a well written presentation on this lego vintage review. i never knew the existence of this set and even though the design is not part of the modern lego design concept but the overall appeal back in the 1970s certainly appeal to many. i could not mind to own such vintage lego model and put them on display and potray as if it was a chart of evolution of lego motorbikes. thanks for sharing and i can't wait to find out your next review.

4 great review for a classic model. i love it.

4 rare classic sets are always a priceless part of any lego collection, and it's a good thing you still have this first set of yours luxor (or did you purchase a new one?). excellent review btw, it's always a pleasure getting a closer look at these classic sets which i wouldn't have known to exist had i not seen this review. overall i think it's a really good set at that time, of course judging this one by modern standards won't be fair but at the time i'm pretty sure it was a 'cool' set to have (though less cooler than having the harley davidson set).

4 thanks for the review 'luxorv', an interesting old set, though i find it hard to imagine a square smoke stack instead of roundish. it truly has that classic lego simplistic build with all studs showing and making do with standard partsm except the few you havepointed out 'luxorv'. a nice flashback 35 years ago....now thats old school anyway brick on everyone !

4 thanks, luxor, for bringing us this excellent tour round an old classic! for its time, this is truly a remarkably detailed and beautiful set, and i think it's amazing how it's still in such good condition after all this time. do you have any more from this era (excepting the harley, of course )? i've created a whole new index to put them in

4 indexed 410 â€“ payloader theme: legoland/vehicle piece count: 28 year released: 1973 msrp: ??? links: brickset, lugnet, peeron, bricklink *note: this set was released under the number 604 outside of the u.s.* ah, classic legoland. a time before mini-figs ever existed, and cars and buildings could be made with just a few bricks. the part selection was pretty basic: bricks, plates, slopes, windows and wheels were all you needed to construct an entire town. heavy machinery could be modeled in 4-wide and be just a few bricks tall. for this review we will be taking a look at the 410 payloader, one of legoâ€™s first sets of a bucket loader. so grab a hard hat, we are heading to the construction yard! box image courtesy of bricklink. box contents here we have our instructions which are obviously the older style of lego instructions. the steps used much simpler imagery, but they get the job done. they show how to build the payloader in seven steps. this small set has all of 28 parts in it. the more interesting parts of note are the red digger arm, the bucket, the blue 1x2 brick with arm holes, and the blue 2x2 brick with the classic lego logo printed on it. construction in the first few steps we start building up the base. then add the arms and start building the cab. add the bucket, the trailer socket and finish the cab. throw on some wheels. completed set and with that we are finished with our nice small model. here is the back right side. notice how the back of the cab was left with an empty spot. here is the left side. notice how on the top of the arm they made it so you could just push down on the tips it to make the arm lift instead of having to grab by the arm itself. on the front we have the nice lego logo shown to remind the forgetful of what they were playing with. you can also see how much space is in the bucket itself, which can't hold more than a few small plates. finally on the back we have the trailer socket. this was a nice addition to make it able to tow trailers from other sets like 685. just donâ€™t try to bring it into your layout populated by mini-figs, they may have a problem trying to get in. other thoughts considering this set is nearly 37 years old, i myself am still surprised by how well the bricks have held up. i purchased this set from a thrift store a year ago for a mere 25 cents. normally when used lego is purchased you can expect to see scratches, marks, wearing, discoloration, etc but boy was i surprised to see how all these parts are in mint condition. even the instructions still looked like they came from a new box and not all ripped up and tattered. the pieces still connect to each other nice and tight and the metal pieces for the wheels haven't rusted. this just shows that with proper care these things can last a lifetime. i really would like to get a small display case to show it off. conclusion playability: 8/10 in addition to the standard of having rolling wheels, you also get a fully movable bucket assembly. with it you can pick up smaller pieces and unload them into a dump truck. design: 7/10 like all other legoland vehicles it has a very basic design, but you can still easily identify what it is. simple yet effective. parts: 7/10 like most other older lego sets, all you really get are a few basic bricks and plates. however, you do get a bucket assembly and the 2x2 brick with the classic lego logo on it is very cool. it was also nice of lego to include the trailer socket so you could tow around your trailers. price: 8/10 bricklink's history shows them to sell for around $10 usd used. while that is a bit much for a set this size, it is pretty good considering this set is over 37 years old. however, if you are looking for a new boxed set be prepared to fork over about $50 usd. overall: 8/10 this small machine would make a nice addition to your collection as a reminder of lego's past. so what are your thoughts on this classic set? edited by thebrickster, 01 june 2010 - 05:55 am.

4 and again those tears in my eyes. with original box...! i really love those classic space stuff. looks like i need to clean my stuff this summer.

4 this classic space shuttle is simply superb! i love the layout of this shuttle. in fact, it reminded me as one of the space fighter jet, that roam around in space, defending the boundaries from intruders. i just love these old grey bricks very much and the printed computer brick is just lovely. it's such a pity, that i did not grow up with classic space in my childhood. these are actually great stuff, and formed the base of the space theme in lego. brickster, thanks again for another outstanding classic review.

4 nice!!! 442 is the lowest set number i have seen for any classic space set, so it must been released with the first wave in 1978. its remarkable that a lego spaceship this old and small can seat more figs than the much bigger mx-71 recon dropship of today. anyway, i just want to grab it out of the screen and swoosh it all over the place, lol. tlg, please make these classic space sets again! i promise i'll buy many!

4 great job! i love reading vintage reviews, as it reminds of our childhood days. glad to see this in very good condition. by the way, i will move this to lego trains & town, to see if thebrickster will like to include this set inside the review index over there. i believe he is maintaining vintage town set reviews over there, and this suits there well.

4 here is the spirit of st louis. just go there (washington) and have a look of this legend : cavannus, on jul 15 2009, 09:40 pm, said: in 1977, trans or yellow slopes existed already, and using them would have made the plane more realistic. i don't think so. there is no 45Â° slope in the original plane design ... and no front cockpit window. quote a third rear wheel would have enhanced playability and design, rather than this ugly black round brick. except that it wouldn't have been the spirit of st louis. this set is a great one and i wish i'd bought it in '77. it is the spirit of the 70ties ...

4 483 alpha-1 rocket base year released: 1979 piece count: 170 minifigs: 3 vehicles: 1 (two sections) list price: unknown despite the nuclear non-proliferation treaty of 1968, lego dared design a rocket base complete with a rocket system that may have had nuclear capability in 1979. luckily, the rocket was defective having rather flimsy white bricks that did not stay together well during launch attempts. lego scrapped its wmd program and the result was this classic "blue era" space set known as the alpha-1 rocket base. instructions: on the backside of the instructions, the set is featured with the space command center, space cruiser, and a few vehicle sets: the set includes three figs: and this great rocket fuel tanker: here's the front section complete with computer: and the rocket fuel section: the set has some interesting features including the control section, fuel control, and launch pad: on top of the control section is a nicely design radar/tracking system: here's the open control room: the launch pad and fuel control: the fuel control includes two sink pieces and blue steering wheels: and lego's wmd (weapon of mass destruction), the alpha-1 on the launch pad: here's a shot of the launching mechanism: unfortunately, i have lost one of the blue sink/faucet pieces as well as a black hose: a close-up of the alpha-1 rocket. the white bricks never stayed together well often times coming apart within your hands: the arming and guidance system was nicely designed: a view of the complete set: and another: this is a great set. the base, fuel vehicle, and launch platform offers a great amount of playability. my only complaint is the rocket (as mentioned above). i don't think i ever played with it a sa kid because it always fell apart. share your comments regarding this classic space set.

4 wooow! what a set!! not all that large, most defenitely not as sophisticated as the message intercept base from 10 years later, but in those, this was all a kid need to have hours of fun. soooo many great parts on this one.... technic hoses, computers, rocket parts, trans yellow parts... the perfect outpst really... it was actually my sister who got this one, but it only took an hour before i claimed it... edited by snefroe, 14 july 2008 - 12:36 pm.

4 ahh, the good old days. thanks for the review.

4 nice rewiew the set is good too)

0 thanks for the great review! *sweet* now that i've seen the set, i'm afraid i'm a bit disappointed 8-| 1) the color combination doesn't really do it for me. blue, dark blue, grey, black, tan, white, they're all mixed together without any over all design... 2) is there any interior? it doesn't look like it, and in any case, you can only reach it if you remove the modules... hm... |-/ now it looks too much of a box... 3) there are most certainly some nice ideas in this model and some great parts. the best part of the model is the staircase 4) i don't think he spent much time in thinking about the design. as apo said, the chimneys on top of a garage is kinda weird, there's also a gate, next to another gate which is weird as well... also, if this is supposed to ba a grocery, then the owner has done a lot to hide it. the croissant is nice, but next to the brown box with vegies, there's nothing that suggests this is a shop... 5) the white lamp and the the yellow cylinder are at the same level of the tiles. imo it should be above the level of the tiles... 6), imo not worth the 90 euro edited by snefroe1, 20 june 2007 - 09:03 am.

4 thanks, i love the look of this set! i love the mix of colours, it breaks up the model rather than being a single monotone colour. he's used several complimentary colours in order to make up the model. i agree i think the chimneys on the flat roof is weird ontop of the garage, but not so weird one you place it ontop of the building. i guess he's done it to give us the choice of roofs and chimneys. you can always remove the ones you don't like... he also seems to have screwed up a bit on the tiling for the sidewalk on the side module. on cafe corner (and the building module of this set) the sidewalk has the pattern light grey 1x6 at the front, then dark grey 1x2 next, then dark grey 2x2's. however on this he's put the 2x2 tiles first then the 1x2's at the back. easilly fixable though. overall i love this set, thanks for the pics! compliments cafe corner perfectly.

4 thank you legocastlegirls for your quick review! *y* it?s the first time i realize the back of the market street. the tan bricks are a replacement for some windows i?d guess? i do love that building, especially the top floor with the neat balcony. *wub* of course you are (again) left alone filling the interior. but i just had some food parts ordered at bricklink... x-d one thing i?d like to know: this is an online-exclusive, right? can i order it at a lego-store (k?ln / oberhausen) and get the sum rewarded on my voucher booklet? *sweet* i heard it here, but i?m not sure. 8-| if anyone is looking for how to fill it with interior: go read the latest brickjournal #8! there?s a whole chapter written about designing the rooms. interior on!

4 hi thanks for posting those great pictures. i got the cc some time ago and i really looking forward to get my hands on the market street. i think the colour scheme of this set is great, maybe because blue is my favourite colour (just check my wardrobe)? i really like the design of the roof and the staircase. i ?am not so sure if i like the gateways but i believe they will grow on me when i get the set myself snefroe1, on jun 20 2007, 09:02 am, said: 5) the white lamp and the the yellow cylinder are at the same level of the tiles. imo it should be above the level of the tiles... i? am totally agree with snefreo1, the yellow cylinder and the lamppost should be on a level above the tiles. actually i have put a 2x2 plat under the lamppost on my cc, looks much better if you ask me. unfortunately shop at home does not send to norway???, so i have to purchase this set in billund (yes, i ?am going to legoland this summer) or on ebay.

4 i still haven't bought the cc or ms. but reviews like this make me wanna buy them instantly. thanks for this legocastlegirl !!

4 thank you very much for that nice review and those lovely pictures, legocastlegirl! *y* a very interesting set with a great color scheme and some "sunny side" feeling indeed. *sweet*

4 i'm not much of a city fan but this looks great. i guess this is the closest we can get to legoland (miniland) quality sets. and considering this is a three floro, small structure, and it's over 1,000 parts, just imagine (pun not intended) how many peices are in ll california's empire state building or wtc freedom tower models! both are large and in real scale over 100 floors! that's a lot of bricks. anyways, i've got a friend who loves city. i'm sure this one would make a great addition to his town setup! gotta tell him about this new set! *y*

4 legocastlegirl, on jun 20 2007, 07:42 am, said: i know it?s not such a nice review like *yoda* did the last times, but i hope you enjoy some of the pics. nonsense sandra !! tks for sharing these cool pics ;-) its also a nice hommage to erik brok. i really like this set, i think its really well designed with great ideas such as the dual stairs, the balconies, the croissant insignia, the market entrance design with the horns, whip and owl 8-? i like the color combination, and the mosaic design just in front of the entrance. the only terrible flaw is that yellow cinlinder !! that is just awful for a flower pot :-x i don't mind at all having that lamp post at the same level since it would be normal to have the base of the lamp at the level of the tile but i agree that is just pickering about an insignificant detail :-p legocastlegirl, on jun 20 2007, 07:42 am, said: a funny idea is the salad in the one box at the front. i think normally it?s a hairpiece of an exoforce fig. yeay that is just brilliant all the way 8-? this is a great set indeed and a must have for town fans !! *yoda*

2 i can't believe i missed this great review! thanks for the pictures, sandra!

2 woooooooooooow! that's some maquette! say, i wonder if the blackhole stormie will be playable in lswtcs? maquette on!

4 you're the coolest man i know! thanks for sharing copmike. that thing is awesome.

2 thank you, interesting indeed. those are quite expensive though, perhaps 60 dollars or more.

4 wow, that's awesome! and look, a giant 3x3 lego piece! 8-? :-d edited by iamded, 27 june 2007 - 08:03 am.

4 impressive, really impressive mike 8-? many tks for sharing these great pics ;-) i really love it !! thats a really sweet way to make us want legions of blackies :-d darn you !! i really like the fact he still has a megaphone - classic all the way ;-) now i want to sing some metallica :-p quote blackened is the end, winter it will send throwing all you see, into obscurity death of mother earth, never a rebirth evolutions end, never will it mend never fire to begin whipping dance of the dead blackened is the end to begin whipping dance of the dead color our world blackened >:-)

4 very nice copmike!! i can't wait to get my boba now! those ebay prices aren't to bad. hmmmm... :-d

4 thats so cool! i would want one. it would look good in the house. -zots

4 hi, you are right, this is such a fantastic maquette. i really hope that i will get the chance to own the other 4, too. it is carefully packed in styropor. the painting is nice, looks really evil. i think it is a wonderful addition (with the 4 other) to any collector shelf..(-; mine is number 276. greetings hendrik

4 well it has taken me over 2 years but i have finally bought this maquette! it's a real beauty! just don't ask what it cost! my set of maquettes is finally complete.

4 well, now that i have some money, a trip to toysrus was obviously in my future, especially since my local tru has much of the summer 2007 lineup. when i got there, almost all the smaller castle sets had been sold out, but there was one left: the one i am now reviewing for both eurobricks and bzpower. ;-) the box: well, for starters, the castle theme boxes are beautiful! the blended clear and stormy skies give a great ?clash of the titans? effect, and the action poses help as well. ;-) the back is equally nice, featuring a photo showing kids how to use the crossbow, and the brave axe wielder taking a swipe at the skeleton (foolish soldier, that won?t work on skellies! see later on in the review to find out why). and of course, we have a small box with the link to the official lego website, where tlc can advertise even more lego sets! :p the contents: after opening the box, a single bag of pieces (with a couple loose ones), the instruction manual and necessary catalog ( :-p ), and a new wider rubber band holder spilt out. the instruction manual is clear as a bell. no color trouble here, folks! also, it?s worth mentioning the nice background with the mountain and king?s castle silhouettes. :-) sorry that there's no picture, but i'll take one if someone wants to see it. ;-) the pieces: for being a 5 dollar set (well, seven in my case. darn your above average prices, tru!), crossbow attack features a lot of nice pieces (as does the entire castle lineup). notable elements include two large brown spoked wheels, two brown modified 1x1?s, a pearl gold slope end, and six dark blue modified 1x1x2/3 slopes! the bulk of the pieces, however, are nothing special. i?ll let the picture do the talking for this. the accessories are by far the best parts in this kit. two different helmets in a beautiful shiny silver are my favorite, but i also really like the scythe (looks good for mocing) and the round shield ( *wub* ), which are both brand new parts. and can anyone not love the classic axe and crossbows? oh, and there?s a black lightsaber too, but that?s rather boring compared to the other parts. :-p the minifigures: can you say, four figures (including the horse)?! that has to be a record for a regular 5 dollar set, at least in the present age of limited figures per set. we?ll start out with the two crown militia: a regular soldier and an archer. both have old faces, but they look spiffy with the shiny helmets and the superb torsos. i?ll name the soldier bravo the stout and the archer angler the precise, for future references. now we come to the skellie. although some people dislike the new skeleton design, i personally prefer it to the old ones, since the arms are now poseable and the face much meaner. the only problem is that the arms hang too low, but it?s not too noticeable when they have weapons in their hands. and last, but not least, here?s the elusive skeleton horse. i for one am very happy that tlc took advantage of that awesome prototype piece and made it into an official mass-production mold. however, the horse is unfortunately one piece, but since regular lego horses are as well, i don?t have a problem with it. i do have a problem with the pose, however. the legs are in quite an odd position, and i wonder why tlc didn?t make the front and back leg poses symmetrical. ah well. the finished set: i have only two pictures here, since this set is so small. first, here?s the completed crossbow. i must say: finally! no more ridiculous horse mounted catapults or crazy fire wheel launchers! now we have realistic siege weapons, including the one included with 7090. plus, it actually launches okay, although not the best. here?s the other main attraction: the completed skeleton rider and horse. i think it?s rather dramatic with that pose and the dark background, don?t you think? ;-) playability: okay, so there?s not much in this set, but a bit of imagination brings plenty of possibilities. to show you what you can do, here?s a little story made only with this set. ;-) overall rating: presentation: 9/10 pieces: 8/10 minifigures: 9/10 finished model: 8/10 playability: 8/10 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ final score: 8.4/10 crossbow attack is a fine introduction into castle, so i recommend it to any lego fan, whether they are a castle nut or just want a cheap change of pace. tlc has a knack with making great small kits these days, and i more than ever support them in their amazing rebound from their dark ages (between 1997 and 2004). ;-) edited by kimt, 10 august 2008 - 01:33 pm.

0 thanks for this review, and that great little comic! about the skellies though (x-d), you have to admit that besides their long arms making the skellie legs look out of proportion, that they're just made poorly. they're sticking straight out, as opposed to every other fig, which have a slight bend to make them look more natural. also, as i'm sure you've noticed, the pegs are on angles! that makes it impossible for them to hold their weapons straight, and they can't even put their arms over their heads without stressing the plastic some... i mean they're dead. well, at least undead, they're not supposed to be stiff, and personally i like the ragdoll look more, it makes them seem more dead :-p

4 thanks for the review. that set is high up on my list; how could it not be with a price like that! (i love the added story.)

4 tks a lot grevious for this !! regarding the set i just love it !! i really oved your comic, it was really well done and hilarious x-d eb spirit on !! vader, on jul 2 2007, 08:28 am, said: still i shall be buying alot of these sets just to increase my army. you don't say mate, i bought like 10 or so so far x-d medieval *yoda*

4 this is the only one of the new castle sets i've been able to get hold of so far. i know others have done it before, but as soon as i'd got it, there was something i just had to try: heh, cool! *skull*

4 grim reaper on! the new skellie looks so much more natural with the droid arm *y* !

4 great review, i love this set.

4 that was a great review!!! very entertaining! :-d love the comics!

2 ugly. as. hell. but an awesome parts pack, worthy of purchase.

4 :'-) such a beauty, the functions are great, cool video! i want to get this set so badly... great review! *y*

0 the box is has really strange dimensions - it's very flat but has a large front - the 1:1 scale. regarding the spines, because they're made of the softer non-abs plastic (the stuff the 1994 cutlasses and brown muskets were made of), they lose their shape a bit and so are hard to grip; they simply fall off. i suppose tlc use loads of different colours because a single or two-colour dino isn't very nice to look at, especially when the surface isn't very smooth - it takes your eyes away from the surface and puts it on the colours. someone should make an all terrain dino that can walk everywhere from this set - i don't have the skill with technic - i always end up layering and never finish any models. :-(

4 got this baby via shop@home a little early and i though it was time to post my view of this set : (snefroe you need to get this one ;-) ) sorry for the lack of pics but there are already many pics online of this baby so here it is : best space set since... a way too long time this is my first new space themed set since more than 20 years and i must say that i’m not disappointed at all. i have much to say about this little gem. first, let’s cut it straight about the martians minifigures: they are absolutely rubbish. i can’t imagine how lego could produce such atrocity. this said; let’s move on to the dropship. a real piece of art. reminiscent of the aliens movie dropship. the cockpit is spacious and provides a great field of view, too bad there is no hinges to open it, you must remove the canopy completely to switch pilot. the drilling unit can be attached under the ship with the clever use of a rubber piece. it stays well in place once attached, good point. some people don’t like the inclusion of the 2 containment area for the martians and crystal on both side of the ship but i kind like it, it makes the ship less empty. the 2 wings are complete with air intake, some armaments and 1 standard launcher on the right wing. normally i don’t like launchers but this one is very discrete and well integrated. on the tail section are 2 thrusters that can be rotated and provide thus some “realistic” movements to the ship. one of the last highlight of this ship is the landing gears, or i must say landing dishes. 6 medium sized radar dishes provide and incredible stability to the set. they are quite sturdy and can take a beating. i’m not going to review the alien spaceship in detail since it’s quite uninteresting. i consider it more like a bonus addition to the set than anything else. the look is passable and there are some interesting building techniques in it. that’s all. to end the review, a little pros/cons table. (we all love pros/cons table :-) ) pros: - incredible design - at last a decent space set - modular functions - quite sturdy - beautiful - great value for money cons: - martians are rubbish - no hinges for the canopy - the drilling unit could use some more details. score: 9/10 by the way , i added a nice cool feature on my site , you can download the stickers for some sets that i own. before building i always scan the stickers, we never know it could come handy. check this out on my site (you need to go in the lego lists on the left): [vtx] classic games

4 i like the dropship kit and got this. now that i built it i see so many things i can do to tweak it to make it a moc. i think this is a set everyone mm fan should get.

4 nice review!

2 a very nice review, thanks dunamis. *y* i really don?t understand that color scheme, but the new motors?re very interesting. well, that dino is just mediocre to me.... i think that the new technic bulldozer is much more interesting.

4 thanks for the bonus review. i am still on the fence with this one so every opinion is good! dunamis, on jul 14 2007, 07:41 am, said: but what about the at-at??? in case you don't know, the at-at in the dark side development kit had a single motor and a moving head. it worked by the head simply swinging from side to side due to balence shifts. i suspect the at-at will be same. i also think that there will be no remote for it either. edited by sinner, 14 july 2007 - 11:31 am.

4 tks once again dunamis for a great in-depth review ;-) i really look forward to your supped up and moded at-at :-p i am really not found of the design but i think its still a nice parts pack, especially with all these nice "power function" elements ;-) *yoda*

0 oh, is he ugly or what? i've never seen a dino that needed to go on a diet more then him. :-d but i'd get him for the pieces; all those lime-green pieces. *drools* but, meh, i'm not really in to mindstorms, so i don't think i'd get this. but anyway, nice review, i now know exactly what he's like. kml

4 wow...that set is really something. but i prefer pehistoric power, and triceratops. or are they the same? i can never tell.

4 awesome reveiw, thanks! i gotta get this one!!! *y* *wub*

2 paulc, on nov 4 2007, 02:21 pm, said: i kind of like the design of this, but more importantly i really want to get my hands on the power functions motors and ir control system. i'd prefer the 8275 technic bulldozer, but there's no way i can stretch to the ?100 price tag, so i was thinking i would have to see if i could get a 4958 monster dino cheap in the january sales. if you really want the power functions the bulldozer is better value as you get two large motors, two small motors and two receivers compared to the one in the dino set alos watch toysrus and argos both have had the bulldozer for ?70-75 in there pre christmas sales usually for a week only i am hopeing they will be on sale soon as i want a second bulldozer to get some more motors.

2 i ended up buying both this and the dozer. :-$ i plan on using my dino for a ir car in a month or two...

4 this is both my first set review and post about a star wars set- (even though i have been collecting them since '99). i got this one early this year so i thought i would post a review on it. please bare with me- i am not a great photographer. so with that in mind, here goes! front of the box: 75083 at-dp box-front by whitesidewjw, on flickr back of the box: 75083 at-dp box- back by whitesidewjw, on flickr shot of the bags: 75083 at-dp bags by whitesidewjw, on flickr the sticker sheet (i normally don't apply them, but for this i am going ahead and putting them on): 75083 at-dp sticker sheet by whitesidewjw, on flickr minifigs- i really like the two at-dp pilots, but the best agent kallus really does shine. of course we get an extra stormtrooper: 75083 at-dp minifigs by whitesidewjw, on flickr no new molds in this as far as i can tell, however these printed 4x4 domes are really great. i can see lots of uses for these in space mocs. 75083 at-dp new printed elements by whitesidewjw, on flickr bag#1 complete- nothing earth shattering here- an easy build: 75083 at-dp bag #1 complete by whitesidewjw, on flickr bag #2 complete: 75083 at-dp bag #2 complete cockpit seats by whitesidewjw, on flickr cockpit assembly: 75083 at-dp cockpit assembly by whitesidewjw, on flickr bag #2 complete 75083 at-dp bag#3 complete by whitesidewjw, on flickr "foot" assembly"- i like how they positioned the slopes 75083 at-dp "foot" assembly by whitesidewjw, on flickr complete at-dp 75083 at-dp complete by whitesidewjw, on flickr complete at-dp-side view 75083 at-dp side view (complete) by whitesidewjw, on flickr complete at-dp- over view 75083 at-dp complete- overview by whitesidewjw, on flickr complete at-dp rear view 75083 at-dp rear view by whitesidewjw, on flickr extra pieces 75083 at-dp extra pieces by whitesidewjw, on flickr the verdict: minifigs- 5/5- we get a total of four figs. i like the two at-dp pilots and agent kallus is a well done minifig. i can complain about another storm trooper either parts- 3/5- other than the dome pieces i commented on before, there is really not any new parts in this. if you build space, star wars, or machinery, this will still be a welcome assortment. experience of build 4/5- this really was a fun build. it came together fast but was challenging enough for its target age group. playability 5/5- this thing is much more sturdy than it looks. the legs take a little bit of effort due to the double locking hinges but hold together very well.this is a very minor complaint. value 4/5- typical- $49.99 for 500 pieces- i must admit i paid a little more than msrp due to shipping but i can't complain about the value. overall: 21/25- i really believe this is one of the best walkers that lego has designed. the only changes i would make would be adding real control panels in the cockpit and it would be nice if lego made a real widow to fit in with these types of builds rather than a transparent tile over another plate. all in all, i would recommend this set and i hope the rest of the 2015 star wars sets are on par with this.

4 pretty good first review! this looks pretty great, i probably won't be getting it due to budget constraints. (bionicle) but still, very nice set. to me it kinda looks like the missing link between when the at-st evolved into the at-at. also, i know the rebels stormtroopers get a lot of hate, but i really like them. thanks for the review!

2 whats behind the printed 4x4 dome? is that 2x4 yellow plate? im planning to replace that.

4 great first review! as a huge walker fan its great to get one thats not a redesign, or one of those tiny battlepack vechicles.

2 flieger, on 24 december 2014 - 03:04 am, said: thanks for the review! i have two questions: - what is the driver standing on, when the hatch is open and he is looking out? - could you show the face of kallus without helmet, please? my only complaint is that the colours of both, kallus's and the drivers's uniforms are wrong. kallus's uniform is way too dark and should be more dark olive than black, and the drivers's uniforms are too bright and should be more greyish compared to what we saw in the series. here are the pics of kallus- his head would be good for a steam-punk character. agent kallus front by whitesidewjw, on flickr agent kallus back by whitesidewjw, on flickr the driver isn't really standing on anything- he is just kind of wedged in there. irispen, on 24 december 2014 - 04:20 am, said: whats behind the printed 4x4 dome? is that 2x4 yellow plate? im planning to replace that. yes there are several yellow accents on this- however, in person it looks really good. edited by whitswj, 24 december 2014 - 02:55 pm.

4 awesome! i am really looking forward to buy this, but is it really $50.00 us? i was hoping more around $30.00. also, i was wondering how the hip section for the legs work, does it have a stiff turning axis to it?

2 great set, really impressed. odd that lego didn't include stickers for the controls - can't think of a reason they wouldn't have. and why do only 3 of the 4 figures have leg printing? i just can't understand lego at times

2 the legs are about 2" shorter than the at-at; its cockpit is a little larger than the at-at's "head;" it doesn't look out of place as an escort-type walker or heavy walker, especially as both are built in the same style, although if scale differences really bother you the most recent at-st is probably a better bet for you. edited by hjmediastudios, 29 december 2014 - 04:32 pm.

0 great reveiw, shame on lego for forgetting that they already made a at-dp pilot helmet (ezra's from the phantom set) that didn't resort to needing a printed head.

4 a great review of an obviously fantastic set. a must-have for 2015! thanks!

4 brilliant review and thanks for plenty of detailed shots of the interior, i may invest in this set but ill have to wait until 2015 star wars is sorted and budget for the arrival of pirates in april!

4 fantastic review, could easily be the year's best, and it's only january 1st! you've got a duplicated picture in the bit where the candy is being moved from the outside and through the barber shop.. ...and i was expecting a final b&w picture or two where the detective makes his report to the woman in red, and gets his reward (candy, of course) or she in turn reports back to her real boyfriend, the candy smuggler. edited by rollermonkey, 01 january 2015 - 04:08 pm.

2 how was the pool table legs made?

4 great review oky! i really love your introduction text. you put a lot of effort in this review, with lots of nice touches. well done for me the set gets 4 out of 5. it's a great set, but there's something preventing me of giving it 5 stars.

4 wow, that is the best start to a review i have ever seen. great job oky, amazing set, i'll be picking it up this weekend!

2 thank you for the review, it was very interesting and changed my opinion of the set, i'm now considering a future purchase ^^. just one question: the mirror is on cardboard? i was hoping for it to be a window piece with a mirror on one side.. i hope it's not the same cardboard we had on some of the early harry potter sets or the element won't last long

4 awesome review 'oky'.....thanks for the cool writing and excellent photography........your last photo could of had a cry of......."you'll never take our candy !"......well he does look mel gibson like ! this set is a serious contender for best set for 2015, so much detail .........must buy one, need to brainwash wife into buying me one !

4 thanks very much. i love it *wub* . it needs tweaking, but isn't that half the fun? incidentally, when people were calling it rhino, i thought it was just a reference to captain scarlet. seeing the stickers in the middle made me realise my mistake. buy! buy! buy!

4 thanks dude. this is a great set. can you please take more pictures? thanks

2 this set is truely incredible, a must have. but this set is also incredibly overpriced *n* ! com' on it's only a big vehicle , nothing really special to justify the near 100? price tag. this set is clearly worth something like 65? at max. look at the incredible dropship for 34?, that's a good value for money! *y* edited by mutex, 15 july 2007 - 04:57 pm.

2 thanks for that very interesting review, snefroe1. *y* that vehicle looks really nice, with a lot of playability, but too much technic brick construction for my liking. it seems like there?s pretty much space wasted inside of it, some kind of small laboratory or a room for the crew and at least a mining toolshed would?ve been cool.

2 i echo the consensus of this thread - too much technic, looks great, too expensive, looks great.

2 please build the alien craft, i'm sure that we would all like a review of that! ^_^'

4 nice review *y* i have quick question though.... do the crystals fit into the aliens hands? try and stick one in there,becuase the new catalog shows an image of an alien holding a crystal lastly lego should have made the aliens with movable arms and no hole in the middle |-/ i don't want to waste any money so i am only going to grab 1 or 2 of the smaller sets piranha edit:imo the aliens would win becuase they have superior technology and all they do is have to cut the airtank line and the humans die edited by piranha, 20 july 2007 - 01:40 am.

2 say, i was looking at your pics and then at the instructions and i just realised : haven't you put the stikers on the shield thingies in the middle upside down? i think you did :-d i don't know if i like those new sets, though... i mean they have great shapes and potential, but at the same time, they seem so holey... they're really huge and big but full of empty air and space as well... well, this one not as much, and indeed it is the best looking set of the lot, though... but i don't think i'll go into that line...

4 8-? such a wonderful machine! great review! too bad all my money is going towards the castle theme! >:-( my wallet is planning to kill me!

4 the life on mars theme was so much better, with the aliens dominating mars instead of the humans. and the aliens were so much better, with their own names etc. good times. anyway, i think this is the best set in the series. it looks so neat and reminds me of the pelican form halo. x-d edited by iamded, 31 august 2007 - 05:11 am.

4 i think the life on mars series was great. although i didn't click until the line was gone that the red hangar on the alien base was for the red mech, and same with the blue one. man, i was gutted when i realised that, i want those mechs! however, the base was great, with the small mech and the flying crafts. could the lom mechs have been the spark of life for exo-force? 8-? edited by iamded, 31 august 2007 - 05:15 am.

2 lego 41062 elsa's sparkling ice castle lego managed to get a frozen licensed set in the new wave of disney princess sets. however, i'm very surprised by the size. it's a $40 set and comes in a small friends-style box (roughly 12"x12" size) - i almost didn't see it on the shelf when i was looking for it because it's so small. i mean, i know it's only $40 but it's a friggin' castle. and why did lego only make this a smaller set? if they'd made a $200 frozen castle they still would have sold every one they could produce. they made big harry potter hogwarts sets and those sure sold. and have you seen the toys in the frozen section of stores? huge playsets for barbie-sized dolls. but i suppose i'm getting the cart before the horse here, reviewing before i've even opened the box. so..... name: elsa's sparkling ice castle set number: 41062 pieces: 292 price: $39.99 minifigs: 3 theme: disney princess year of release: 2015 links: bricklink peeron brickset the box the front of the box is standard lego fare, other than the large anna and elsa in the bottom right corner. oh, and surprisingly, nowhere on the box is the normal minifig lineup. the only way to know what characters are included is to look at the set pictures. the 1:1 this set uses one of the minidolls as the actual size sample. that's probably not a bad choice since the minidolls are not nearly as well known as a minifig. the back on the back, the play features are shown in insets around a rear view of the castle. like friends sets, you also have an array of play accessories. the seals is this standard on 2015 sets or is this specific to this set? i've never seen 3 tape seals on a set. even huge modulars or technic sets only have 2, so 3 on a set this small seems excessive. perhaps lego expects people to try to steal the dolls? if so, why bother with extra tape? a tiny pocketknife makes quick work of the tape so the third strip doesn't even slow you down. the contents in the box are 2 instruction booklets (bent), a white plate, a sticker sheet, and 3 numbered bags of parts. the stickers these are very hard to photograph since they're shiny. i mean polished chrome shiny. those dark lines across the corners are not really there, they're reflections of my ceiling. the manual backs the back of one booklet has a friends "win!" girl. the other has an ad for the lego disney princess website. that site is so girly there's even sparkles following your mouse cursor around. so i didn't stay too long or look too deeply. the sample page the interior pages of the manuals are on lavender backgrounds. it's standard lego instructions with part callouts and insets when needed. the build, 1 the first thing you build is anna, but i'm not showing that yet. then you build this little picnic scene. it's tiny but effective, and nice to have something not icy in the set since the movie has the "in summer" song for olaf. i'm curious what's in that sandwich though - green and pink? after the picnic is the olaf build, but i'll save him for later too. the build, 2 next is this small sleigh. it has an amazing amount of style for something so small. the curved front and decorative whips on the back make it look sleigh-like instead of blocky. but come on, it already had pink accents, are the pink flowers really necessary? technically, yes, so the whips can mount to them, but still, it's just over-girly for my taste. the build, 3 the sleigh needs a ramp to help it rocket along (for a couple inches, at least). the ramp starts like this, with a hidden lime green jumper plate that gets a cookie on it. i couldn't remember anything in the movie like that, so i asked my wife and she couldn't either. a hidden cookie under a hill? the build, 4 after putting the tilting 2x8 onto the base and adding decorations, this is the result. a lime green bucket holding a pair of ice skates, a flower (in the snow, really?), green and white round studs that i assume are supposed to be grass and snow? the build, 5 the sleigh looks huge sitting on top of the tiny hill, but it actually works pretty well. assuming you're on a smooth surface like a table, you can give the sleigh a little nudge and it'll shoot down the ramp and a few inches across the table. the unevenness of the slopes vs the blue tiles holds the sleigh in line well, and the bumps in the slopes don't seem to hamper anything. the build, 6 moving on to bag 2.... man that's a lot of colors in this base already. and i'm already starting to feel like there's trans-blue cheese thrown around randomly. the build, 7 continuing (and rotating), some steps and even more colors thrown in. magenta? in elsa's ice palace? i sure don't remember any of that... the build, 8 wait, seriously? an ice cream stand in the castle? that is what the magenta is for? i kinda actually like the looks of it, but it doesn't fit the set. the build, 9 spinning back around, now there's a light aqua spiral staircase added along with a roof. this is where i'm really starting to wonder about lego's thinking. those light aqua stairs, and the light aqua 1x4 tiles, are exclusive to this set (as far as i know... it's possible some other 2015 sets use them, but nothing in bricklink yet). seems expensive (to produce) to me, when there's no huge reason to need them. another blue for the tiles would have been fine. and the spiral stairs? really? elsa's castle is known for staircases, but not spiral ones! there should be a huge straight ice stairway out front or sweeping curved stairs inside, but not a spiral. the build, 10 and now we finish the tree. again, why? where is there a tree next to elsa's castle? and so weird... with ice hanging from green branches that have both snow and flowers on them. huh? did lego watch a different movie? the trans-light blue bits before looking at the upper level, a brief pause to look at some other parts. here's the 1x2x5 brick in trans-light blue and the 2x4x6 rock panel in glitter trans-light blue. do those look like the same blue to you? and again, another unique part for this set. why do those rock panels need to be glitter, when lego made the same panel in trans light blue in 2013 and 2014 for superheroes, friends, and chima sets? apparently disney really wanted glitter, because there are a bunch of trans-glitter parts in the new princess sets. there's trans-neon green cones for jasmine; ariel, jasmine, and sleeping beauty all get glitter trans purple cones. so there's a bunch of new glitter parts for 2015. the build, 11 back to building - time to add the upper level. we get a bedroom with a decent bed, although stickered. the build, 12 the other side of the bedroom has some little accessories. perfume and a crown i assume? the build, 13 time for walls and a roof. i like the small white macaroni bricks for a wall, but what's with the lavender fence piece in the center? i'll grant that it looks nice (a common white fence would have been a little boring), but it's another unique piece to this set. the build, 14 the very top of the castle is built separately. not a whole lot to say here other than why is there a torch in an ice castle? the finished castle once the roof is put on, the castle is done. and that big purple star on top says everything to me about the styling. it just doesn't look like modern lego to me; it looks like this should be an old belville fairy tale set from around 1999. if i saw a photo of just the castle with no figs (or picnic blanket), i'd assume that's what it was. the oops, not actually done yet accessories at the end, there's a few bits left to add. there are these dark purple skis (yup, another unique part) in the lower level. let me tell you, they're a pain to get into that location, at least with my big man hands. more accessories the top level gets a stickered book. the sticker has a nice castle image on it that is, while not quite exactly the castle from disney world, very disney-looking. i actually had to google and see if that's the castle they use in their logo. nope, but it's the same style. the leftovers there are a lot of extra parts in this. that's almost 10% of the part count in the set right there! they are pretty useful overall though. it's great to have an extra "carrot" and brown "branch" for olaf, since you know those will get lost as he's played with. the figs finally, the reason for the set. let's face it, the castle set is just an excuse to make these figures. and they're great. i mean just fantastic. the print on them is just such a good match to the real characters. compare to the cartoon version from the front of the box. elsa's hair is a little darker than the cartoon, but overall these are just dead on. if i had to pick out a flaw, it's the "spell" elsa is holding. it's too bad she can only shoot it forward with her arm down like that. it'd be nice to have the end of the splash part bent 90 degrees so she can have her arm forward and the spell shooting forward too. oh, one other thing. the minidoll heads don't press down tight to the body like minifig heads do. there's still exposed neck. it looks nice, but it means elsa's cape can swing around. the fig backs elsa's cape is glittery on the back and you can see the removable bow in her hair. the full set one final issue. when you put anna on the sleigh, her cape doesn't have enough flexibility (since it's a wraparound kind) and so it folds out funny. that's why on the back of the box it shows her standing on the back of the sleigh with elsa in the seat. edit: how on earth did i forget to comment on those orange flowers to each side of the castle? i'm pretty sure elsa did not have any flowers blooming outside her castle! the conclusion hm. i really wanted to like this set, but i just can't quite bring myself to. it feels like lego pulled a random castle design from the files then redid it into white and trans blue to look icy and allow a frozen tie in set. the figs are great, but the castle isn't. i guess the real castle in the movie would be a boring set and this one has play features, but it just is too different for my taste. the ratings value: 7/10 - $40 for less than 300 parts is high (especially when so many of the parts are tiny, but on the other hand there's a lot of rock panels and 1x2x5 trans blue panels), but the figs help save it. design: 4/10 - not one of lego's best. not as bad as the lows in the 90s, but not a great set. minifigs: 10/10 - possibly even a 12/10. they are the reason to buy the set . playability: 8/10 - there are a bunch of play features, but they actually detract from the design, so i had to knock off a couple points. parts: 7/10 - a bunch of impractical unique parts (how often do you need dark purple skis or a lavender fence piece?) but also a bunch of nice parts if you wanted to make your own icy scene. overall: 7/10 - a great bunch of figs, but i'd recommend not bothering with the manuals. just use the parts to build your own castle that's better.

2 the review is very well done. thanks! i don't know the movie. my key question is whether the bricks in the set will allow to build my own snow/ice creations. now, with "trans-glitter" being part of the design approach i am not so sure. can those who have already bought it tell me: can trans-glitter be used as "transparent with snow particles" or is it just terrible? i cannot really tell from the review pic above.

4 i think the trans-glitter blue panels can be icy or snowy just fine. i'm sure that's why they used them for this set. now, if you're looking for realism (like the photos in your sig seem to be), it might be tougher. but i've been thinking about using those big glittery panels to make a waterfall-type scene.

4 i'm literally of the exact opposite opinion to op here. i love the structure and the parts (this is a fantastic little parts pack that i'll be snagging more of when i find it again)...but i've no use for the figures (not a big disney princess fan). it's all about the parts. this set is freaking amazing! :d

4 well, the good news for you is you're in luck whenever you find sets, since the figs sell for a good bit of money :) right now the bricklink value of the 3 figs is about $30!

0 bennemans, on 13 january 2015 - 06:08 pm, said: there is a very simple reason for the flowers and green-leaved trees; you should remember from the movie it was actually summer when elsa set of the eternal winter… true, but all around her ice castle it is all winter. so why are there non-winter bits in this set? doesn't make sense. the picnic is because they wanted a mini-vignette for olaf to fit into, but the rest of the green and flowers don't make sense. tenorikuma, on 13 january 2015 - 09:58 am, said: i'm pretty sure i've gotten other sets recently with three pieces of tape on them. cool, good to know. was wondering but haven't remembered to look when i'm at a store recently. whitefang, on 13 january 2015 - 09:12 am, said: very nice review indeed and i also can't wait for the release of this set. it will be a superb wonderful addition to the lego disney princess theme. thanks for the fp, but "a lovely sweet review?" i thought i bashed this set pretty hard

2 i'm trusting there is something else going on behind the scenes because this should have been a huge set and released in november of 2014 at the latest. maybe we will see more and better frozen sets when the post-christmas consumer spending wave hits. edited by m0dulo, 13 january 2015 - 10:03 pm.

0 hello everyone, i am back to share with all of you, another of my legends of chima polybags review. it will be pretty comprehensive since the finished built will be quick and will be focusing more of what kind of fun that you can derive from there. this polybag was bought in september 2013, when i visited legoland malaysia and i did not hesitate to put this in my shopping basket. name: 30253 leonidas jungle dragster theme: lego system / legends of chima year: 2013 pieces: 30 minifigs: 1 minifigure price: usd n.a, gbp n.a, euro n.a, sgd n.a resources: brickset, bricklink an original polybag image of the 30253 leonidas jungle dragster back view of the original polybag image of the 30253 leonidas jungle dragster the road scout of the lions tribe this polybag design is definitely plan to be the quickest and fastest dragster to recce enemy front by making a swift scout for the lions tribe. i believe by the sound of the name, jungle dragster, it might just be suitable to use in jungle terrain. well, i don't quite agree that this is a 'dragster' even though it has the kind of open view concept of rolling in fast but it does not have the length of a typical dragster, similar to this town polybag design, for example. still, it is nice to have smaller variants of their vehicular supremacy. instruction manual (front) instruction manual (back) the lego building content with just 30 lego elements, you can be pretty quick to be able to display these laid out content. after the built is completed, these are the remaining spare parts. i am fond of the wheels which are some useful parts, other than that, there are nothing spectacular about it. my name is leonidas and i belonged to the lions tribe do not be mistaken of his name, leonidas to be the king of sparta who led the brave men of 300 spartans warriors to fight to the death against the persians. instead this character is based on the bio resided in lego.com, you will realise that he is aligned with the lions tribe and is a proud lion foot-soldier. he may have that goofy idiotic look but he can be very serious in his commitment to discharging his duties. you are able to observe his nice back view printing which reveal his black and blue sash. leonidas has a dual facial feature to reveal his much serious appearance. leonidas is one of the common characters available in the legends of chima universe. it can be found in a total of five sets. it is a great pity that there is no weapon being made for him in this polybag design which will certainly make a fine addition. the completed built of the jungle dragster this is the main design of the jungle dragster which is very simple looking. there is no distinct fighting capability from the vehicular design and it look just like a regular patrol vehicle. one thing i like about this, is the close distinct colour schema of the lions tribe. other than that, there is nothing special about it. moving off with my jungle dragster to conclude, this polybag is really meant for lego fans or collectors who appreciate legends of chima or wanting to sample the legends of chima theme. it is a very simple built, but yet could form a decent force size for recce purposes before sending in the big arsenals to whack their enemies. either way, i will only suggest you to buy it if you really love this theme at an inexpensive price. otherwise, it is perfectly alright to give this a miss. summary review playability: 4/10 (you need to have more lions tribe vehicles in order to bring the best and fun out of it since this is more of a supporting vehicle.) design: 4/10 (simplistic built of the dragster and main focus is just acquiring the minifigure.) price: 4/10 (bought at about usd$7, which is not an awesome price, so get it if you can get it more than half of this price.) overall: 4/10 (if only you are a huge mega fan of the legends of chima, then you need to get this.) i gave it a "2" based on my review score card. what about yours? i hope every one of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine. comments and criticisms are strongly welcomed. pictures can be found in my flickr.

4 thanks for this review, i love this set *wub* that batman is great, and i've always loved that awesome scarecrow fig. that new pumpkin is fantastic, i can't wait to get it in the set...how many come with the set? i hope more than two :'-( i love both of those vehicles, this set is a definite buy for me!

4 when i first saw pic's of the bi-plane i wasn't sure if i liked it or not, but after seeing it in more detail i gotta say i love the thing *wub* it's a great plane with so many good aspect's, it's also the perfect counter vehicle for the new bat-plane. for me though the best part of the set has got to be the new pumpkin heads, those are just beautiful and i cant wait to get lots of them.

4 tks mate for this brilliant review :-d i loved your batfabuland story !! always fantastic to read like always *sweet* i really love this set and i shall buy 2 copies: one to build as is, and another one for my town loool: regular biplane for the tarmac, and my swat copter ;-) btw, i would have a request: could you post pic(s) of the parts inventory please ;-) many tks in advance !! *yoda*

0 christian, on jul 18 2007, 08:21 pm, said: i would love to have this set but the price is just to high here, far worse than i had expected. i'll be better off buying the battank, which is much better priced. actually there is almost no price difference between the batcopter and the battank here *wacko* that is insane! *wacko* 450 and 500! indeed; you should just buy the tank. comparing the price of the tank to the batwing you seem to be getting quite a good deal there. both are over priced for australians and the tank is twice the price of the copter. (they are 60 aud and 120 aud.) i am still not sure if i will buy either... :'-( edited by sinner, 18 july 2007 - 11:47 am.

4 sinner, on jul 18 2007, 08:24 am, said: i thought you would like it! i am pleased to say that i didn't know that "the jig is up!" was also a common line. most of what i remember about the old batman tv show actually comes from the movie as i own that. (mum bought it for me.) i tend to put in on if i have friends over and i am drunk enough. i like the darker side of batman only, and thus anything that is against the idea that batman is as big a loon as the guys that he hauls in i don't like. joel schumaker's movies fall well within that category. wait, what? are you saying you prefer the joel schumacher films? if you like the darker side of batman, i recommend the tim burton films. joel schumacher is as campy as "the jig is up" imo. he added freakin' nipples to the batsuit for god's sake! :-p you'd have to be nice and drunk to enjoy his films. ;-) i really like batman, batman returns and batman begins. sinner, on jul 18 2007, 08:24 am, said: santa brings presents here. in the middle of summer, in full winter rig. he is a hero. at least he can come down chimneys here without being burnt :-p ! no. no no no. i saw a movie once. i'm pretty sure it's a wallabee. xwingyoda, on jul 18 2007, 11:27 am, said: tks mate for this brilliant review :-d i loved your batfabuland story !! always fantastic to read like always *sweet* i really love this set and i shall buy 2 copies: one to build as is, and another one for my town loool: regular biplane for the tarmac, and my swat copter ;-) btw, i would have a request: could you post pic(s) of the parts inventory please ;-) many tks in advance !! *yoda* what nice things to say! :-$ thanks mate! you always make me feel brilliant. :-$ here is the parts inventory: (click to enlarge) the scarecrow plane would make an excellent crop duster and the batcopter will make an excellent swat copter. sweet! *sweet* thanks everybody else for the nice compliments as well. i'm deeply concerned about price differences in other countries. it seems pretty ridiculous and counter-productive for tlc. has anyone posted about this in the embassy forum?

"holy opinions, batman!" :-d

2 what about the cartoon??? batman: the animated series will always be the definitive batman to me. the two tim burton movies were okay (they haven't aged well though), and i really dig what christopher nolan is doing with the new movies. christian bale did a fine job in "batman begins" ... but when i watch the movie, i hear kevin conroy's voice in my head. the cartoon rocked. and as much as i enjoyed the justice league unlimited cartoon, my biggest complaint was always: more batman please!!

2 shakar, on aug 1 2007, 01:34 pm, said: third note: is it just me or did you attach the two black gate pieces too high? shakar no, i think this is correct. the upper plate with clip for the door is a little high, on top of a dark gray 1x1 brick. so if you want the door to operate well you have to place it like that. i just put the clip under that brick, a very easy fix, so my door now is lower which looks better imho, and no sneaky skelly can crawl along under it.... x-d

4 not sure i like this one much. i like many of the new parts but the boat isn't that great and i would rather get each seperately so i can avoid the whole skeleton army. nice review though!

4 all i can say is... wow... can't wait for my local stores to stock this! nice review btw :-) does the snowspeeder actually fit through the door? thanks! edited by supernova, 02 august 2007 - 02:06 pm.

4 nice review mutley *y*! i agree with all your observations, especially stickers versus printed parts |-/! i get some of this and replace the snowspeeders with my v.2?s. hoth on copmike

2 review - 42039 - 24 hours race car introduction when the preliminary images of the "le mans racer" surfaced somewhere last year (2014) it got a lot of praise. this changed dramatically when the final images of the 24 hours race car showed up. the front side of the car, especially the head lights, and the curvature of the side of car had changed a lot. the car obviously still resembled the prototype, but the new design raised a lot of eyebrows. the new design was considered a step back instead of forward. eventhough i still liked the design, i must admit i liked the earlier design better too. with the emphasis on past tense liked. i am not sure anymore and this review will show you why. like the arctic truck this set has a b-model which is well worth checking out. that's why this review includes both the a-model and b-model. for people who are on the fence, the b-model might actually convince them to buy the set after all. let's see what this set is all about! note: all images can be clicked for hi-res versions. set information number: 42039 title: 24 hours race car theme: technic released: 2015 part count: 1219 box weight: 2110 gr box dimensions: 47,8 cm x 37,3 cm x 8,7 cm model dimensions: 40 cm x 18 cm set price (msrp): €99.99 / $? / £99.99 price per part: €0.082 / $? / £0.082 links: brickset, bricklink the box the box measures 47,8 cm x 37,3 cm x 8,7 cm and weighs well over 2kg (2110 gr to be precise). the width of the box is the same as the box of the arctic truck. this box also feels like it's filled to the brim. the front the front shows a picture of the main model in action, with radial blurred wheels to emphasize the motion of the car. the lower right section shows the dimensions of the model. upon completion, it will measure a length of 40cm and a width of 18 cm. the back like the front, the back side has exactly the same setup as the box of the arctic truck. the top shows the functions of the model, while the lower left side shows the b-model and the lower right side shows the motorization options. the picture of the b-model looks so cool, it could be a model of it's own. at this point i was very eager to build both models and compare them. the side one of the sides usually shows a part in 1:1 scale. this time it's one of the wheels indicating the size of the model. content of the box the box contains: 1 book(let) 1 sticker sheet 13 bags 4 tires instruction booklet since i own two copies of the set, i also received two instruction booklets. what's catching my eye is that my second copy is supplied in different packaging than the first one. it's for the first time (that i am aware of) that the instruction booklet and stickers come in a sealed bag, without cardboard back. hopefully this will be a new standard for all sets with sticker sheets. instead of multiple booklets, this set contains a single square bound book. in earlier reviews i have epxressed my preference for a single book. i don't see any advantage in having 2, 3 or even up to 6 booklets. sticker sheet like the actual model, the sticker sheet looks very vibrant. the bright green, white and black color combination has found it's way to the stickers as well. either you love 'em or hate 'em. since i started writing reviews i have been applying stickers and i am happy i started doing it. stickers do give the model it's finishing touch. bags with parts thirteen bags with a total of 1219 parts (give or take a few) are supplied in the densily packed box. the rims and flex are sealed in a bag as well. sometimes looking at the bags makes you wonder what the logic is, behind the distribution of the various parts across the different bags. well this time it really got me confused. take a look at two of the bags below. there's a bag containing all the 3l blue pins. then there's a bag with various parts....and a single 3l blue pin. i figured this might be an error, but both of the sets have the same anomaly. tires the tires have been supplied unbagged, as usual. highlighted parts this chapter describes new and interesting parts. this set actually contains a lot of them. this set also contains an abundance of panels. if you aren't into panels, this isn't the set for you. changeover catch this year (2015) the new changeover catch parts were released. it's a combination of three parts. the advantage of the new parts is that the red gear is the same on both sides, which avoids mounting it the wrong way around. it also avoids the changeover catch slipping out of the driving ring, like it used to do. you can apply lots of pressure, but the catch doesn't slip out. pins some of last year's new pins are also included in this set. 12 x pin with pin hole and 21 x 3l pin with 1l axle. securing technic beams can be quite simple with the new pin with pin holes. the new 3l pin with 1l axle gives you more possibilities when connecting beams and other parts. below are two example situations where the new pins have been used. granted, the examples below can be accomplished by using other techniques. however, some predicaments from the past can be easily solved by using these new parts. like me, you will most likely appreciate the ease of use. engine and suspension also included are two steering portal hubs and steering portal hubs with ball joint arms and four steering portal axles for driving and steering the vehicle. these parts are commonly used nowadays. the picture below also shows some other parts, like gear rack, steering arms and suspension. frames this set comes with a single 5x7 frame and three 5x11 frames. panels this set contains a whopping 47 panels in three different colors. i personally like panels a lot and i do appreciate the variety we have at our disposal lately. this set even contains a new 13x3x2 curved "mudguard" panel. new 13x3x2 curved panel this is the first set to contain the new 13x3x2 curved panel. looking at the pictures doesn't do these panels justice. in real life they are actually quite big. i figured they would be smaller, but they are even longer than the 11 x 5 frame, with a length of 13 (including the attachment points). hopefully this part will be available in other colors as well, preferably white, for adding variety to your ev3 robot. 19l white flex-axles the white 19l flex axles have only been released in a single set, the 8461 williams f1 racer in 2002. current prices on bricklink are as high as 15 euros! needless to say we are very happy with the return of these white axles. now we can build jeroen ottens' awesome alfa romeo 4c spider for a decent price as well. i am really happy that useful rare parts are being used more often by tlg designers part list here's the complete list for all 1219 parts. as you can see in the highlighted parts section, this set contains a lot of interesting and useful parts. if you don't own sets like the 8070 - supercar, this might be the set to pick up if you want to start building your own supercar. the build enough with all the set and part information, let's build the model. rear suspension the build starts with the rear suspension and drivetrain. as you can see in the picture below, the length of the axle between the steering cv joint is 4l, where it usally is 3l. this is an indication that the finished model will be a bit bigger than usual (8070 for example). the finished suspension is one of the cleanest suspension setups i have seen in an official model. it's pretty basic, but it works like a charm. this setup is defintely worth using in your moc. here's a video: after attaching the suspension to the frame you rotate the module and secure it. at this stage the rear section of the chassis with suspension is almost finished. v8 mid-engine extending the chassis forward results in the picture below, where the front spoiler is already visible. what's also visible is the v8 engine placed right in front of the rear axle, resulting in a mid-engine setup, perfectly suited for sports and race cars. two exhaust pipes have been fitted on either side of the engine, together with two hoses attaching them to the engine. the instructions are easy to follow, although you sometimes you need to bend the beams a bit. minor improvements are possible here and there, but nothing shocking. front suspension the front suspension is a bit more complicated than the rear suspension, which makes sense considering the fact it contains the steering rack. the shock absorbers are placed in a different angle than the rear ones, resulting in a somewhat stiffer front suspension. all in all the front suspension is well designed and the steering rack can be easily powered with a servo motor. the picture belows shows the front suspension attached to the chassis. if you follow the official instructions to motorize the model, the area in front of the suspension is used to mount the battery box. when you are modding this model to make it full rc this area can be used to mount the servo motor. gearbox like the gearbox in the 8070, it's not used to switch gears powering the drivetrain. it's used to switch between two functions, opening the doors and the hood/bonnet. the gearbox is located at the left of the vehicle, near the cockpit. the mechanism to open the doors is located on the left side, while opening the hood/bonnet is taking place at the right side. to accomplish this, some axles traverse under the cockpit to the other side of the vehicle. following the axles to other side of the vehicle and adding some gears, results in the situation below. the video below shows the gearbox in action. door opening mechanism the mechanism to open the door is comprised of some knob wheels, links without stoppers and pins with towballs. take a look at the doors opening and closing. the front using the new mudguards and various other panels you finish the front of the car. the front is probably the most controversial part of the car. this is caused by the preliminary pictures shown before the release of this car. in the early pictures the front of the car had smooth curves and beautiful lines, while the final car lost these smooth lines and got a more blocky look in return. i must admit that at a first glance, the new design lost some of it's appeal. however, this model grew on me pretty rapidly. the headlight design can be found, in more or less the same way, on several real le mans type race cars. the rear the rear of the car looks great, with the stickers continuing from the mudguards to the panels underneath the spoiler. the two exhausts sticking out give some details to the back. i absolutely disagree with all the negativity surrounding this car. maybe it's one of those models which needs to grow on you. finished model here it is, the finished model. i know some of you don't like the looks of the car, but i think it looks great. the color scheme is outstanding. the new (for technic) bright green parts, combined with white and black make this car look very vibrant and colorful. i am not a big fan of the green used in the 42008 - service truck, but i do like this bright green a lot. it fits perfectly well with the mindstorms ev3 set. the curves on the side of the car are not as smooth as some of us hoped, but i still think the car looks more than acceptable from the side. the stickers add some nice details to the car, giving it that characteristic race car look. the model looks great in pictures, but it does even look better in real life. i love this picture of the front of the car. however, i do wonder if a dedicated 24 hour le mans racer has the seat and steering positioned off-center?! using the good ol' google machine i come to the conclusion that they do have centered seating and steering, at least the majority of them. there's ample space in the cabin, which makes me wonder why tlg decided to place the seat off-centered. the rear view looks cool too, with some of the suspension showing and the two exhaust pipes clearly visible. the bottom view is very useful to determine the size of the car in studs. it measures approx 59 x 27 studs. the chassis looks organized and well designed. the engine has been placed close to the ground, which is perfect for the weight distribution. a low center of gravity improves the handling of the car. i really enjoyed building this baby. the build is very clean and organized, although there are some steps where you need to bend the beams a bit to get things into place. seeing the model come to life and seeing it grow to pretty impressive proportions is very satisfying. for me it was fun, but i reckon kids will go nuts over this set and the build. size comparison what became obvious during the build, but what's emphasized when you have finished the model, is that it's quite big! the size of the car is pretty impressive. the pictures below show the car next to the 42030 - volvo l350f. the side view emphasizes the size of the car. it's even longer than the volvo, if you dismiss the bucket. parts left some parts left. nothing out of the ordinary. features and functions unlike the b-model, this model doesn't implement any unexpected features. the functions it does implement are exactly what you would expect from any car. steering (hog) working fake engine suspension opening doors (gullwing style) opening bonnet/hood opening trunk gearbox for switching between functions unfortunately the steering wheel hasn't been linked to the hog (hand of god) steering mechanism. placing the seat in the center would have provided an easy way to link the steering wheel to the steering mechanism. it's a shame we hardly see actual steering anymore. opening the hood actually opens up the entire rear section of the car, providing you with easy access to the motor compartment. the mechanism to open the hood works properly, which results in smooth opening and closing of it. the same goes for the gullwing style doors. both functions are operated manually and you need to switch with the lever to the left of the cockpit. these two functions are also the ones which can be motorized by placing an m-motor near the cockpit and a battery box in the trunk. all things considered i think this car offers lots of playability. the model is solidly built and the functions are easy to operate. i'd say it's pretty safe to let your kids play with it. b-model unlike the a-model, the b-model for this set received (almost) universal acclaim, and i can see why. often the b-model is a pale shadow of it's part donor. in this case the model looks so good, it could be a model of it's own. it even incorporates a neat feature, which actually deserves to be in the a-model. there's a lot a variation in the quality of digital building instructions tlg is providing, but these ones are of very high quality. the picture below shows most of the chassis with suspension, fake engine and gearbox in place. finished model some concessions have been made, but overall the car looks fantastic. the black of the roof has been extrapolated from the hood, which definitely works for me. the rear section of the car feels a bit empty, but the panels do cover up most of it, so it's hardly noticeable. the v8 stickers will be upside down if you use the parts from the a-model. since i could apply new stickers, i have placed them using the proper orientation. the bottom of the car shows the chassis. it's obviously a bit smaller than the a-model's chassis. features and functions taking the functions into account, this model isn't playing second fiddle to the a-model. besides the obvious functions like steering, opening doors and hood, this car features folding fog lights, which deserve a better podium than a b-model. steering (hog) working fake engine suspension opening doors (manually) opening hood/bonnet (manually) opening trunk (operated by gear) folding fog lights (operated by gear) gearbox (used to switch functions) fog lights one of the most interesting features of the b-model are the folding fog lights. it almost feels a bit weird that a feature like this is implemented in the b-model, instead of the a-model. below are 4 steps showing how the mechanism works. i have also included a video. the mechanism is somewhat reminiscent of fork mechanism used in the 8109 - flatbed truck, which has been described in efferman's review. take a look at the video to the fog lights in action. parts left a fair number of parts left, which isn't uncommon for a b-model. summary to summarize how i feel about this set, you need to take a look at the picture below. the combined image reflects the quality of this set....or better yet....sets! you actually get two great models, for the price of one. you don't like the a-model? no problem, you can have lots of fun with the b-model. i can't stop playing with the fog lights, it's mesmarizing. the color scheme on both models is outstanding. i simply can't emphasize enough how well this color scheme pleases the eye. the regular green is dull and boring, but this bright green really pops out, especially when combined with black and white, and possibly some red details. black, white and a little red?! sounds familiar? yes, bright green can easily be combined with your ev3 robots. so while you are combining the bright green with your robot, why not use the great new curved "mudguard" panels. these new panels are introduced in this set and they look great. they open up a lot of possibilities in the design department. the build of the a-model is outstanding. it is fairly simple, but since it's so clean, i really enjoyed it a lot. i think the build should be entertaining, which doesn't mean it needs to be a real challenge. and let's be honest; when is a build really challenging?! the rear suspension is a good example of why i liked the build. it's very simple, yet very effective. works like a charm. the same goes for the other functions in both models. and the star of the entire show can be found in the b-model. how's that for a surprise?! being aware of the fact that i like this model a lot better than most of you seem to do, i really encourage you to give this model a chance. the sheer size is impressive, the color scheme is awesome and you get a bonus model, which is actually worth building. score okay, so how do i grade this set? 8 design open to debate, but i like it a lot. 8 building experience fun and clean build. 9 features superb function in b-model steels the show. 9 playability both models offer lots of playability 8 parts lots of new parts and cool existing parts. 10 value for money two models for the price of one. 8,7 twice the fun i hope you enjoyed this review! more pictures can be found on my flickr page.

4 outstanding review jim, congrats ! love the pictures, so clean and crisp . hope to see many more of your reviews. as for the set, after seeing this review i kind of like it, if i will find it at a decent price, i will get it for sure.

4 thanks for a great review. i've got a pile of tru and lego credit i wanna spend and was thinking about getting this (since i got a sneak peak of your review in the academy) but it's not here in the us yet. too bad. wonder when it'll hit? i do disagree about the manuals though. i find the thinner, stapled manuals easier to use than single large square-bound ones since they lay flatter when open. have any links to the prelim photos of the front end? i don't remember seeing that and was curious how different it looked.

4 great review,i am still undecided whether to get this set or not.

4 really thorough review, jim. i am super jealous that you have 2 of these and i have none, with no opportunity to get one any time soon.

2 i think i read somewhere that the us will not get this set or the motorcycle until august 2015. that means the flagship most likely won't be in august but even later in the year... nothing bricklink can't solve though.

4 i'm still not a huge fan of the model, but this is one awesome review. the effort and quality can be clearly seen and i hope you continue making reviews like this

4 a great review jim. just finished building this set. a couple of steps required abit of lego stressing to get together when there was an easier way. just made it into rc ( almost finished it in ldd) which was easy to do as it has so much room for nearly any configuration of motors and not have them showing. a great set. edited by jono.rocky, 13 march 2015 - 10:53 am.

4 ickelpete, on aug 3 2007, 09:26 am, said: the clutches are for the shovel and claw on the front and back the engine is driven from only one of the drive motors. it works fine on our rugs but we have mainly wood floors. not sure if is fairly strong i have only chased the cat at the moment :'-( thank you! *wub* (i expected the engine was run from only one drive motor; that would have involved some complicated mechanics to do otherwise!)

2 ah man...i wanted to review it with mine. oh well. here in the u.s. it cost $150 and has 1355 pieces total. the pins and axles did seem a bit difficult in putting them into place. a problem i have been having is the batterys are done after about 4 hours of play, which i really wish they would last longer :-( . overall it is a stupendous set and it is really nice to see our old friend the studs make a return!

4 thank you very much for that neat review, ickelpete! *y* your pictures?re very interesting and your video?s really good. that set looks very beautiful to me, a formidable new technic set that quickly?ll turn into an everlasting classic for sure. :'-) i?m just a little sorry for those quality problems.... well, i hope that tlc?ll work on that matter and fix it soon. 8-|

4 5150 lego, on aug 3 2007, 06:10 am, said: you found it in the u.s.???? where?? i'm really liking this set! its looking better now that i'm seeing more of it at differnt angles. i'mvery curious how wellit pulls, and and can push/doze before the clutches start slipping. the clutches are only for the shovel and claw on the front and back the tracks are driven directly from the xl motors and first impressions are good they seem quite powerful it will climb over a small cusion quite easily.

4 hi, many thanks for this review, photos and videos. i can't wait to put the hands on mine, since it is already ordered and should arrive before the end of the month. :'-) could you post a scan or photos, from those last pages in the building instructions where the parts included are listed? thanks edited by conchas, 04 august 2007 - 07:19 pm.

2 could you please please post the instruction boolets' number codes (located on the back in tiny print)? so that we can download them from lego.com and have a look for ourselves. i think a personalised flag would be a good finishing touch to this set! thanks.

4 nice review! i must have this set!!!

4 really awesome review! i didn't think this set could be that great, but it looks very nice and seems quite cheap. *wub*

4 excellent set, excellent review. a good job as always, sinner.

4 alright, so i usually do quick photo reviews when i get new sets. that's what i'll do here, but there's quite a few photos, so i thought i might as well make its own review thread. so, i got the kwik-e-mart by paying just2much on an early ebay copy. i think it's worth it, as this week i'm gonna be super busy, so i was able to build it saturday and stuff. here's my video review, i think it's one of my best: well, let's get onto this photo review. the set is $200 usd with a little over 2100 pieces. the official release is april 15th for vip members, may 1st for everyone else at lego stores. and, if you want full size pictures, check out my flickr by clicking here. the minifigures included are great. you get three exclusive minifigures (one being a completely exclusive character- the first time lego has ever put an exclusive mould in a direct to consumer set), and you get three of the series most popular characters in their normal attire for those who missed out on the first simpsons minifigures series. the kwik-e-mart's exterior is loaded with lots of sticker details. the only printed detail you'll see in the exterior is the dial pad in the phone booth, which has appeared in some other licensed themes since last year. ( ^^^ right here is there the store can be opened- a simple technic pin and receiver keeps it in place and allows for opening and closing) the roof of the store includes the garden shown in the paul mccartney episode. the roof can be slided out/in once you open it with the hinge part. here's a look at the store with the roof removed. the floors are a nice sand blue color, coming with 8x16 thin plates: and, for the interior, from the view of the store opened with the hinges at the back that i mentioned earlier: the left front corner, which includes some arcade machines of bonestorm and great white hunter, an amazingly done buzz cola soda machine, juice machine, the checkout counter, ect: the right front corner, with food aisles, freezers, and a frozen jasper sticker: the back left corner, which includes some nice coffee kettle builds, the donut tray, hotdogs, ect: the right back corner, which has a door leading to a very small hallway that only has a mouse and cheese in it. the hallway leads to the employees only door in the back, and it's very hard to get in the door way (not that there's anything to do inside there): also included is clancy's copcar, which fits three figures: here's a look at the piece list in the instructions, click on each to be lead to an enlarged version of the pic: also included are some awesome printed pieces, and two unprinted coffee cups! honestly, i think this set is perfect. the price is fantastic, and has a great ppp ratio. they really went above and beyond by including snake in this set. i honestly think it's better than the simpsons house in terms of accuracy and the value here- so many cool pieces printed and in exclusive colors. so, that's my quick picture review. hope you guys enjoyed, and i'd love to hear your thoughts!

4 thanks 'j2g' for another review, one of my favourite parts of the set......the half eaten donut on the dashboard of the police car. brick on review on 'j2g' !

4 thanks for the review, your video was very well done, seeing those sticker sheets is daunting.

4 thanks for the review. i can't help but think the minifigures are the weak part of the set. snake and apu are great but the rest.... i don't know. they kinda redundant now. they could at least give us new torso printing, like homer wearing his jacket or bart wearing his blue t-shirt or marge wearing her coat. or, as i said in the discussion thread, i'd have included jasper in cmf series 2 and a frozen version here. overall, the set looks kinda smaller than what i thought. (snake's bag needed a $ symbol printed, because it looks like he is stealing gargabe ) pretty good review overall

0 thanks for all the feedback you guys! robert8, on 12 april 2015 - 11:25 pm, said: i can't help but think the minifigures are the weak part of the set. snake and apu are great but the rest.... i don't know. they kinda redundant now. they could at least give us new torso printing, like homer wearing his jacket or bart wearing his blue t-shirt or marge wearing her coat. or, as i said in the discussion thread, i'd have included jasper in cmf series 2 and a frozen version here. overall, the set looks kinda smaller than what i thought. i agree, but so many people were complaining about how the simpsons house should have included the most common versions (mostly because the eyes or whatever), so i think lego played it safe and just included the normal versions. it makes sense, since series 1 is gone forever, and the common versions were in there, and this set is bound to be in stock for a very long time like the death star. i never really agreed when people were complaining about the alternate eye prints personally, but i guess this is a good business choice based on previous feedback. edited by just2good, 13 april 2015 - 12:06 am.

4 hello everyone. excellent review! english is not my native language, but i want to express my opinion. simpsons house was the first of its kind, and i can say without exaggeration that this is the most impressive set that i'm going (my collection http://brickset.com/sets/ownedby-celeb ). i look at the video from the kwik-e-mart, and is difficult to say how good it is compared with the house. the main disadvantages that i said to myself, is this: build the walls of the large panels, next is access to the roof (gray parts in front of the back door (i think they represent the stairs)) is not on the level with doors on the roof and when you open them, you can see the white block is openly trash, my points of view. boxes on the left of go to the store and powersauce box, i want see make real and not just a cube, f.e. such as in the unreleased star wars set. about minifigures, i fully agree with robert8. two more of the same homer, marge and bart?! personally, i put my set as a scene and all the replays minifigure are inside the house that was not identical characters next and also absolutely terrible bart`s accessory this set is made parking for bikes and it looks very cool. but damn, it is hoped to see the bart or lisa's bike, instead of useless balloons with paint. the walls are made with convex inside panels, why so? can anyone know? have not seen any pictures with such walls in tv show. why did not they turn? i personally really like how realized roof, but my brother says that it is terrible :) garden could do more in the series there were almost jungle i do not know how to be considered here, maybe anyone can express any opinion or idea? i look at the simpsons house, and then look at the photo of this e-mart. i can not understand, in the house we have a garage, two floors, cool floor, a lot of furniture, all the rooms and walls, collected from cubes, many additional accessories. and where is all this detail here? it looks much smaller (maybe even poorer). if they still will release next year comic book store, it will be even less? of course it is difficult to estimate without seeing it live, we have it will be sold only in may. at first sight it does not look so impressive as the house. can certainly the case in the limit on the amount of detail, but why it was impossible to add $ 50 to the cost and make jasper, the more detailed the roof, the walls of the smaller elements, that it was not convex. sad. thanks all for attention. edited by celeb, 13 april 2015 - 05:10 am.

0 that's actually not bad sizing, imo. sure, it looks like you get a lot more with the house, but the kwik-e-mart has a lot more of those little references that make it simpsons. i agree with some of the complaining; a real jasper behind a trans-blue panel would have been cool. you could always bulk up the roof with more foliage... i think it has a great foundation as a set, but could do with a few mods to make it better. thanks for the pictures; i greatly appreciate being able to see reviews like this before dropping $200 on a lego set.

0 it's the level of detail that floors me, a licensed set with the mindset of those great creator sets. i think it displays much better than the simpsons house which, from the outside, is a bit drab

4 skalldyr, on 15 april 2015 - 10:53 pm, said: nice review! but i have one question: is the transparent dome of the squishee drink removable? nopers.

4 i like this set a lot better than the simpsons house, but 60+ stickers is just incredibly disappointing. it seems quite a few of them could have been printed parts

4 did anyone else have a problem with the piano against the wall of the simpsons house? it just kept coming off way too easily and i was getting really frustrated with it sticking out and not fully going on so i had to put the two tiles that hold them one place over away from the wall for it to sit properly without falling out, i think i might put snowball ii behind it since cats love to hide underneath or behind things lol but just curious to know if anyone else was encountering this problem with the previous set.

0 i recently acquired 90% of this set, so i thought i would do a review of it. please note that half of the mini-figs are wrong, and there are some part substitutions. this is the only set that comes with this plate. there is a depression under the grey plates to the back. the pool depression can be easily covered by three quarter circle plates... which just happen to be included in this set. (good set design lego!) the stairs are old fabuland ones, and have been used in a few other sets. this is the only one that has them in "parapink" however. what is the difference between "parapink" and "pink"? dunno... the big windows are in only two other sets, both of them dacta ones! the smaller ones were in one other paradisa set. the interior, while simple, works very well. i love the coffee machine. a cute car came with the set as well. the bird house is a nice idea as well. once the current visitors leave i will probably be breaking this set. i wish lego would go back to these sets as they always had some great parts in them.

4 nice review of a surprisingly interesting set. *y* those windows are great, and no doubt difficult to get. classic coffee maker, simple yet exactly right. that baseplate was in a few other sets, but never with that pattern. would have made a great base for some of the classic 80s houses lego used to treat us to. in tan was part of the adventurers egypt sets. as recently as 2001 it was a base for ogel. versatile plate that hopefully hasn't disappeared completely. parapink is apparently "light pink" on brickshelf, so i guess it's just lighter than normal pink (and stopped appearing in 1995. just so you know, that monkey is drinking too much and likely to fall in the pool ... ;-)

4 tks sinner for that cool review ;-) this set is not one of my favs (never was really a big fan of those raised baseplates) but had fantastic parts and mfs !! it has great playability with really cool "80's miami" feel *wub* that pink was actually pretty cool and went well with that lime green (i think its lime but i'm not 100% positive). once again this pisses me off so much that i was in my dark ages when this theme was out !! i loved it, especially all the beach/water themes *wub* i really wish tlc decided to bring that water paradisia back !! who knows !! after all they need to make some girlie sets !! girls are a part of their market totally neglected !! how many women we have on the boards ?? really a tiny few unfortunatly !! so tlc, please bring paradisia back in may 08 :-p , please !! *yoda*

2 thank you guys for your nice reply. :'-) i have to add two pics of my freight train showing a bit more clearly what the size matter is about: this is what it looks like when you put the hopper waggon right behind the red car of 4512. it looks a lot better without the red car! i had a lot of fun with this review and i will add another one (look at the 2nd pic ;-) ) the next days. stay tuned!

4 yes my spongebob fans, its time for another review !! lets look at our bikini bottom map and head strait to meet miss puff at her boating school. she is waiting for us to give us a guided tour of her establishment ;-) another bit of sb history: this set comes from the following episode: boating school: spongebob fails his boating test for the 38th time (what a freaking retard lool). he's so determined to get his license that patrick decides to help him. he implants a walkie-talkie inside sb?s head in order to cheat and tell him what to do. you will say that i am biais but i really enjoy building this set and i really like the sb theme !! lets hope 2008 brings more of that cool spongieness !! but i digress... here are general pics of the instruction booklet and the dss (g there are loads of crappy stickers in that one also !!). as you can see the set is divided in 3 polybags. shamelessly (but nonetheless wilfully hehe), i will disregard the third one which is that playability crap course !! i would have reviewed it but since it involves stickers, i didn?t want to ruin the parts and without stickers it would look dull, plain and ugly (it does look crappy with so imagine without), so that review will not be 100% complete and i do apologise in advance. but how many of you would have build that and keep it hehe off :-p 1/ mfs and extras i will start with the really cool miss puff *wub* (the fig mind you !!). she looks a bit stressed !! no wonder, that sponge menace will bring her to the hospital once again hehe. as you can see, that mf comprises 3 parts: the small blue 1x1 round and the 2 major parts. yeay another great stupid looking sb. i love those idiotic faces !! 3 different sb figs and 3 idiotic faces hehe. you never can get enough of them !! here is just a regular patrick. too bad patrick doesn?t have different expressions ! the pull back boat car: nothing really to report (except the fact that i left it sticker free !!) the only thing i built from the third polybag is that pretty cool ancker holding tower thingie !! looks great in a lighthouse set hehe. yes the roud tile bouey is printed !! its the same as in sb's bed in the bikini bottom set ;-) ok, its time for those two great buildings: the lighthouse and the school + pontoon !! before reviewing them individually, here is a general pic. 2/ the lighthouse one of the main reason to own that great set !! sure it suffers from accute stickeretite (sad but :-d ). t worst is that door), but nonetheless a great and simple building !! great white/red colour scheme, and a really fantastic 2 turning lights !! i really like the yellow top of the lighthouse, it adds to the comic atmosphere of that theme instead of having a more plain red/white only. the rear has nothing really fancy, except tools to fix it in case of problems hehe. the only thing i modified since i didn?t build the third polybag is that i got rid of the trechnic parts on the right of the lighthoue to replace them with regular ?logs? all hail the tower king !! :-d 3/ the school and pontoon i really like that little building and its great to see that once again tlc uses the amazing dark blue color !! its really a simple design but looks fantastic and can be used for many things in a town hehe i also really like the combination with those dark bluish grey slopes !! the rear reveals the desk, stickers on the wall (d?oh !!) and two clams serving as chairs (really like on the show). its really great to see that tlc stays really as close to the show as possible. the pontoon again is simple yet really cool and effective. and its really nice to have 2 lifesaving boueys. the only thing i modified since i didn?t build the third polybag is that i got rid of the trechnic parts in front of the pontoon to replace them with regular ?logs? on the overall, i think its really a great set !! apart from the crap stickers, i think tlc should have ditched (or simplified) the third playability polybag to lower the cost !! oh well, parts are always usefull (except those one part shitty palm trees !!). so until my next review, i bid you farewell my spongebob fans !! and i really hope to see next year hehe will sb get his driver?s license one day ? for the sake of bikini bottom, lets hope not !! no license ever on !! *yoda*

4 you've done it again. *yoda* ! great reveiw. i really like this set, but in my opinon, $50 is steep considering i won't actually 'play' with it. i mean, half of it is a track for peat sake! ill eventually get it for the mrs. puff figure, though. *y*

4 *yoda* comes through again! i love this set... but it just costs too much for australians so i will be giving it a miss. :'-( it is a shame as it has clams in it... 8-|

4 nice review !! i'm not a big fan of those spongebob figs. however this set has some very useful pieces. this is actually the first time i took a decent look at a spongebob set.

2 yoda, i don't thank you for this review, and after the chump bucket review too! because i'm so exited to have them that since i ordered them from s@h, i come back home aftre the work the faster i can, with the hope to see a big box on my bed... and this, even if i know that it tooks more than 6-7 days to have my order... this mrs. puff figs is really really nice *wub* and this 3rd sb head too!

4 i might get this and convert it to a lighthouse and warehouse for a city dock...looks nice. wall on!

4 very nice review *yoda* !! though, i think you should review the "course" because it looks very interesting.

4 xwingyoda, on aug 16 2007, 10:11 pm, said: hey patrick, i'm on your side :-d !! *yoda* oops, i read too quickly, so misuderstood! :-$

4 the set, and the other designer sets that came out with it (especially 4888) are incredibly well designed sets. i wish lego would go back to doing sets like these as i loved the multitude of instructions and ideas. the last batch of creator sets had zero ideas, even though i know several were made. :'-( anyway, less whining, more review. the lion is the main model. his mouth doesn't fully close, but it does open more. the head works well from most angles. i love the dark orange bricks; great for rust... he is quite solid, but the joints take the weight well. the neck goes side to side and rotates, but doesn't go up and down. the body is built in two parts and pinned in the middle. with what is left you can make what i think is a hyena, a silly plant moc... ...and what i believe is a vulture. there are also instructions for a few other models including a bat, boar and a snake... which i quite like. he can be built at the same time as... ...this cute little lizard. overall this is a great set with an excellent blend of colours and pieces. i wanted it for steampunk potentials. *sweet* i hope you liked the review. till next time....

4 the lizard looks the best to me - put him in a town and you've got a monster terrorising the residents. dr. s.

4 great review as always! *y* lego is timeless, so there is no such thing as an old set. i never build brick monsters/creatures, but this set had such a nice assortment of parts that i had to pick a couple up as they weren't clearancing out on shop @ home. i absolutely love dark orange and tan, so it was an automatic win. i love the use of "familiar characters" in the review, i can almost hear hinckley screaming, "my megabloks!" :-p you sort of look like you're planning some vulture stew though. might have to start a new challenge to determine a winner there. sinner and his big pot o' doom vs giant vulture! only thing is, does everything horrify the mrs? she seems perpetually shocked and/or dismayed at the goings on here. now that i think about it, i can see why. i'm occasionally shocked and/or dismayed 8-? brick built beasties on! *y*

4 great review sinner i regret not buying this set when i saw it cheap in a local sale :-(

2 nice review! although, that picture of the ad reminded me of how some of the things surrounding jurassic world (lego, that is) seems hastily put together. just look at that the minifig. he is star lord's head and hair, indiana jones' torso with different arms, and city legs. to me, that seems a bit weak, especially for a video game.

2 nice little review! now i definitely have to check if the toys r us in dortmund has it, too! edited by kcmatze, 03 may 2015 - 01:34 pm.

2 great review! but spoiler i didn't see or even hear mentioned a galliminus or any sort of dino trap in the movie. i wonder where this design came from!

2 any chance you have a picture of the news stand next to the detectives office building as i would love to see the scaling for that?

2 nice review mostlytechnic. i particularly like the use of grey background surface for the pictures. it somehow makes the building stand out more. good job!

0 a terrific, very comprehensive review - but i'm not at all impressed with this set. it feels like a mishmash of bricks with no clear design aesthetic and as such blatantly underdeveloped (i.e. designed to hit a price/brick count point rather than provide a solid set in the creator town tradition). compared to other creator sets at this price point (31025 - mountain hut, for example) it feels utterly uninspired and ugly. edited by johnny6666, 04 may 2015 - 10:02 am.

0 cheers for putting in the time to create a wonderful review. i am not a huge fan of this set; i like the colour combinations, but it all seems a bit all-too-simple. it can (and will) be nicely modularised, though!

2 thanks 'mostlytechnic' for this review, i only brought this set to continue the shop series from creator. in my opinion it's only half as good as the bike shop/cafe one. plus it doesn't fit the same as that pair of shops, oh well maybe next year lego creator will have a better one. brick on review on 'mostlytechnic' !

2 this seems like half of a set compared to the previous bike shop/cafe. as i like many of the elements, i will probably buy a second one and build a mirror image version (making one entirely a toy shop and the other a book store/news stand) and adjust the sidewalks to work with the previous model. then i think they will work well together. i remember a little area in copenhagen that had this sort of architecture. i would hope the subsequent models are better deigned to create more complex alternatives, but these are both good starting points for original or enhanced models.

4 as a fan of creator houses, i really want to like this set. however, i think that creator houses have long filled a niche that's neglected elsewhere: residential houses. we haven't had a larger residential house since 2013; i'm not sure if these sets have anything to do with that, but it seems like they may be the replacement for larger houses. and i'd much rather have a larger house set than a set like this. i also agree with many others here; something about it just feels incomplete. i think that the various city business buildings we've gotten in recent years (including those in this year's city square--which is much more expensive than this, but also contains much more) make for better buildings at this scale.

4 thanks andy_0306uk, your very clever strategic decision to serve us with blurry pictures allowed me to glance at this review without ruinating that whole wonderful advent surprise too much.... :-p *y* but although i loved the last year?s one, i think they could do another theme (or perhaps even two calendars), because right now castle?s pretty hot imo.

2 thank you andy for your speed review! *y* so there?s nothing left to open while advent? ;-) i like all the tiny sets, it needn?t be another police- and fireman |-/ , but well, what would an advent calendar be without them? :-d one thing about the train traffic lights: tlc used to give us similar lights, but you could show either of the lights with the other one being covered: that one was waaay better! :'-( just a little piece more would have done the thing... ...and i won?t mention the radar-crap-dish :-x let me quote franz beckenbauer: "is' denn scho' weihnacht?" (legendary quote from an promotional job he did years ago - "is it x-mas already?")

0 no girls....again! and no santa? whats up with that? sure there are many nice pieces to give life to every city layout.. i would love something more simple a girl taking her dog for a walk a boy on a bicycle simpler things...not all the workmen again!

2 whoa! it's out already! *places order* i guess i should thank you andy, because i might have missed this one just like i missed last year's calendar. now all i have to do is wait two weeks and pick it up at the post office across the border.

4 thanks for the great review. i love the poses. :-d i got this for my kids and they didn't mind it but i think they prefer my sets because they aren't theirs. :-|

2 thank you sinner for bringing the pictures of the hovercraft. i think it is a really cool model, but the steering wheel doen't work too well. it doesn't turn easilly all the way around and when the craft turns, it doesn't stay stable on the three wheels because the front wheel turns quite alot into the opposite side. now to the third model! this is quite a basic helicopter with the functionality of having the rotors turning. it doesn't use that many of the bricks and doesn't even have a landing gear. i have a question to all of you. as you can see, i prefer to show one or two large pictures and have the rest as clickable thumbnails. most people use only the relatively big (typically 640x480) pictures so that you don't have to follow links. what do you prefer? it is no problem for me to do it the other way, but i would like to know if you have any preferences.

4 it?s for sure an at least interesting set. the idea of attaching that small mecha to the bugs body is very good, so it works like a counterpart to the aero booster. pretty nice. although.... only the two front legs?re articulated? that?s a shame.... :'-( thanks for the review, rezourceman. *y*

4 it is no secret that marvel is one of the most successful companies right now. from the avengers to the x-men and down to even the most obscure characters like ant-man, every one of their movies has been a big hit until now. the latest marvel movie, fant4stic, was released last month and while i have not seen it yet, i'm sure it's just as great as their other movies. i mean, it has the word "fantastic" in the title after all! and being the smart business that they are, the lego company decided to get in on the hype early and capitalize on this movie's undoubtful success two years in advance by making a set featuring fant4stic's main villain, dr. doom. now that's what i call forward thinking! but did they do a good job with it or were they being overhasty? let's find out! set number: 76005 name: spider-man: daily bugle showdown theme: marvel super heroes subtheme: ultimate spider-man year of release: 2013 pieces: 476 minifigs: 5 price: $49.99 usd s@h description: quote swing into the daily bugle and stop dr. doom™! dr. doom™ and his henchman beetle™ are attacking the daily bugle in their speedy jet to steal spider-man's™ secret identity. it's up to spider-man™ and nova™ to swing in and stop them! trigger the daily bugle's explosion functions to cause destruction as the jet fires missiles! stop dr. doom™ from hitching the jet's anchor hook to the safe with spider-man's secret inside! knock beetle™ off the building with the swinging web attack and drop dr. doom™ inside with the rooftop trapdoor! then fly nova™ in through the broken window with the dumpster catapult function and send those villains back to where they came from. includes spider-man™, nova™, dr. doom™, beetle™ and j. jonah jameson™ with accessories and weapons. the first thing that comes to mind after reading this description is: wow, that's a lot of tms! anyway, here are some resource links for this set: brickset bricklink rebrickable the box since this set is based on the ultimate spider-man cartoon, the box has the usual usm design with the red marvel super heroes background, an illustration of spidey in the upper right corner, and the usm logo in the lower right. as usual, there is a minifig line up in the lower left, and since this was before the terrible redesign, you can see the full body of the minifigs. i really miss this type of line up. there is quite a lot going on here: doctor doom attacking the daily bugle in his jet while simultaneously reaching for j. jonah jameson below with his jet's claw, spider-man (reluctantly) swings in to save him, while nova fights off the beetle. it's a pretty cool scene, even though it's not very accurate to the show. in "beetle mania", the episode that this set is based on, the beetle was indeed out to kill jjj, but it was in order to stop him from exposing his identity, not spider-man's (although spidey was next on jjj's list). and while he is a recurring villain on the show, doctor doom had nothing to do with this plot and didn't even appear in the episode aside from a brief cameo. it's awesome that they included him anyway, though, so i'm not gonna complain. note that the tower is so tall that it wraps around the top of the box. there, you can also see a scale reference with the spider-man minifig. on the back of the box, you can see the interior of the bugle and all of its play features which there are quite a few of since this is a playset. it's all illustrated pretty well, although lego's choice of sound effects is still a mystery to me. i don't get why they don't go for spider-man's signature "fwip!" instead of "fazzing!" and i didn't know that a breaking window made the sound "btoom!" but i digress. contents inside the box you will find three instruction booklets (one smaller than the others), a comic book, a fairly large sticker sheet, five numbered bags, and two loose pieces: a white string piece and a gray 16x8 plate. there aren't really any notable pieces and nobody cares about the comic bock (no offense to the artist), so lets get right to the instructions. they are pretty straight forward and easy to follow. some of the pages have a ghostly image of spidey, nova, and dr. doom in the top right corner which is fitting since these are all minifigs that appear in this set (which is strangely not something that can be said for many other super heroes instructions with this type of artwork). minifigures as with most super heroes sets, most people will get this set mainly for the minifigs, so without further ado, let's talk about them. spider-man is the same old bootless one you get in almost every usm set. not much to say about him. some might complain that we don't get spidey's alter ego peter parker in this set, but in the usm cartoon, mj is actually the one who works at the daily bugle, not peter. curse the creators of this cartoon for ruining our chances of getting a new peter parker minifig by trying to mix things up. next we get j. jonah jameson. he appeared in a spider-man 2 set before, but this is a complete redesign. he now has a blue suit with a red tie, a unique face print, and that combed-back hair in dark gray. this new hairpiece doesn't suit him at all and the old flat top hair was perfect for him in my opinion, so i don't know why they changed it. the good thing about this change, however, is the fact that this piece is exclusive to this set in that color. nova on the other hand is spot-on. he comes with a new helmet mold and some nice torso printing. however, he, too, is missing his boots. tlc should have started making dual-colored legs a long time ago. here are some reference images to compare them to. okay, so jjj's hair may not be completely black in the show, but i still think they should have given his minifig a black hairpiece. his suit is also not quite the right color. he rarely appears in person in the show (including the episode this set is based on) and is usually seen on screens around new york, so this is the best picture of him i could find. i guess i should be happy they included a minifig of him at all. in the episode, it was actually mary jane who was at the bugle during beetle's attack, so it would have made more sense to include her, but we got her in the spider-copter set one year later, so that's ok. all three of them have back printing. in jjj's case i'm using that term loosely since it is only comprised of two lines, but it's nice that they went through the trouble of adding them. both jjj and nova come with angry alternate faces. it almost looks like they're trying to out-angry each other. who do you think looks angrier? let me know in the comments section below. now let's talk about the bad guys. even though he would be better off in a fantastic four set, it's great to finally get victor van doom, one of the greatest marvel villains ever and in comics in general. he comes with a dark green hood which was new and exclusive in that color at the time, and he is the only minifig in this set that has leg printing. beetle is a regular minifig with wings. the metallic printing on his face and torso is pretty nice, but i wish it would have continued onto his legs as well. the beetle looks quite accurate to his on-screen counterpart. the only thing that could have improved him is a new helmet mold with pointy eyebrows/antennae. doctor doom, however, looks nothing like he does in the movie. i just don't understand how lego could have messed him up so badly. maybe they were working off of early concept art or something. here is a back view of doom and beetle. beetle would be a pretty boring minifig if it wasn't for his wings which are awesome with their holographic texture. they are so mesmerizing, i could look at those things all day. this piece also appeared in trans. light green in the galaxy squad sets which came out at the same time. here they are without their gear. as you can see, they both have back printing as well. and no, doctor doom does not come with an alternate facial expression, which is fine since you can't see much of his expressions due to his mask anyway. here's a look at dr. doom and nova without their headgear. some say that doom's face looks too cartoony, but i think it looks fine. nova is wearing stylish goggles as a way of explaining his white eyes. it's a far better explanation than the bat-sweatband. they did the same thing with the masked wolverine later. here are all the figs with their accessories. jjj comes with a camera so that he can take "more pictures of spider-man!" beetle comes with one of those overused adu guns which is a very poor representation of his wrist-mounted blasters. i hate to say it, but even those bulky new stud shooters would have been a better representation of his weapons. spidey comes with his usual string of webbing and nova comes with some iron man style translucent studs. the weird thing is that they are red while his powers have a blue glow in the show. doctor doom sadly doesn't get any accessories, but who needs weapons when you have a jet with a claw and flick-fire missiles. the build the first bag contains spider-man, a brick separator, and the parts to build the ground floor of the dbc building. after a quick and straight-forward build, you get this. the dumpster and street lamp are separate from the building and since the lamp post is not built onto any baseplate and is quite top-heavy, it gets knocked over pretty easily. maybe it's meant to be that way, but i would have preferred it if you could stick it onto the baseplate of the building on which there is unfortunately not enough space to do so. as you would expect, the second bag has the parts for the first floor of the building. this is also the bag that contains beetle. after another fairly simple build, you'll find yourself with a two story building with a spiderweb one side and a fire escape on the other. however, you have to apply three stickers during this section of the build which is never fun. can you guess what's in bag number 3? yup, the second floor of the building. you don't need superpowers to predict that one. also, this bag contains nova and jameson. the build of this section is a bit repetitive since the second floor is mostly the same as the first and it takes slightly longer to build since you have to build the rooftop as well. also, in addition to the two window stickers you have to apply ten 2x2 tile stickers! trying to do this without having any of them being crooked is a real pain in the megablocks. the next bag contains doctor doom and the cockpit of his jet. doom's cape is in the usual square white box and the string for the claw is folded up in a piece of tape. here's what you get at the end of this section. looks more like an escape pod than a jet at this point. the final bag is the smallest as it only includes the few parts needed to finish the doom jet. once you build the wings and tail, you stick them onto the cockpit via technic pins and you're done. spare parts these are the parts that are left over after the build. there is the brick separator of course, an extra antenna, and the usual little bits and bops. what's really awesome, though, is that they give you an extra pair of beetle's wings! considering what a neat piece this is and that this is the only set in which it comes in trans-black make this a very welcome spare that you can use in your customs. the finished set here is the complete set. the dbc building looks quite tall, especially when you count the antenna. comparing it to a screenshot from the episode, the general look of the building is there, although there are some inaccuracies. aside from the fact that it is obviously way down-scaled, the screens that show jjj ranting about spider-man should have been hexagonal, not square, and should have wrapped around the building. however, considering how many stickers you would have had to apply if they would have made it accurate, i'm actually glad they kept the screen mercifully small. much like doctor doom himself, the doom jet didn't actually appear in the beetle mania episode. however, it did appear in a later episode titled "not a toy" in which spider-man plays around with captain america's shield, accidentally drops it in doctor doom's latvarian embassy and has to try to retrieve it. and yes, that episode was as godawful as it sounds. here's a screenshot of the jet from that episode. like with the dbc, they managed to capture the general shape of the vehicle, although it doesn't look quite as good as in the show. the color scheme is too dark and it looks kind of blockier. let's take a closer look at the jet. there is no real way to reel the claw in unfortunately. however, there is a stud on the back of the jet that you can stick it onto. needless to say, this is not the ideal way of storing it. i would have much preferred it if they would have attached it onto winch instead. the engines on the wings can be turned, even though they don't turn in the show, and there is a flick-fire missile on each side. even if it's not much to look at, at least it's a very swooshable vehicle. on top of each wing there is a tile with the emblem of latvaria. there was no such emplems on the jet in the cartoon, but they are useful pieces that make it clear whose jet it is, so i'm glad they included them. there is nothing inside the cockpit except for a seat and unless you want to ruin dr. doom's nice dark green cape, i wouldn't put him inside of it. they could have at least printed a control panel onto that empty 2x2 tile. play features since this is a playset, let's look at all the play features it has to offer. like all playsets, the building is open in the back so you can play inside. on the ground floor, there is a potted plant and... nothing else. seriously? is this all they could come up with for this floor? they could have included a security desk, a lounge, a second plant, or anything else! as it is, it's just a boring empty lobby. the first floor is a bit more interesting. there is a safe, a swiveling chair, and a pin board with various pictures of spider-man. there is one tile that reads: "the true identity of spider-man" which is supposedly what the villains are after. i wonder how jameson got this information in the first place. speaking of jameson, the second floor is devoted to his office where he can sit and yell at his non-present employees, demanding "more pictures of spider-man!" it also has a swiveling chair as well as a desk with a lamp and a computer. there is a technic beam connecting his desk with the ceiling of the first floor which you can remove in order to take off the upper half of the building, but it's difficult to do, so i don't recommend it. as you may have noticed in the picture above, there are a few red pegs sticking out of the building. these are for triggering the play features. most of them are on the roof. there is one on what looks like an air conditioning unit. if you place spider-man holding is web-string on the jumper plate in front of it and push the peg, spidey goes bungee-jumping off the building. wee! there is also one that sticks out of the side of the building which when pulled triggers a trap door. the third red peg on the roof can be used to pop off the dbc sign. why is it called the dbc, you ask? it stands for daily bugle communications since in this version of spider-man, the daily bugle is not only a newspaper, but a news tv station as well, one that promotes its own highly biased views. so basically the fox news of the marvel universe. i guess if you're an old school spider-man fan, you could just leave off the "c" and have it just stand for daily bugle. the sign above the main entrance wont be so easily modified however. there is also a peg between the first and second floor which when pushed pops out one of the windows on the first floor. the safe is only attached to a couple of jumper plates and has some jumper plates on top of it as well, so you can easily attach the doom jet's claw to it and rip it out of the building as seen on the back of the box. there are also some snot bricks on the corners of the building that you can attach spiderwebs or spidey himself onto for some wall-crawling and webslinging action. this is not so much a play feature as it is just a feature, but as i mentioned earlier, there is a fire escape on the left side of the building. this was a neat idea as it helps it feel like a building in new york city, but it is executed very poorly. there is no hole big enough for the minifigs to climb down through, so they would have to climb down the ladders from the outside which makes no sense. no wonder spider-man always needs to rescue people from burning buildings. there is one more play feature in the form of the dumpster. you can open the lid, put a minifig inside, and make them jump by hitting a tab in the back. remember, this is before the introduction of super jumpers, but nevertheless it's a pretty strange place to launch minifigs out of. i guess even super heroes like to do some dumpster diving. you don't think this was funny? no? well, me neither, but that's the type of humor that this show loves to use. sigh. anyway, let's get on to the ratings. ratings design: 2/5 - the set looks ok. despite many inaccuracies, the dbc building and the jet somewhat resemble their on-screen counterparts and don't look too bad, but they definitely could be better. build: 1/5 - a mostly unchallenging and repetitive build with an attrocious amount of stickers. minifigs: 4/5 - definitely the strongest point of the set. some of the figs could be better, but four out of five of them are exclusive to this set. doctor doom is easily the best and probably the most desirable one - unless the fant4stic movie portraits him so badly that nobody will be interested in him, but that's impossible. playability: 4/5 - as you would expect from a playset, the playability is quite high, although i still feel like there could have been more. parts: 3/5 - not many rare parts. if you're looking for parts for building your own skyscraper with tan walls and lots of doors and windows though, this set is for you. price: 3/5 - at 476 parts for $50, this set is a bit pricey, but it is somewhat justified by all the large window and wall pieces. overall: 3/5 - this set is mediocre at best. playsets are always a good choice for spider-man sets since they give spidey something to swing from, but unfortunately they are rarely pulled off well. the jet is blocky, the building is bare-bones, and the price feels too high. the only reason to get this set are the four exclusive minifigs. this set was discontinued early this year, but if you still see it on clearance somewhere, go ahead and get one for the minifigs and parts, or buy multiples and use the parts to build a better dbc building. i hope you enjoyed this review. it is part of the reviewers academy's 7th anniversary. we're not doing a big celebration this year due to other commitments, but look out for more reviews with the 7th anniversary banner soon. now, if you'll excuse me, i am off to see fant4stic. i hope it's as fantastic as it promises to be! (2 hours later) i was wrong! i was horribly, horribly wrong!

2 thanks for the review, i've had that set for quite a while, and it's among my favorite marvel superheroes sets actually. compared to the other stuff we usually get to accompany the minifigs... all those "laboratorys", the most recent construction site, and the "hydra fortress" .. yeah... you're being a little harsh here maybe you're still suffering from ptsd after watching fant-four-stic!

2 this set seems to appeal more to the non superhero crowd. it is one of the only marvel sets i bought. mainly because i thought that the building was a nice return to the old style of city sets. i would love to see this sort of backdrop for a more realistic agents theme... i also liked that most of the figs in this set were easier to merge into other (non-super) uses... thanks for the review! god bless, nathan

4 hi again! they have arrived *wub*! they come dismantled inside the package instead of one piece like the blackhole stormtrooper did. they have the head and sw-sign made with magnets to clip on to the torso. it actually works even if it feels a bit "cheapish". here?s some pictures - mr vader goes first *vader*: package pieces stormie: package pieces my collection so far >:-) : here?s the blackhole stormtrooper review. boba fett & luke maquette on copmike

4 nice review. i'll be watching and waiting for the rest.

4 will follow this impatiently ;-) really like the start of the review *y* you always seems to pull it of nicely, in comparission with the exasperating *yoda* x-d :-p build on! play on! on on!

4 the manual: the gigantic manual measures 17? x 12? and is almost an inch thick. it is spiral bound with a cardboard like front and back and it is 314 pages. interesting decision not to break it up into multiple manuals. it is almost unwieldy at this size and thickness. unfortunately, the manual is not available electronically from the lego website. hopefully, it will be soon. missing were the little instructions at the beginning telling you to not build this beast on shag carpet and to sort out the 5,000+ pieces before you get started. i guess they figure if you got $500 to spend on this thing, you can build it however you want. as usual, we get the regular lego manual features: - piece call outs for each step - parts inventory at the end of the manual - page numbers - photos of all the other 2007 sets at the end of the manual manual (paperback book provided for scale) various manual photos (8x8 plate provided for scale) i'm about 2 hours into building and sorting. i'm trying to stay a day ahead in my posting. the build has been easier than i thought so far. despite the massive number of pieces, it has not been too hard to sort and find what you need. build photos will start appearing in tomorrow's entry.

2 the minifigs: as you can see, the minifigs are really nice. they even throw in an extra fleshie head! no doubt these will fetch quite a bit on the bricklink and ebay markets. i?m keeping mine. continuing the build this photo shows how well this model is put together. notice that they use four of the three-hole beams per side to hold this together. i remember reading that you can hang this model from the ceiling. i don?t doubt it. these right angle technic pieces are used to reinforce the structure of the model. you can see them used here: i was shocked at how many light gray plates are in this set. i have two tubs full of these: the infrastructure is now complete: i got hung up for about an hour looking for one of these: turns out, lego gave me an extra left wedge and shorted me a right wedge. so frustrating! i had to stead one off my 6211 star destroyer. it is not a very common piece by the way?

4 hey nice review, im up to about the same point as you (page 70 to be exact) , tho i didnt have that missing piece thankfully! i think lego have done a much better job at packing the lego this time, i remember it taking me much longer to find pieces on the ucs isd build

4 thanks for the review, and tons of pics! i've been wanting to pick this one up since i saw it. i thought the 4956 creator house was nice, but this model town house is in a completely different league! i also like the alternate models that you can see in the catalogues.

2 thank you for the review sinner. at first i wanted this set for the 4 blue 1x1 slope tiles, but i can see there is much more into it than that. it sure is a great value compared to what you get in the building bonanzas (no cars and less detail). it was funny to see the little side story in your pictures. would it be hard to modify the cars to fit minifigs better?

4 thanks for this review sinner! i love this house, with the nicely made tiled corners, the colorscheme and the garage. the only thing i dislike about this set is the way the windows are attached in train windows (so they turn inwards a little) instead of the usual frames with shutter-attachment-ability. but that is something that can be fixed in the blink of an eye. i will certainly buy this house some day when i find it at reasonable price.

0 i too have bought this set and the only thing i notice which is a bit odd, with the exception of there being no floors in the house is the lack of a steering wheel in the car!

2 thanks for comments. i know about text, i'm trying to write more, but haven't succes in this yet. i thought about joining reviewers academy, but i'm not sure because i have only maimum 4(may be 5) hours each time when i can make review or something that needs some hours.

4 thanks for the review grevious! i already have this set, but i loved your comic and that nice alternate model! *y* ttfn! >:-)

4 great review grevious!! *sweet* *y* nice job, thanks for sharing. great comic and i especially love that you gave us an alternative model, something lego neglects to do anymore... |-/ thanks again! *wub*

4 great review, this is one of my favorite sets from the new castle line. it's simple and yet so effective, oh and great comic you have there *y*

4 nice review *y* the comic is very funny :-d i don't have this set 8-| but i'm going to buy it soon.

4 lol what a review!!! i love the story ^_^

4 nice review, i like this set alot. *y* :-)

4 great review! *sweet* i wasn't aware that the catapult rotated either... this set isn't on my buy list though as it is all more of the same for me. thanks for the cool moc! :-d i always plan to add a moc to my reviews but i always run out of time.... :'-(

2 great review! i just built the original, and this one has clear advantages over the original (though i wish lego would stop putting torsos with defined breasts and curves on children). i really like pretty much every change. i won't be getting it, and i'd be lying if i said i'm not a little disappointed. for the first four years, my mother-in-law got me the new winter village set for christmas; after the last two, which didn't really fit thematically in my display, i had hoped for a new one--particularly since my daughter is getting to be around the age where she can play with them. i mention her specifically because i've seen lots of people dismiss those who are a bit disappointed as rabid adults who don't care about kids getting cool sets, and i don't think that's fair. i may have to see how much some of the parts go for on bricklink. the rerelease is better than the original, but not good enough that i'd want to spend $80 to get a set that's nearly identical to one i have. edited by tea weevil, 29 november 2015 - 04:31 pm.

4 regarding the reason for the different designs on the inner bags, i think that the white stripe is the new version, with the non-stripe version being old. i suspect the reason some sets have both versions is simply that they're still using up some of their supply of older bags. good review. i didn't realise there were quite as many changes as you highlighted (tree, roof etc).

4 i missed out on the first one, but i love the improvements made in this version, like the tree having an actual brown trunk so it looks less like an artificial one, and the carolers as well. i may pick this up, but i'm sorry to those of you who already have one.

4 i bought it and i'm very happy with it.

2 cheers for putting up the review. some nice improvements, but not enough for me to pick it up. the original set is good enough for me. pity the poll has no option "yes, but only in addition to new sets, not in stead of new sets". edited by withacee, 01 december 2015 - 09:38 am.

2 oky, on 29 november 2015 - 11:45 am, said: as for the controversy over re-releasing the winter toy shop, i can see where the haters are coming from, but i find their complaints to be quite petty. i can understand if you're disappointed because you already have the first winter toy shop and were looking forward to a new set this year, but there's always next year. if you're a completist and feel like tlg is forcing you to buy a set you don't need, you're wrong. nobody is forcing you to buy anything but yourself. if you decide to buy every set in a theme no matter what it is, that's your problem, not lego's. so put down your torches and pitchforks and just be glad that they improved the set design and gave us another chance to buy this classic set. there are far worse things that can happen in this world than lego re-releasing one of their most popular sets. sorry for that little rant. so what is your opinion on re-releases like this? please cast your vote in the poll above. after mocking people for holding a particular opinion, you then turn around and ask people to express their opinion?? no thanks. i guess i'll keep my opinions to myself. i certainly don't want to be labeled a "hater."

4 very nice little set, and a lot of those new white small panels. it's a need!

4 thanks for the nice review! the landing mechanism looks quite cute. aren't the yellow axles 5l, not 4l? (very strange that they would release such a part).

2 it says 5l in the parts list.

4 love this model, awesome swooshability, interesting parts, and a nice little model to put on my desk at work :)

4 hi there, nice model, great review! i almost reverse engineered this model, but used wrong parts for landing wheels, didn't know how to fix the nose proper, and so on. so i was very interested in this model and i like playing with it. i love the reviews, but i think i have to mention, that the yellow axle must be a 5l! the picture shows a 5l, and a 5l would fit the size of the model. the cart has also a 5l in yellow. what sitze is the yellow axle in this seit. really 4l as written in the text? greetings, robert

2 i seem to have been messing up axle lengths in various reviews it's indeed 5l. my bad. thanks for pointing it out.

4 very nice review for a nice little set! i especially like the smoothness of operation for the retractable landing gear. i don't like the lack of symmetry for the propeller of the b model though, but understand the alternative would be to add one extra small panel to the set, or skip two of them in the b model.

2 jay psi, on 02 december 2015 - 12:10 am, said: nice review, even with the missing demonstration video of the a-model! hmmm strange. let me fix that.

2 set is only interesting for the panels, that's all it is to me

4 i just built the a model, and i rather like it. it is much bigger than it looks from the box - about 30 studs long. there is only one function - the landing gear - but it works very nicely. apart from that, it's a very solid build, and achieves an elegant shape with an absolute minimum of parts. i don't usually get excited about small sets, but this one appeals to me. i like the feeling that every single piece has a purpose.

4 boulderer, on 27 december 2015 - 05:44 pm, said: my favourite of the 2016 sets i've built so far. i'd go so far as to say this is the best "budget" set in years. i would have loved this when i was a kid ... great "swoosh ability" ?????? good to hear that, im gonna check the toy shops in my lunch break tomorrow, see if they got their shipment in yet, if they have, ill definitely buy one of these little sets

4 so this set showed up in stores yesterday, and i immediately picked two up. all in all it is a nice set, but it is slightly different from what i was expecting, the plane feels a bit "flat", pointy nose, wide bottom etc.. and while the panels work very well as wings, it feels a bit simplistic to just have single-part wings. the stickers really work for it though. its a cracking set though, nice parts pack, and a nice model as well

4 review - 42046 - getaway racer introduction starting with the 42010 - off-road racer and 42011 - race car in 2013, tlg released two sets in the first half of each year, using a pullback motor. the pullback motor allows the model to be pulled back, followed by forward motion. usually there's no apparent relation between the two set, other than the ability to combine them into an alternate build. this year there seems to some sort of cops and robbers scene going on. a getaway racer and a police interceptor. that can't be a coincidence. makes you wonder who will be victorious, the good guys or the bad guys. let's find out! note: all images can be clicked for hi-res versions. set information number: 42046 title: getaway racer theme: technic released: 2016 part count: 170 box weight: 302 gr box dimensions: 26,0 cm x 13,8 cm x 5,9 cm set price (msrp): € 19,99 price per part: € 0,118 links: brickset, bricklink the box the box has the same dimensions as previous year's pullback motor sets. in the lower right corner there's a visual explanation of the pullback mechanism. the dark model with it's decals sure looks like a cool hot rod. content of the box the box contains: 1 instructions booklet 1 sticker sheet 2 technic liftarms 1 pullback motor 3 bags instruction booklet just a single booklet. unfortunately no booklet for the alternate model. sticker sheet the sticker sheet contains a lot of cool stickers with flames and skulls etc. pullback motor and liftarms the pullback motor and two liftarms are found unbagged. bags a total of three bags containing the majority of the parts. highlighted parts this section describes the new and/or otherwise interesting parts. actually, this set is the only set of 1h 2016 which doesn't use any new parts, not even parts in a new color. tires the getaway racer uses four low profile tires (tire 37 x 22 zr). rims the rims are wheel 30.4mm d. x 20mm in pearl gold, found in 12 other sets. panels this set contains three #3 panelsand three #4 panels in black. part list this set contains 171 parts, all listed below. the build this being a small model, i won't show any building steps. let's skip right to the finished model. below you can see the end result. in my opinion the model looks great. it's got that hot rod vibe going on and the stickers add darkness to the vibe. slight problem with this set is that it really needs the stickers to finish the look. otherwise it's quite dull, with black and dark grey liftarms and panels. the rear view shows the pullback motor connected directly to the rear axle. in this image you can also clearly see the exhaust pipes on the side, which are very well executed. the 3x3 technic discs with stickers, used in the rim, result in only seeing a part of the rim. this works very well with the golden rims. the bottom view shows the chassis of the car. nothing really noteworthy, as you would expect from a pullback set. video the following video gives you an overview of the finished model. parts left these six parts are left after building the model. seems about right. features and functions this being a pullback motor set, it only has a single feature. the video below demonstrates the acceleration of the vehicle. my girlfriend was kind enough to catch the model before it fell to the ground. or did it hit something before it fell to the ground?! video this video shows the pullback functionality. b-model the alternate model is a combined build with the police interceptor, which you can see on the back of the box. unfortunately the instructions for the combined b-model are not included, so i didn't get a chance to build it. this would make for a fun challenge, building the b-model without the instructions. summary pullback sets are not the most technically advanced models, so you can't expect any other functionality than hitting the walls in your house. however, i think they are very appealing to kids. the fact that this year's pullback sets form a duo adds to the fun. in my opinion tlg hit the nail on the head with the getaway racer and police interceptor. the getaway racer looks very badass, which is something you don't see every day in a technic set. score how do i grade the bad guy in this year's duo. 8 design it looks so cool, but it does need the stickers. 7 building experience nothing out of the ordinary. 7 features limited to the pullback-and-drive functionality. 7 playability combined with the police interceptor, kids will love it. it does need it's nemesys though. 7 parts collection of common parts. gold rims could be interesting. 8 value for money pullback sets always deliver a certain value. 7,3 hit it! more image can be found on my flickr page. thank you for reading. i hope you enjoyed it.

2 first thing i thought: hot wheels?? whut. the set looks like the hot wheels 'bone shaker'.

2 the instructions for the extreme police interceptor combo model is now online....will someone do a review of this b model? https://wwwsecure.us...tselector=true#

2 thanks again for the review. i am not sold on this one yet, but i confess it took about 2 years for me to finally appreciate 9396. maybe i need to see this in person.

4 thanks for the review. i wonder if the design inspiration came from the russian ka-32 helicopter.

4 lego 42045 technic hydroplane racer thanks to lego and eurobricks for making this review possible! this was supposed to be a preview-review, before the dec 1 release date for the set, but it got stuck in customs or something and didn't arrive in time. well, i'd rather do a good, late review than a rushed review, so here it is. name: hydroplane racer set number: 42045 pieces: 180 price: $19.99 minifigs: 0 theme: technic year of release: 2016 links: bricklink brickset the box standard technic box. action photo, 2-in-1 logo, inset of functions. and the new "try our app" logo in the corner. the box back more standard stuff with the b-model and a larger app ad. the contents 3 bags, two manuals (yes, despite all the ads for their instructions app, they included printed manuals for both the main and b models!), a big sticker sheet, and two loose black beams. the interesting parts there's a lot of panels in this set. some are new colors (the blue curved panel) and the l-shaped blue panels are a new mold. i see them being used as mudguards on future sets (or maybe even this year; i haven't looked at the other 2016 technic sets in detail yet). the hose, soft axle 7 long in black is new as well. the normal 7 axle in yellow is a new color too, and i have no idea why it's in this set. both models use it in invisible places, so there's no reason other than making it easier to grab the right length axle to have it. i assume other sets this year are using it, but i'm not sure. the manual and the dumbing-down continues. now they have to show people to compare axle lengths to the 1:1 prints on the page that have always been there. but how does the 1:1 work on the app? might have to look into that... (for the record... i pulled out my phone and tried to find the app in the google store. couldn't find it. so then i went to the lego website shown on the page and it had a link to it. turns out it wasn't showing up because it's tablet only, so google wasn't showing it to me on my phone. i'll try again later with a tablet...) starting the build two technic standards. a bunch of pieces linked together to make a specific pattern of holes, and an engine block. some weirdness this felt very weird to me - making the crankshaft for the engine, they have you build it right to left. i don't know if it's because i'm a lefty or what, but it felt awkward. i need to look in some old manuals and see if it's always been this way... (nope! i randomly looked at 2013's set 42000 racer, and it builds it left to right.) assembling the core here's the core of the racer, upside down. the engine block, some gears at each end, and a couple boat studs for smooth gliding. and yes, they cheated and those are only attached on two studs instead of all 4. i'm always amazed at how lego geometry keeps finding interesting ways that it works. like here, with those boat studs. they fit perfectly into the bottom of the brick and against the beam. the front end up front we get a standard blue seat with a couple "hidden" wheels behind it. a boat doesn't typically have wheels, but these will drive the mechanisms of this model, so we'll let it slide. an odd part choice here though - in the very front there are two tan "axle pin without friction" parts holding that 3 long liftarm on. why? there's no need in either model for the non-friction pin, and there's lots of the normal blue axle pins in the set. so why include these two different pins? and all done! it looks like a huge jump here, but it's really not. the front and rear connect to each other, and then a bunch of big panels are added that make the model look way bigger. the stickers on this set really make it work. without them it's pretty bland and boring, so i recommend using them. from the rear at the back we have a fan to propel the boat. that's not so accurate. all the images i can find of real-life boats use props in the water. but since this is a non-floating model, we have to make some tweaks i guess. there also should be fins going down into the water for stability and hydroplaning, but again, had to drop that. here's an example of a real boat: you can see they nailed the overall look quite well. the underside for those that want to see the mechanicals, here's the underside of the model. minifig scale technic? nope, not quite. a fig will fit the seat, but sticks out of the cockpit and can't fit a helmet at all. so close... starting the b model again with the engine block, but this time an opposing 4 instead of inline. an odd part it's rare for lego to include parts specific to the b-model, so i was curious when i found this 2-axle with pin, a fairly new part. in the main model, it's used in a place that a normal 3 pin would have been fine, and it's the only one of these in the whole set, so it obviously must be needed in the b-model. sure enough, there's an assembly here that needs it: the front of the boat more upside-down building. and that silver piston is basically only there as a spacer. it has no real function. (yet.... it turns out later an axle goes into it, so it's a support for one end of the axle.) adding the wheels we keep building around the engine. this model uses the same wheel setup as the main model. taking shape the b-model instructions tell you to put the stickers on in case you haven't - they actually did a good job making the sticker work on either model. but the silver piston used as a cross-brace is a bit weird. it can spin, so that axle hole on the side ends up facing whatever way it wants. the back end the flex axles are used here under the panels just for appearance and to support the exhausts at the right angle. same fan propulsion as the main model, and just as wrong here :) worse, the gearing is switched. in the main model, the pistons and fan spin pretty quickly as you push the boat across the floor. in this one, they turn very slowly. more instruction weirdness i'm always curious at how lego decides to do instructions. here's how the panels on one side of the boat are assembled. for the mirror image on the other side, they tell you to put all 3 pins into the short panel as step 1 (2 black and a blue), add the white piece as step 2, and then add teh second panel and stickers as step 3. why two different ways? all done here's a similar angle as most of the official images. looks ok. i noticed though how obvious the wheels are. the back of the box image is a lower angle that hides them more. and i like the mudguard panels as seats. pretty clever. from the side i'm not fond of the profile. it doesn't sit level like i think it should. the wheels are a stud too low sticking out of the bottom. the underside like most b-models, there are compromises. there's pins and axles sticking out, but that's what you do when faced with a limited piece selection. minifig scale yet? nope, not quite. a bit too big this time. i think the driver is supposed to sit in the seat with knees over the front of the guard (where the grey pin is). so the minifig is way too small. spare pieces very few leftovers in this b-model. the conclusion so, what's my conclusion on this model? the b-model is fairly meh, and too similar to the main model. however, i love the hydroplane racer itself. it looks great and is very swooshable. for the price, it's surprisingly large thanks to the big panels on the sides, yes, this is one set that really needs the stickers to look good, but they look great and are well worth putting on. the ratings value: 9/10 - close to 10 cents a piece, and a fairly large model for the price. design: 9/10 - looks great other than the tiny fan on the back. minifigs: n/a - i was tempted to give a score since a minifig almost fits, but that'd be cheating. playability: 8/10 - not much functionality other than the engine and fan spinning, but very swooshable and sturdy enough to be played with. parts: 9/10 - a bunch of panels (including some new ones), just about every kind of technic pin, and quite a few thin liftarms . overall: 9/10 - the set is a solid winner, as long as your satisfied with the main model.

2 quote and the dumbing-down continues. now they have to show people to compare axle lengths to the 1:1 prints on the page that have always been there. but how does the 1:1 work on the app? might have to look into that... (for the record... i pulled out my phone and tried to find the app in the google store. couldn't find it. so then i went to the lego website shown on the page and it had a link to it. turns out it wasn't showing up because it's tablet only, so google wasn't showing it to me on my phone. i'll try again later with a tablet...) funny thing is that they changed colour of 7l axle to yellow, and on that picture it still is in lbg.

4 excellent review! i am glad that you did not rush this or the mine loader review. could it be that the fan in the back is like a turbo prop propulsion.... just reaching here. andy d

4 nice review, thanks nice little set, i might buy me one

2 i think this model is more or less supposed to be a version of this thing. a pretty obscure topic, but also very interesting.

2 how about this one: ps i somehow didn't find this picture when i wrote my review.

2 you switched the sides for the panel with the unsymmetrical sticker. otherwise you would see that the cut off part is where there's a beam in front of the panel. that's probably done because the beam could possibly damage the sticker, either while building or while placed against it for a long time. or it's simply omitted because it wouldn't be (completely) visible

4 until i saw photos of this set i wasn't convinced i wanted it. now after seeing all the combinations (a+b and tumbler tires!) i am definitely buying two copies. i need orange parts and black treads anyway. the only problem i have with this is that it's going to encourage me to buy many copies of the drag racer just to get enough wheels to play with.

0 i have the 42038, nice set but i found the tipping of the bed clumsy. it was a pleasure to build and i do like the build with the tumble wheels

4 thank you jim, nice review it´s a great set: a lot unique parts and not just pins, axles and beams. i bough it to bring me back to lego from my da (10 years)... ps. soon i will post an alternative model

4 review - 42001 - mini off-roader introduction technic mini models are sometimes regarded as models not worth buying. i don't agree with this opinion. whether it's a special part or innovative building technique, almost every mini model has something that makes the set worthwhile. this time i will be reviewing the 42001 mini off-roader. this model is not a smaller version of an existing model, so there's no real comparison with a bigger brother, or sister if you will. nor does the model resemble a real life brand or vehicle, so it is what it is, a mini off-roader. note: all images can be clicked for hi-res versions. set information number: 42001 title: mini off-roader theme: technic released: 2013 part count: 100 box weight: 165 gr box dimensions: 15,5 x 14,0 x 4,2 cm set price (msrp): 9.99 eur de / 7.99 gbp / 12.99 usd price per part: de 0.100 eur / uk 0.080 gbp / usa 0.130 usd links: brickset, bricklink the box the box measures 15,5 x 14,0 x 4,2 cm which is obviously not very big. the weight of the box is approximately 165 grams. frontside the front of the box shows a though four wheel drive off-roader challenging a fierce rocky mountain trail...now does it?! what the box actually shows is mini off-roader challenging a small foam rock formation, much like rocks used in star trek the original series, yet smaller the box also states that this model is for the age of 7 till 14. more importantly, the 2-models in-1 logo is clearly visible, which means this set can be used to build two different models. backside the backside shows a picture of the alternate model and a smaller version of the original model. the conversion arrow and the 2-in-1 are printed to clarify that the main model can be converted into a secondary model. sides one of the sides shows the 2-in-1 logo and a picture of the main model. another side shows a picture of one of the wheels in actual size and again, a picture of the main model. contents of the box the box contains: 2 booklets 2 bags 4 tires booklets this set contains two booklets which is not very common for a set this size. both models share the same chassis, which is why the build has been divided over two booklets, one for the chassis (8 pages with 10 steps) and one for the bodywork (34 pages with 23 steps for the main model and 20 steps for the alternate model). bags the box contains only 2 bags which is to be expected from a set consisting of 100 parts. one of the bags is filled with liftarms, panels, rims and two elastic bands. the other bags contains all the other parts, like pins, axles, connectors, etc. opening the bags results in the following collection of parts, with the exception of the tires. no abundant number parts that will add real value to your collection. nevertheless, there are some interesting orange parts and elastic bands. tires the tires are provided seperately (i.e. not contained in the bags). from the picture you can see that these tires have a front and a back side, so you should pay attention when fitting them to the rims, which have two different sides as well. highlighted parts this section describes the unique and/or highlighted parts. very small smooth technic panel (#21 and #22) these two small technic were new at the time of release and this set was only one of two sets containing them in orange. the other set is the 42007 - moto cross bike. at the moment of writing there's a third set containing these parts, the black champion racer. side a side b small rubber band i was under the impression that these white rubber bands weren't that common, but it seems that these bands are as common as dirt. but hey, you can't have enough rubber bands! thin liftarm 1x5 with axle holes like the panels, these liftarms were also new at the time of release. looking at the the frequent usage in other sets, this part has proven to be a most useful mammal. thin liftarm 1x3 not a very rare piece per se, but if you are not into bionicle, this liftarm part can be hard to find. your other option would be to buy the 9390 - mini tow truck, or the 8305 - dual bikes from a while ago (2000). long pin with center pin hole this relatively new kid on the block is currently used in many technic and non-technic sets and has well proven it's worth. axle pin connector hub with 2 axles like the previous part this newish part is also quite helpful in certain situations. part list here's the complete list for all 100 parts. building experience the build starts with the chassis of the off-roader. after connecting some liftarms two elastic bands, one on each side, are attached to the towball pins. this is all there is to the suspension, plain and simple. the two elastic bands contract the l-shaped liftarms, which results in the long ends swiveling downwards. the video below demonstrates the suspension. the simplicity doesn't do it justice, because it works like a charm. the suspension is very smooth with the right amount of stretch and resistance. this great working suspension adds a lot of value to this set. to quote john hurt in the movie contact: "why build one when you can have two at twice the price?". i have purchased two sets so we can simultaneously see both models and make a proper comparison. below you can see two identical chassis which will be used for both versions of the build. at this stage we have arrived at the end of the first booklet, which only took about ten minutes. not surprising, since the first booklet only has 10 building steps. progressing to the second booklet, you need to choose between building the main and alternative model. that's a choice i don't need to make for this review, so let's start with the main model. main model when building the bodywork there's a rather peculiar building technique, which you wouldn't expect in an official lego set. the axle and pin connector hub with 2 axles only protrudes halfway into the double bent liftarm. the thin 1x4 liftarm which is added in one of the following steps makes sure the hubs stay perfectly in place, but i was still surprised to see this technique. the finished bodywork for the main model looks like....uhh...well.....i don't know exactly. it doesn't bear any resemblance to a real life model, which makes it hard to judge. one thing's for sure; it's not the best looking technic mini model. the bodywork can be attached to the chassis by using a 7l axle and two bushes, one on each side of the chassis. alternate model unfortunately the alternate model doesn't look much better than the main model. it's even a stud less wide, while you would like to see slightly more body, matching the size of the tires and chassis. attached to the chassis the body is even more out of proportion. it's not really ugly and the color scheme is great (obviously this goes for the main model as well), but the body simply doesn't match the chassis. i can only imagine that this model is supposed to have a chibi look, much like the microfighter star wars models. comparison the following section shows a selection of images from different angles to compare the main and secondary model. the main model has a bit more volume, while the alternate model has a more sporty look. front view the main model has headlights which are attached at a higher point, while the alternate model has headlights which are placed more closely next to each other. rear view a slightly different setup in both models, where the main model again has higher placed rear lights. side view the side view shows that the panels are used differently in both models. the main models uses them as doors, while the alternate model uses them as engine cover (bonnet). top view the top view reveals that the main model might have room for a minifig parts left the left image shows the parts which are left after building the main model, while the second image shows the parts left after building the alternate model. as you can see, the main model uses slightly more parts than the alternate model. features besides the awesome suspension, which we already have discussed, there aren't a lot of features in this set. there's actually a single feature, which is only present in the main model....opening doors! wow, impressive! well, maybe we can't expect too much functionality in such a small model. summary the off-roader is a fun model which is fairly easy to build. the suspension is simple, yet very effective. the model could do better in the design department, but the suspension offers great playability and that is what this set is all about. the orange parts are not very common so they are an added bonus. all things considered this set is definitely worth the few bucks you need to spend on it. pros great suspension fun to play with some (semi) rare orange parts great color scheme cons no resemblence to an actual off-roader not the best looking model score below are my scores based on different categories. 6 design not the best looking technic model. 7 building experience the suspension makes it fun to build. 7 features the suspension makes up for the lack of functionality. 8 playability the model has car-swooshability. 7 parts some interesting orange parts. 8 value for money great present for the younger builders. 7,1 elastic hope you enjoyed it! thanks for reading and please rate this set at the top of this topic!

4 the suspension is indeed awesome. for it's size, this is a great set! looking at the grades, i seem to have lowballed the score.

0 i don't like appearance of this off-roader at all but i've got it as gift so it's in my technic collection now. when i built it i was very surprised how cool suspension it has and how much playability it features. i've also tried to build some alternative model out of it but without success. anyway thank you jim for great review! edited by tomik, 14 december 2015 - 05:45 pm.

4 sigh. i think i got this for a birthday back in the day. my parents were so awesome. :) tc

0 i'd give a 2, but you put 3 two times. is a nice set but is not really cool. is a worse version of lagoon lock up

4 for the price it really looks like a nice set. because of the lack of a cannon, i give it a 4. cool comic is! *y* captain roger, on oct 20 2007, 10:59 am, said: i'd give a 2, but you put 3 two times. thanks for the pointer! changed, and i added your vote.

4 how much was it again? for the price it looks really solid. if u add the prison to the back it looks real good.

4 hello, well as this is my first review i hope you like it. the 7744 police station is simply fanstastic. the many minifigs and the vehicles makes it really nice. the great playabillaty and and great space makes it great for children i think. but latest but not least the pics! general overview: the front of the box: the back of the box: inside the box: top of the box: instructions: the minifigs: the cars: patrol car: dog car: the dog: the motor: well now the police station : the mailbox: the crime report room: the handcuffs holder: handcuff: suspect who wears handcuffs: jails: satelite: little things: water machiene: and if you don?t like water, we have coffee to!: well and as last: the interrogation room: well this was the review. i hope you liked it! bye

4 thank you very much for the review, the-force! the new police station looks great! i really like its lovely interior - amazing! by the way: i have a question: are there any beds, tables or/and seats for the prisoners in their cells?

4 awesome! these maquettes are really cool, thanks for the review! *y* ~peace

0 not my thing, but a very nice review, thanks for sharing it! i was seriously considering this one when it was originally announced as a 6212 copack item at a particularly good price and then everything changed. i do, however, seriously ache to get my hands on one of the more traditionally lego looking 2ft+ vaders they use in the official stores (at least they had one here in orlando). *wub*

2 can you swap head? and coler on the saber?

4 during the annual thanksgiving road trip to the relatives, i stopped by the tru in portland, or. lo and behold, the new mars mission sets! obviously, i bought them. ;-) the box: not much to say. standard box art for mm sets, nothing new. the parts: some good parts here. even if you don't like the set (which i highly doubt after i've had my say :-p ), it's a decent parts pack. i noticed that some old parts have been renewed. i know the wheel has been used in the '07 sets, but the cockpit and hitch i haven't seen in a while. the vldss (very large dss). grr. new part. at least, i think it is. someone slap me if it isn't. *wacko* the figs. i know i've seen that head before, but i have no idea where. does anyone know? i was hoping that the aliens would have new arms, at least. i was sadly mistaken... on the upside, i finally discovered that they glow in the dark. :-$ the alien has a jetpack. if that's not the silliest thing i've ever seen, i don't know what is. the build. simple build. a block. so easy a caveman cou- oh, never mind. geico's used that one enough. then, we have this jobber right here. not sure what it is, but it looks like some crystal scanning device. it's starting to look pretty nice. it almost looks practical. the cockpit is suffering from a bad dose of over-stickering. on the upside, we have a new piece there to hold the cockpit on. part 1 complete. it has a nice little radio antenna, which is ruined by the use of a random missile that looks like it's going to shoot the antenna before it shoots the alien. still, i never say no to a good missile i can use for something else. the trailer: fairly simple, but it works. it features stabilizing arms, a handheld saw, and an extremely random mini-bot who's purpose escapes me. the whole meal deal- erm, general pics. overall, i thought this was a good set. in fact, it reminds me of this:

4 finally we have seen the light!!! i've been waiting for a while deciding if i was gonna get this....well i've decided after that wonderful review i am! good job reviewin!! *wub*

4 cool review, thanks!! :-d i personally think the minirobot is awesome, and (dare i say) cute! this was described on amazon to be a mobile lab, i'm not seeing that. i do however see a crystal hauling vehicle. *sweet* pretty cool, not as bad as previous sets. ~peace

4 thanks for the review, it's a neat little set. i hope it comes to australia sooner rather than later. that minifig head was also used in 7699 mt-101 so that may be why it seems familiar.

2 *wub* thanks for another great review. *sweet* i am also glad that it is a very different alien fighter design as i already have three varients of the old type! the fighter transforms better than i thought it would; i was expecting just the wings. i should be buying this set as well... mr. mandalorian, on nov 26 2007, 03:45 pm, said: without "anti-grav" support, it would fall forward on it's nose each time it transformed. well, since anti-grav doesn't exist, and will never exist, there has to be another option! looking at it in tank mode it does have a vague aerofoil shape so i think it should be able to work as a lifting body. all it needs to do then is move fast enough to start taking off and then it can extend the wings... 8-|

2 great review! sinner, on nov 26 2007, 12:22 am, said: well, since anti-grav doesn't exist, and will never exist, there has to be another option! looking at it in tank mode it does have a vague aerofoil shape so i think it should be able to work as a lifting body. all it needs to do then is move fast enough to start taking off and then it can extend the wings... 8-| this is clearly tlg officially supporting anti-grav technology...i mean think about it. "how can it support itself without anti-grav while transforming?" the answer? it can't *sweet* :-p

0 hmm, its actually a nice bit better than i expected, and great review, thanks! but think ill pass on this one. i quite like the alien fighter though, heh. and loved the way you described how he sat in the cockpit.

0 hmmm, i doubt i'll be getting this set. good review though.

4 i really like the transforming aspect of this! the one thing i wish mm sets would include would be baseplates. i liked that about the classic space stuff because it really helped create the environment. some "red rock orange" mars baseplates would be great!

4 thanks, guys! lasse d, on nov 26 2007, 08:54 am, said: wow. this is actually quite a neat set! it is definitively my favorite in the line after the big drilling unit! \begin{geek} i'm not sure it would nose dive when transforming from tank mode. i guess it would pick up speed and transform quickly since it doesn't seem to have any downwards pointing thrusters. \end{geek} i don't think that tank is very fast... maybe if it drove off of a crater.... commander andrew of 501 st, on nov 26 2007, 09:03 am, said: friggin sweet, thank you mr mandy for the reveiw of this sweet ship! *y* *wub* i see you know imperialshadows. :'-( ;-)

0 and another tks and congrats mm on that review !! like the o?her post i think that this set is a wastre of time and money and shelfspace. its such a ripp off from that ugly alfa team crapjet. i do not like the design of the jet itself: the small flags as front is so lame !! and i don't like those orange wheels as engines !! furthermore i don't like the "rover" mode either !! the only cool thing about it is the special martian jet which they should ahve sold separatly :-p at least some interesting parts but that far from saving that set imo |-/ money saved on once again :-p *yoda*

0 lasse d, on nov 26 2007, 03:34 pm, said: 1) there will always be kudos for a good review at eb ;-) 2) yeah. it does look quite slow and tank-like. it is a shame lego didn't make a more obvious way shoving what goes on. you mean the ungainly way in which the wheels have to turn in order to change from tank mode? i think you are right as well. on the other hand. if it has anti-grav, then it doesn't really make sense to have wheels as well. i mean. if the power goes, then the wheels can't turn anyways! it must have anti-grav. otherwise, none of the flying sets would work... athos, on nov 26 2007, 04:02 pm, said: i think blue must be a cheaper color for lego... steve i think this is weird. tlc included way too many random colors. blue, red, green, and yellow... *wacko*

4 8115 dark panther review check out my review of this great new exo-force set. comic and rating will be up shortly! and hopefully more reviews too... :-)

4 yes, finally!!!! hinckley youre the best!! is there a chance i can ever be in one of your ever so loved comics? i just read it and so far so good in the 08 ef line. looking forward to the rest of the review! edited by exo-builder59, 27 november 2007 - 04:04 am.

4 sweeeet. *wub* it's nice to finally see a set that's not bipedal or (?) tripedal. quote exo-force is an anomaly in my lego interests. i don't know why i like it so much or why i keep buying it but i do. that would be a problem, wouldn't it? :-p quote the cockpit itself is constructed very well but the canopy seems like an afterthought, closing on to the robot's head and leaving his back and sides completely exposed. i dunno. at least it has a canopy, unlike past sets..

4 awesome reveiw thanks for the pics!! did the instructions come with a comic?

4 great review as always, hinckley. frankly i'm in love with this thing. so much so, in fact, that i've been calling it 'shadow panther' for weeks, but never mind... anyway, why do i like it? well, purple is such a fantastic lego colour- it's sparingly used, which makes it interesting, and it simply looks great. those jetpack/backpack things the robots are wearing, and if they are jetpacks, as the back of the box suggests, then the use of chaisaws is quite nifty and innovative. the minibot is cool, and certainly an interesting gimmick. sure, they don't look quite as good in some of the other sets, but here it looks great. the overall structure and design are cool too. it's always nice to see an 'irregular' mech, and this is no exception. it's especially cool whee the spines are concerned. plus, on top of all that, it's got a nice selection of parts, including some lovely new ones, and the inlaid box is interesting. well worth getting, i think.

4 another fantastic review, hinckley. i really like this set, i wasn't to keen on it when i first saw the pictures bit having seen the review, i am starting to like it. it seems quite sturdy, and it makes a change from the usual 2 legged mechs. as well as that purple is welcome anywhere, i have such a shortage of that colour! i like the rusty orange colour of the robots, and their back/jet packs are quite cool, and the mini robot looks sweet.

2 great almost finished review *y* thanks for doing these, since you are probably busy however my favorite part is missing, the comic!! :-d interesting set, however i never liked exoforce but i like the parts wait on! piranha

2 from the lego store in chicago, if i recall his post properly! my goodness hink, you're going to pull an all-nighter for reviews at this rate! oh well, it's kinda worth it, right? :-p

4 this one is much better than i thought; i didn't expect the gun and the "turret" to be geared! i agree that a lot of the details sux (hollow inside, lame cockpits...) but as an overall package it looks quite good. the best part is.... no shooter! is the nightmare finally over? :'-) the bonus robot is a much better idea. the large amount of blue pieces make this a must buy for me as impartial needs more raw materials! :-p how well do the tracks work? the last tank was too light and it didn't roll well at all. :-/ thanks for these photos as well hinckley. *wub* so far the 08 exo-force sets are looking good! *sweet* hinckley, on nov 28 2007, 04:48 pm, said: and actually i did feel the same way you did about the flying module, until i put sinner in it and started to play. :-p wow! it's big enough for my big walrus head! *wub*

2 sinner, on nov 28 2007, 12:53 am, said: how well do the tracks work? the last tank was too light and it didn't roll well at all. :-/ it's similar in weight but i didn't have to press down so hard to get the treads to move, barely at all, really. i think the mobile defense tank, although a better overall design, suffered from the odd angle of the treads and that was mostly why the treads didn't turn well. plus, what was with those weird exhaust pipes?? anyway, they are both cool tanks although i like the mobile defense tank better... :-)

4 thanks for this great review hinckley! :'-) i know you're loving this attention! x-d :-p i actually like this set, and like it a lot more now that i've seen this review. i'll most likely get, mostly for the figs and parts. i reckon it would look a lot better alongside the rest of the 2008 ef mechs. anyway, thanks for the review! to the brickmobile! >:-)

4 thanks for that good review, hinckley. *y* a really interesting set and a turning point for lego. minirobots instead of shooting crap, pretty cool. i hope the kids?ll like it too. for the design, i love that asymmetrical look of the front part and the sleek guns of the flyer. it?s smart that the gatling gun moves along with the tank, too. the set idea with two vehicles in one?s not new, but very play- able and the treads/big wheel design?s cool. i don?t like the use of studless technic beams, but well, they do their job i guess. and keiken?s cockpit should be easy to improve....

2 can't wait for the extended review!! ;-)

2 thank you for the review hinckley :-) already waiting for the comic x-d

2 8112 battle arachnoid review i've opted to do another set review instead of getting the comics up. i don't want anyone to beat me to the reviews. so, thanks for your patience and enjoy the review. the comics will be up in due time. thanks! :-$

4 thanks for this new review, hinckley *wub* for me, it was love at fistr sight with this little set :-p it's simple but nice, and way better than shadow crawler for a spider-like mech *y* you sure will be very busy these days, and your characters will get breakdown before they finish filming all the comics x-d luxorv

4 awesome! thanks hinckley! i was not planning to get this set but now it look as if i will have too. (i still cannot afford it anyway) :'-(

4 i would agree. the spider looks really cool. too bad we can't see how the combo mech looks like. instructions are not online yet. :-/ there should be another combo mech but you'll need the storm lasher set. :-p

2 zero1312, on dec 5 2007, 05:27 pm, said: wow, nice review. *y* but i have a question: where can i find these "ork sets" everyone is refering to because of these swords in the rotors. :-/ are you talking about the dwarves mine? *sweet*

4 cool! another *y* *y* *y* *y* *y* *y* out of *y* *y* *y* *y* *y* and could you post a pic of all the minirobots and planes

4 here is my review of the set 6265 sabre island! overview: sabre island was release in 1990 an it contained 92 pieces and its retail price was $15.50. it comes with 3 imperial blue coats, and a nice outpost for them. the pictures + full review: anyway, you can see here a picture of the box, the model shown on the box differs from the actual model slightly. ...and the back of the box, which shows some nice alternative models from the pieces provided. a close up of two or three of the alternative models. and now for the minifigs. i prefer the red coats over the blue coats but these minifigs are nice, and for the number of pieces one gets a fair amount of them. the set itself makes a nice small outpost, it comes complete with a palm tree, a cannon (with ammo) on a turntable, a small tower a nice large imperial flag and a little red row boat! here is a shot from ground level showing the cannon and blue coat (patrolling the out post!) the rowing boat was a nice touch, and it comes with a small flag too. "no pirates will avoid the wrath of myself and my mighty island!" the top of the tower is rather plain and simple which in some ways is good, as it keeps the whole set detailed yet not crowded, but i feel a little something should of been added to the top though. the back is lacking any type of walls, so one can play with the minifigs inside, yet their are also no stairs or any other ways for the blue coats to climb up their tower either! the rag tag pirates attack sabre island! but never fear, the lord of pies is here! me throwing a pie at captain ironhook from another angle. overall i think this is a very good, if somewhat simple set, and makes a great cheap imperial set! comments, thoughts and opinions are welcome! (and sorry about the darkness in some photos, i have not had time to take photographs when it is till light recently, for when i return home it is dark |-/ ) edit: fixed, thank you! edited by phred, 12 april 2015 - 05:14 am.

4 fantastic review! i'll post my views on the set later when i have more time. but i've already fixed the poll.

4 nice review! hmm...i gave it a 4...why? very good bits: -3 epaulettes for 3 gurads! -patterned wall parts -cannon bad bits: -no pirates to fight -title is rather grand for an outpost -top needs battlements, not very low lattices -needs a more substantial base - the wall goes right into the sea! - surely the whole thing would sink... -palm tree is too short ...and the rest is good! :-p you might want to fix the vote option for 5 - it appears to be the title; you can't vote for it... pirate king skelly killer edit: ok, boney, but i gave it a 4! edited by slyowl, 06 december 2007 - 07:32 pm.

4 i give it a 4, only because there are no pirates. i aways loved this set, nice little fortifaction. lots of details. i only wish i could have worked it in aberbrick.

2 athos, on jan 2 2008, 10:59 pm, said: perhaps a catapult? steve hmm, maybe, although a catapult doesn't really fit in to that time period all that well.

2 lord of pies, on jan 3 2008, 08:51 pm, said: what a wonderful idea.... :-p a pie catapult! although it is a waste of a pie....we have ourselves a dilemma! there's plenty of stale, moldy old, maggot infested grog around eldorado fortress, perhaps that's worth wasting on the scurvy sea-dogs afterall my men have taken to eating only coconuts brought by islander girls in their skimpy undies! x-d

4 its a fantastic set, cant think of anything wrong with it to be honest, even if the island is a bit small, the plate itself is still useful, and the rest of it is also very useful, walls can go toward a bigger fort, cannon can extend your ship, soldiers extend your army, boat extends err your boats, and the island prin is just cool

4 its a nice set. i would not mind owning one, just for the minifigs and cannon. the base plate is pretty cool as well. nice review, i gave it a 4 out of 5.

4 :'-) i really love everything you did with this gas station. it looks very cozy!!! amazing how you said you built it by the book, does that mean you didn't have the set but you used your own pieces to rebuild the thing? the flourescent lighting is genius! and the interior space looks just like what you'd see at those little shops. i really dig the moc ;-) it gives me good ideas and now i want a gas station of my own :-p and the history behind how it was "rebuilt" and how it will improve business etc is so cool *wub*

4 great moc! it seems you did the math when doing this one and hit the nail on the head (which pierced a megablock causing it to self destruct) ! stauder

4 nice station phred, love those fluorescent lights! *wub* but...start dodging cannonballs now, boom, harr! :-p

4 great review!! i love this set *wub* (not only because of marion though :-d ) it has the ark that is very cool , sw humor and lots of snakes a very cool set and perhaps my favorite so far *sweet* damn, 3 out 4 indy sets reviewed and isn't even 08 yet x-d p

4 db24, on dec 16 2007, 02:09 am, said: thank you for the great review! looks like a very nice set, so many snakes!! 10 in all ... 5 green, 5 red

4 iamded, on dec 15 2007, 06:51 pm, said: thanks for the review! it looks awesome, and 10 snakes! is that box the ark though? thanks again! ~peace yes, the ark is the box in the center.

4 lol! those star wars heiroglyphics are awesome! were those in the movie? or is this just a joke by the lego designers? that would be the first time tlc showed any kind of reference humor! the rest of the set is great too, even the skeleton and the stickers. yes, that's right, i actually like those things. i like the new skellies because of their posability (i'm a big supporter & user of stop-motion) and i think there's nothing wrong with stickers. i mean seriously, why does everybody hate stickers so much??? :-| sure, they are a pain in the megablocks to put on and, sure, they come off after a while and are never usable again, but hey, you don't have to put them on, even better, you can save them (like i do) and use them for your mocs! could somebody tell me, please? i'm just curious. however, as i said, nice set! i might even get one. gotta love that marion with the carot torch x-d and that arc is neat too! by the way, are all parts on it golden? some more pics on it would be nice as soon as your camera is recharged! ;-) thanks. peace out!

4 awesome!!! i want it soo bad!! :'-) how much was it? edited by indy565, 16 december 2007 - 12:55 am.

2 big pete, on dec 15 2007, 06:04 pm, said: ?44.99, as it says in the first line of the review ;-) yes, but i don't live in the uk. any idea how much it might cost in the us?

2 this set is pretty nice i love the idol id probably buy the set just for that :-d lol is it just me or in the earlier concepts of this set we saw a native on the box? i wonder why they removed it :-( *wacko*

4 tks so much big pete for thisd awsome review of yet another fantastic indy sets !! its clearly one of the best lines of all times with sw 8-? that idol is superb and i love all the details of that set: loads of cool defense mechanisms, sweet vegetation and yeay another black carrot torch :-p and those mfs are really nice !! i am so happy to see lego go dark tan *wub* now i clearly can't wait to enjoy building this set ;-) fertility idol on !! *yoda*

2 i just noticed another inconsistency between box art and the actual set ... on the box, the biplan has white wing supports (they're just plane windows without glass in them) and yet the set they are dark grey (or is it bley ... can never tell the difference without careful study). add to that ... the outer of the engine at the front is white on the box and black in the set. we don't normally have this many inconsistencies do we ?

4 because of exams and other obligations, i haven't posted this sooner. seeing that no-one else has reviewed this set, i thought i might as well do it myself. the set in its entire glory (minus the slammer, instructions and the (obviously) massive sticker sheet) the four cars included in this set; a muscle car, a sports car, a roadster and the police off-roader(!): because the police obviously have no clue that an off-roader is useless for catching street-racers, no less a batmobile-ish sports car, it will always trail behind: but the police have a trick up their sleeve - the drawbridge: gotcha! and the mechanism that makes it all tick: the motor is nothing more than a (slow) pull-back motor. push down the bridge, the latch will hook on to the gear and keep it in place until the latch is released. and there's the new gas station. staying within theme, this gas-station is, like the tanker in 8147, from the company fuel 4 speed: there's a notable presence of detail here, such as the soda-dispenser, water (coolant?) bottles and other accesories, two fuel pumps and bumper-level railings to prevent cars from crashing into them. there's no interior however. and as demonstrated here by a loyal octan-employee and a pursuing officer, the gas station is built to minifig-scale: my impressions of this set: as a collector of tiny turbos, and yet to miss a set, i got this one regardless of what it included. the gas station is indeed very nice, and the minifig-scale accesories were unexpected. the lack of interior is no big issue, and the both the station and bridge can with ease be implemented into a mini-fig town. the bridge also solidly built, and includes the ramps in its design, so it can be lifted, with ramps attached, without breaking apart. the slammer included in the set is identical, apart from the white color, with those in 8147. the cars are also very nice, altough i am yet to get used to the yellow batmobile, as i've grown accustomed to calling it. i also love the off-roader's chunky tires, they make perfect wheels for the newer minifig-scale cars. i never consider price/parts ratio, and here it would, for me, be irrelevant, because it will never be demolished for parts. the play value is what i would consider pretty good, and while the bridge won't rise with a car on it, it's still strong enough to stay open with a car tipping over the edge. hmm. every nerve in my body is saying that this sets is worth roughly 8/10, so: verdict: 8/10 edited by whitefang, 23 may 2009 - 07:01 pm. indexed

2 picked up from the lego shop in bluewater yesterday front of box back of box price ?2.50 gbp contents, a very small instruction manual instructions (front) intsructions (back) 25 pieces (23 used in the model) regular construction mini fig start of the assembly roll in the drum just attach the drum a little tap with the hammer! (hammer not included!) wheel it into position time to start mixing, also time for a well earned tea break, the cement is all ready now. and the 2 left over bits. extra cement is always useful and not really wasted. overall, a nice little set and i am pleased to see little sets appearing again at long last. the only negative is with the drum of the mixer, although the angle can be adjusted you cannot tip the contents out of the mixer. all in all i would say 8/10 for a good little set? comments...? ? ? edit by hobbes: replaced pictures with clickable thumbs and corrected set number.

4 i tink its better if you resize the pics before uploading to ur brickshelf account. picasa2 is a good tool to resize ur pics. use the "export" function. ;-) anyway, nice review! looks like i will be getting all of the city impulse sets except for the fire fighter one. maybe more of those large bin sets. heh.. thanks for the pics! is it possible if you scan the rest of the sets at the back of the manual? thanks in advance! :-d

4 omg i absolutely love how you reviewed this set, i think you are the only person i've ever seen on eurobrick with such a thorough review. i read eurobricks daily and this really raises the bar in terms of how a person does a review. please do not resize your pics, they are perfect, crisp, large, thorough, and clear; it gives anyone who really wants info on the set just about everything they need to know about it. i had no idea they used that lil "thing" to have the cement mixer spin, cool idea ;-) . nice set, but perfect perfect review. thanks much! x-d

2 i just want the ship...just the ship.

2 i don't recall mine having an alignment problem on the tubes... could you perhaps take a closer picture of the area? did yours also have two of the same sticker for the wings of the alien craft?

4 thanks for this review. lots of minifigs is a plus, although half of them are junk jellies, but dang the base just doesn't seem impressive. it looks so cheap, like a skeleton. the tubes are just ridiculous. but hey, at least it comes with two cool spacecraft, that's nice.

2 lol, "polizei" is german for police.

4 great review! the helicopter is very nice and a cheap way to get a cop and those new handcuffs i wish the police impulse had those new cuffs *sad* thanks for doing this *y* x-o a printed part :-d mail carrier review on p edited by piranha, 26 december 2007 - 04:07 am.

2 cool review, thanks! and i think that doctor hair piece isn't hinting at anything new, just some cartoony stuff for the pic. :-/ ~peace

2 caseyref, on dec 26 2007, 02:02 am, said: i quite like it, but i feel that my lego city is getting over-run with helicopters and planes. also i have got the helicopter from the 7237 police station set, but it is not as good as this plus i'am sooooo dissapointed that the :-x stickers :-x are blue instead of black and green as they will not fit with the sets i have already got :-d nice review thanks if you look at the police picture from the instruction booklet, it looks to me that the 3 sets in the bottom left corner are the bike (7235), patrolcar (7236) and prisoner transport (7245) from 2005, but with new blue stickers?

4 thanks for the review pspguy. i think this is a very nice little chopper... but the biggest reason why i will probably get this is for the handcuffs! :-d are the side windows flush like the old ones or recessed like the new ones are supposed to me? (the look recessed to me. :-/ ) scrypt, on dec 26 2007, 09:36 pm, said: if you look at the police picture from the instruction booklet, it looks to me that the 3 sets in the bottom left corner are the bike (7235), patrolcar (7236) and prisoner transport (7245) from 2005, but with new blue stickers? yes, you're right. ;-)

2 thanks for the review psp guy. i just have one question for you, in bottom right picture on the back of the box what is the policeman putting in the container. thanks in advance!

2 nice review *y* i will get 2 of these at the least especialy since they're going to be $15 aud *wub* :'-)

4 pspguy, on dec 27 2007, 03:08 am, said: what? if your asking how they are but together you snap the window piece into the ho\lder. errr.... no. as brikbitz said on his site in the 7732 postal plane review... quote you can see the traditional airplane window piece, but the bad news is they've changed the window pane. it's the new flat piece used in 4996 beach house, it just doesn't work as well. without the original bevelled edge it doesn't seal the window and there is small noticable gap around the edge. not a major problem but it might get a bit draughty inside and certainly no high altitude flying. i was wondering if it is the old or new type. darth_legois_619, on dec 27 2007, 08:20 am, said: nice review *y* i will get 2 of these at the least especialy since they're going to be $15 aud *wub* :'-) how did you find out the price? if you are right then this is a must buy! *wub*

4 thank you for the great review sandra *y* . i *wub* the detail that tlc added to this set. i would like to add that i think all the buildings look *sweet* . i really like how you compared the look to "back to the future". when i saw the first pics, i thought the same thing. the look of the set is definitly the 1950's. i am :-( to see the price though. i am sure this set will be $149.99 us too. great review, model on!!

4 thank you very much for the wonderful review, legocastlegirl! plenty of pics, thanks again! *wub* *y* ~peace

4 axle, on dec 28 2007, 02:07 pm, said: can you take a picture(s) of all the film posters? there?s no necessity to take pics of all the film posters. there are only 3 different film posters at the set. always one poster twice.. and you can see every different poster at the brickshelf gallery. if you need more details, then you should maybe buy it :-) regards sandra

4 freebee, on dec 28 2007, 02:33 pm, said: ouch ;-) hm if my answer was to harsh: sorry axle :-$

4 i enjoyed seeing this review. nice to get some different angles on the components. sorry to disagree with anyone however, but this was not a great review. i appreciate the effort sandra made but a great review would include more details such as what are stickers and what are printed pieces. a great review points out flaws or limitations as well as what works or is really neat. a great review would have analyzed the price per piece and compared that to other sets/themes. one might look at the recent reviews of the indy sets or the new spongebob sets as examples of really good reviews. the pictures are good but a great review, above all, should provide the reader with some new information, perhaps even answer questions posed in the pre-release discussion thread. i learned nothing new about the set from this review. that said, it was a good review for someone who had not seen the pre-release discussion and she did a good job of showing said person what they could expect in the set.

4 thank you for the review

4 thanks for the review. i really want this set because: 1. it looks fantastic 2. has harder to find colors 3. is a 50th anniversary commemorative 4. some of the models are based on the 50s sets (i love the old stuff) the tanker truck is a perfect recreation of the old ho 1:87 scale esso tanker truck. i have one, and you can look at it for comparison if you would like. lego ho vehicles i'd like to modify the truck from this new set to look even more like the old esso truck, getting rid of the green and adding some decals.

4 tks will for your great review !! g after reading *vader* 's reviews (of that set and the rs) and yours i really can't wait to get that set and all of the sw sets :-p really nice photography there which is sweet !! *yoda*

4 thanks for the review, mr. mandalorian! this set looks very nice, and it's good to know the nose cone stickers are 2 separate ones, so they don't cross bricks. :-d that camera is working out great for ya'! thanks again! ~peace

4 thanks for the reveiw on this great set! i actually just came home from tru with this, maybe 1/2 hour ago! funny! love the new hair sculpt! *wub*

4 this is a brilliant review of a brilliant set! *sweet* thanks a lot! i know this may be a bit much to ask but could take some pics of the whole instruction booklet? please!!! if you can thanks a bunch. but if not do know of a place where i could find the instructions?

4 ok i thought it might be to much to ask. i will try *vader* 's review. and again thanks for the review *y*

4 than kyou for the review. i don't know if i buy this set now i know there's also a anakin in the at-te with a new jedi, but who knows.

4 i totally like this set *wub*! i bought it some days ago ,it looks really nice together with the mtt. and i am going to get the at-ap today. *sweet* edited by stealth hunter, 05 january 2008 - 04:44 pm.

2 wout, on jan 5 2008, 09:27 pm, said: a druid battle pack would also be a nice idea for the castle sets. may i ask what you paid for this? my first (and second) idea was that 25 euro was a bit to much for this. :-) x-d whatever :-p bloody typo i say. however, the upcomming castle advent calendar might include druids :-p i paid 30? for it ;-) (dang 1 cent more expensive as s@h :-d ) trudop561, on jan 5 2008, 11:21 pm, said: they released the battle droid commander in 2000 :-| yes, another nice tone, meessa so happy !! first, you are very welcome for my review of a set present in your wishlist. then the commander you are talking about has a tan body with oreange markings only (check !!) and the commander here has a full yellow body like in the spiderman set doc oc's hideout (4856) !! therefore those 2 commanders are 2 different mfs. *yoda*

0 nice review, thanks. it still seems overpriced to me though. also, the box shows the droid torsos that are used for "feet" on the spider droid as being light bley, yet they are clearly dark bley. *wacko* tk

4 great review, as we've come to expect from *yoda* *y* nice to see that tlg is finding new and interesting ways to get around the "no minifig only" sets restrictions with hasbro. clearly, this is another army builder with a minimal vehicle as we're becoming accustomed to. heck, even the diminutive hailfire is technically a droid as well, thus making this all minifigs, from a certain point of view. only negative: it is a bit overpriced. i'll have a better feel for that when i get one. treads/links always drive up a price, so it might just be fair. the spiderdroid is a winner, even with the unusual parts assortment. i like it when lego thinks of different ways to use things, i think it promotes the same from us. i'm not sure what i think of the new battledroid commanders, but at least i can make extras easily if i need to, as i bought a bunch of yellow droid bodies off bricklink once, thinking i might want to make some kind of new droid out of them. they were cheap at the time, now i expect the price to go up just because of this potential use. between those and the grey ones, it's good to see more becoming available. hopefully we'll see black and a few other colours produced for some nice customizing possibilities. all in all, a nice little set with a great army building potential, especially on a buy-one-get-one-half-off or better type of sale. until then, i'll grab one or two and be glad to have them.

0 i got this and a couple of other sets on monday.and to tell you the truth, i was a bit dissapointed.i like the set, i like the parts, but it's definitly not worth it's rrp of $45 nzd, if you ask me i should be more like $35 nzd, but hey, i still like it, i got it for $30 on ebay so i'm not complaining *y* *y*

4 ah i finally got the 2 city sets i really wanted !! i am so happy that lego went postal on us :-p . since they are rather small i shall do a mix review of these 2 sweet sweet sets. 1) mail van (7731) like always i?ll start with shots of the box art and bloody dss. now here are the extras of that set: i really love the new torso of the postal worker. my huge grip lies on the mail box: that mail logo is a freaking sticker !! for that part i was so expecting a printed part. that is really really bad !! apart from that the design is pretty cool. the van is quite simple but i think its pretty cute. i love the fact that the rear is a window. 2) air mail (7732) like always i?ll start with shots of the box art and bloody dss. the extras are ok: another great postal worker. you also have yet another red trolley with a package that is a bloody sticker yet again !! g tlc should have more printed parts !! that plane for me is a classic thing of beauty !! really is consistent with the fantastic planes of the 80?s. that?s the kind of lanes tlc should produce instead of those huge playmo planes. actually i am happy that tlc released that one ? for once its not a bloody airline exclusive promo set !! here are general pics. i love the engines of the plane: simple yet superb. also the top hatch opens to insert mail and packages. the front control panel is a printed part !! i love the classic double train windows and here is a poc of the undeneath of the set. in conclusion i truly love these small sets: they are the perfect size (4 wide car yeay !!) and the colour pattern is amazing as well. i hope you enjoyed that review and do not hesitate to comment and ask pic requests if any ;-) *yoda*

4 great review yoda. thanks for sharing. i wasn't real fond of the postal truck at first. it's so different than those in the us. but after seeing your close-up images (esp. the back of the tuck), it looks really neat. i also like the mail box a lot. it looks good in red. too bad for the stickers, but it's still nice. the plane reminds me a lot of the design used in the jurassic park set. as you've said, it's similar to 80s designs. i really like the brick-built design too. it's just real lego - that's about all i can say. very nice sets that are a must together. thanks for the review.

4 excellent review. you convinced me to buy these two. could you tell me how much you payed for them? i think i'm gonna buy them tomorrow if they have it already (or if i don't see any cooler sets).

4 thanks for the great review *yoda* . i'm definitely going to get that plane, i've sadly only owned one of the many lego planes there is. :'-( thebrickster, on jan 5 2008, 11:23 am, said: i haven't spotted these in the us yet. i'm looking forward to finding them. overall, the 2008 line-up is a excellent and it's going to be difficult for me to decide which themes/sets to pursue. there's a lot to choose from. really? where do you live?

4 thanks for the takes on these two sets, yoda. stickers or not, i still think these are charming sets with all the essence and nostalgia of the older sets back in the 80/90's. am i the first one to notice the new doors used in the back of the van. not only is it using the popular new frame, but the old container doors have been redesigned to fit with the new frame as well. pity they're not yellow, though.

4 great review *yoda* (i find myself saying that line alot :-d ) i love these two little sets *wub* tlc continues the great city line that started in 07 and continues into 08 its also nice to have other sub lines besides fire and police :-| :-p i hope there are many more postal sets, like a post office!!that would be sweet! hope these are mainstream and not those damn exclusives >:-( postal on! p

2 thanks for the review! i was always going to get these two sets, so you haven't swayed me at all!! x-d i reckon lego could enhance this sub-theme by releasing a post motorbike (with or without a sidecar) and post office. obviouly the office would be the hub of all the activity, while the post bike would take care of the postal run. this would free up the van to take or recieve bulk mail or parcels to or from the airport. it could then also do the parcel deliveries around the city. the office would also serve as the reciever for all the parcels the new goods truck might deliver. just some thoughts, that's all!! *sweet*

2 while the plane does look nice, i don't particularly care for the van. but the van does have some good parts, which is the only reason i would by one: yellow mud guards, the new windshield, and the small door on the rear.

0 well first off, thanks yoda for the great review. :-) hmmm... well, i have to say, i'm not at all impressed with any of these sets. i mean, there nice and all, but the van just seems way to small. it would have been nice if you could fit more than one package in it. i guessi'm one of those that are more of the fan of the 6 wide trucks. and the plane.... hm. this has a "cute" factor and all, but i mean com'on... you have to open a hatch on the roof to get your packages in?? and what about getting them out? you have to flip the plane upside down? :-| weak. they should have had a hinged rear end or a hatch on the side.

2 thebrickster, on jan 5 2008, 10:12 am, said: i wasn't real fond of the postal truck at first. it's so different than those in the us. good point b... this design is just too foreign to my eyes for me to enjoy... i don't like either of these sets, very disapointing - the postal theme has so much potential. i don't really like the torsos either - too plain/cheap as kanal suggested. and i will agree that the wheels on the van look cheap. i was sooooo impressed with city 2007, this is a real let down. though, i am happy to see a small set with a postal box. so, even though, all that aside, i'll probably buy 6 of the van - just for the yellow mudgards, postal box and stickers to populate my city. and i think this set will provide some excellent piece to moc a yellow civillian convertable with *sweet* - bm

4 thanks for the review! i definitely plan on getting this one. thanks again! *sweet*

2 i didn't know that the other models in this set came with interiors. this changes everything!

4 thanks for the review. *sweet* this set is on my when-i-see-it-i-buy list! x-d

4 imperialshadows, on jan 7 2008, 03:20 pm, said: oh honey, be sure to wrench that chicken before it burns! *wacko* :-d :-d :-p thanks for a great laugh! good review of a good set, a real house with an actual staircase and a beautifully designed hinged window in the roof. i'll buy this.

4 thanks for this great review! i love this awesome set, the creator line never disappoints. this is definitely a must-buy for me, just like the other creator houses. batbrick something! *wacko*

4 takuto20, on mar 22 2008, 04:54 am, said: hey, yesterday i got around to mod my beachhouse too! i bought two boxes so i could have enough material for an extra floor and then i also added a kitchen, a vine in the backyard, storage for the upper floor... try to spot the humongous flatscreen tv! http://www.brickshel...96/cimg2656.jpg very nice... i guess i should buy a second one too.... *y*

4 looks like i'll need to buy another one i just started the garage (which is attached to the house) but i ran out of yellow bricks........... :'-( >:-( btw nice moc takuto20 *y* i might have to "steal" your idea and make a third story since its abit tight downstairs to fit everything.......ooo yea and i like your kitchen and the dishwasher :'-) ....... edited by darth_legois_619, 23 march 2008 - 11:00 pm.

4 thanks for the review dunamis, this is a great little set! i'm also very impressed with takuto20's mods. i've been trying a few of my own. i liked the tower block design, but a lot of stuff needed fixing. firstly i added a 4th wall, and made it so the storeys could be lifted off like in the other models. i also added flowers on the windowsills and doorways out on to the balconies. still to be added is an extra door for the top floor which i'm going to get from the new doors and windows pack. i added a chimney that goes all the way up the back of the house, and has a fireplace on every level. each floor is fully furnished with a fireplace, wash basin and bed on the upper levels... ...and a corner sofa and coffee table, plus an extra large fireplace on the ground floor. finally here is my idea of what to do with two copies of this set! all the parts pictured are from 2x 4996, except 5 extra fence panels and the minifigs. the house on the left has it's garden at the rear.

0 a big thumbs down for me. this doesn't look like lego at all :-| *n* *n* *n* *n* *n* out of *n* *n* *n* *n* *n*

0 review gets *y* *y* , ugly plane gets :-x. thanks for the review!

0 i have the big passenger plane so i'll be passing on this one. one big juniorised plane is enough for me! if i didn't have the passenger plane though i'd rather get the cargo plane. there's enough police in my city as it is!

0 daoudbazaar, on jan 17 2008, 05:21 pm, said: thks for this caustic review :-d i'll wait for the parts on bricklink. i think you're a bit unfair with this small oversized submarine - oups sorry, i mean plane. here are some advantages i tried to imagine : 1. that's the first submarine with a plane nose, 2. that's the first unprinted nose, 3. that's the first shark that make me laugh, and which has a plain white fin 4. and at last, you should have notice that that the first submarine with a wing made of several plates it is said that this set has more than 200 parts... hide and seek ! x-d you may have lost several bags i'm eager that people buy this set a lot : i'd like to buy a lot of these new white 4x4x2 curved slope for my mocs. can you take a picture of the plane crashing in the sink ? is it fire proof ? i think that will be too easy this year to decide what is the crap of year ... great comments, rofl, rofl, rofl. :-d :-d :-d concerning last sentence - i have seen or built hundreds of different sets issued since 1980 until now, but this plane is really a hot candidate not only for crap of the year, but for crap of the decade... last two days i thought about the sense of this set, and, finally, i was enlighted - i must call to my folks living in a small village, i am pretty sure, that they will be happy for a new house for their pullets. edited by kanal-k1, 17 january 2008 - 06:31 pm.

4 legoman132, on sep 11 2008, 06:26 pm, said: this still looks like a cool set but the price not so much. the price is now €20 in ireland on s@h, which is reasonable considering the large fuselage pieces. has anyone modded this set to make a reasonable looking plane? i am thinking of buy it to do so, but i don't want to take a risk and end up with lots of useless pieces. aswell as -€20.

4 an excellent first time (?) review iamded! *y* well, atleast a first time redman review anyway. i really enjoy redman, i hope to see him pop up more often. your pics are great now that you ditched the phone :-p , and you've shown the set from many different angles and perspectives. thanks for this brilliant review, you have certainly convinced me to get a few of these, and then some x-d redman on! edit: btw, is it just me, or does my new avatar make me seem a bit creepy? 8-| batbrick is back! >:-) edited by batbrick, 18 january 2008 - 12:39 pm.

4 great review iamded! lots of pics, all the details. wish i could find some of these sets locally, but so far no luck. :'-( i fully intend to steal your use of a character to do the reviewing, should i ever do one like this. x-d oh, and if eb news presents ever needs someone to do a commercial, we'll be sure to get in touch with you. *y* batbrick, on jan 18 2008, 07:36 am, said: btw, is it just me, or does my new avatar make me seem a bit creepy? 8-| are you sure it's the avatar doing it? 8-| :-d ;-)

2 very good reviews, i think that redman is really ok, a very little cute curious fig... sadly he is not in the impulse set... ;-) i wish to see redman still around about your creepy avatar, yes, it look a bit creepy *skull* nausicaakro (this impulse set is storage in 8 copies, with 8 wizard set, 16 city set (2x), 16 mission to mars set... so if you want buy 10 of this (like me) you must find 2 different toy center)

4 nice review, very detailed. *y* as for the spare parts, mine didn't come with any. both dark grey 1x1 round plates are used on the weapons rack (one for the armour, one for the helmet) and i only got one robot hand for holding weapons.

0 i would have purchased a few of these except for the fact that i do not like the new torso that they use.

4 thanks for this excellent review vader! it seems you are succumbing to the castle side of the force. i love the new helmet, and the new orc torso is fantastic as well, which is great to see that the troll faction has many ranks too. the troll himself i love, i agree with you in saying i prefer the sand green version. the battle wagon is cool, one of the better wagon designs, and the flag is a great touch which improves it. sadly the back is rather empty, but a few mods'll change that :-) and of course this set includes the infamous chicken pole! one pic request, if you have time vader, could you please post a few pics of the new helmet on its own, and on a human soldier please? batbrick is back! >:-)

4 those extra helmet pictures just seal how much i love those new helmets *wub* they look so great.

4 thanks for the review! i love this set! it's a cheap way to get green trolls, and i love the new helmet, it looks great and i think it will be very usefull for other factions as well. *sweet* dnl

0 a troll driven by a turkey leg, what a wonderful little detail!!! :-d :-d thanks for the review vader. very clever, using a flag to hide that crazy firing device. i find it rather odd they used blue pins for this. black or gray would've been alot more discrete. about the big trolls, i think using different colours is good. i don't think a troll force would be very organized, so different colours would make the effect complete *y* . as for your troops, looks quite fearsome! definitely compared to my pathetic number of soldiers.. :-$ a nice set, but i would rather get the attack on tower though.. no matter about the price difference.

2 thefrisian, on jan 20 2008, 03:04 pm, said: am i the only one who thinks this helmet looks a bit like the juggernaut from x-men? now you menton it i think you are right, that really would work well as a film version *y*

4 tks for the review mate ;-) now i have to bloody wait long because lego france has this line available in freaking march >:-( pissed *yoda* on !! :-d i love the "new" goblin :-p that helmet is really cool. why on earth tlc didn't include that one in the dwarf mine ? such another idiotic move |-/ anyone keeping track of tlc's stupidity lately ? that would be interesting !! i clearly want a huge goblin army now hehe !! and i totally agree with you mate, the troll lokks better in sand green. the cart itself is pretty lame imo - just a sordid excuse to include yet another annoying shooting crappy device. but for a 21? set its okie i say ;-) need my bad guys on !! *yoda*

4 the forklift is amazing, and nice design of the opening side doors aswell. thanks for the review, i may actually pick this one up ;-)

4 wow, 8-? great review. *y* i usually don't buy city sets but i think i might get this one just for that awsome forklift! *wub* general tarful

2 thats fine, as its not a neccesity. and thanks for the piece #. edit: hmm...that's interesting, i just bricklinked it and it is not cataloged yet, oh well edited by ricecracker, 22 january 2008 - 03:47 am.

4 greetings, and welcome to another redman review! i'm your host, redman, and today i adorn my medieval outfit to tell you about the impulse set simply titled "the knight". no wait, that's the old script. x-d i mean, "the good wizard". *sweet* the other castle impulse set (the first being 'the knight'), this is a wonderful, and in my case unexpected addition to the castle line! i did not expect to get a nice good wizard, but rather another plain white skellie for the impulse, and was pleasantly surprised when i saw the first picture of this set. the impulse sets give you pieces you wouldn't expect to see in such small sets, for example, the knight came with the armour, and this comes with an owl, a gem, and a crystal ball piece. it comes with 11 pieces, including the wand, owl, and gem, and no spares, which doesn't really matter as it doesn't need any. the box sports the set number, age range (which i blissfully ignore x-d), awesome castle logo, and the assembled set, with the usual 1:1 scale picture of a minifig. the back of the box shows pictures of the boxed skeleton tower and king's castle siege sets. note the price is in new zealand dollars, and is really the same prica as any other impulse set. next are the instructions, which are separated into 3 parts, 1 for the minifigure, 1 for the table, and one for the bird stand. very simple, also worth mentioning is the parts numbers are next to their respective parts, for replacement parts etc. on the back we see (on the top half) pictures of skeleton prison carriage, skeleton tower, and king's castle siege, this time not of the boxed sets, but the sets themselves. on the lower half we have 8 pictures, each of the different impulse sets. the wizard's torso is plain sand blue, with no patterns or anything, but it doesn't really matter is his beard's in the way. ;-) the head is that same old 'white fade to grey beard' head, but the white beard covers up most of the grey. my favourite part is the pants, i love that we're getting printed belts and legs again. his belt has 4 gold crosses (as seen in, if you look closely, the new crownie's torso and the crownie archer's torso) and a belt buckle, and the legs have a bottle, a coin, and a small bag. nice little wizard-ey items. the, er, items, no, accessories, no, models? the stuff in the set include a little stand for the owl, and a table utilising the new 4x4 round piece in light bley, with the crystal ball in the middle, encasing the yellow gem held on by a 2x2 circle piece in blue. why blue, i'm not sure. maybe it's because the crystal is yellow, and the crownie's colours are blue and gold, so the blue piece with the yellow crystal symbolise the crownie's colours. or maybe tlc just felt the need to include an odd colour. :-p in conclusion, this is a wonderful set, with some neat accessories, and it doesn't really need to be bought in the masses, after all, you needs an army of owls and wizards? :-| :-p so it works fine as a single set, and adds a more fantasy feel to your crownie army. that's all for today folks! *sweet* [/redman] thanks for reading another of my redman interviews, any suggestions on how to/what to do to improve it is greatly appreciated, as are all comments and criticisms (except those blatant thoughtless criticisms that don't help at all :-p)! ~peace edited by kimt, 10 august 2008 - 01:31 pm.

4 nice review, your camera is much better now. i look forward to more of your reviews :-) i just went to toyworld today and got a wizard and 4 knights :-) and on top of that, they were having a 20% off sale *sweet* i might go back and get some more tommorrow. the wizard is pretty good, and comes with some good parts (owl, beard, legs, hat, round table, crystal ball..). it would be nicer if he had a torso with printing on it, but i can understand why they didn't.

4 amperzand, on jan 21 2008, 03:56 am, said: i'm not blaming you guys. ;-) the op in this thread should, at the very least, have linked to the existing thread about this set on this board. |-/ why? its his review, and a very good one at that, i don't see why he needed to link anything. be glad that he was kind enough to take the time to write up this review. now we have two different opinions on a set, which is great, there is no need for him to give credit to you, its his review :-) batbrick is back! >:-)

0 blueandwhite, on jan 21 2008, 10:15 am, said: not bad. i could see picking up a couple of these guys along with a few of the new knights. i actually prefer the wizard as these impulse items are simply too expensive for army building (imo). later. same, thats why ill probly only get the wizard because they are quite expensive if you compare them to the $2 ones i used to get back around 2000 and you got about the same peices aswell. :-/

4 well, since no-one seems to have done one for this set, here we go.... here's the complete set in all its glory. yes, i really like it, but then, tabletown has the capacity to support it and my green army have their eyes on it as a potential military transport as well. :-) i'll start out with the little airport ground car thingy - very neat and functional, here are views front and back: next up, the steps which allow the plane crew to embark and disembark: and to round off this little trio, the cargo loading platform, here in its lowered position. note the prong thingy sticking out from the rear: and here raised. the prong thingy is now hinged up to support the back of the platform and keep it level: here's a slightly different angle so you can see the pieces under there: the all-important cargo itself! hmmm...not much for a plane this size... the cargo pallet slots neatly onto the loading platform: here's the complete set of ground equipment - all attached: and so onto the plane itself. note that unlike the other large planes, the main wing sits at the top of the row of bricks making up the side of the fuselage: i took it apart a little so you can see the internal construction of the fuselage. note that the cargo area is really small, right at the back. what else is this thing carrying? illegal immigrants? :-) a picture of the rear of the fuselage, just because i like the sticker: front landing gear. way better than on the other large planes. i don't know if this is a new piece or what but i've had no problems with it at all, and my kids have been playing with it as well: the rather sexy rear undercarriage - this area reminds me of one of those giant russian transport planes - wicked: those angled grey slopes atop each side of the rear undercarriage annoy the heck out of me as they keep coming off whenever i pick the plane up. i think a 1x4 plate on top to bind them together might solve that. a slightly blurry view (sorry) from underneath. the gear looks like it might be capable of retracting internally, but alas, no. this is a shame as there's certainly enough room in there and it's a wasted opportunity imo. might have to modify that... a view of one of the four engines, i personally think they look too small and should have something under the wing as well to make them rounder: cockpit: crew door, open. i love the smooth action of these doors and the way they seal flush against the fuselage when closed: cargo door, open: crew door with docked ladder: cargo door with docked loading platform: cargo slots inside and locks into place the same way it sits on the loader, neat: the minifigs, sorry this one is a bit blurry: and that concludes this week's "show and tell". dr. s.

4 i do admit the amount of cargo is rediculously small, but it still looks good. say, how much can the plane hold? thanks for the review! *sweet*

2 thanks for the review and pics dr s! i am still considering this set. what is the instruction manual number?

2 sinner, on feb 4 2008, 11:51 pm, said: thanks for the review and pics dr s! i am still considering this set. what is the instruction manual number? there are two - hopefully these are the numbers you need: 4525919 4525920 ? dr. s.

2 thank you very much for a good and informative review, doc sinister. *y* this looks like the best of the bigplanes to me, very nice and smoother than the rest. :'-) although, like you?ve said, what the heck?re they transporting, diamonds and pearls? so much wasted space.... and the landing gear should really fold in. *n*

0 i loved the pics in the catalogues but was a bit disappointed by the build and end result. my own thoughts: cons: - as noted, the cargo space is really small considering the size of the plane, although i can see this is restricted due to playability - without the barrier in the middle, the cargo would slide all over the place while the plane was being swooshed - the cargo 'lift' (i'm not sure how else to describe it) is very weak and snaps off, although it is a clever design i think it's badly implemented - there is nothing to hold the cargo pallet to the cargo lift truck so it tends to slide off all over the place as soon as the truck moves - colour issues - i had at least 3 shades of green with the larger plane pieces and noticeable variances even with identical cargo hatch pieces. at least one of them also came quite scratched, which was a little disappointing - at $79.95 aud it's $10 more than the passenger plane was with less pieces and figs, and no printed pieces whatsoever! more $ for less, methinks. pros: - lots of nice cargo crate pieces and even the stickers for these are pretty good. - landing gear piece adjusts very well to height differentials so the plane doesn't lose its gear as often as the earlier passenger planes - the hinging mechanism works very well to open the cargo holds - opens very smoothly and is not noticeable - i'd definitely like to see more of this technique - the little vehicles work well chained together and are all good small designs overall: - i really like the large planes since 06 but i don't think they've still quite hit the nail on the head. whereas the earlier planes were a little flimsy, this one is sturdier but has its own issues. the look of the cargo plane is nice, and the new landing piece and cargo hatch pieces are really great, but some design weaknesses and colour issues detract from the overall product. it's a shame as with a bit of tweaking this could have been a must-have set.

4 wow, that's a great review of a great set dr s! *y* as you yourself have already noted, this has the potential to be a fantastic military moc! with a bit of modification you can get the engines to be rounder, or perhaps do away with them completely and replace them with jet engines. *sweet* though i can't think of a system to retract the undercarriage at the top of my head it seems like there's indeeed more than enough potential to do so. it reminds me rather of an ilyushin il-76, one of my favourite cargo planes. :'-)

2 thanks for the review, i like the looks of the set but i'm not sure about it still. is it work ?35? would you recomend buying it?

4 cardinal brick, on feb 5 2008, 08:49 pm, said: thanks for the review, i like the looks of the set but i'm not sure about it still. is it work ?35? would you recomend buying it? well, i can only speak for myself - i like it. worth ?35.00? well, it's a big box for that amount of money, but full of big parts of course. i dunno - could do with being cheaper, but then i'm sure we all think that of our favourite hobby. ?30.00 would be nearer the mark imo. dr. s.

2 if i do end up geting this set it will be for my slowly growing army. btw nice review *y*

2 tks for your great review pirnha ;-) piranha, on feb 8 2008, 05:09 am, said: first off we have our hero, indian............. what the hell? why is there a freaking cw anakin head on indy!! there was a production slip up as instead of indy's head i get anakin's! :-| |-/ i open the box up and there staring me in the face is his ugly face!! g another production error >:-( at least we know they manufacture licenses sets in the same place :-d did that happpen to any of you guys ? piranha, on feb 8 2008, 05:09 am, said: cool fig 8-? will need to make one like that for keeps (will change me from having indy numerous times :-d ) *yoda*

2 that is the one of the oddest mistakes i have ever heard of! :-d even so, you have to admit that it is good news for you; lego will hapily give you the right head if you ask. thanks for the review. i have this set too. *wub*

4 nice review, all the important stuff is there. weird cock-up by tlc to put an ani face on indy... i didn't encounter any mistakes in my four indy sets. great selfmade temple of doom indy fig, piranha! so uhm... has anyone found out yet what the extra hieroglyphic stickers are for?

2 supremecommmandergrievous, on feb 9 2008, 11:32 am, said: i have noticed that at my local tlc store (orlando) they have this set in a glass case on display...with the cw anakin head on indy. i did not realize this was such i widespread problem. i saw this review on s@h.... quote "in lego world we're all detail conscious, right? our set(really my 8-yr-old son's) came with the wrong head for indiana jones! thin eyebrows, no five o'clock shadow, lots of red scars...really hard for him to get into the character. everything else is great - especially the falling wall and snake trap!" i might get this set today. i hope i dont have this problem! 8-| dp8

4 thanks for a nice review, piranha. *y* a lovely playset, with a classical egyptian adventurers touch. although i?m not completely sure for the robot arms for the statues.... somehow, a little more details could?ve worked well for that set.... 8-|

4 i got mine today! x-d i too got an anakin clone wars head, although i'm not really complaining since i already have an indy head from the motorcycle chase set. it is really odd that they would pack in such a different looking head though. also, for those that think the head has no use, try placing it under one of the braided new brown dwarf beards. it looks pretty nice, i think! *y* on the set, it's wonderful! the hieroglyphic stickers are wonderful, marion (especially her head and hair) is wonderful, and the anubis statues are nice too. there's also lots of nice tan parts, such as 20 round 2x2s, and 8 1x8 bricks. all in all, it's a great set for the price, and i can't wait to get race for the stolen treasure and temple escape now! *sweet*

2 thanks for the review, stealth hunter. *y* that truck looks better than i expected, and it?s for sure a pretty playable set. nice, but still too much police mayhem to me. i think the new police station?ll satisfy all my safety needs.... :-)

2 i like the new station but the truck is a good question. i still like the classic 1994 one and the 1980's can that was one of the first units i got

2 it looks to me that the little building is supposed to be like some sort of customs checkpoint between one nation and another or like a toll facility on a highway. i like the little checkpoint but i think that should be part of a separate set and 7743 just having the police mobile command center truck.

4 great review, batbrick! iamded got what he deserved. x-d

4 thank you very much for a fine review, batbrick. *y* what the.... i never realized these cool grey barrels till now.... that?s pretty interesting. :-) the whole chopper looks very good, with a well fitting power function. it?s for sure a rewardable work to change that baby into a real mf version with accessible cockpit. :'-)

4 i am definitely getting this set. thanks for the nice review!

0 i wish i could just get those grey barrels alone, the rest of the set doesnt really intreigue me much :-$ thanks for the review.

4 haha your review are so funny and so lego cool

4 i really like this set... even though i was hoping for a mini-motor! :-d chock full of great parts too. thanks for the review. *sweet*

4 thanks guys, heres the final part: the instructions for the boat begin on page 46: the overall set, its actually much nicer than i thought it would be, the pictures on the box make it look ugly. top view, tommy guns do not actually come with set ;-) side view, the designers have done an excellent job with the hull, considering the lack of many slopes pieces. you can see it is pretty much minifig scale too: here you can see that by pushing in the red technic axle, the "anchor" on the front will be hauled back into the boat: back view, these outboard motors are pretty cool, though i wish they could go own into the water more: overall, though the weakest model, its still a lot of fun, and has a clever way around the lack of a shapely hull. i was impressed with it after the building it, it even has two rounded snotty bottom pieces on the nose of the boat to give the impression it is speeding through the water with the front lifting up. lots of leftover pieces for this one: the pieces: sorry about the poor photograph there, it was getting late :-$ overall the cargo chopper is another great set in the fantastic creator line. loads of fun, great play, and some clever designs, it challenges you to make your own things, and even includes some nifty pieces (bley barrels! *wub* ) i won't give it a rating, but i'll just say i certainly recommend it to fans of the theme and lego fans in general. now, finally, iamded and i teamup in the face of a larger foe. get that lord of pies! batbrick away! >:-)

4 thank you for your wonderful review! ) i was done very well.... ) i suggest that you will find "two-face's escape" set a very interesting one to build.... it also provides great playability and is not very expensive for what you will get. ) good day to you. )

4 thanks for the review aayla, i love this set and its great to see another person interested in batman. now all you have to do is start watching the movies, then the cartoon series, then the comics, then the......... x-d i really recommend two-face's escape as well, a great set for a great price. and btw, the green dude as you call him is named killer croc, he is a killer with a freakish skin condition. batbrick away! >:-)

4 it is a tie between two face's escape and the batcave... but i would go with the cave... over 1000 pieces, nifty submarine, penguins, alfred, mr freeze, and and and.... it is wonderful...! especially for 38?!! :-) ol' style batman on! (yep, this is a lil' rant on 2008 batman.. :-p )

4 6258 smuggler's shanty overview smuggler's shanty was released in 1992, it consisted of 69 pieces, 3 minifigs (two pirates, one imperial) and it cost $9.25 (usd). the set itself is a small but rather sturdy den for the pirates! review: the minifigs consist of two pirates and one imperial. the minifigs are not all that rare, which is disappointing, i would of liked a rarer fig! but still it is a good cheap source of pirate and imperial figures. here is an overall shot of the set, which includes the three figs, the shanty which is made using palm leaves pieces, and a nice grey shark nibbling at the soldier's oar. a close up of the soldier rowing hard in his boat. i would have preferred to have a normal soldier with shako hat, as i have more officers than normal soldiers now!: and a close up snap of the main structure. note the wine glass, which was a nice touch! funnily enough, only 4 pieces of treasure were included in this set, compared to the usual 8 gold coins in other sets. a view from the back, which also gives a good view of the pieces used to construct the shanty mainly simple black 1 by 1 bricks: the shanty looks good from most angles but their are a few where the roof construction looks rather odd, but that is just a minor nitpick! yet another view from the front,, this time at a slightly different angle. the yellow base plate looks rather nice too, i prefer it over the tan pieces we trend to get nowadays: "attack!!" the stupid drunk pirate in the background does not even notice! overall i think this is a rather good set, despite some shortcomings, such as the lack of treasure and odd roof from some angles. the shark, imperial soldier and useful parts make up for it, and of course the price is cheap on most auction sites, i got mine for a mere ?5 ($10), with the cheapest price on bricklink being $8. rate the set then leave your comments, thoughts and opinions!!!

2 first i'll comment on the review and at a later date i'll comment on the set. you've done a top job lord of pies *y* you've captured the set from a variety of angles and posed the mini-figures interestingly.

4 very nice review, lord of pies! thanks for taking the time to put this together, and especially for all the detailed pics. *y* i very much regret that my dark ages occured when they did. basically, i missed out on all the cheap and easy troop building sets, and this one is certainly no exception. the big sets are nice, but these are the ones that always make me wish just a little harder for a return of lego pirates... :'-) i gave it a 4 out of 5, just because i'd buy 4 out of 5 sitting on the shelves today, were it possible.

4 simonwillems, on feb 19 2008, 07:47 pm, said: nice poll as well, but you made sure nobody can give this set a 1 which is very nice (but probably a little mistake :-d ). i gave it the top-rating. *y* so i have, oops! i never was very good at maths. :-p

4 another first-rate review! it's a nice little set with a big number of minifigs. and 2 flintlock guns is also a nice bonus.

4 a very nice review of a pretty and neat little set, thanks lord of pies, guess it´s a 3 for me, with strong tendencies to 4....

4 first of all excellent review! 5/5 for me. i have yet to attain one of these sets. it has a nice trio of men including a redcoat, and a nice assortment of weapons. the rest, such as the leaves, is great for mocing. imperialshadows, on feb 19 2008, 08:41 pm, said: i gave it a 4 out of 5, just because i'd buy 4 out of 5 sitting on the shelves today, were it possible. if i saw 5 of these sitting on a shelf i would certainly buy all 5, then i would ask to speak with a manager to see if there is any way i can attain more pirate lego stuff. simonwillems, on feb 19 2008, 08:47 pm, said: nice poll as well, but you made sure nobody can give this set a 1 which is very nice (but probably a little mistake :-d ). i gave it the top-rating. one should not step into the pirates domain and give a mere 1 to any non4+ pirate set. duke

2 woow :d this was my first lego set ever!

4 this set shows the awesomeness of classic pirate sets. i really have to get me some more! xd great review on a great set!

2 well since this topic has resurfaced, i would add my 2 cents about my appreciation of this set. it was the first and (unfortunately) the largest pirate set i owned as a kid, but i played the wazoo out of it. some of the minifigs have lost almost all their face printing after so many play sessions! theres just something about the hut that appealed to me more than the cheesy skull-face islands we keep getting.probably that it wa kind of neutral, good for my pirates, settlers or islanders. though the palm leaves were rather fragile and used to break off the studded parts. it would be nice to get more of these "beach village army builder" sets. edited by ardelon, 21 september 2014 - 03:40 pm.

4 tks for that nice review, brainbox! i recieved the construction diggers set like this last year. gee what a nice parts pack. i like that orange lidded set, the truck. so nice. i won't get it though.

2 why not? they are all very nice (i have all six of them), especially the helicopter, my least anticipated, but one of the most detailed!! thanks for the review brainbox!!

4 thanks for these great reviews brainbox, i never expected you to do a review for some reason. i love these mini sets, the train in particular is great. i won't get any though, those indy sets are coming in fast and i'm gonna need all the money i can muster. still they are nifty little sets. batbrick away! >:-)

4 brainbox, on feb 20 2008, 02:55 pm, said: you're welcome guys. :-d sorry, that just made me laugh. i did some research and re-read tyour review. i will pick this up this weekend. quote yeah, so do i. they really were a neat idea. i had all the x-pods. they were awesome. i haven' collected all of these though.

4 so here it is finally, my first ever review of a lego set..oh wait, it's actually 2 sets. so i don't really know how to do it right, but i'll try the best. (sorry if some pictures are a litte bit dark, but i'm not really into photography and i got bad light here) let's start with the dwarf's mine defender: theme: castle 2008 set name: dwarf's mine defender number: 7040 pieces: 86 price: ?9,99 (eur) first, as always, the box: the back, a few instructions on how the defender works, for those how don't know ;-) : and the instructions: we continue with the minifigs, sorry i forgot to make a closeup of the dwarf: and finally the mine defender itself, i personally think it isn't as bad as maybe some people think. the chain for the catapult is great i think: i kinda love those controls, the mechanism with the rubbe rband actually works pretty well, but only on a not-glossy underground. that's pretty much all of it, it's small but i like it a lot. so let's go on to the tower raid now, which would be my absolute favorite of those new sets. -------------------------------------- theme: castle 2008 set name: tower raid number: 7037 pieces: 364 price: ?29,99 (eur) again, first the box & instructions: we got 2 sets of instructios here, one for the tower and one for the siege tower: the minifigs, we got one archer and one soldier here, both with the torsos of the 2007 sets: now thw orc side, starting with the great leader, with the new armor and the golden helmet (i love those pieces!): closeup of the armor & helmet: then we got another orc-knight: and the prisoner, with handcuffs! the crownie tower looks great overall, though there is something i don't really like about it, but later on that. now the back, and that is what really bothers me, there areno walls on the first floor except the one with the wall-piece and the door, and theprison also is open at the back. the orc easily could jump out there: not sure what these are all about, they really don't add much to the set: enough rant now, let's go on with a pretty sweet detail, the golden crystal on the little table: the wall piece on the first floor you can ram in: and finally the very best thing of this set, the amazing orc siege tower! from the front: the great working ram, you can pull it back very far and it got pretty much power: here we got another sweet detail, the siege "platform" that moves out by pulling a cord in the back of the tower: finally a picture of a bit siege action: if you ram in the lower wallpiece, the brown shelfs of the prison-floor collapse and the prisoned orc is finally free! summary: likes: as i mentioned before, i really think that's the best ever produced siege tower, it's got so mich details and works extremely well, also the overall look of it is magnificant. the destroy-mechanism of the tower is pretty cool too, the brown door is a fine detail too. nothing much to say about the mine defender, i like this little set, and there's nothing really to bother about it. dislikes: the back of the tower. that's really the only thing that's a bit bad imo, they could have put there 2 more walls on the first floor and something to lock the prison easily. final thought: the tower raid for me personally is the best of the 2008 sets so far, it's got great playability and looks simply good. my opinion: buy it!

4 thank you for these fine reviews, metalandi. *y* there?re really some nice playable features in the tower raid set, and all these great orc torsos, just sweet! and it even looks like that black orc-armor?s a new piece, lovely.... :'-)

4 thanks for these great reviews! *sweet* the dwarfs mine defender looks interesting, the figs though are *wub* the only thing missing is a weapon for the dwarf and some shields the battering ram and tower are awesome! 8-? the troll king with new torso, helmet, and body armor is simply amazing i like how the troll is handcuffed :-d the tower shows nice detail except for the poor "brig" . i love that gold crystal! the battering ram is a thing of beauty! $30 for the tower and ram and $10 for the defender are very well priced! i still want the battle wheel more though! damn exclusives! :'-( >:-( p

4 thanks for the review, i personally think the siege tower is probably the best one which lego has ever produced.

4 well, i don't think orcs are that sturdy, seeing that they'd have to jump from the second level of the tower, i don't see survival as his chief objective! :-p awesome review! i'm loving these sets more and more! the tower raid is definitely the best and the cheapest set there! >:-) oh, and pirhana, it's not really a 'king', it's more like an officer. remember, the wizard rules these goblins! edited by trooperdavinfelth, 22 february 2008 - 02:49 pm.

4 the rancor, on apr 22 2008, 05:54 am, said: i perfer using the batle wheel to knock down the tower's walls, not the seige tower i love all the siege machines the orcs have, they are certainly a much bigger threat than the skellies. batbrick away!

2 yeah, the open towers are kinda funny, although they were also typical of (for instance) 90s pirate sets. the trolls' vehicles are cool though. they look evil. i can't wait to start collecting '08 castle sets...(i didn't buy any castle in '07, i only got one set for xmas, so i'm catching up on the '07 stuff first before it's all sold out)

4 very nice. very nice, indeed. lots of lovely, little details, even at the back. this review hasn't changed my opinion one bit, i'm still looking forward to when i can finally pick up mine at the post office. i'm crossing my fingers that there will be more buildings following after this one. i'm guessing that lego's just testing the waters to see how far afol's are willing to go regarding price vs. details. green grocer is still epic, though.

4 for some silly (and quite delusional) reason i thought that i had a chance to review this first... :-d but yours is at your house, and mine is (hopefully) winging it's way to me... :'-) thanks for the review! it will help me survive until mine arrives. i love this set. *wub* hopefully there will be many more stunning sets like this to come. *sweet* xwingyoda, on mar 8 2008, 08:03 pm, said: i didn't know green grocer had a rodent infestation !! neither did i and i have looked through the instructions at least three times... :-$

4 man, these sets are so awesome. incredible work done by the designers there, must have took a long time to get all this ogether. if they weren't too expensive i would go and buy them all 3 right away *wub*

4 damn it ! what a great great review ! i definitly love this set !!!! burn credit card, burn ! you're the must in there dunamis ! many thanks !

4 a very fine review with great and informative pictures, thanks dunamis! *y* and what a wonderful set, a masterpiece and far beyond everything i would?ve expected just one year ago.... the amount of details is exceptional, from the different railings to the mousehole and the radiator.... sheer brilliant. :'-) and two female mfs (or hippies, you never know....) and a child.... only one adult male character who nearly looks like.... well, anyways. it?s simply a milestone, and a very creative and inspiring beauty. *wub* easter parade on! and, sweet gg.... will you marry me? :-$

4 :-) amazing!!! great review!!! :-d u have totalyl convinced me to get this set! its so wonderful, filled with great details. what a waste, i can't order it in s@h because i am from singapore :'-( i hope it will come to my country, so i am able to buy it!!! :-)

2 afol sf, on mar 8 2008, 06:29 pm, said: a very informative review, indeed. thank you so much for doing so. now i know that the price is worth every penny leaving my pocket. ;-) what do you guys think is tlc putting up as the next modular set? is it asking too much of tlc to produce 1 modular set each quarter (4 times a year)? i would vote for a bank next.

4 i?ve got something, i want to share with you. a beautiful dream came true: #1: the box: top: back: the alternate model is also very well done. the pneumatics dump the bucket and open the flap (?). open: you can see a diagram how the pneumatics work. just a happy kid playing. the plastic inlays (?): all: #2: the parts: as you can see, 8854 offers a very large variety of different parts. loads of technic bricks, gears and even plates. also note the threaded axle 10, 5 large pulleys, a big turntable and the 1x20 rack. #3: building: the mechanism for the outriggers and the rotation of the turntable: the turntable: the pneumatics are finished: the mechanism for the telescope: the finished model: #4 random shots: you can see how the turntable will be rotated. thanks for reading- erm? viewing the pictures! please comment if you want to!

4 wow, another old technic set review by you. nice set, and thanks for that review.

2 cp5670, on mar 10 2008, 05:53 am, said: the old tubes also grip the nozzles much more firmly and if you aren't careful when removing them, it's actually possible to rip off the nozzles completely. x-o i actually noticed that while taking it apart but didn't really pay any attention. i just thought that's because it's an old part. well, thanks for the information!

4 as i bought it, i didn't even know i would also get a box. it just said: all parts with building instructions. after opening the parcel i was like: "woah... woooaaahhh" and so on. ;-) i love lego-boxes because as a child i stood in the toy stores starring at the boxes, only seeing the front and the back, nothing more. this brings back some memories... :'-)

4 thank you very much for that review!

4 this was my first technic set, aged 7! still a great one in terms of function density, and a great b-model. in the uk i'm certain it was called the "salvage hoist".

4 this set is really cool. i might actually get it!

4 ah a good old retro review. those old school days had some pretty impressive sets, with alot more complexity than modern sets. if you have it may i recommend 8880?

0 the only original stickers are the front headlight-patterns on the 2 red 1x2 bricks. the others have been destroyed - must have been the bad decaying sticker quality that breaks when you'll remove it - so i printed them. i didn't print the flag for only the alternate model needs it, although it's a neat idea...! and lordgalewind: clickey! i keep that in mind. one of my 8880 is already dusty enough!

0 i've seen a few cases like this where the box pictures are slightly different from the actual model. the airtech claw rig compressor is another one that comes to mind. the changes sometimes seem pointless and make you wonder why they bothered. :-p quote the only original stickers are the front headlight-patterns on the 2 red 1x2 bricks. the others have been destroyed - must have been the bad decaying sticker quality that breaks when you'll remove it - so i printed them. i didn't print the flag for only the alternate model needs it, although it's a neat idea...! the other stickers on mine have held up pretty well, although i didn't try to remove them after i put them on. the flag started to break after a year or so and just fell off its axle at one point. i taped over it and it's holding up well now, although it's a little frayed along one edge. this is actually the earliest set i've seen that uses this crappy sticker material (which is unfortunately very common today). even other technic sets had good stickers for many years after that.

2 blakbird, on mar 10 2008, 09:35 pm, said: hey, why do you only review sets which are red? :-d i exactly thought that today as i made the pics for my signature...! x-d at my school leaving examination i made a model in blender3d and explained to the board of examiners how to build a car and how to animate it. it needed a color, so i took red "because all beautiful and fast cars are red..." my physics teacher contradicted. :-)

4 a neat review of a cool set with very informative pictures, thanks bernddasbrot! *y*

4 i can remember that i've seen a few color variations on brickshelf and on ebay (they sold well). it's new and familiar at the same time. that makes it more interesting!

4 i also happened to receive this set this weekend, virtually misb (the seals on the side of the box were loose, however everything inside was untouched). this little beast a joy to build and even more so to play with! as indicated by eric on the technicopedia page, it's crammed with functions for a medium-sized set. i think i love it even more than my son does

4 hello, my dear friends! here's something new. i am actually making a review with pictures! yes, i got a new camera for christmas. now i was testing to see how the camera would reflect, so some of the pics are a bit blurry. i have based this review from dunamis's reviews. he is my inspiration.so, without further ado, i bring you the review! set #: 7693 name: etx alien strike price: $19.99, ?12,99 pieces: 246 box: okay, so as you can see below, the box is pretty simple. as always, european versions won't have the piece count, name, etc, just the number i believe. mine, having the american version, has the info on it. as you can see, it has the classic mm logo, and the red planet, as well as the set in a pose itself. very nice. i linked it because the pic wasn't resizing. http://www.brickshel...ke/dscn0017.jpg below is the back of the box. it shows the other sets and some features of this set. contents: next we have the contents. this set includes a medium sized dss (xwingyoda), a bag labeled one, and huge bag labeled two, the 1 bag contains a smaller bag, and the two bag includes two smaller bags. 5 bags in all. also pictured are the instructions. i have linked it due to the non-resize. http://www.brickshel...ke/dscn0019.jpg figs: included in this set are three figs. two jellies, and 1 astro. the jeelies are fine, but i pefer the lom ones. but they glow. those new alien commanders for summer look promising though. the astro is nice, and includes an extra gold visor. moc on! astro miner: in all mm sets there is a human and alien set. the astro par of this set is a mini-miner. here is a pic of construction and that wonderful space logo sticker. not much of a cockpit. :-/ finished miner(the set number, too): overall i like the miner, and it is nicely designed. i feel the cockpit is lacking though. aliens: the alien vehical is the main part of the set. this pic shows the beginning steps. solid and sturdy. but those four axles/pin parts(blue) are pointless. no support, and they don't get used at all. nice tlc. :-| now we get cooking! this pic shows the tail added on and the more bulk being built. we get a little repetitive and build the craft up in this pic. and this pic from the instructions shows how the alien craft transforms for battle. the completed set and extra bits. parts: 8/10 figs 8/10 price per piece ration: 9/10 playability: 9/10 overall: 85% the alien craft is great. the attack feature is nice and there are a ton of trans green parts. the alien falls out of the cockpit when turned upside down. i love this set, and it's perfect for mm fans or beginners.it has nice parts, and read the above part for more details. gallery when moderated. keep an eye out for future reviews! please comment. :-)

0 a nice review, well done! *y* the set itself doesn?t look quite interesting to me, compared with some of the newer ones like 7647 or 7648.... the way the driver fits into the cockpit looks not very clever and pretty uncomfortable as well.... x-d

4 sweet first pic review! *y* i got this set for a birthday present last year, and it is pretty fun overall. the alien ship in this set is actually one of my favorites. it just looks cool, and the way you can fold it out is really clever. the only negative for me is the cockpit of the mining unit. not really because it isn't detailed, but because mine is top heavy, and keeps falling forward. it's kinda funny if you think about him driving along and then falling forward...but not funny at all when you're playing. |-/

4 well, as bad a concept aliensvshumans is for a theme... i really do like this set. the human rover has nice parts for reuse, especially those oldschool space wheels. and despite those wobbly wings, i really like the alien ship. goes from a flying saucer-ish shape to a spread winged almost raven shape, very ominous and cool looking. now that 'alien commander' is terrible... if i don't buy bionicle minifigs already, why would i be interested in that thing? kinda wish they'd take the drones from the retiring exoforce theme and do them in green, they'd make nice alien robot things...

4 a great review for a great set. *sweet* i too own it and it's still in one piece. ;-) kliq, on mar 13 2008, 05:20 am, said: the only negative for me is the cockpit of the mining unit. not really because it isn't detailed, but because mine is top heavy, and keeps falling forward. it's kinda funny if you think about him driving along and then falling forward...but not funny at all when you're playing. |-/ may i suggest this mod?: http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=2848762

4 great review! thanks for taking the time. i'm glad to see another reviewer out there as there are a lot of sets to cover. nicely done.

4 toa_of_justice, on mar 21 2008, 08:10 am, said: that looks like a very nice set! :-) in your opinion, how does it compare to the current dune buggy? -toa of justice imho, 8829 is much better than 8296. first, 8829 is a lot bigger. i really like the huge rear balloon tires. they both have rack and pinion steering, and they both have trailing arm rear suspension with a v-2 engine. i think the body on 8829 is a little more well done. for 8296, i think the alternate tractor model is much better. for more comparisons, see technicopedia. eric

2 blakbird, on mar 22 2008, 09:49 pm, said: one thing i noticed is that a bunch of your pictures are missing the beam that goes over the left hand wheel as a fender. oh no. i forgot to put it back. i wanted to make a photo with this beam alone... 8-| blakbird said: what kind of camera do you use? the pictures have very good depth of field, meaning that both the foreground and the background are in good focus. this is usually hard to do without a very small aperture. the camera belongs to my dad. it's a panasonic lumix dmc-fz30eg: blakbird said: one of them works well mated with an 8 tooth on parallel axles, and the other one doesn't. the difference is only supposed to be longer teeth, so it really should not matter, but it does. if your set works bad, try switching the crown gear to one of the other variety. worked for me. wow! you're right! never thought of that! thanks! i made a scan (!) of those two gears: you can notice the longer teeth (first pic). edited by bernddasbrot, 23 march 2008 - 03:03 pm.

4 hello all apologize for digging out a such old post. recently i got a bag of lego technic parts where there have been mixed three sets: 8858, 8829 and 8235 the resurrection of 8858 has been described by me in a separate post. going back to the dune buggy – when i saw it for the first time back in 1994 i did not like it, as i was always big fan of 8840 (which i consider to the day the best looking buggy) and set 8829 looked to me ugly. so there were those all parts in the bag… then i though why not build it ? and i started to do it. when i finished i was very surprised how the final look of this set is! really taking my words back. unfortunately in the bag there were missing some parts and i could not rebuild the back spoiler. so i made some changes to it and make it from spare parts that i have and it came out acceptable. i also added some additional parts such as “fake” steering wheel, “rally” logo, antennas. i have also reverse mounting of the rear tires – why lego did them like that i never know – as i think they look better this way. set: well the review has been already made by owner of this post so i will only add few things into it. engine – v2 (aired cooled?) is driven by 4 gears -> from the single wheel (no differential as in 8840) using two old school z14 tooth bevel , then by z24 tooth crown and z8 tooth type 1. actually the (as in most old sets) the pistons are moving very fast (not as in current sets) and smooths – i needed to extra clean all engine parts as there was a lot friction. suspension – set has “engine bay” working using two old gray shock absorbers 6,5l – the movement is not big but works very nice, better then in 8840 in my opinion. steering – this is a bit odd as there is no direct connection to hog as in most old sets, but first the gear rack is moved by z8 then two z14 tooth where reverse movement is taking place. later connection of two old school z14 tooth bevel goes to hog details – this is the most that i like in this set, specially how the use of axle pin connector perpendicular and 1x10 bricks with 3x3 cut corners and plate 1x5 toothed ends 2 studs with center axle hole are making the body shape – is just wonder. tires – the balloon rear are pretty nice the front is a new version of those that were in 8840. what i do not like: 1. missing of technic figure (8840 had it.) 2. no steering wheel in the original set 3. no differential – but having in mind that lego has introduce 24-12 teeth would be difficult to build the transmission in such small space where the engine is. i will shortly upload new pictures and post them here later on . over all – i think it is worth buying it as it is very payable ! actually very payable and runs smoothly , the steering, suspension – perfect thank you and regards

4 finally, after a very frustrating incident with the internet explorer 7's 'back' button, i present to you my very first review. this is a review of set 8158 speed racer vs snake oiler, it's also the first review of a speed racer set on eurobricks. also you should know that i didn't put the stickers on as they can be quite valuable later on down the road, so i'm sorry for the lack of stickers. :-$ so without further ado i present to you my first review. he he, that rhymes. :-d edit: i just finished resizing the pics and uploading them to brickshelf after having a heated argument about when my bedtime is with my mother. so, i will be doing a complete redo of the picture portion of my review of set 8158. i'm going to work on that as soon as i finish typing this message... edit 2: review fully redone now, *sighs*, that took forever. edit 3: almost forgot to put in a new link to its brickshelf folder. this is v.2 of my review of set 8158, enjoy... theme: speed racer set:8158 speed racer vs snake oiler price: $19.99us pieces: 242 minifigs: 2 first off pics of the box, instructions, dss, minifigs, and new parts: there are so many stickers they had to number them! x-o so's sunglasses are chrome gold. 8-? close-up of the hemets. new parts include, first system lego hubcap, new more curvy fenders, curved windshield, and a s-shaped connector piece. now onto the build, first speed racer's mach 5: back part of the car. the cockpit of the car. they connect with the new s-shaped piece. front part of the car. front and cockpit also connected using the new s-shaped piece. side view of the car, so far. underside of the car, so far. adding more detail. ground level front view of the car. side view with added detail. underside with newly added axles. demonstrating how the new hubcaps are put on. now on to building snake oilers orange-ilicious racer: back part of the car. the cockpit of the car. they are connected using the s-shaped piece. front part of the car with seemingly random color choices. *wacko* the front and cockpit are also connected using the new s-shaped piece. adding orange-irific fenders. side view of the car so far. adding more detail. smoothing things over. ground level view with lime green "eyes" and white "fangs". side view with more detail. rearword view of the car with newly added cuve-acious windshield. no hubcaps!?! :-| now onto finished views of both cars, first the mach 5: side view with sweet hubcaps. up close and personal with the mach 5. a rearend shot. "i got hubcaps, i got hubcaps!", speed racer. now so's snake racer, yes thats what i'm calling it. :-p :-d beautiful! blurry, :-$ rearend pic. "watchout it bites!", snake oiler he's ready to take on sr, hubcaps or no hubcaps! >:-) racin'! now for some comparison shots: hope you all like v.2 better then v.1, i know i liked it better. x-d seriously though i even learned a thing or two doin' this last version. ;-) now it's time for my summary: overall a very well designed and executed set. it's only downfalls are that there are way too many stickers, 32 to be exact, :-| and there are no cool contraptions on the cars to take out the other racer. a great buy for $19.99, i reccomend this set to everybody because of the reasons i staed above and because even i, who is not a big fan of speed racer, x-o was drawn to this spectacular little set. price: 10/10 pieces: 8/10 too many stickers. minifigs: 9/10 needed some accessories. playability: 8/10 needs some cool contraptions on the cars to take out the other racer. overall: 35/40 general tarful edited by imperialshadows, 01 june 2008 - 12:07 pm.

4 can't wait to get me one of those!!

4 what store did you find this at? x-o great review.

2 general tarful, please resize those pics. even with the new re-size feature, people are having a tough time reading your review because it takes time for the tool to work. check out the picture resize tutorial here and some other handy tutorials here. thanks.

2 lt. veers, on mar 23 2008, 01:39 am, said: what store did you find this at? x-o great review. i found all the april released speed racers sets in the shop in legoland. i was going to post a review tuesday of this set, but i can see i'm too late. now i cross my fingers for the fierce creatures set doesn't get "taken" as well. i would like to comment on the review, but the pictures are too big - it simply takes too long to load. regarding that new resize function. i can see it does "nearest neighbor" rescaling. doesn't it resize to less than 640x480? i thought that was the standard for forum post pictures. edited by lasse d, 23 march 2008 - 12:55 am.

4 thanks for the review, i think i'll certainly get these sets. they look very nice and have nice minfigs (i love racing, as long as minifigs could sit in them). the fact that there are so much stickers make me think this is an model building theme, like when you build plastic cars (with all those tiny pieces and a load of stickers). but that 's'-shaped thingy does already exist, doesn't it? edited by matn, 23 march 2008 - 11:40 am.

( that's right, i'm talking to you micvash and phred! ) *sweet*

0 i don't even see why you reviewed this set... it didn't tell us anything that isn't perceivable from the box, being so simple. though i do appreciate the effort.

4 thanks for the review. it looks beautiful. my father was a backhoe driver, so understandably i used to drool over this set in the catalogs. i never did get it though as lego was so expensive in australia then; i had around 2000 pieces and i thought i had loads! :-d anyway, last year i bought 8455, which i love; it works great with a compressor i made too! *sweet* i wish mine had a real cab though... :'-( do you have 8455 as well? i'd love to see how they compare side by side... it looks bigger than 8455 but i don't own any of the big old chuncky tires so i find it so hard to tell. by the way, i have been reading all of your reviews but i have been a bit busy of late so i haven't had time to comment. i hope you have more planned; any chance of a supercar one?

4 another nice review. the slow shutter speed pictures are great. i think that was the only set with 8 distinct functions for a very long time and was only displaced by the 8455 backhoe in that respect. the turntable on the back doesn't turn very well though, as the weight is all distributed on one side. the screw axle prevents it from popping off but there is still a lot of friction in it. i don't have mine built anymore but it might be worth trying to put a weight brick or something on it. quote do you have 8455 as well? i'd love to see how they compare side by side... it looks bigger than 8455 but i don't own any of the big old chuncky tires so i find it so hard to tell. yeah, it's quite a bit bigger. when everything is fully extended, it becomes something like 26" long. although the 8455 actually has more/better functionality. edited by cp5670, 24 march 2008 - 08:15 am.

2 yesterday while building, i accidentaly dropped a axle nut. of course i'm working in a total mess and so it tool some time 'til i found it again. there are ~324 axle nuts on bricklink with an avg price of $0.89. i didn't know of this accessory-set: 5110-2... you can buy it for $40.00 8-?

0 bernddasbrot, on mar 24 2008, 05:08 pm, said: there are ~324 axle nuts on bricklink with an avg price of $0.89. but i wants it cheap! *sing* and i would still call 324 quite rare. and i also want to just tack it onto another order. *sad*

4 thanks! *sweet*

2 quote there are ~324 axle nuts on bricklink with an avg price of $0.89. i didn't know of this accessory-set: 5110-2... you can buy it for $40.00 8-? i was thinking of getting one of those off bl several years ago, back when the price used to be more like $15 or so, but i realized that i hardly ever use the couple that i already have. :-p they came out with the modern turntable the year after this set, which mostly negated the need for these screw axles. i think their only use now is to hold non-lego objects onto models, like the technic pen in 8094. i guess you can try to make linear actuators out of them, but they're often too rare and fragile for that.

4 bernddasbrot, on mar 23 2008, 02:32 pm, said: hi! this is my forth pre-old-school review. as promised: a yellow-set ! my 8862 arrived today, survived the washing machine coaster and actually was real fun to build! the finished “boom / jib / scoop thing” (=bjst) :-| x-d thanks for viewing the pictures, i hope you enjoyed it! another great review and a wonderful set of pictures. i like your nomenclature for the bjst. acronyms always sound nicely scientific; much better than "digger". no one would know you made it up until they found out what it means. i also really like what i will call your "kinetic photos". they convey a sense of motion and show the range of the mechanism without the big file sizes of animations. how long of a shutter speed did you use? the secret to not getting too much friction in the turntable is using extra nuts and jamming them together. you don't want to actually clamp the nuts tight across the turntable. you want to jam two nuts tightly together at each end which prevents them from unwinding, but still leave a little free play (gap). this way it will hold the assembly together but not prevent it from moving. mine moves quite easily. this same concept is used on the pen plotter or 8094. "slewed"? i think that's a word. how about "slewn" or "slain" or "slewifacated"? i think "rotated" is best. *sweet* eric

4 wow thanks for putting up this thread, that reminded me that i own that one too. *sweet* and i loved it as a kid.

4 thanks for another classic review! man, i wish i had this set. the shovels should have been black though.

4 some time ago i sort of complained about the fact that there was not much technic represented in the eurobricks community (this was the topic, if someone is interested). i am glad to see someone took that complaint serious and started reviewing technic sets on large scale to show us how fascinating the theme really is! this review is once again an excellent one, i really enjoyed reading it. i must buy this set sometime soon because i always liked the three-way pneumatic system it came with and the overall look of the machine. for many years it seemed out of reach, much to expensive and hard to come by as a kid. now as an adult there are many ways to acquire this wonderful set. keep on reviewing! *y*

4 i saw ur pocket knife 20 :-d times yay do i win 8-| mm anyway great reveiw can't wait til these come to my stores. btw i don't know which one to get so could you reckomend me one? thanks and great reveiw! *y*

4 first off i would like to thank you all for your feedback. *sweet* iamded, on mar 24 2008, 01:32 am, said: 29 times! great review, these are some sweet lookin' rides. :-d very similar to the other set, but still great. *y* thanks! ~peace i counted only 28 times. x-d thanks iamded, and yes they are very similar. dragonator, on mar 24 2008, 01:35 am, said: those are some beautiful cars, thanks so much for the review! *sweet* of the two, i like taejo's one best, as red is my colour. >:-) a perfect car for you and the bird to roll round in. :-d i like the windscreen pieces, they're new right? you're welcome dragonator, and yes the winshield piece is new. ;-) on another note long live dragons! hollisbrick, on mar 24 2008, 02:11 am, said: i saw ur pocket knife 20 :-d times yay do i win 8-| mm anyway great reveiw can't wait til these come to my stores. btw i don't know which one to get so could you reckomend me one? thanks and great reveiw! *y* nope. :-p and thanks hollisbrick. they are both really similar so it really depends on which colors you use more in moc-ing, or which characters you like more. my personal choice is 8159 as it has cooler minifigs, except for racer x's recycled head :-|, and the colors are more useful to me. then again if you're like batbrick the only thing that matters is if a set has orange in it. :-p whitefang_sg, on mar 24 2008, 03:52 am, said: great review! i personally do not like the stickers very much. it's great that you show us the cars without stickers. hehe, it look nice! was thinking why other characters do not have a visor in front of their helmet thanks whitefang_sg, i don't put the stickers on because they can be very valuable latter on down the road. yeah me too, but in 8159 you get an extra black visor. ronan nissen, on mar 24 2008, 04:57 am, said: yeah, they're supposed to have see-through visors over their eyes like this: can't wait for speed racer lego! when tlg makes a helmet like that, hell will freeze over, we will finally get a proper open helmet clone pilot. trooperdavinfelth, on mar 24 2008, 06:50 am, said: curses! you beat me to it. :'-( anyhow, i saw it 29 times as well. i'm probably gonna get the truck and the grand prix. racer x was a letdown; i expected a kickass awesome unique head and all i get is bruce wayne rubbed in my face again. *sing* (that is me screaming) anyways, these sets look cooler and cooler! more reviews! i must see more! *y* as i stated above i only counted it 28 times. :-p yeah at first i wasn't going to get any sr sets but when i saw them in person i could not resist, now i intend on collecting them all. more will come as soon as i get more sr sets... darthperson8, on mar 24 2008, 07:33 am, said: wow! not as cool as the other set but awesome nonetheless...i can see that red car being a sportscar for city. and i hope that bruce wayne head does't become of liscened themes that the sunglasses face for city :-| why is it not as cool as 8158? *wacko* yeah me too. asuka, on mar 24 2008, 03:50 pm, said: a very good review, thanks generaltarful. *y* that´s an interesting set for sure, and especially the red car looks really fine. air intakes, very nice.... :'-) you're welcome asuka, and yeah the red car is fine. batbrick, on mar 24 2008, 04:29 pm, said: thanks for the review general tarful! i only saw the knife 27 times :'-( i like this set, but i probably won't justify the price, the other set has orange ( *wub*) and the mach 5, as well as better fleshie head i reckon. to the batbrick cave! >:-) you're welcome batbrick, and wait untill you see set 8561 it has the mach 6! x-o regards, general tarful

2 thanks for the review. and for giving me directions :-p i think the design of these two cars looks to be better than in the other set. the drivers are positioned lower compared to the windscreen and the design of the front on th red car is really nice. i'm missing details of motors and cars this big could use a working steering mechanism.

2 thanks for the review, mate. i may get this as well, so i can get racer x. axctually, i see what tlc's done here, splitting up the two more well-known characters, speed and racer x, so you have to get both sets. matn, on mar 25 2008, 08:09 am, said: lego should have used this for their helmets, you can put a (protecting)glasses(don't know the name) in front of it: visor? i'd have to agree with you with regards the helmet. i would've preferred this, especially for speed. interestingly, my pocket knife is the same as that one. i didn't count its appearances though.

4 crap, now i want these sets!! great review!

4 thank you for your detailed review, lasse d! *y* the only problem about this set is, that most of the people here will regard this as a pure parts pack. x-d oooh - i just found out about the red "teeth" - cool. i want that! *wub*

4 thank you for review very good army builder i see

4 excellent review! *y* getting a better chance to look at this set actually makes me interested in it. i was in my dark ages throughout the islander days, though i have built up a small force of them (10?) from ebay buys, but no actual sets. if this is really as reasonable as you say there, i may just have to pick one up soon. oddly, i do own the baseplates to this set, having also picked them up in a lot on ebay, so i might be able to recreate it manually, but i think i'd rather pick one up whole. it looks like a great mix of parts and makes a decent looking display piece. thanks again for the fine review! *y*

4 thanks for a lovely review! i only recently bought this set off ebay (pretty good deal: misb for 30 euro's!) and i enjoyed putting it together and mixing it with the other piratesets. when you put two sets of two baseplates together you'll get a large pond with an island in the center, just to achieve that i bought two more baseplates off ebay. the result is this moc. i always loved the islanders and have most of the sets, not all of them but that is going to change in the future. *y*

4 a mighty fine review you've created slyowl! *y* after some sleep i shall immerse myself more fully within it.

4 good review, mr. slyowl! and good pics too! i know it probably deserves better but i only give him a 3. i'll be surely the only saying that i don't like this set but i remember i had it for christmas when i was a child and it disappointed me very much because i expected it much larger after seeing it in the lego catalogs. well it's just a little trauma i had :-p lol anyway i must admit it's an interesant set, specially because of the large number of mini-figures and accesories it brings with and the two little "ships" edited by bluebard, 31 march 2008 - 01:13 am.

4 excellent review of an outstanding set! i love the main image. i want this set so bad!

4 for some reason i never considered buying this set. but your review changed that. i'll try to get it on ebay. thanks for your efforts to make this wonderful review for us. it's now added to our index.

4 thanks for the review! i am getting very interested in the classic pirates sets, and i wat some now. this seems like it would be a great starter.

2 everytime i saw this at a toy store i always cried to my parents for one, but never got it, i got the smaller islander sets, but the more i see this now, i don't want it, i could buy it, but naahh, i am hoping lego does an updated version of the islanders with this new pirates line, one can hope right!! xd

0 i realized that building the chess set from the new pirates theme, they are two grey heads that reminded me of the king kahuna throne, which goes to say that i am hoping they bring back new sets, i just wish they were bigger. i would love to build the old ones, but i would side more towards the newer model if they ever released them.

4 no problem casewindu! i actually like this set for the pieces and torsos (especially sprittle's)

4 i will most likely get all the speed racer sets as it was one of my favorite movies(the animated one) i just loved the decked up and tricked out cars >:-) great review and red tux = x-d

4 looks like a great ole set to me. the cars seem abit overly slopey to me though, i'll probably pass on this. but as a note, i especially like the black and yellow car's horizontal wheel covering things. nice :-$

4 ah, thanks sommuch again for that great review! *y* *sweet* man, i am so happy they made this set. the new one seems too boring. ;-)

4 somehow i competely missed your review when you first made it, i saw your pics on brickshelf and wondered about the review... you have managed to review my all time favourite technic set! it was the first large technic set i was given by my parents, when it first came out in 1995. i played for hours with this set, making minifig seats in it (it was so huge there was room for four minifigs to sit next to eachother in front....) i made various applications for it, a bungee-jump system with a large rubber band, and lots of containers to be lifted. the first changes i made included the inverting of the wheels and the disabling of one of the flashlight-steering wheels because they obstructed eachother. by the way, the nob for your winch is yellow instead of black (i know this set by heart, so watch out :-p ). i always liked those nobs. i do own the 8421 and i can tell you: this 8460 is much, much stronger, it can carry more weight because the boom is lighter then the 8421: they are powered by the same two pistons... you know when you made it right: when the crane is in upright position, fully extended and you release the brake from the winch. does the hook lower without having to pull it? if it does, you succeeded in constructing the set right. the alternate model was great fun too, the pump is cleverly hidden and the crane folds up great between the cab and the loading platform. you could easily mod it with a pneumatic claw on the crane, a motor to turn it and a compressor. the only flaw was the loading platform which had no floor (only some axles). thanks so much for reviving my memorie concerning this great set! *y*

4 front, on apr 6 2008, 05:19 pm, said: btw. boxes are expensive, so at a given price point, it's a choise between more bricks or nicer boxes. i have no doubt what most people would chose. yeah, it's certainly understandable why they did it, but bad for box hoarders like me. :-p

2 funny review just a question though: did your set come with three cutlasses? also your food crate seems to be missing... edited by sir dano, 15 april 2008 - 09:04 pm.

4 actually they are ants. spiders have 8 legs while ants have only 6 like these. the two thing that look like legs in the front are the antennae. back on topic, i think this set looks great and i can't wait until i can get my hands on it and the other new ij sets. edited by erdbeereis1, 15 april 2008 - 09:26 pm.

4 can't wait to get this one (ants!!!) i don't have a tent either, so that'll be a great pickup. i'm surprised, though, that it includes the gold exo-force sword. i didn't expect this to come in any other sets besides the tower. <faramir-<

4 thanks for the review! must...make...ant...army...

2 i have no idea why they dont use that female hair piece on trixie in speed racer. it would be perfect! greta review!

4 another great review alex. is that the same tent/construction as the tent in 5978, sphinx secret surprise?

4 front, on apr 16 2008, 10:15 am, said: they must be ants, but i'm pretty convinced that what you think are the antennae, are the ants mandibles. or not. there are six legs, 2 antennae, and 2 mandible. and they most definately are ants, to those still in doubt. thanks for this great review, alex, this is most definately (well, in my opinion anyway) the best set. lets face it, in motorcycle chase you really only got 2 bikes and 2 crates as the big parts of the set. in this one, which is the same price, you get those ants, a neat tent (hurray!), a [b]printed[/i] map, a chicken leg, a castle sword, ef sword, and pirates sword, a dagger (now in light bley) and a silver frying pan. this set is packed with useful pieces, i'm definately getting this one. and i for one love mutt's hair piece. i sense my sig-fig will soon have a new hair style. thanks again alex for the sweet review! ~peace edited by iamded, 16 april 2008 - 05:07 am.

4 ok! i think, it''s a no-brainer that this is a must-have for pretty much anyone who likes lego! it's cheap and a great minifigs & parts pack! i'll be getting at least 1 of these! here is what i like about it: 1. great minifigs with nice torsos, sweet faces, and awesome hair! (gotta ask 'em where they get it done! ) 2. golden katana! 3. chicken leg! yum! 4. nice campfire! and this is what i don't like about it: 1. dark bley knife! seriously, they could have at least made it silver like the sword, if not chrome! 2. rehashed tent. 3. spiders with 6 legs!!! i actually don't really care about the tent and the multi-legged creatures. those go straight into the sorting boxes. perhaps i might use the tent someday for a steampunk moc of some kind, or a stop-motion film, or maybe some kind of contest... anyway, what's up with that thing that holds the katana, the sword, and the saber? it's in the airplane set too! is it perhaps one of the treasures of the new movie or is it something indy takes with him everywhere in this film? 44however, nice pics, nice review! thanks, dude! edited by oky wan kenobi, 16 april 2008 - 09:38 am.

4 great review

4 thanks for that great review! this is a very interesting set filled with nice parts for customisation. somemore, the price is not that steep. i will need to get ready for the second wave!

4 is that a laptop it's on? does it come with the set? seriously though, it looks liek it has some good pieces, particularily the soldier's clothing and the crocodile hehe. hooray for new indy sets, lets hope the film is as good (it will be).

4 nice review, i like what i'm seeing in this set. i liked the little comic, marion should be arrested though

2 joey lock, on apr 15 2008, 09:50 pm, said: i swear it is supposed to have stickers on the side of the car, boat, oil canister and windscreen? i expect it does, but alex54 has left them off it, like i do.

2 alex54, on apr 15 2008, 10:17 pm, said: i plan to use the outpost for my forest section, and the amphibious vehicle is always a nice touch of originality in a layout. yes you can use all those military things without creating an army in a layout: just put the violent parts out, and you’ve got nice things, like a biologist car in the case of the amphibious vehicle! or just put it up on blocks next to a trailer and you've got a nice trailer-trash section of town... steve

4 batbrick, on apr 15 2008, 05:39 pm, said: ...commies look great as well. haha! commies this set really looks great. i really see what you were saying about the whole retro thing. reminds me a bit of a dino island set, myself. except without the dinosaurs. always without the dinosaurs... this is a must get, does anyone know when these will be released in the us? <faramir-< edited by faramir, 15 april 2008 - 10:50 pm.

4 what are those bricks with the guns attached supposed to be? great review and set btw...

4 my favorite part of this is prob the amphibious vehicle! looks really neat! nice to see another (different) torso for marion...

4 thanks for the review! i really like this little-ish set, quite alot of detail, it reminds me of sets from the late 90's more soviets are always welcome too, and the new torso for marion is nice, as is the new dark green alligator all of the neat little accesories are great too, a cup, shovel, binoculars and of course the cans of gasoline again, thanks for the review, alex

4 this one is my favorite from the bunch. thanks for the time spent in making a review

2 wow those trees look so weak compared to those enormous blades. anyway, a high-possibility-and-appeal-to-us-compulsive-lego-shoppers set, so, i'll try to get it, which means i'll obsesively look until i find. deforestation of puny trees, on!

4 looks great

4 what a marvelous diversity of plant parts, very nice mfs and a cool and detailed harvester. that conventionalized cave with its neat opening feature´s also very well done. thanks for that fine review of a pretty cool set, alex.

4 this is the 3rd review, that i had read. it's very tempting to fly over and get those sets from there. because, i may need to wait for some months before it arrived. it seemed we will have a new small little creature to add into the ranks. these "red ants" is cute and of course looks nasty too. haha. i love those trees, foilage and plants very very much. it can be used for my moc and is good for any "green" project related expansion. i love it. about the vehicle, i find it abit wierd. it seemed too big in the set-up. hehe, but still i love this set. mainly, i will get it for the green parts

4 thanks every much for the review! i remember having this set, and making really terrible stop-motion movies with it. very playable. this brings back lot's of fond memories! thanks! majisto on!

4 agent rick: you're definately the dragon master around these parts. what a great little set. i really like the classic dragon which reminds me of a similar style used for the lego crocodiles. and the dungeon is pretty slick too. i like the use of the large gates plus the doors. plus the set contains the blue wizard. awesome! great review.

2 the wizard somehow "controls" the dragons i think, like, for example the wizard of the new castle line does with the undead skeletons. but i think it isn't sure that the dragon master's wizard is evil. as it is still unclear which factions of the older castle series are "good" or "bad".

4 phoinix, on 16 april 2008 - 09:06 pm, said: this was the last castle set i got before my dark age.. really liked it although the big rock parts looked really bad ( i am kind of used to them now) unfortunately i lost the little wand.. and i never understood who is "good" and who is "bad" does the wizard own the dragon? well they dont seem to be enemies but isnt the dragon supposed to be evil?? i always liked the burps, i don't know why. maybe because they were dark grey and dark grey pieces seemed a bit hard to come by at the time. i always assumed that the dragon was, sort of, the mascot of the dragon masters. the wizard was there to keep him under control so he wouldn't turn on them. i always figured that the wizard was working with the dragon master king, and they were fighting against the royal knights (the dudes with the lion faces on their torsos), or whatever they were called. i like this set a lot. i think the castle theme declined after the dragon masters and royal knights themes were discontinued. the new knights never really took the cake. it's funny, but it seems, to me anyways, that when the lego minifigs lost their regular smile/smirk faces (whether they were masked by a beard or not), that's when lego began to decline...a bit. the dragon masters had their vicious faces and all, but they still had that smile/smirk underneath their rough exteriors. the new knights look a little...less confident.

4 i own this set and i think its a great for a smaller fortress building. there is a good selection of mini figs, the burps do detract somewhat from the set, but they do make it feel as if its in a large cave. the cloth flags that are included are really nice and mine have lasted a long time.

4 i think the green motocross bike looks great. i like the use of fairings on this bike. the only thing i really don't like about the technics bikes in general, is the "clumsy" design of the chaindrive. it sticks way to much out to the side. if they made a really big bike model, it would be more in place with this chain drive. i'm not sure if it wouldn't be possible to design a shaft drive to the rear wheel, ala bmw style. but the green "kawasaki" look great with the front and rear suspension. i have the street bike, 8420, a somewhat larger and more complicated set, and will probably add the motocross bike to my collection soon. it would be great if lego could make a line of bikes, like they do the ferrari line. front

2 simonwillems, on may 17 2008, 06:30 pm, said: how did i manage to miss this review? i must have overlooked it somehow... you must have been ignoring me! it's been in my signature for weeks! simonwillems, on may 17 2008, 06:30 pm, said: it looks a lot like an upgraded version of one of the first bikes lego made, namely the 8838 shock cycle. i also believe the back gearwheel is somewhat oversized, it looks better with the smaller one you attached. yes, it does seem to be a remake. the shock cycle even has a dangly chain like my modded version... as a set i'd prefer the old one due to the four indentical springs.

2 great review! i never have been interested in this set. i am saving my money for a grey technic set or thatt technic ferrari set...

0 great review sinner i bought this set a few weeks ago personally i prefer the alternative model of the flatbed truck.

2 thank you for your detailed review, sinner! i´m not that much into technic building because i´m lacking the inspiration to build something different with all those technic elements. so i´ll pass on this one and stay to classic bricks.

4 looks great! i cant't wait until i can get my hands on this and the other new ij sets. this is turning out to be a really good theme! i'm really liking the crystal skulls and i also think the baseplate looks very nice. those natives look fantastic in my opinion. thanks for the great review! edited by erdbeereis1, 01 may 2008 - 02:53 am.

2 brilliant review, and great pics. thanks. hmmmmm i would actually like one of these now, where before i was unsure.

2 nice review, and your cat looks exactly like ours! shame yoda ain't around to review anymore, though... *m'aiq runs off to the nearest tavern to drink* away all thoughts of parson yoda yoda* *"i don't know how to get drunk off soda, but it's possible!" -me

4 svelte_corps, on may 1 2008, 02:44 am, said: (e) central turret thing this thing is kind of annoying and doesn't really sit or work well. it's kind of like a laser beam sending messages to space, i guess. as the central dome rises, the two plates peel away. i find it is a little bit tight to work smoothly and the two plates doesn't really sit well together at the top. maybe i just need to rebuild it. i'm sure this will also be explained in the movie. great review! now i'm really truly convinced that i'm gonna buy this set. my faith was a little wobbly, but its benn restored anyway, i just wanted to point out that the temple's entrance might actually be the turret thing. if you watch the teaser, there are some very similair stone pillars surrounded by sand (there are 4 not 2 though ) and when they close up it looks like all our characters are sucked into the sand and magically appear underground going through some stone plates(which act like steps to go down) that dissapear. so, in theory those steps beneath the turret are actualy the entrance, and i'm asumming from this picture that the steps with 1x8 bricks with the dragon heads at the end lead us of somewhere else. all in all this temple looks like a mixed up version of the real temple, which is fine by me (sidenote: i'm not sure but based on minifig inclusion, either lego was cheap or colonel dovchenko is dead by the time irina and her goons reach the temple, i'll wait till i see the movie. ) edited by belloq, 02 may 2008 - 02:14 am.

2 trooperdavinfelth, on may 1 2008, 05:06 pm, said: absolute hogwash. i wouldn't trust anyone on a forum i've never heard of. i don't believe they'd cancel it. it's still on s@h, right? well, the people there are quite trustfull. but i looked now on shop@home and 7624 (i posted the wrong number, sorry) is only available in canada and the united states, so i hope it's not an exclusive.

2 that's awesome!!! i'm going to my local tru today to see if i can find the two smaller sets.

4 nice review! got this set yesterday and u have to say, that amphibious vehicle rocks!!!

2 a very nice review of a very lovely indy set indeed, thanks wilhelm screamer. but you need for sure a better lighting for taking your pictures....

4 very good for a first review! i bought this set and jungle duel at target the other day (i was going to wait and buy them when i go to downtown disney this summer, but how could i pass up saving four bucks that i can spend on store-exclusives? ) and i have to say i absolutely love them. the amphibious vehicle (don't they call it a duck in the movie?) is definitely my favorite lego vehicle i've ever built. everything about it is wonderful- the size, the colour scheme, and it's accurate to the one in the movie. and irina spalko's hair is to die for. on a side note, i don't get why they made marion's arms white in the set. the shirt underneath her vest in the movie is obviously blue. i switched the arms out for light blue ones and it looks a lot better, and it makes marion's eyes look great. -ryan

2 metalandi thanks for this wonderful lovely review. i enjoyed myself very much when i am looking through at the lovely pictures. i must admit, this is what i called a "real classic" race prix i miss those cute sweet little race cars which is able to contain a mini-fig. furthermore, this set offers 4 race cars and 13 mini-figures in addition, if town collectors remember, the car number tiles are printed instead of using stickers. this is the other set i owned, which holds the similarity above. 6381: motor speedway overall, great review! simonwillems, on may 9 2008, 02:20 am, said: i recently made an entire racetrack together with this set and to promote myself i will place a link here i saw your entire racetrack. it looks real exciting and i love your layout, real nice! edited by whitefang, 15 may 2008 - 09:56 am.

2 nice reveiw i would fork out $100 aud for that set its just so bueatiful if only tlg re-released this

0 i'll be passing on this set, thanks for the review anyway, is everyone supposed to be bald in the film? it looks weird

0 batbrick thanks for the sweet review. you give me great insights into this set. hehe, i agreed that racer x is nice, but i believe we can get it in the other set for a much lower price. for me, the trailer which does not have a cover is bugging me alot. that's why, i holding my reservations against this set. at most, i will consider the other 2 smaller sets for collection purpose. nevertheless, batbrick great job

0 thanks for the review. my wife wanted me to buy this for the fishtank, and i came close! untimately this set didn't offer many good part to me so i bought the smaller set with the same car. the trailer is just too insubstantial...

2 i enjoyed the review. some cool fleshie heads and parts, but it does seem a bit lamer even than i imagined from the box (the "airy" truck is rather slyly disguised on the box art). i would like to get it if it is ever on sale, 50% off would be nice :) speed racer lego doesn't seem to be selling too well in local shops here.

2 hi all newly arrived today, don't you just love shop at home. thought i'd give it a quick review. see more details over at my site. the tumbler: joker's ice cream suprise

4 the batman minifig have a detailed and cool torso. thanks for the review brickbitz. edited by darkrebellion, 16 may 2008 - 07:31 pm.

2 that is a very nice and quick review! thanks for giving us a quick summary. not much comments on this set, as i do not really go into batman theme yet. however, the ice cream truck in the set interest me. apart from that, nothing much yet. who knows, maybe i will change my mind in the future.

4 must...get...!!

2 trooperdavinfelth, on may 16 2008, 11:11 pm, said: although i know you don't take many pictures in your reviews(imho, ) but can we see a little more about the tumbler? i'll get some set up tomorrow in better light. to be honest there isn't a lot to see, most of it is just basic technic blocks underneath with all the slopes built up on top.

4 thanks a lot for the review brickbitz. i really love this set, sure the figs are annoyingly not new, but the ice cream truck is fantastic and the tumbler is a marvel of black slopes. i see now that it is far too huge though, i reckon i will either keep it that way as a "mega tumbler", mod it to become another battank, keep it as a model tumbler, or pull it apart and use the bits to make a tumbler like wetwire's awesome one. love those popsicles though, and those wheels are very nice, so overall as a loyal batfan i love the set, even though it could've been better. batbrick away!

4 the tumbler is massive! i'll struggle to fit it into the cave, but never mind. the figs are nice, the tumbler is pretty accurate (or at least, it will be after i've moded it), and joker's tainted ice cream van is so very joker. thanks for the review, btw.

4 nice review dunamis ! i built it two weeks ago on the legoworld speedbuild in oslo and didn´t have time to get the "feel" during that crazy race. i agree with you that the base is nice & sturdy, makes it stand real still ! i´m looking forward on your next score! four eyes arms on copmike

4 thanks for that fine review, dunamis. i really like that set.... gg´s an interesting and well designed movie character and that lego version of him´s indeed well done and very detailed. and although i would wish for a some more functional (or playable ) feature of move- and even splitable arms i guess it´s an already very cool ucs version of that grumpy old kaleesh....

2 ok, here are a couple of shots of the head and eyes: a very nice effect. any, silly me, in my first set of photos above, i never folded in his ribcage (you guys gotta call me out on these things). here is what it is supposed to look like: anyway, carry on...

4 quote since there were links posted to the .pdf files of the instructions online, i’m sure you can all get an idea of the manual and the parts inventory. however, for those of you without access to the internet here are photos of the parts inventory pages: luckily for me i have access to the internet to read this review in the first place seriously though, nice review! my girlfriend has told me that i can't have this one after we just got through a 3-day build of the 10030 star destroyer... but i'm sure i can turn her around eventually... :)

4 awesome review, dunamis! that's such a sweet set, i loved it as soon as i thoroughly examined the online instructions. it looks way awesome in the brick, my favourite part has to be the eyes. very cool, and creepy. thanks again for the info, and of course the pics! ~peace

2 an excellent review with superb presentation dunamis . when the time comes i hope your able to get your hands on the other new sw sets and review them just as good.

4 detailed report,thx for sharing.i love to see the special parts of it!you persuaded me to buy this!

2 nice review! but id rather save my money for the indy and clone wars sets.

2 nice review i hope to get this set for my birthday!

2 the rancor, on may 18 2008, 01:38 pm, said: damn!!! i was just about to post a review on this why not.... multiple reviews´re doing no harm, and it´s always interesting to see reviews with a perhaps different point of view too....

4 lol your sig is awesome! the little power suit is well done, i would like to see articulation some how jammed into the little legs though, and we all now exoforce 4 finger hands would look great on his arms. edited by rayskull, 18 may 2008 - 04:51 pm.

4 thanks for the review nice little set and its around $20.00!

4 thanks for the great review oky wan the two vehicles look quite nice for a small set and the minifigs look great! the two sided head is nice, although it would've been nice if it was a new head rather than the standard frowning face. the cyborg looks good, nice and cartoony, i like the printing on his back. the belt on the hips should be useful, not to mention the robotic hand. i assume that anything that fits into a 1x1x1 cylinder can fit in it? i hope so thanks again oky. any chance you can get any more sets?

2 huhm .. i like the idea of the agent-id .. but offcourse all they want with that is that you buy all six sets .. but it can be a good idea for children, they wouldn't think of "hey they get all money only because i have a little card with stars" or something. well, not to rant, i think it's good. also, can you make that name yourself? maybe set 5 comes with a extra stickersheed with all letters, that would be nice "agent rupee" a very nice review oky wan kenobi. =rupee

2 thanks, guys! i really tried to make it a good first review! now to answer your questions: the robot arm can fit ef robot claws and anything that a minifig can hold in his hand or that would fit into a 1x1x1 cylinder, so normal minifig hands are too small to fit. tlg is using the robot claw idea for the main villain of the agents line! do you still want me to try it out and take pics? the price was 10.99 usd at the tru i bought it at. i bet it'ss be a dollar less on s@h! and i'm sorry, but i probably won't get any more sets any time soon. i have to save my money for all the other good set that are to come. but if i would get another set, it would just be the one with the helicopter and the all-silver car! if anyone gets this set, can he/she please review it? thanks! any other questions i can answer for you guys? edited by oky wan kenobi, 18 may 2008 - 08:59 am.

4 nice first review oky wan ! i´d say this is better than we first thought. the minifigs looks cool and the overall look is ok. and the excaustpipe is a new peace also i think? agents on copmike

4 i love the way the bad guy has a special attachment on the jewel case just to allow the agent to grab it with his hook. it's like the two of them sat down beforehand and drew up the plans for the vehicle together... cyborg: "ok, and then i'll make my getaway in the special snowmobile and you can follow me..." agent: "...and i'll scoop up the jewel and return it to foil your plan". cyborg: "perfect. see you tuesday?" dr. s.

2 thanks for a very good review! agent line seems better all the time... looking forward in seeing review on mission 2 gold chase (and new pictures of the jet) really soon!

2 thanks for the great review oky wan! at first i didn't think i liked the agents sets but the more i see them the better i think they look. i will definitely pick up 1 or 2 of the sets. i really like the jet pack, and the figs look great. that double face is very nice. tlg should make more figs with these faces in my opinion.

2 great review!thank youvery much! i think this line is much more promising than most orginally thought it would be. i'm onmy way to see ifican find the big rig right now!

4 thank you for the nice review. it has some big pieces i don't like, but the minifigs are good.

4 thanks for the review, this set is wonderful! u love the two dark green crocodiles and awesome minifigs, especially break jaw that bike is awesome and the base, like all agents sets, comes with great pieces, like the barbed wire, orange anything, leafy pieces and brown log pieces. thanks for the review, i'll definitely get this one! batbrick away!

4 have you made any other reviews? i want more. please? i'm not planning to get this set, but its pretty cute. the set itself is okay, but the figs are amazing. agent charge: i want that head. unibrow man! great villain! crocs...

4 great little set, nice to have a small building instead of all vehicles. plant pieces and dark green crocs always welcome. good parts selection for the price. thanks for the review! can't wait till we can get our hands on these!

2 can't..resist...the unibrow...must obey.

4 great review and a good confirmation of exactly what i suspected... this is a parts line for me. much like exoforce before it, this will be the theme i pick up when i'm out of other things, or it's on sale. plus those dark green alligators bring tears of joy to an old pirate. alice, on may 22 2008, 12:43 am, said: i always joked that our house would have a moat around it with mechanical alligators. you were joking? what about the monkeys and the miniature golf course? don't ruin my dreams ...

4 nice review, thanks! i really like those little go-kart thingies, they've got a fantastic mario kart look to them

2 quote but i have to say that these two small vehicles just look plain ugly imho, without any inspiration nor orginality indead. the only reason to get this set is if you couldn't afford the batcave back in 2006 and want a mr. freeze fig for a cheap price. and anyone who did get that kit really have no reason whatsoever to get this. wait, did i forget something? oh yeah - thanks for the review, riddler. edited by grevious, 22 may 2008 - 11:54 pm.

0 like many others, i'll buy this just for mr f, quickly recycle the parts, and pretend this set never existed. the flame detail is indeed terrible. the bat is back - and he's flatulent! this third bat-wave isn't really doing anything for me. i'll get the penguin set as well for pretty much the same reason - although the sub on that is pretty cool - but skip the others. maybe batbrick can make us all nice alt-mocs to improve these sets... thanks for the review though!

4 thanks for the review ???theriddler???. this is a neat little set, a bit overpriced in my opinion, but for a new suited batman and a mr freeze fig in a set other than one of the most expensive bat-sets released, it's worth my money. ~peace

2 wowie!!!!!! i'm glad you like it! maby i'l do the tumbler also! but soon the batcycle and the scuba also come!

2 thanks for the reveiw the figs are bloody great! but those cars are a bit... well i'll put it blantly, retarded!!! although they shall be good after some modding! and whats with that grapple hook? does it even have a rope, so i guess batman will hokk it to mr freeze so his ride looks more ugle anyway, can you pleese take some pics of the figs

4 that's a great set. it'd be even better if it were sold as two separate little cars. they remind me of the dozens of little lego cart vehicles i got as a kid. those were always fun, quick builds that resulted in lots of cool play. i think this set is aimed more at kids and, in that respect, it's a pure winner. it doesn't hurt that you can get freeze and the newly designed batman both in this set for a reasonable price.

2 thanks the penguin, and more pics on monday!

2 the pics as promised. extra part:

0 thanks for the review. i dont know if i would get this set though. the cars are not that great and the price is a little too high.

0 i got this yesterday and built it this morning. apart from the figs, it is very crappy. mr freeze's buggy is ok but the bat buggy is easily the worst vehicle i've seen for years. colours are all over the place, the grappling hook feels cheaply made, the inclusion of those odd pearl silver parts which have been in the exo-force sets seem especially random here, the terrible bionicle flame piece... it's the first lego vehicle i've built where i've immediately had the urge to disassemble it and pretend i never bought it! really, i only got it for mr freeze so i shouldn't complain. but still. it's a real step backwards. the comparable catwoman dragster set was heaps better. the penguin sub is sweet though thanks for the review anyway!

4 coming in at around $50 us, turbo car chase is one of the bigger of the new agents sets. a big box with a helicopter, car, and gate in it. seems like a winner, but how good is it really, and is it worth the cash? let's start with the minifigs. this set comes with a standard inferno henchman, spy clops, and agent chase. the henchman is you basic lego criminal type with a gun and a jumpsuit, nothing real groundbreaking here. spy clops, on the other hand, is very cool for, technically, half of a minifig. his head has a neat electronic goggle print and the rest of him is a torso mounted onto a set of six legs made from exo-force robot arms. the whole thing is really well done and neat as hell. agent chase (turbo car chase! ) seems to have a standard agent body and a double-printed face with one side a sunglasses and headset print. the other face is a determined agent look. the set also includes a laptop with doctor inferno wallpaper. the laptop is a new piece and works like the lego books that are in a lot of harry potter sets. molding on the keyboard is really well done and the thing can be held by a minifig along either corner, but not in the middle and not while closed. the gate in the set is nothing revolutionary by itself, and i sort of get the feeling that it was included to drive up the piece count and the set price point. that being said, there are some things to like here. for instance, the gate has four wheels of barbed wire attached to it. the barbed wire is new and makes me want to start building some world war i trench mocs. the rest of the gate is fairly big and it has a handy ramp attached so that vehicles can roll through it easily. the main feature of the gate is a sound brick. it's much better then lego sound and light units of the past, when the gate is opened it depresses a button and an alert klaxon blares that sounds every bit like a prison-beak in progress. the triggering action works surprisingly well and it's pretty much for this feature alone that i'm not going to immediately break the gate back down and add it to my parts bin. the designers did make an effort to create more then just a fence though. a nice control panel connected to a big spotlight crowns the piece, and a pair of cameras watch the opening. it's really hard to mess up a lego helicopter, and this set is no exception. the inferno chopper is a nicely proportioned and well built machine. it looks properly menacing and has the uniform orange and black of other inferno property. it's armed with a set of four technic pegs cleverly used as guns on outriding mounts, as well as a pair of the newer-style flick-fire missiles. i personally don't care for flick-firing missiles, but these look decent enough and seem to stay put so i really can't complain about them. along the fuselage are a pair of intake pieces that i've never seen before and i'm guessing are new. they're pretty well designed and will come in handy for mocing down the road. the action feature of the aircraft is the wench system. this is very different then other lego wenches in that you build the entire mechanism and housing. you can then use it to raise spy clops up and down from the bottom of the chopper using the rotor. now, this also keeps you from sitting there and just giving the rotor repeated spins to simulate flight. i'm not too thrilled with that, but there are a hundred other lego helicopters out there with fully rotating rotors, so i guess i can let it by just this once. as you'd suspect, the bottom of the cockpit is completely open, which makes this a vehicle pretty much solely for spy clops (sorry henchman). but there is plenty of room beneath the body to attach a plate with some seats on it to accommodate another pilot without drastically altering the design, or even removing existing pieces. the turbo car is a slick little honey of a lego car, and the silver pieces that make up the body work contribute a lot to that fact. the front license plate appears to be an exo-fore code brick. but it also hides the activation lever for the passenger ejector seat. the seat works about as well as the spruce goose, which is to say not well at all, but here it's the thought that counts. the interior of the car is really well done. there's even a radar screen for keeping track of pesky helicopters. but the bond-like features don't end there. a lever in the compartment raises pair of guns in the hood and a knob on the rear deploys a quad rocket system with more flick-fire missiles. this is a car that won't be stopped easily! the rear has two cones sticking out. i'd like to think they're smoke nozzles or oil-slick sprayers. all-in-all, this is a really good set. the car is pure lego vehicle love and looks fantastic. the silver pieces are very nice and it's a shame lego doesn't use metallic colors in system sets more often. there are, however, a lot of sticker for this set and i know how much that bugs a lot of people. i personally like how much detail the stickers add to these sets and don't mind them so much. the set also comes with an agents id card for chase which you can put little star stickers on from other sets as you get them. it's printed on a real nice piece of sturdy plastiboard and would be cooler if you could put your own picture and name on it instead of pretending to be chase. sold by themselves, the car and chopper would be must-haves. all tossed together with the gate sort of makes the set a little less then the sum of it's parts. and with 498 parts (most of them small) that's not so hot. it's only slightly over-priced in my opinion, but if you do shell out the money you won't regret it. i'm very comfortable recommending this set to anyone. close to perfect, but the price and some minor flaws bring it back just a little. i'd say 4.33, but out of 5 is close enough!

4 deinonychus, on may 23 2008, 10:12 pm, said: pics and thoughts tomorrow! i picked up this set earlier in the week and was quite pleased with it (in fact i have missions 1-5 and am happy with all of them - this series is much better than the old alpha team ever was). i look forward to reading your thoughts on it. i will say 2 things about it now though. 1)my set came with defective instructions. in 2 places pages are missing and duplicates of other pages repeated. for instance, the car instructions are missing steps 16-21. fortunately, i was able to make out what pieces went where in the missing steps by studying the illustration in step 22. i hope you have better luck with your instructions. 2)this set contains the best lego sound brick ever (it's just begging to be incorporated into my arkham asylum).

2 yay! can't wait for your review. i plan to get this and the giant truck. the brick rat, on may 23 2008, 07:31 pm, said: 2)this set contains the best lego sound brick ever (it's just begging to be incorporated into my arkham asylum). what is a sound brick?

2 mr. mandalorian, on may 24 2008, 11:58 am, said: what is a sound brick? ditto. maybe its like the exo-force light-up brick, only with sound instead of light. that would kick [innapropriate word deleted].

4 wow! thanks, deino, for this great review! i can't wait to get this myself, but right now i gotta save for the cw sets! the car is with no doubt one of the most mind blowing things tlg has come up with and we can only hope that there will be more models made out of almost only metalic colors! the spider cyborg, while not as innovative as some of the other cyborgs, is a very nice fig, and his head will be very usefull for splinter cell mocs! and those intake pieces are only relatively new btw, they are in almost all of the current $10 racers sets. any chance of you taking a pic of a line-up of all the silver parts in this set? edited by oky wan kenobi, 24 may 2008 - 11:32 pm.

4 thanks for the review deino! i love going back through the old "agents" thread just to see how wrong we were about these awesome sets! i actually really like the gate, those portcullis pieces people may know i always find nice uses for, and i really, really, really want that awesome sound brick. the figs are a bit disappointing in numbers, but agent chase is very cool, generic henchman are great, and spy clops is one of my favourite minifigs ever! the helicopter is wonderful too, i love that it is customised for spy clops to winch him down. the colours as usual for these sets are fantastic, the dark blue, orange and chrome silver! the car is the best though, i love all the functions. how does the ejector seat work though? batbrick away!

2 es.jpg 47.94k 110 downloads the ejector seat a long technic axle runs the length of the front of the car. it comes in to the seat area here and nests into the gray joint which is attached to the small gray technic beam. the beam is attached to the ejector seat (bottom white 3x2 plate) with a technic pin. the seat, in turn, is attached to the side of the car with a technic pin. the result is, when the axle is pushed forward, the gray joint and beam tilt the seat and "eject" a minifig. after about 20 shots the minifig only went outside of the car 3 times...the rest of the time he just bounced around the inside of the car. so they get an a for effort, but an f for execution

4 hello all eurobricks members, i will present to you a very short review on the recent castle battlepacks. this time, i will be reviewing skeleton battlepack, and i hope everyone of you do enjoy viewing it. this was a request that put up by hollisbrick in the castle thread. initally, i thought it was a very simple set to do a review. however, for the love of castle, i decided to whip this up for every castle fan out there. this is an image of how the skeleton battlepacks look like. i have bought 12 last packs of these in total so far but none of the crown battlepacks yet. there were snapped much faster, that i imagined. do pardon me for the poor lightning. today is a bad weather, it's hard to get natural light. the skeleton gang for a single battlepack like this, with an attractive reasonable price. you obtained a series of 5 skeleton mini-figs with tons and tons of useful castle accessories. to me, it's a very very great buy, and it's a must to stock up for my army building! some add-ons! however, i was not very satisfied with my skeleton armies standards. therefore, i decided to make some slight modifications with some additional castle accessories that is stocked in my castle warehouse. after the makeover, ok, this is what i called a real skeleton army. this is mainly my opnion and it have to be aligned with my standards. i felt this improved battlepack gives a punch to the exisitng battlepack. the two soliders on the right, is able to align with the rest of my castle chess sets armies. while the one on the left, it gives me a great archer back up with the quiver and helmet attached to him. the ones, on the center especially the armored guard which equipped with the black nose cone helmet is my fave. it is able to illustrate the "elite" among the rest of the guards with its armor and helmet which was featured in my castle deep forest expansion moc.. promotion on! in addition, the one which was hastly done with a modify mace, it looks rather simple. in time to come, i will change it and gives a better equipment and look. these are the remains. i can use the axe for my dwarf in my dwarf mine defender. in that set, there is no weapon for my dwarf and i have to get it from other sets. the rest of the accessories, makes a very good stock up for future upgrading! overall: 9/10 this is not a playset. it is mainly bought for its abilty to mass recurit any armies, and is a main love for all castle army builders such as me! this set mainly have no major faults, and i love it so much. although, i have done some slight modifciations, but this set is a must for me to buy more and more! meanwhile, i will need to wait for the next shipment! hope everyone have enjoying viewing this simple review of mine! edited by whitefang, 25 may 2008 - 12:52 pm.

4 thanks for the review whitefang. i love these sets, and i wish they were available in nz. so far, it seems they may never come here... but i can sit and hope. i like the look of them after your make-over, a real skeleton army there! did you say you've bought 12! tht's lots of skelies. are you planning a big moc or something?

4 thanks, whitefang! castle battle packs.... simply wonderful! finally a dream came true, well done tlc!

2 whitefang, although i realize that the battle packs are great specifically for building armies, and castle accessories (which is why its such a shame that i won't be able to buy these things ), while sdpirate's sets are more for a catapult, calvary whatever. the fact to the matter is with the battle pack you get: 5 minifigs with lots of accessories. while with the sets that sdpirate showed us you get: 5 minifigs with an okay amount of accessories 3 horses (including two skeleton ones) a ballista a weapons rack, and a jousting barricade. you cannot say that the battle pack contains the same amount of stuff that the other two sets have and therefore should be priced the same. it just seems that lego is ripping off canadian army builders, to me if the battle pack contained a small catapult, or wall so that it contained about the same amount of stuff that the other sets had it would be fair. it seems stupid that you will only get minifigs from one set, while you can get about the same amount of minifigs plus a bunch of other stuff from two other equally priced sets. that’s why to me these battle packs are a rip off, because of what they contain, imho the battle packs seem to be only worth about 10 dollars.

4 thanks for the review whitefang! your additions look great, i like your mace much better than the use of a small technic cog, your looks much sturdier. and that helmet looks really great on skellie soldiers, i never thought to use that before. very cool indeed! ~peace

2 thanks for sharing these close-up images of this battlepack whitefang. i actually had this set in my hand at legoland cal. and could not decide if i wanted it. i'm currently out of "castle-mode" with my large indy jungle set up on the table, and creating ghost train mocs that are starting to line up on the bookshelves. once i buy the troll ship, i'll want to start collecting these great fig sets. thanks again for sharing.

4 welcome to cardinal brick's review of 7736 it's a small set but as i bought it the other day i felt that it probably did merit a short review. the box is ofcourse far larger than necessary! there's plenty of air inside. the contence is one bag and the instruction booklet, you could proably build it inside the bag if the desire took you. we have one new coastguard with the slightly stubly head found in the castle range and a trans-clear visor. the build was challanging and arduious the final product is quite nice at one ?3.00 it's a good set only 50p more than an impulse set and with enough extra parts to justify the increase in the price. a good set for a little gift or so on, the buggy moves well. there's not that much to say really for i can't really think of additional models to build with the parts but then what do you expect for the price. edited by cardinal brick, 26 may 2008 - 06:47 pm.

4 i recommend this lil set, it's a nice small set, and the vehicle does roll well. i'm sure many young builders would love it

2 i might buy a second one of that set, and build it in the bag. i just wanna prove that it is possible.

4 wow. i was skeptical of this coast guard line. though getting to see some detailed pictures of this set i really want to get get it. alas, i have not the money to get it and it isn't available in my town. oh well. maybe i can catch it on a sale at some point. good review!

4 great reveiw this is definatly one of the cg sets im geting i cant wait to get my hands on this set!

4 great review 5150 lego! the new camera was well worth it. you´ve got everything well done. i´m looking forward to your next review. meschepers, on may 27 2008, 06:22 am, said: wow. i was skeptical of this coast guard line. though getting to see some detailed pictures of this set i really want to get get it. same here. maybe in two days i can see it in real.

4 this has gotta be the coolest chopper ever. i love it its so accurate plus your review is great because it shows all the inner details

4 thank you for that fine review of a really excellent set, 5150 lego. i never saw a little 'juniorization' done that good before!

0 i could tell from the pictures that a lot (maybe all) the designs on the raft were stickers. in the whole set are there any printed parts besides the torsos or is it all stickers?

2 5150 lego, on may 29 2008, 07:12 am, said: thanks everyone for the nice coments! its nice to finaly have a camera that can take some decent photos! makes doing reviews much more enjoyable! there is no real way to lift up the stretcher. due to the crane arm being in the way there really isn't any room for any kind oflifting straps. the set does include a 1x2 plate with a hinge for the diver to stand on so at least he can hold on to someone, the crane lifts them up and then he can put them in the strechter. thats my guess at least. as far as the motor, i don't believe it uses bateries since you pull out the motor, and all the button does is recoil the winch line back in. i have to say it does a very good job of that, and is very smooth. (as long as you don't have anything to heavy) one detail i forgot to meation is the shark. its nothing new, just the basic shark lego has had around for nealy 2 decades, but it was a detail nothing less. thank you very much for that information, 5150 lego!

2 oke thanks for the tips, but you see that not blurry pics, i've taken them later, so now it will be totaly great pics! who want's the second riddle?

4 ???theriddler???, on may 29 2008, 12:22 pm, said: oke thanks for the tips, but you see that not blurry pics, i've taken them later, so now it will be totaly great pics! who want's the second riddle? excellent review! this and the other four batman sets are must buys.

4 thanks for those wonderful pictures and congrats! i think buying this on ebay was a good decision! i have no m:tron sets at all, but i like the mcm very much. it's just a wonderfully big set with many nice detials. lots of playing possibilities! i wish i had it too.

2 fun review, thanks! kinda sad to think that with tlc's recent ban on magnets in their products, we'll never see an m:tron revival ...

2 i love the design of the front canopy of this set, but i always felt that they could have done more with the rest of the model. this set is good candidate for customization though. there is quite a bit on unused space inside, especially in the middle section. i want to try putting a technic-style engine into mine at some point, along with the necessary gearing. i got my mcm brand new off ebay some years ago for a pretty good price, but the box was very worn out and the big trans-neon panel, which floats freely inside the box, was a bit damaged. as for the hose/jetpack things, i always assumed that they were either welding torches or flamethrowers. take your pick. quote kinda sad to think that with tlc's recent ban on magnets in their products first time i've heard of that. what are they going to do for the train couplings?

2 fluyt, on may 28 2008, 01:56 pm, said: since when is that? the new train couplings have magnets, only with a special casing. you're right, i should have clarified -- it's the old loose magnets that apparently are being discontinued, not all magnets altogether. as you noted, the new train couplings still have magnets, but they appear to be permanently attached to a fairly large housing, which i guess will prevent kids from eating them. but the old m:tron round magnet pieces are presumably discontinued.

2 thanks for the review, maybe i can pick one off ebay.

4 this does look alot better than the new mm drilling tank. great work!

2 zero1312, on may 29 2008, 08:22 am, said: thanks for the review, maybe i can pick one off ebay. yeah, i got this for only like 19 pounds, pretty cheap. it's a great set! cp5670, on may 29 2008, 08:55 am, said: it looks like you're right about the old magnets. i got a few off pab two months ago but they no longer have them. i guess i should grab some while they're still widely available on bricklink, as they can be useful in a number of situations. on a side note, one interesting thing about this set is that it seemingly had two us/canada names, mega core magnetizer and multi core magnetizer. brickset, lugnet and all the other sites i've seen call it mega, but i have some north american catalogs from that time period that call it multi and the box also says multi on it. i actually didn't know the mega name at all until many years after the m:tron line. hmm... i've never seen it listed as multi, but now i guess it has three names, strange that m:tron is basically the only space theme that had different names depending on region... clonecommando007, on may 29 2008, 10:11 am, said: this does look alot better than the new mm drilling tank. great work! yeah, i should take a comparison, yet the boxart on the mt-101 was pretty cool. sinner, on may 29 2008, 12:29 pm, said: thanks for an answer. i'll shut up now so we can focus on your review... it's okay, i have a question kind of not related to the review.. is there still a space review/moc index now that docking bay has closed? thanks again!

2 thank you very much asuka, but i get the hint. last.

2 darn you! making us wait like this. meanie.

2 why must you taunt us?! just kidding, can't wait for the review and to see a detailed view of ms. harley quinn! ryan

2 darn i was going to review this set. i gues my review will be second.

2 review...hurry! quick! you've got us on the edge of our seats with suspense!

4 grevious, on may 30 2008, 05:03 am, said: *gasp* are you kidding me? honestly, i hate this set. the batbike looks far too blocky, and that hammer truck looks super shoddy and thrown together. the only real reason i'd get it at all would be for the harely quinn figure - but i'd probably just get her separately on bricklink. besides, the tumbler and robin's jetski sets look far better to me. they actually seem to have great vehicle designs. no new villian figures, i know, but still some great old ones. er, wait a minute... oh yeah, hope your review gives the real scoop on this kit, deino. the batbike may look blocky, but the hammer truck is by no means thrown together. read the instructions, it actually has a great assembly. add into the fact it has harley, great wheels, a modable batbike, awesome stickers and awesome pieces and i'd say this was a win. the penguin is a bit of a repeat and the tumbler is too big for me. either way, it's a great set, batman 08 wasn't nearly as bad as i thought it would be, which is great. batbrick away!

0 so, down to business. the 267 piece set retails for $30 us what? but it's £30 in the uk! why, lego, why?

4 my set has arived! and i have build it, what a nice thing! anyone want a review for me? without blurry pics . who want's the second riddle?

4 brickadier general, on may 29 2008, 07:27 pm, said: hi all, so i was at "the wal-mart" yesterday and had the munchies and was looking for something to eat. somewhere along the line, i stopped caring about food and decided to browse the toy department to see what they had lego-wise. thank you very much for that neat review, brickadier general .... i´m glad that you changed your mind, a review of a burger wouldn´t be half that interesting for sure. it´s just a mediocre set to me, but of course it´s always cool to get important mfs in less pricy sets. i like the penguin´s sub from the batcave more, just because they did a fine job on resembling a penguin without using a sticker.... robins craft looks fairly nice, but the most useful parts of the whole set, for me personally, would be those indeed very neat green engines.

2 thanks . why isn't this set on s@h? who want's the second riddle?

2 iamded, on may 31 2008, 03:43 pm, said: i see you've also learnt to call dibs. looking forward to seeing your review!! ~peace nooooo! i'm not calling dibs, it's all going up this afternoon. i just didn't want my browser to crash and lose it all .

4 man i was hoping to be the first to review, ordered from tru 2 days ago. oh well this set looks sweet, can't wait for your review.

2 can't wait for the kick @$$ trailer review :d

4 that's an awesome review. and a great set, it seems. with all of this year's star wars (i still haven't got rogue shadow) i can't afford agents too, which is a shame looking at this.

4 thanks for another wonderful review, svelte_corps a very fine set indeed, i absolutely love the way all of the vehicles fit into the command centre, very clever. the projector is really cool, it looks very nice. it's great to see these light and sound bricks in the agents sets. all of the little nooks and crannies in the centre are great too, i really love the amount of detail featured, mixed with all of the playability of this set. the minifigs - as usual - are brilliant, the uniforms look fantastic. dr inferno looks especially great, i love his white suit with hints of orange, and who can forget his hair? i'm really tempted to buy this beast now, though i'm not sure my wallet will forgive me for it. i suppose i'll have to cut back on indy and castle multiples for now... thanks for the truly great review, svelte_corps, nice work

4 woah, i got to have this set! i shall buy it asap! thanks for the review! expertly done.

4 splendid review! i love everything on this set. no question 'bout it. somehow i knew i should have saved up and buy that when come to tru...but the sight of turbocar chase and jetpack pursuit was to tempting to pass up.

4 wonderful review - one of the best i've ever seen on this site. man, we thought this might be the weakest set in the line, but it turns out it may be the strongest! everything about this set - from the color scheme to all the details to the minifigures to the piece selection - is just wonderful! i think this set has finally confirmed it: agents is everything alpha team wasn't, and is how they should have done a spy theme from the start. kudos to tlc for finally getting it right - and i sure hope there's a second year!

4 wonder full job, but now my wallet aches in misery.

4 great review. i just got 7644 mx-81 hypersonic operations aircraft. it's a great ship. i started to review it, but then it started to rain (i was outside), so the review is coming tommorow. technicolor stickers! very pretty!

4 another great review. i'm looking forward to getting this set sometime soon. i wasn't aware of the power function aspect, similar i suppose to the old technic sets which had an additional instructions for those with the relevant motors. i knew those dino's i got at clearance would come in useful. nice to see the recent "bulldozer" treads appearing in black. grey seemed a slightly unusual colour choice.

4 well i guess its nice that they're making the story background a little more clear. with that jelly plugged into the power cable... hmmh, both jellies and crystals can be used as power sources, think theres a connection? both of them are transparent and greenish... maybe jellies hatch from crystals like eggs? or need them as food? or something important like that? yay for evil humans.

4 thanks for the great review sveltecorps. i bought some of the mm last year and ended up selling them off for sw. this new set has got me interested in mm again, partly due to your cool review! one question though, did you get this set in aust shops or s@h, just wondering if i should be looking for it yet? edit: sorry just saw your other post saying it was ordered from s@h cheers isc edited by i scream clone, 04 june 2008 - 08:08 am.

2 algernon, on jun 5 2008, 02:03 pm, said: why is it that agents and star wars get their own news articles but this fantastic set is totally ignored? i think maybe there's a bit of star wars excitement on the front page which has probably got a few members frothing with excitement. not every review needs to be frontpaged anyway .

2 no, but this is one of the most anticipated sets of 08...

2 well, title says it. the description, you'll understand later. i ordered this off of s@h last tuesday, and oddly enough, it's listed on s@h as mx-81 hypersonic airplane... i'd like to apologize for the random, horrible, faded pics. i took the review outside, and the clouds kept shifting, changing the lighting, and then i had to go inside because it started raining. it's been raining for a week. it's raining now, as i type this. so, i foolishly went outside to take pics. the front of the box. not bad, as far as boxes go. it features a lift-up tab... ...which shows the various functions. back of the box. still not much to say... two manuals. i think this is just right- not too thick, but not too many manuals, either... oddly enough, the box came with a little folded up piece of paper telling us not to mix the bags. it comes sorted into 4 bags, by the way. minifigures the set features 3 normal mm figs, 1 normal jellie, and one of the new commanders. i really like this guy. he has a few issues, like his hands being stuck sideways, and still being hollow, but still a great improvement. he'll make a lovely addition to any halloween moc. stickers the set comes with a fairly big dss for the spacecraft. pretty normal, but i do like the dragon sticker. then, suprises of suprises, a technicolor sticker sheet for the aliens! how cool is this, huh? the tops of the actual stickers are shiny, which is hard to see in the pic. even the bottom is shiny! who said stickers can't be cool? the mining craft the little guy is pretty cute, and well built. my only gripe is that there's nowhere to spin the drill! it seems so lifeless without a feature... the alien craft you'd think a commander would be important enough to have a seatbelt, rather than be stabbed with a clip and stuck on the ship like those other grunt aliens... i think this thing has some potential. shiny stickers, different body shape. and when you look at those engines, this thing could be an alien corvette! but then you look at the back. pretty bare, no flares or anything. it's a cool little craft, but it just...lacks. the modules these things have some potential, as well. with some modding, they could be pretty cool. unfortunetly, it's pretty boxy, there are no engines, and the wings are too small. the top is pretty nice, though. the greebles are all right. the controls, as usual, are a sticker. pretty spacious, mind you. the cockpit doesn't stay flush with the body, though. the front plate underneath it can be easily replaced with a brick to fix that. ...i'm not gonna comment on this. the main body too bad. the 'labratory' isn't much of a lab. a trans-red panel and some tray thing are all that compose the 'lab'. i was expecting more, but true to form, this mars mission set has no impressive interior to speak of. there is a lot of space, though, so it shouldn't be hard to mod. phew! the lab folds up like so. pretty simple, and would allow access to the lab, if there was one. and then we have this thing. what is it? defense laser? communications array? satellite t.v.? the modules connect like so (sorry, out of place...): too bad the pins stick out... various pics... as you can see, this thing has more of those bars than an at&t commercial... (there, you understand the topic description now? ) the rear. it uses a white city plane wing for the...wings. when i first saw the prototype pics, i thought they slanted downwards... that would've been really cool. ah, now to the platform. from the position of the drill, i think this could be a really cool turret location when i mod it to more military space. back to the bars. if we had space monkeys, they'd love this. this set has more bars than a jungle gym.( ) here we see the button that drops the platform. pretty clever, and it's not in the way. best of all, it really works! really well, actually. good job, tlc. 2 more bars and a shooter mechanism. jeeze, this is really setting itself up for a joke. a shooter mechanism walks into a bar... never mind! here we have the handle that allows you to pick it up safely. a good idea, but it's placed waaaay to far back, way off the center of balance. you have to hold on to it pretty well to keep it angled up, though it does stop your hands from getting in the way of the platform. ah! the platform in action. this is really a neat little feature. not only can the ship land in a reduced footprint, but it also prevents the nice white paint job from getting red dust all over it... it's centered pretty well, too, and you don't have to worry about knocking it over, just don't shove it back at all. here we have the latch. when the button on top is pushed, this gets pulled inward... ...which pulls out of this hole and allows it to swing neatly down. good luck, and happy mining!! again, sorry for the lack of in-progress review. i would've liked to take pics of the mechanism and so on, but typical of the mm sets, you can't really take it apart. well, this is really a nice set, which can hopefully be upgraded with a better lab with little difficulty. some of my military mod plans include: -strip the lab and install a command center -get rid of lots of bars. the thing has more bars than alcatraz. -install some turrets. this is a big command ship, so why all the forward-facing weapons? it'll need some aa defense... -mod the landing platform to be a troop dropper with installable aa turret. -mod the cockpit pods to be more aerodymic. so, that's all folks. shall i include one last "bar" joke?

2 mr. mandalorian, on jun 4 2008, 01:19 am, said: and then we have this thing. what is it? defense laser? communications array? satellite t.v.? that certainly feels like an homage to the deep freeze defender... which itself feels like an homage to the galaxy commander. is there some way to centre one of the cockpit units without massive de- and re- construction?

2 sinner, on jun 4 2008, 03:44 am, said: having a name like that is a good start! my screen name largely sums up my interest in lego, but is not soley limited to space. thanks for the warm welcome.

4 algernon, on jun 4 2008, 09:34 am, said: i don't understand why there's so much negativity... this is actually my favorite of the new mm sets. the finished look is very sleek and not very gappy at all. the deployable landing pad is great, and it'll make it easy to put on a shelf without taking too much room. lots of greebles... although i will concede that it's just begging to be modded. still, though, i'm definitely buying this one. :) it has a really great look to it! i don't understand the negativity either, one man's treasure is another man's trash i suppose. that said, having grown up with lego during the 80's this set has a certain nostalgia factor in its overall look and feel that harkens back to that earlier period in my life which i fondly remember. aside from the factory star justice set (elements of which i loathe), i expect the 7644 to be the closest thing to a classic space revival that we'll ever see again from the lego group, but i hope to be pleasantly suprised someday. though i'm not living in the past, and do appreciate everything lego is doing now and will do, and has done since. and, like you, i'm one who's definitely buying this set. no matter how few of us there may be.

2 iron moose, on jun 4 2008, 02:15 pm, said: do tell. (i'm being curious, not confrontational. ) well, first and foremost like many other people i'm no fan of those dreaded unprinted minifig torsos and stickers. but also the cost to piece ratio of the set, it just seems too expensive for everything that you get, such as too many small parts and a lighter than usual piece count for the price. though if it had included printed minifigs and other elements, i maybe would of been able to swallow its 100 usd cost a little easier. but star justice is still lego space in the most classic sense thats available today, and i will probably pony it up just because... anyway, i hope were not breaking forum protocol by not discussing the 7644 review of the original poster or that particular set in general.

4 thanks for the review. i actually quite like this. i can't afford it, so i'm not getting too attached to it, but in its own way, it's great. it's certainly reminiscent of space sets of the past, as others have said, and the drop-down ramp section is just really cool. as an idea, you understand. sure, the lab is a little crap, but at least the effort was made (sort of ). the sheer fact that it's so big though, really makes me like this. there's just something appealing about large spaceships. not capital ships, just big space ships. with lots of guns! spacefan, on jun 4 2008, 10:34 pm, said: anyway, i hope were not breaking forum protocol by not discussing the 7644 review of the original poster or that particular set in general. hey, it's no worse than batbrick and i. no, really, it isn't even in the same league!

4 thank you for that nice review, mr. mandalorian. wow. somehow it´s almost like classic space´s back indeed.... it´s a great star ship. it looks stream lined, original and impressive and even the huge plane wing part looks rather cool and smooth on it. it´s equipped at least with some kind of engines on top of the wings and although they´re made with only two a little 'juniorized' parts it´s better than nothing. there´s a lab or some sort of engine room with enough space inside to allow one or two mfs to play scotty.... yeah! the two cockpits´re nicely detailed with a cool use of these orange 1x1 round plates and to detach one or all two of them reminds a lot of the playability of the good old space sets. it seems even like it´s easy to attach them to some kind of cloud city twin-pod car thanks these hinged wings. looks like some solid fun to me. of course.... the cockpits aren´t airtight and even this reminds unfortunately of the post blue, grey and trans yellow era of cs. anyway, there´s no real fun without some moding i guess. another great advantage of the set´s that it´s not overpacked with shooting things. one technic shooter, cool in grey and only one trans orange prison pod too. well, i can surely live with that especially since it´s nicely asymmetrical. the drill rover´s very charming, a little like a rebuilt oldsmobile convertibe stranded on mars. sweet! and that platform feature´s plain nifty and well done too, very playable and useable for a lot of things. hmm.... recently i complained a lot about the dense use of studless technic beams for the inner structure of vehicles like these exoforce tanks par exemple which makes moding (in an economical way) pretty frustrating.... but the beams here´re used in a very proper way. it should be fairly easy to mod, let´s say, the back of that lab section up to perhaps even the cockpits to create a larger airtight area that could be boarded from the platform.... just to fit this certain spacers need for, um, realism.... there´re many more nice details too like that 'satelite t.v.' thingy and that cylinder with trans blue 2x2 dish for the knob or these cylinders with cones on that handle, and that alien craft´s pretty nice and detailed as well. like i said before.... i really feel like classic space´s back.

2 hey, thanks guys. so you tolerated the bar jokes and faded lighting? radiant7, on jun 3 2008, 09:01 pm, said: i appreciate your review mr. mandalorian, but why the negativity?. i'd try to find more positives about the set instead of kinda criticizing it after each picture. i personally think it looks freakin' awesome!. the size is very impresive and i nearly fell of my chair when i saw the first pics earlier this year. it's quite unlike anything i've ever seen from lego. algernon, on jun 4 2008, 06:34 am, said: i don't understand why there's so much negativity... this is actually my favorite of the new mm sets. the finished look is very sleek and not very gappy at all. the deployable landing pad is great, and it'll make it easy to put on a shelf without taking too much room. lots of greebles... although i will concede that it's just begging to be modded. still, though, i'm definitely buying this one. :) it has a really great look to it! spacefan, on jun 4 2008, 10:38 am, said: i don't understand the negativity either, one man's treasure is another man's trash i suppose. that said, having grown up with lego during the 80's this set has a certain nostalgia factor in its overall look and feel that harkens back to that earlier period in my life which i fondly remember. aside from the factory star justice set (elements of which i loathe), i expect the 7644 to be the closest thing to a classic space revival that we'll ever see again from the lego group, but i hope to be pleasantly suprised someday. though i'm not living in the past, and do appreciate everything lego is doing now and will do, and has done since. and, like you, i'm one who's definitely buying this set. no matter how few of us there may be. i'm sorry you guys thought i was being negative- i actually love the set. it brings a real feel of classic space to mm (no, i'm not talking in the third person. ). however, it does have its own small issues, which are nothing, really. i said that there's not much of a lab- but that's the beauty of lego. there's a lot of room in the ship, so it should be a piece of cake to mod to a bigger lab. too many bars? i'll take them off. i really like the set, i just want to change it to suit my tastes. it looks beautiful- it will find a home among my other mm sets as a favorite. iron moose: good question. it's about 17 inches wide, 11 inches tall (with ramp down), and 16 inches wide. as for the platform, it's pretty stable. it tilts back a small degree so it doesn't collapse when tapped on the nose, but i wouldn't leave it on the edge of a table while in that position.

4 i think this thing is compensating the poor lab with the bar army.

4 sorry mr. mandalorian, i guess i was just getting a bit defensive because when this set first appeared here, there were literally 2 pages of people just bagging out the new mm sets (but then the thread took a turn and people started to warm to them, much like the agents). i do agree that it definitely needs some mocing, but with that work i think it has the potential to be a really amazing set in terms of what you could cram into it. the lab is a little disappointing, i've always wanted an enclosed cabin space in a vehicle this size because then all the little space guys can have a true meeting place! the drop-down landing ramp is my favourite part, it has lots of potential uses. maybe it's even possible to integrate pneumatics :d

2 yes, the beard and hat are leftovers from what was meant to be a athos photoshoot, i was too lazy to remove them so... they are - 2 maps of slovakia and one of europe. stauder.

2 a very nice little review of a pretty nice little set that i wish i'd bought between 1 and 10 of. just for the griffin. oh well. your review has shown me that it's useful for more than just that, so maybe i'll try to pick one up someday. can't have too many black capes, books, or printed things. speaking of which: whitefang, on jun 9 2008, 09:41 am, said: interesting parts it comes with a wizard book, owl, 2 printed tiles with a spider and stone prints on it. the far right, seriously i don't find any good use for it. can any eb members enlighten me on that gray thing on the right? the gray thing is technically a plume, like any castle plume, except in this case it's a feather (presumably from the griffin), and made from the mold to the old indian feathers in the wild west sets. it's a case of an old part coming back for a slightly new use, in a new colour. beyond that, the "stone print" tile is a bundle or rolled up blanket or package, depending on where it's used. i don't think it's ever meant to be a stone. it was used as a rolled up pack on the back of the star wars speederbikes, for example. nice pics, plenty of useful information. i'd give this review an a+ thanks for doing it!

4 this is one of the few sets i've bought more than one (2!) of. it has a really good selection of pieces, and your review really does it justice, whitefang. multiple hippogriff/griffins on! edited by shoc, 11 june 2008 - 05:58 pm.

4 great review. nice set for plants, huh? too bad i didnt get thus set... but luckily my neighbor did! that griffin is nice for castle mocs, and that orange head (pumpkin, i know) seems rare to me. not much else to say...

4 ohhh great idea to review the "old" potter sets! especially the line from prisoner of azkaban... i was in my dark ages then. luckily i was able to catch up on the missed figs with one internet order. this draco is the best tlc has made, if you ask me. the new one (also doubling for belloq and "guards" in the indy line) doesn't look quite as hautain as this one. buckbeak looks cool. looks like his neck/head can be moved, right? rather similar to lego horses. well designed. the orange brick doesn't have a pumpkin face on it, right? unlike the one from philosopher's stone in the set with the troll. i'm looking forward to more reviews by you, sir whitefang! good work

2 i'm looking forward to getting this set, as well. the hippogriff will become the valiant steed to my princess minifig for her comic adventures. i'm really annoyed that the harry potter sets were released during my "dark age". i so would've wanted all of them.

2 great review as always, batbrick! ) i always enjoy reading them because they really make my day! )))) i hope that we shall see more and more.... good day, gentlemen! )

2 great review batbrick, i was curious as to what the interior of the building looked like, i still think that there should have been a few random chains or something lying around as they may add to the abandoned feeling that the ware house had. though i have to admit that i really like the roof dock and minifigs as some of them make good average civilians that are somewhat hard to come by in todays sets . great comic as well it seemed to add a lot to your review, hope you can review another spider man set soon . btw as adam mentioned i believe you owe me a bar of soap, for reading your review ... edited by mack, 14 june 2008 - 12:59 am.

4 great review. the hippy and the "story" at the end were hilarious. i think this was easily the best of the spiderman 2 sets. you're right though - it wasn't movie acurate, as the actual movie dock was far shabbier and more trashed than this. ah well, i guess tlc couldn't do everything.

2 a few years late, but great review! i really want to get this set!

2 y'know you can open the bag

2 now now, don't judge people who do this. there have been bigger sets that were done in the bag. to each his own :)

2 adik_sa_lego, on jun 17 2008, 10:02 am, said: now now, don't judge people who do this. there have been bigger sets that were done in the bag. to each his own :) you make it sound like i did something deeply socially deviating... like being an adult playing with lego but back on topic. open the bags? if they were meant to be opened, why did lego close them in the first place? bag building is not for everybody. some might become very frustrated with it and let their anger out on the set by lining it up on a mini golf course.

2 nice review. but i think bag building is a boring way to build.

2 i bought a tiny turbos set(a no-no for me) after i saw this "bag building." it's actually pretty fun. i built it faster than i would if i had opened the bags!

2 nice job with this review skipper

0 nice review! i echo the sentiment that more snowies would have been better.

0 nice review ! the "driver/pilot whatever you call him" ( ) 's helmet looks kind of odd, and why does have a long red pole instead of a kick-butt lightsaber?

2 vader had a red pole because i think it makes him look bigger and in the films i doubt it is but i think his saber might be bigger.

0 thanks for the review kimt - it comes at a... confusing time you can take off the top disk and lift it like the millennium falcon from the top now. i actually don't like this set that much. it takes about 5 hours and 15 minutes to build if you do it in one go, but the repeating sections makes this built the most tedious i have experienced. it has way too many holes from which you can see the colorful skeleton and is overpriced compared to the older 10030 isd. i remember thinking it was too expensive when it was 50% off at s@h! even the snowspeeder was "kewler" to less than half the price:

0 grevious, on jun 24 2008, 10:12 pm, said: thanks for the review. eh, honestly, i though this was awful ever since i first saw the pictures. to me, an incomplete grey ball doesn't really work as a special ucs kit, for the sole reason that it's boring. extremely so. now, the new death star playset is a whole different story. they should have done that in the first place. there's nothing to add to grevious' post. thanks but i never like the big grey ball. benny

4 great review kimt . i like this set (even if i don´t own it) because it looks simple fantastic to display. i just have one question: the mini executor can be moved around the death star ii or its attached to that place? thanks for the review .

4 great concise review kimt, though its not for me, you held my interest all the way through! thanks isc

(how many alternate models of the ds2 have you seen?) - the bricks are more varied. - you get magnets! - it is a larger set if you look at the size

4 dang! so much negativity on a such spectacular set! this baby provides an amazing backdrop to any lego inspired star wars diorama. and lets face it lego tends to be a rectangular brick and somehow we now have a sphere!!! guys... its a ucs. it accurately depicts the on screen icon and put plain and simple is a wonderful sculptural piece of work in its own right. i agree with kimt in that the removal of the laser and super star destroyer gives it more authenticity but to call it a gray golf ball or ignore its inherent accuracy is simply to miss the point. it proved to be the best build to share with someone, be it family or friend due, to its repeated sections and impressive finish. its a clever build and to criticize it for lack of playability or (i suspect for many) its absence of minifigs is just absurd and possibly why lego has not released a proper ucs in nearly two years. i reckon many out there would love a ucs tyderium, imperial walker or slave 1 with a spectacular piece count be it minifig scale or just darn impressive in its own right. sadly for those who love these sculptural masterpieces we're stuck with simple toys with 'play features' and cute minifigs. clever in their own right but lacking the clout and purity of the old ucs line. let's hope some diversity of product is just around the corner else 10179 was the last of the truly brave financial gambles of the star wars line....

0 i bricklinked it too back in the day. it was an interesting build - just thought building the "unfinished" hemisphere was kind of tedious.

4 i've just ordered the bits for this from bricklink (i'm awaiting the final order now) so i'm interested in these comments. i can see that, since i'll be building it with the kids, i'll have to plan in plenty of breaks and do lots of parallel building to keep us all from getting bored!

4 7656 general greivous's starfighter release: 2007 number of pieces: 232 minifigs: 1 brickset welcome! this is my first review, so contstructive critisism is very much appreciated! on to the review: first, we start out with the box: the box art is the same as always since 2006. nothing special. then we start the build. the build is fairly easy, and will take the seasoned builder about 15-20 min to complete. here is the finished model: and bird's eye view: as you can see, this ship is very sleek. the fins or "wings" each have an outer slope and an inner one, with the guns in between. there are also cones on the front of the fins, which give the ship an even more sleek look. in the middle of the wings there is the main body, with a big slope and stripes decorating it. this set has a very good playability factor, as i'm about to show you now. the guns on the ship are pretty cool looking to begin with; a bley slope attaching a lightsaber hilt and a trans-neon green stud to the fin on each side. but theres more than what meets the eye: yes, the guns flip up! ...and they can flip all the way back to hide them, for whatever case they need hiding. lets have a look at the back, there is a tail fin used as landing gear and some lightspeed boosters: but wait... the tail fin can flip up for flight thanks to a hinge attached to the back of the cockpit. heres another playability factor: the cockpit can slide open very smoothly and easily. heres how this is possible: a clever system under the hood allows the cockpit to open. see those two bley pieces on the black ones? those bley ones attach to the tan plates under the hood, and the hood and windsheild attach to the black peices. the black and bley pieces work together as a sliding system, so the cockpit opens. viola! and then the cockpit snaps in place thanks to the red hook and clip. its a very accurate system, and works very well. you'll want to open and close it over and over again! now, finnaly to the fig: the general himself. a very impressive fig, with a new head and torso mold. in this set, (which is one of only two with greivous in it) he comes with 2 green and two blue lightsabers, all with bley hilts ( ). i was hoping for chrome hilts, but its a minor fault. grievous also comes with a new mold pistol blaster (not pictured). heres the general in the cockpit (sadly a weak cockpit, no details): he just half lays down on a small slope. in this set, he doesnt come with a cape beacuse with it on, the cockpit doesnt close. thats about it, heres the... final verdict: build: 7/10 fairly easy but fun. a little bit weak. playability: 8/10 many playability factors, but some are boring or pointless. swooshability: 8/10 very fun to fly around, sometimes pieces break off. minifigs: 10/10 one amazing fig with 4 lightsabers and a new blaster. what more could you ask for? design: 9/10 very sleek, but hardly any real texture. i like it, but others might want greebling. price: 10/10 overall score: 9/10 a very cool ship with a very cool minifig and accessories. one of the best sw sets i have ever seen for its small price i highly recommend it to any kind of sw, lego, or sw lego fan. hope you enjoyed my review, please leave feedback! edited by jimbutcher, 15 september 2008 - 03:01 am.

2 you should have posted the entire review up! i am about to look at the gallery for the rest of the pics. edit: as soon as i post the images came thats weird. nice review, is there more it says i'll be back? good first review! edited by skipper 24, 26 june 2008 - 09:11 pm.

0 does the sliding cockpit come off easily? my friends brothers breaks everytime you touch it, but he may have built it wrong. it put me off the set.

4 nice work jim for your first review. i must admit the set didn't really appeal to me at first, but your review has definitely shown off the cool functions built in to this ship, well done! cheers isc

4 great review! i would get the set, but i'm saving for the clone wars sets.

4 great set, great review! i have it too and i am very glad to own it! it will probably be the cheapest and best way to get a grievous fig for a while (even though it doesn't come with a cape ). you guys know that you can use the new robot/skeleton arms from the castle sets to make him hold his lightsabers horizontically, right? i always have him with two of each kind of arm.

4 hello all eurobricks members, i will be doing the second wave of the 2008 impulse set series, which had released recently. i bought this set earlier ago, and will like to share this comprehensive review with everyone of you. name: troll warrior theme: lego system / castle year: 2008 pieces: 19 minifigs: 1 an image of a 5618, troll warrior let the march begin the mighty brave troll warrior, carrying a dangerous cart equipped with a "flick" fire missile. marching into the lands of the crown kingdom. crown knights must be ready for this new troll addition. from what i see, this set has a very minimum piece count since it's an impulse set. there is no unique parts found in this set. however, this set has a couple of useful accessories, such as 2 spears and 2 wooden wheels and a grey mouse running around. this set is another alternative for castle army builders to buy multiple sets, to build a massive troll armies. in addition, the flick missile really works. use a little bit of force from your finger and flick it, the missile will fly. well, it certainly does not impress me at all with such playing feature. base of the cart different angles there is one thing i dislike about this set. the wooden wheels are too big, and it is the same as the ones in the crossbow attack. i prefer the smaller wheels that exist in old castle sets that produced smaller cart. since this cart size is similar to the old cart size. the old wizard's cart is a very good example of the proposed wheel. bits and pieces close-up on the warrior and the mouse summary review playability: 5.5/10 (the playability feature is not fanastic.) design: 6.5/10 (design is adequate. if the wheels is much smaller and the flicking thing disappear, the score will be much higher) price: 8/10 (an inexpensive set to get a troll warrior and a mouse.) overall: 6/10 (to conclude, this set is good only for army builders. a new range of millitary vehicle to be added. that's all) hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine. comments and critics are strongly welcomed. pictures can be found in my brickshelf (when moderated) edited by kimt, 10 august 2008 - 01:29 pm.

4 thanks for the review. bearing in mind that the whole point of this set is to get a cheap troll warrior, i actually quite like it. the cart isn't brilliant, but for 13 pieces it's not that bad. the troll fig is great as always, and i guess the rats are always nice to get (not so much in real life though). the sets that contain the trolls have a fairly solid number each (i mean, tower raid has three!), but nevertheless i think i may have to pick up a few of these. whitefang, on jul 2 2008, 02:49 pm, said: in addition, the flick missile really works. use a little bit of force from your finger and flick it, the missile will fly. well, it certainly does not impress me at all with such playing feature. the troll's hands are going to get quite sore then aren't they?

4 guys, thanks for your kind comments. i am glad to know that you have enjoyed viewing this review. trooperdavinfelth, on jul 2 2008, 11:15 pm, said: it's a rat. i thought by calling it as a "mouse", it will be a little much friendly unlike calling it a rat. brainbox, on jul 2 2008, 11:20 pm, said: thanks for the review. bearing in mind that the whole point of this set is to get a cheap troll warrior, i actually quite like it. the cart isn't brilliant, but for 13 pieces it's not that bad. the troll fig is great as always, and i guess the rats are always nice to get (not so much in real life though). the sets that contain the trolls have a fairly solid number each (i mean, tower raid has three!), but nevertheless i think i may have to pick up a few of these. norro, on jul 3 2008, 06:10 am, said: a more affordable troll warrior for those of us avoiding the large sets (me) is always nice! thanks for the review! i must agreed with the both of you, that this is a much easier way to acquire these troll warriors at a much affordable price. i am glad these trolls are available in impulse sets. now, will there will be a dwarf impulse set in the future? i supposed that will be much interesting. g.l.man, on jul 3 2008, 12:15 am, said: its a good review but you forgot another thing. the troll needs a shiled like they used to in the 2007 castle line the sets always had shields for the minifigs and it could be better if it was 3.00 instead of 3.50 but yes it is a good impulse great army builder. if this impulse set includes a troll shield, my rating will defintely go higher. this is a troll army builder set, with minimum feature and limited weapons range. if the troll comes with an armor or a shield, i will think this set is worth it. troll armor is hard to get by, as it appeared only in troll warship and tower raid. edited by whitefang, 03 july 2008 - 03:06 am.

4 ah, sweet! thanks for the review, whitefang! i hope this set shows up in nz soon, i can't wait to get my hands on it! troll warrior on! ~peace

4 quote in addition, the flick missile really works. use a little bit of force from your finger and flick it, the missile will fly. well, it certainly does not impress me at all with such playing feature. something to toughen up kids fingers! thanks for the review, cant wait til i get this comes to oz!

4 guys, thanks for your kind comments. it seemed most of us here love this impulse set, mainly to build army. guess, i am a little bit too critic in my review. i was expecting a little bit more! nevertheless, i intend to buy multiple sets of this and build on my orc armies and split them into different battalions. this is indeed one of the better ways to acquire orcs. wilhelm screamer, on jul 3 2008, 11:30 am, said: i got two of these in the mail today and was so eager to do a review of it. thanks for saving me the work. opps, i was eager to do a review as well, when i bought these sets. i hope you enjoyed reading this comprehensive review. nikola bathory, on jul 3 2008, 04:08 pm, said: hey, your review is great (as usual!!) as for the set itself - well, it's an impulse set after all - small and cheap, nothing special. well, the rat is special, hehe, for me the rat is the most interesting in the set (cause i don't have a rat). i don't have a troll warrior either, but i'm not very interested. give the new theme a chance. i feel tlg have made an effort to revive certain elements that are present in past castle themes. although it is not as good as the past, but it is certainly better than the recent castle themes. shoc, on jul 4 2008, 01:00 am, said: why is mouse friendlier than rat? well, mouse sounded more friendly, because it can associate with tom and jerry. but, calling it a rat equal calling it a pest.. it's just a matter of putting it in different terms. that's all. edit: instead of posting another post to explain why i used mouse. i will write it here. tom and jerry is reflected as a cartoon. children associate jerry as a mouse, since its supposed to be heart-warming and make us laugh. in real life, there are many different pets we raised. one of the possible pets we considered is a mouse. mouse are supposed to be shy and friendly creatures that live in harmony. while rats lived in packs, hunt food in the dark and is widely regarded as a "pest". in this review, i am trying to illustrate rat and associate it with mouse by presenting it in a much friendly approach. there is no right or wrong answer. it's just making use of different words to represent how i feel towards a particular thing. edited by whitefang, 04 july 2008 - 08:08 am.

2 whitefang, on jul 4 2008, 05:43 pm, said: well, mouse sounded more friendly, because it can associate with tom and jerry. but, calling it a rat equal calling it a pest.. it's just a matter of putting it in different terms. that's all. the thing i dont get is how jerry is friendly

4 wow, what a great little impulse set! i relly dig the face as well as a chance to get some cool accessories like a broom, bin (no lid....sigh) and a mushroom top (hat). a really nice review and story too whitefang, i think this guy will be joining my set of lego when he shows up in australia. cheers isc

4 thanks for the review! poor little minifig: this guy has to haul the heavy machine all the way from the depot onto the littered streets to locate some trash, but when he has finally found some and switches on the machine everything will be launched towards his pants.... no wonder he's looking sad.... a nice set though, and inventive too! when it comes to streetsweepers, i remember getting the first of it's kind on my birthday in 1991.

4 thanks for doing these impulse sets, whitefang. this set looks like it has a good number of useful parts. i dont have the minifig torso or head, nor the oar or the life jacket.

4 excellent review; i like how the new coast guard sets blare out new when you see them.

4 thank you for the nice review. the set is nice, the pieces are nice. and the grey helmet is great for an additional star wars rebel technician.

4 i really enjoyed your review of the kayak! so many little things in one set that aren't currently in my collection. i didn't even realise it came with a buoy! cool helmet, lifejacket, face, and oar, i will definitely need one of these! cheers isc

4 one of the better impulse sets imo.

4 thanks for another review whitefang! this is quite a nice set actually. it evokes some of the design elements of the mx-11, while looking different enough to justify me buying it. the head on the astronaut is one i like, so even better. i hadn't realised it was that one actually. does 26 pieces make it one of the bigger impulses sets? i think i may have to get one, if not two... plus it's called 'crystal hawk'. how can that not be considered cool?

4 thanks for another great review! i definitely like this set. sure, the interior might be a bit bare, but i think that the outside of the base with all of the great lava and rocks more than makes up for it. it is a bit weird that on the one side there is nothing on the inside. but that's easy to fix. anyone know when this will be out in the u.s.? thanks again for the fantastic review!

4 droool must buy!!!!!! to svelte_corps: how on this wonderful planet, did you get that??? i thought it was coming in september!!!

2 darth_legois_619, on jul 7 2008, 11:33 pm, said: and thats not including 2 other sets that i dont want yeah, break jaw sets are generally worse than the other ones. anyway, the review was great. can we have a close-up of fire-arm's face?

2 nice set review i really liked the narrative for the review. i must have missed your custom base back in june, also well constructed and great story too!

2 ah, great review! i have always wanted this set since it came out, but with the price, i think i will get the mobile command center first. this will need serious interior mods, like i did with my dino attack chopper(pics soon).

4 thanks for the review svelte_corps, i have yet to purchase an agent set but i think that will change shortly. i am not a big fan of the stickers but the huge laser gun, the unique minifig design, and beaucoup trans-orange pieces have me sold.

4 i know the word "secret" base but whats this! the base is hardly secret with a massive laser gun and wide screen sticking out it looks good, lots and lots of orange! woo!

4 i'm still keeping my money payments until july 26th ...so i won't be able to buy this set unless i get some money prize or something however, i appreciate the review, and hopefully i will get this set sometime in the near future. i just love these new cybernetic arms

2 excuse me but..what?

4 when i got this set, my first rock raiders set, i thought it was the best set i ever had. maybe that was a little bit of an overstatement, but i like a lot, the pieces mainly, and this is a nice little review! are92 rowar, on jul 10 2008, 08:22 pm, said: omg iamded's torso! [ spoiler] oh my god!![ /spoiler] what would be more appropriate is commenting on iamded's torso saying "omg jet's torso!"

2 great review and such a nice figure! i consider rock raiders space too. i also consider many of the diver themes space as well... i've yet to own a rock raiders set. i have tried to buy a few off ebay, but they always went too high...

2 sinner, on jul 20 2008, 04:56 pm, said: i consider rock raiders space too. i also consider many of the diver themes space as well... me too. the rock raiders are very sci-fi, with the best lego space storyline. the aquazonies would be inner space rather than outer space though, but they look very 'spacey'. edited by shoc, 20 july 2008 - 07:45 pm.

2 led zeppelin, on jul 10 2008, 04:46 pm, said: you're supposed to slide the front of the hull off, rather than lift the top piece off. yeah, i was looking at the construction booklet and it reminded me of that (i forgot about it), but that makes it more fragile.

0 i'm not real fond of slimeface. he looks too much like the joker-bombs. i was hoping for something newer. the slime printing is a nice touch though. steve

4 thanks for review...(i hope svelt corps still reviews it ) slime is pretty cool, i knew about the torse for a while but its no less cool now

0 great review, rezourceman! your pics really show off the sub well and it's good to see the build in progress. i also have this set but i didn't apply stickers to the sub as i was planning to reuse the nice dark blue pieces. however as shown in your review they do brighten it up a fair bit. i can't say this is my favourite agents set; the boat is a little oddly proportioned and the sub, although retro looking, has practically no interior and would be difficult to customise to put more in (unlike, say, the clever job batbrick did with the penguin sub in his review). the sub kind of looks like some jules verneish sea creature - i would have liked it if they'd gone all the way and made it some kind of giant robot jellyfish or squid i do agree with you about slime face - he has a fantastic torso with all the slime dripping down which is a bit obscured by the air tank. it's really encouraging that in the last 2 missions we've had great extra villains added in. the only thing i would add about the octopus is that the glow in the dark plastic is mixed in unevenly with the aqua blue, so it doesn't glow in the dark evenly - it's kind of like the mars mission jellies in that respect though much cooler! thanks again for the great review!

4 darth_legois, on jul 11 2008, 10:28 am, said: [color="#0000ff"] *cough*alphateam*cough* i'd forgotten about ogel's mutant vehicles i guess i meant a bigger cross between the 8636 sub and the big squid from 7775 aquabase invasion - that is such a great design. sort of keep the retro feel but make it bigger. with the 8636 sub, there's really only room for one agent to sit and despite its size, there's just a few (not amazingly great) functions such as the hidden chest and missiles.

2 thanks for the review! it's great to see detailed pictures of slime face. the set looks good but not as good as some of the others in this line. great review!

4 aside from the price, i love this set! when i saw the prelim pics of agetns i did not like the theme, but all the sets are starting to look more attractive now i can see the cool features and details! as for this set, i really like the bad-guy boat for some reason and the submarine looks good - i love the dark blue colour.

2 svelte_corps, on jul 19 2008, 10:20 am, said: nothing is impossible to mod! probably the easiest part to change would be the front where the missiles are and the treasure chest slides out - you could make a sizeable compartment there. however the middle section is so narrow and the end fins are just that - fins - that it might be harder to expand without changing the shape of the sub. you'll find out soon when yours arrives! thanks for that info, i will definitely try anyway when i get the set, see if i can't loosen up a few dark blue bricks at the same time! svelte_corps, on jul 19 2008, 10:20 am, said: it's not really clear but since all the other mutants are evil (or at least controlled by dr inferno), it's probably a safe bet the squid is too. slime face's head is different to the joker bombs - different eyes and teeth (although the smile is similar i guess) and the slime marks are much more apparent in the flesh (or abs) although they don't photograph that way. joker bomb face below for contrast: ah, thanks for that info, i see that they are more different than i thought now. i hope the slime looks good when i get him! batbrick away!

4 wow, thanks for the review, that is one awesome set, slime face is excellent! i must add him to the collection, i think we need some new agents, there's so many inferno minifigures now... maybe next year? thanks again!

4 6927 all terrain vehicle year released: 1981 piece count: 167 minifigs: 2 list price: $14.50 a very unique vehicle in the classic space collection was this "all-terrain vehicle" which i always considered more along the line of a mobile lab. the set introduced/infused white and black bricks with classic blue space pieces. the result was this great classic vehicle. the set includes two figs (still red and white): here's a view of the vehicle which is really two components, the vehicle itself and the lab section: i absolutely loved the the blue windshield slopes (2 included), and the unique upside-down large blue slope: in the back of the vehicle is the blue lab: the back section of the vehicle has hinges that allow the jets sections to open: the brick design fits perfectly into the lab, and when opened, the lab falls to the ground: note: the little round trans. red 1x1s allow the lab to slide up and forward when the jet sections are closed. i tried taking off the red 1x1s and the lab does not lift as easily with them. the design is very clever, esp. for a classic set. here's a shot of the stand-alone lab: unlike earlier classic space windows, this set has train window frames with yellow windows. the top of the lab lifts up for playability: inside the lab are several computers and a swivel chair: back to the vehicle, here's a shot of the cockpit with white steering wheel: the left side has an upside-down wrench and black antenna: the right side, a walkie-talkie and another antenna. the antennas can be used as breaks to keep the middle wheels from moving: here's ashot of the under carriage: and a final shot of the complete set: for those of you following my classic space reviews, this is review number 9 of 10. my final review of an-all time favorite will be coming soon. hope you enjoyed this review. comments are always welcome.

2 thebrickster, on jul 10 2008, 10:48 pm, said: for those of you following my classic space reviews, this is review number 9 of 10. my final review of an-all time favorite will be coming soon. no more of your great reviews? why? a good review right here, got into the thick of the set without becoming boring with an absence of pictures or not having enough text. this looks like a good set and i'd better catch up with the rest of your reviews, asap!

4 give me an excuse to sneak into your house, and let me have a feel of these classic space sets. i never had a chance to have any experience with the classic space sets. through your recent reviews on these, it gave me a wider perspective of space. i loved to play space as a child such as the late classic and futuron sets. back to the review, this 6927 is a great mobile command center vehicle suitable for all kinds of harsh terrain in the unknown space. the 6 big wheels are real solid and firm back in those days. transparent blue windscreen at the front, is wonderful. i just love these parts, especially when it's in blue. 4 computer printed tiles. aren't lego so generous back in those days, when printed parts are more commonly available unlike now. it's a real nice set. however, there is one thing i don't understand about this design. why is the driver seat has a wide back with no cover behind? and, the command center has no door at the back? i understand that these space guys are always carrying their helmet around, for oxygen supply. i wonder if there is a better answer to it.

2 thebrickster, on jul 11 2008, 10:16 pm, said: yes. the extra space was probably for the oxygen tanks on the figs. it makes taking them off a lot easier. as for the lab/control center, i never had an issue with it being open. i think this was just for playability. one could always "pretend" that some sort of invisible force ray closed the side when activated. invisible force field/ray? that is a very neat idea. i don't have much problem with it either. was just curious about the design, as i am not very familar with classic space. i supposed the oxygen tanks is quite big to carry around, especially when the vehicle is so cramped. these allowance of space, makes them much mobile to move about in the vehicle. cp5670, on jul 12 2008, 02:39 am, said: i just modified mine to make everything fully enclosed: great job! thanks for sharing and answering the question i posted above. i love the way you modify the front and back. now, i need to find where is the entrance to the mobile command center.

4 i've always associated this set with 6929, the voyager. they're of the same timeframe and more or less the same style. 6927 is without any doubt my favourite ground vehicle of space. it was pretty simple, but it was such a creative set. the stories you could tell with this model... g... most defenitely in my top 5 of space sets...

2 wow! that brings back memories. i have that model too (in storage somewhere). the pictures are great. i will definitely be checking out more of your reviews.

4 thanks for the review, looks like a great set. i'm surprised that spongebob's bandage has a full body headprint so kudos to lego for that

2 oh so spongebob was the injured one. i thought this set depicted the episode wherein mr. krabs was the one rushed to the hospital.

2 great review! i want that set, mainly for patric and the spongebob with the bandage. but: why does bob have full length pants? i thought he wore briefs?

2 i ordered the set via s@h and it cost 34.99€ in germany, 37.99€ in belgium and 50$ in australia. it looks like it´s a exclusive set, but without the 2limited edition" sticker on the package. in the usa it´s not aviable, now. i think it costs as much as the rocket ride (30$). @ mrs pegleg: he has the same, short pants, like in the other sets.

4 thanks for the pics, this set is necessary for each spongebob-fan, it looks so great

0 the fish doctor is supposed to have a new torso.

4 ronan nissen, on jul 15 2008, 07:09 am, said: the fish doctor is supposed to have a new torso. says who? i think the one he has is fine...

4 i'm not a huge fan of spongebob, but this set i might want also have. maybe i can combine it with the city hospital.

4 thanks navy trooper fenson for the review - good one ! i really like that sb is printed! i will need to get this one when i go to the us in two weeks. copmike

4 there's a lot great pieces in this set, i would be willing to get the set just for them. thanks for the great review!

2 my fish doctor has the torso from 7902 doctor's car, which is unfortunate, because the other torso is more stylized and cartoonish, i think. however, i did have that mad scientist lab set, so a bit of digging through my old collection will hopefully yield the better torso.

4 baby catapult you say? puts a basenet to shame! top review by the way, lego drink bottles for the win! edited by mrs pegleg blockbeard, 12 july 2008 - 06:37 am.

4 nice review, good to see your almost letting your kids play with your lego i like the functionality of the baby catapult, its good that they include some working features in a build this big! are you not showing the figures because its really hugh hefners playboy/belville mansion? i dont see the grotto though, must be an add on set like the poor puppy! its just so darn pink

2 shoc, on jul 12 2008, 12:20 pm, said: a bucket, in disguise as a watering can... bucket, pale... same thing. its can be called a watering pale...

4 thanks for your report and the pics, my sister wants this set, but she's already got the last house and she doesn't play very often with it, but the new one looks very good, too

2 i recognize the clock! it came with my old airport set 6392 back in 85! in fact according to peeron it mostly came out in train stations link belville looks horrible to me too barbie-ish and does not look lego at all. would prefer they went with paradisa instead.

4 i got like 5 of theses hope we get the new clone battlepack, do you ever think we will? we will only get 5 clones if you buy all the new republic sets...

2 joey lock, on jul 13 2008, 12:16 am, said: they are not sold out! if you go into uk woolworths they have loads in stock! i live in canada

2 yet another fine review your getting my fingers bleeding from all this updating the review index keep doing that - reviewing that is. kimt

2 i believe there's another set that has star corps trooper with an orange pauldron. is it any better?

2 that's strange. i saw about 20 of them in my tru. anyways, nice review. i thought this set was great for armies.

2 thanks for the review. i want to add that the few parts which are contained in this set are very usable for own mocs. the rancor, on jul 12 2008, 11:11 pm, said: ...unfortunately the droid battle pack is discontinued for the uk s@h ooops - it's also not available in germany any more.

4 hello all eurobricks members and town lovers, this is my first classic town review. for today, i will be featuring the 6641, 4-wheelin' truck which is produced in 1987. for some younger members in eb, you might not have encounter such a baby roaming down the streets, horning at others with its big massive truck. considering this is a 1987 set, such a vehicle size is considered big in those days. name: 4-wheelin' truck theme: lego system / town year: 1987 pieces: 80 minifigs: 1 price: usd$6.50 an image of a 6641, 4-wheelin' truck *hello everyone* why the name 4-wheelin' truck? it is because this truck is equipped with 4 heavy duty wheels which is considered "big" among other small vehicles in classic town. please take note, most of the vehicles that are produced in classic town era, are 4-studs wide. this truck is no exception. meet the driver and his truck! this truck has a very good combinations of different colors that are common for most town vehicles. it made used of blue, white and red as its primary combinations. i find that this combinations is quite soothing to its eyes especially the blue bricks. in addition, the mini-fig torso is superb. the driver must be a great fan of this vehicle. i realised most truck drivers in the classic town era wear this most of the time. i wonder if its some kind of an organization? front view there is 2 red doors coupled with the truck, to enable the driver to get in properly. this vehicle is considered big in the 1980s. however, if you compared it with the current city vehicles, this truck certainly will not outsize the current designs. please take note of the wheels. the wheels are pretty different. i don't remember seeing these wheels in many other vehicles, maybe some members can help me on this. most of the classic town vehicles have a window frame on top which is known as a "sun-roof". in this set, this feature is also included. furthermore, the vehicle frame has a simple mechanism which all town lovers love. it is to lift it up and place their driver in and out the seat. most importantly, you do not have to take off the entire window frame just to put in the driver. different angles of the 4-wheelin' truck snot technique? back 20 years ago, lego had been experimenting with snot technique. you can see that the back looks very neat without the studs. in addition, it can be quite useful to place a mini-fig on top of it, or throw some baggage for some quick getaway. summary review playability: 8/10 (great addition to your town collection.) design: 8.5/10 (very good design. i love 4-studs truck. at least, it is able to occupy one side of the lane) price: 9/10 (an inexpensive set based on the 1987 pricing) overall: 8.5/10 (a must have for all classic town lovers, we have been complaining for more wider range of vehicle) i gave it a "4" based on my review score card. what about yours? hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine. pictures can be found in my brickshelf (when moderated) edited by whitefang, 13 july 2008 - 12:08 pm.

0 great review! but for the car: i don't like the color combination of red+blue

4 great review of a lovely set! thank you! sadly i don't see my 6641 really often, because it is kind of in the back of my shelf. but i might get it and swoosh it (?) a few times...! imho i think 6675 is a little bit more aggressive. cool! please make more!

2 glad you guys liked this review. bernddasbrot, on jul 13 2008, 07:33 pm, said: great review of a lovely set! thank you! sadly i don't see my 6641 really often, because it is kind of in the back of my shelf. but i might get it and swoosh it (?) a few times...! imho i think 6675 is a little bit more aggressive. cool! please make more! swoosh it around?? i will prefer to use it to "vrooom" it around on my road baseplates. bernddasbrot, thanks for reminding me of the 6675. i will need to find it and restore it first. meanwhile, watch out for more upcoming classic town reviews.

0 hmmm.... i probably would not have bought this as a kid in 1987, unless i had money to spare or the shop had no other set from space or castle, the two other big lines in 1987, and no better set in the town section. i think it's a great parts pack, but the model itself does not look very attractive. i never really liked those wheels, honestly. they're from the basic sets, mostly, and they work pretty well in those, but i'm just not a fan... the roof, on the other hand, was very popular and the blue modified bricks at the front were quite rare in those days, but generally speaking, this was not the star of 1987. gave it a "3"

2 zzz, on jul 14 2008, 10:49 am, said: ...the minifig is really classic, made only for this set... the minifig also appeared in 6395 grand prix racing scene as a spectator cheers rog

2 thanks everyone. glad that you guys enjoyed this review. rriggs, on jul 13 2008, 08:06 pm, said: as for the wheels, these were primarily technic wheels but did find their way into some other models. in white, i can only find a handful of minifig sets that they are included with. there's half a dozen space sets but, apart from the 4-wheelin truck, the only other town set appears to be the 6524 blizzard blazer (tractor with snow plough). the wheels were also in a train set called 4549 road & rail hauler where they were the wheels on a big forklift. i never realised that. i supposed these wheels is one of the earliest technic parts, appeared in system sets. zzz, on jul 14 2008, 05:49 pm, said: minifig is really classic, made only for this set (appears in some later train sets as well) and shows the exact image of the truck on the shirt, including the motor piece. one of the most detailed and loveliest little sets from a sweet era of legoland city! i will show it to you in a few days time, that this mini-fig torso does not only appear in this set. in fact, i am quite fond of this lovely torso with its symbolic truck printed on it. snefroe, on jul 14 2008, 07:37 pm, said: hmmm.... i probably would not have bought this as a kid in 1987, unless i had money to spare or the shop had no other set from space or castle, the two other big lines in 1987, and no better set in the town section. i think it's a great parts pack, but the model itself does not look very attractive. i never really liked those wheels, honestly. they're from the basic sets, mostly, and they work pretty well in those, but i'm just not a fan... the roof, on the other hand, was very popular and the blue modified bricks at the front were quite rare in those days, but generally speaking, this was not the star of 1987. i wouldn't agreed less. this set is a good to have and is defintely not the main highlights in 1987. this is actually a great add-on to your classic town vehicle collections. after seeing so many typical police cars, ambulance, fire engine and etc, i need more variety of civillan vehicles roaming down the streets.

4 omg, i have seen the light! will it be availeble from s@h? or is it just a promo? thanks for making my day wonderfull! dr. brick

4 it would appear that lego wants this beauty kept a secret...=p anywho, this is amazing. i found pics...somewhere...and...oh wow. this thing is a must-have, and i'll be saddened so much if i can't find it anywhere. i doubt they'd keep a set like this promo, though. those parts are great for town fans, castle fans, space fans...you name it, that set could be useful for it. ohhh goodness... ~trexxen, who is blown away by this amazing set...

2 bagh i missed it all i know is that theres a cottage and van! time for brickshelf no doubt they've been taken down to. edit: awsome just found the brcikshelf pics. edited by skipper 24, 14 july 2008 - 06:05 pm.

2 sounds cool but i can't seem to find any of these leaked pics, not even on brickshelf. maybe i am not searching under the right phrases. oh well. i guess i can wait patiently.

2 what's so great about the cottage? i do agree that the generator and van are teh pwnzorz. edit by hinckley: we prefer the use of real words here. please familiarize yourself with the member guidelines. thank you.

2 i now found pics, too. that's absolutely ! after 10188 town plan this is the best city set ever! i really like the neat landscape with the little hill (there are a bench and some flowers on it, too ) and this brilliant cottage ! great idea with that power function that the wind mill turns and then enable the lights of the cottage ! concerning the city theme i must say: in the last time tlg comes up with one great surprise after the other. does anyone know where and when it'll be available (this year i think - otherwise there wouldn't be already pics, would they?) and how much it'll cost (i think about 70 euros, what do you think?)? i only hope that it'll be available in germany, too, otherwise i would be really if i am not able to get it since it is a must for every city and environment fan! klaus-dieter edited by klaus-dieter, 14 july 2008 - 06:49 pm.

4 i recently got a few still sealed and new sets from the 90' on ebay, and after the rock raider's hover scout this isthe second one i'll review. i really like the space port theme, even if the sets may be more simple than earlier space city sets, i like the overall look and the color scheme. but enough of that, let's go on with the pictures! set nr.: 6455 name: space simulation station number of minifigs: 3 number of pieces: 240 release year: 1999 first again a few pics of the boxes and the instructions: the main box: this theme had a kinda strange seperation of the pieces, the parts for the control center and the shuttle are in seperate little boxes, and the others are in polybags with the models printed on them. also seperate instructions for each step: a general overview: we got 3 lovely minifigs here, from left to right the control engineer, the mechanic and the astronaut: the -i dont know the english word for it- testing-thing, the astronaut is being tested to hard nerves there the mechanics little car, on the back an extinguisher and a radio device is attached: the take-off station for the little shuttle with the shuttle itself on it: and without it: tools, tools, tools! the shuttle as stand-alone: i think that would be fuel tanks, i like this little detail: and finally we have the controll room, would have been better with seats, but it's alright: a really sweet mid-sized set if you ask me, a few juniorized parts, but it fits perfectly with the set. the theme itself is also great, and i wish that tlg brings it back, i could see stunning sets with the quality city sets have right now!

4 i got this set for christmas, and you gave me the feeling for wanting to build it again. thanks for the review!

4 *mini-bump* wow, i'd completely forgotten about this theme, which is suprising since i absolutely loved this theme as a kid (minus the sound n' light brick, which i thought was pretty big and ugly). sure brings back memories of looking at those little catalogue booklets that came with the sets.

4 the base of the propeller. it wobbles a bit, but doesn't fall off. very sturdy. right side of the rear propeller. and the left (and better) side. the tail. it uses construction similar to the x-wing's nose, but on a larger scale. definitely cool. a very neat part of the copter. the guns are constructed so that... ... they turn without turning the cockpit. the interior is rather blase, though.

4 another of my favorite parts - landing gear. this is the front section. ... and it retracts! unlike most ships with landing gear, this does not retract without effort (coughxwingcough). very sleek. the back landing gear. ... and again, smooth retraction. gotta love it. final score: 8.4/10 parts: 8/10 figs: 10/10 dinos: 2/10 copter: 9/10 value: 7/10 don't buy if: - you can wait for vikings - you don't like any set with stickers - you're not a space fan buy if: - you're a space fan - you don't mind stickers/don't apply them - you're like to create cool figures overall, i think it was worth the price, even at 605 pieces. however, i'd suggest buying vikings even considering this. well, hope this review (unexpected as it was ;-)) helped someone out there. until next time, bloody jay

4 i really want those figs.....damm you bloody jay!!!

4 thanks, bloody_jay. another brilliant review. i really like the helicopter. though i hate the stickers (it seem like there are a lot of it), it won't stop me from buying it. too bad that when will the dino line arrive in singapore. . . :'( guess i've have to wait for the meanwhile.

2 hmmmm . . . . interesting. it's a shame though, because i really like the guns. any idea when it should come to europe? edit: i've just scene the official dino attack site, which says they're coming to europe in october.

4 wow, great review, for a great set. thanks jay. i really like it, although to big for my city. :( i too really like the mfs. because of your review, i am definitely considering it. thanks again, legobmw.

2 mr. lego_bildur, on jul 25 2005, 10:53 pm, said: sorry for the double post, but i just had another question in mind: how long/high/wide is this "badass" copter? (including rotors). have have heard of as long as 25 inches for the length, but is this true or is it just an exaggeration? 25" long, and the rotors are 10" long each (making it 20" wide). hope that helps!

4 i love this set... and i wish i thought of the bridge piece idea! the only part i don't like is the lift... thanks for the great review. metalandi, on jul 18 2008, 06:53 pm, said: edit: oh damn, i forgot to write "review" in the topic title, can a mod please add this? thanks! done!

2 seeing the pictures in this review certainly reinforce my original thoughts on this set: here's an oil-rig mod waiting to happen...

4 excellent review metalandi. it's always great to see early pictures of new sets. this set really reminds me of an oil rig, and could probably be easily modified as one (if one wanted an alternate model). the two components that i like most are the boat crane and the control room, but other sections are pretty slick as well. are those printed pieces in the control room, or stickers? i'm really starting to gain an appreciation for these new coast guard sets. they've come a long way over the years: 575 coast guard station -released 1978. i picked up the control boat & tower (7739) a few weeks ago but haven't opened it yet). in any case, thanks for taking the time to review this set and share it over eb.

4 thanks for the great review. i'm loving this set a lot - it looks well designed, and the helicopter is awesome! plus, i love the new worker figure with the beard. quote i agree, this is a great set - one of the best of the cg line for sure, way better than the boat set with the tower on the bionicle baseplate i wouldn't say that at all - true, this base is bigger, but the other set was well designed as well - plus the included boat is wonderful.

2 i don't know really. in which country do you live? i haven't been to my local stores for a while now, so i don't know if they have it there, but maybe i'll find some time tomorrow to check it out.

4 nice review! this is just the "crown jewel" for the coast guard theme. i love the layout of its platform. it looks real neat to have it placed it in the midst of the deep blue sea, awaiting of any emergency rescue. sometimes, i feel that this set can used it to merge with my aqua raiders sets. i thought of using it as a land base, for the raiders to dock in their stuff before submerge into the ocean. ok, it's just a wierd idea of mine. just feel that aqua raiders and coast guard can work hand in hand, since they are naval expertise! it seemed, i can't view all the pictures somehow. nevertheless, i can still view some of it quite well. i love the command center. the amount of computer printed pieces simply make me smile, with the monitor, keyboard, radar screen and etc. the helicopter is cute too. however, i pity the victim that is loaded at the back. it seemed a little bit too dangerous. in addition, this set seemed to have quite alot of stickers, which can be quite discouraging. i do hope to see this set soon. so far, i quite like the current coast guard sets.

2 great review metalandi! thanks for posting it with a number of pictures, the only question is why lego decided to produce so many sets i want to buy in one year!

2 paramedic unit set #: 6364 year released: 1980 piece count: 140 minifigs: 2 list price: unknown well, let me first say that the english name, "paramedic unit" is not really a good name for this set. the function of a paramedic is to take a patient from an emergent situation, and deliver them to a hospital for treatment, generally an emergency room. this is a rather small "clinic" that i would imagine is more for family care than an emergency room. in addition, the car looks more like a doctor/nurse's car rather than an ambulance or emergency response vehicle. i would call this a "clinic" rather than a paramedic unit. in any case, it's a great set, esp. for table towns that need medical services. what i like is that this set is small enough to place anywhere in your lego city or town. starting with the instructions: like all the classic town sets, alternate models are pictured, although i never tried building one: i like the little medical bus/van. the set includes two minifigs, that include a female doctore or nurse, and what i presume is a patient, based on the torsos: i really like the vehicle. it's a 4-stud wide two seater: the colors work well and i like the use of the white bar between the seats (and the 1x1 blue plates for lights). unfortunately, the emblems are stickers. here's a shot of the neat little "clinic": i like the use of the blinds for the exam room. it shows that lego considered patient privacy when making this set. the interior includes an exam room, desk, and two blue swivel chairs: and a neat little eye chart: although the letters l e g o would have made a nice touch. lastly, a picture of the complete set: i must admit that i remember buying this set back in the 80s and i regreted it after taking it home. i'm not sure what i didn't like about it (perhaps the "girl" back then), but now i really think it's a neat set. well, there's a line of patients waiting to have their eyes checked... comments welcome.

2 thanks a lot for the review, brickster! i never had the chance to get some classic town sets, but i wish i couldve! i just wonder why lego cant release sets like this anymore....

4 brickster strikes again with another awesome review! ah, one of the few hospital related kits lego made. wasn't this the first hospital with modern minifigs? (because i seem to remember seeing an even older hospital online that had the armless, faceless figs). regardless, this would be great as a little doctor's office in someone's town layout - although the vehicle is a little silly. and that eye chart sticker has to be the coolest decal ever. quote maybe a tfol... well, it sure isn't me. i personally love older kits, even though i'm only a teen. i like a lot of the newer sets a bit more than some of the classic stuff, but i have always agreed that the 70's and 80's were an extremely high point in lego's time (even though i don't really own any kits from the period) edited by grevious, 19 july 2008 - 05:05 pm.

4 gave it a 4. it's not exactly town plan, but it's above average.

4 thank you for all these reviews, thebrickster! and: the idea with the polls is a very nice and interesting idea. (it will only take a while until i will have commented on all - so please give me some time. ) i gave this set a four: the vehicle, the minfigs and the design of the house are excellent - only the interior could be a bit spiced up (telephone, some other equipment). klaus-dieter

2 wow! old thread. just for the record, so long as it is here. paramedic's are advanced ambulance technicians. unlike standard emt's they are trained for advanced cardiac life support. they can push drugs, defibrillate, place a breathing tube etc. in the 1980's when the set was made, it was quite common for paramedics to respond to calls in "fly cars" or special response units. they would join up with ambulances at the scenes that required their skills. if you ever watched the old american tv show "emergency", johnny gage and squad 51 were one of these response units. they were mostly phased out in the 90's in favor of simply putting the paramedics and als gear in the ambulances.

2 cool review! i've always loved these "hard" looking tyres, i never understood why they don't make them anymore. they looked way more off-roadish.

2 thanks for all of your encouraging comments! i am glad most of you love to view our classic reviews. do stay out for more upcoming exciting classic town reviews! i appericiate greatly by all of your words. there are many outstanding reviews from brickster as well, especially those classic vintage lego sets, that i had never seen before, except browsing it in brickset. therefore, i will encourage eb members, to take some time off to view these truly wonderful classic reviews. trust me, it shall be an eye opening experience for each and everyone of you, whom had never seen classic town, in such an up close personal experience before. lasse d, on jul 19 2008, 12:22 am, said: this is one of my favorite town vehicles from the old time, and for one specific reason: the truck is on the guys shirt! it didn't matter that the color was wrong, or the hook was missing. i thought it was awesome beyond imagination... for some reason the torso is just lovely! i felt the 6641, 4 wheelin truck is almost identical with the torso, except for the front color combination. click onto the picture for an instant review. bernddasbrot, on jul 19 2008, 02:47 am, said: btw: the 6350 pizza to go van looks soooo cute! yes, that cute pizza van appeared for a reason.

(or did you have them to?) we have shell as well. snefroe, on jul 19 2008, 08:23 am, said: once again, i just don't know how you were able to keep stickers and prints in such a great condition! i am sooooo jealous! thanks, but these stickers are in pretty bad shape (esp. those on the fuel pumps). the tires were hard to remove. in regard to the cowboy hat, i think my avatar is still wearing it. welcomestranger, on jul 19 2008, 08:24 am, said: i much prefer the shell version of that station which had the full awning over the roadway, and the special road plate with the extra lane to pull into to fill 'er up... i have another gas station, but i think it's an octan.

4 okay guys, i have built the set! so let's review! set name: 7649 mt-201 ultra drill walker price: $69.99 pieces: 759 bought from: tor r us in michigan, us. the box: first we have the front. it shows the set, it's functuns, and the limited edition sign. the box is huge, about the size of the dino attack chopper set or the mars mission base. nowadays, most set that are $50.00 or more have a flap displaying the sets functions. opening theflap on this box reveals a gigantic picture of the set. and the back. the bags, numbered: next, the manuals. they have piece call outs, page numbers, etc. there are 2 manuals with this set. sticker sheets: they actually aren't all that bad. random manual image: build: first, we open bag 1. this will build the alien craft and the minifigures. now here we have some interesting parts. a green spine from exo-force, and a black rim for the set container stacker. next we start the build on the alien craft. it is pretty sturbdy, but has no cockpit for the alien. the alien stickers are really cool. they are rainbow-ish, and has a silver back. next come the build on the wings: and the finished craft. it is pretty good, and has a nice sleek design. however, i think i will use the large ship for the commander out this year to fight the driller instead. next is bag 2, which builds the rover and astro ship. first is the ship. it starts off with doctor inferno's colors. it builds up very nice, and the detail is absolutley amazing. next the roof is built. it has some speed racer slopes. the hinge piee now has a hole through it. sorry for the blurry pic: more is added: then comes the bottom piece. the detail is very nice, and the hinge piece has a use later on. then you build the crates. each one holds two crystals. added to the ship, also a pic of the finished ship. here we start the rover. it sports anice detail- the orange studs get coveded by the grill to look more like an engine. the detail in this thing is pretty good. it has a gun and shovel. here is how it fits into the ship: it slides in... and is secured thanks to the hinge. okay, so next we open the number 3 bag, which builds the body. here are some interesting pieces: then we start the build. it begins nice and study: i just love these stickers with the bulldogs on them: more of the build, with the stickers added: next we add in the front part. the detail is again, outstanding. with the turntable added. it can move down as well. the next step is to build the water tank. it utilizes the bionicle boosters(big white things) and added to the walker: then we build that drill. it uses a lot of rims and such. with the gears added: the front part uses a lot of those new droideka 3-prong things. and bionicle eyes. the drill can spin thanks to the gears. and added to the vehical: next is the cockpit. it has a nice space for the astro's bckpack. added: the final stage is the legs. thank god they aren't like striking venoms. they are all the same, however. see those two rubber parts? those keep it in place when on surfaces like glass. next come the large part of the legs. these are similar to the assault tiger's legs. the final result is very sturdy, thanks too... notice the amazing classic space sticker? so we finally come down to this: the final result is amazing. it is sturdy, and has great detail. it is very realistic. and, when the ship is removed, the drill goes down, and the turret is aimed up... hope you all enjoyed the review!

4 i can't wait. the set looks really good, i don't know why but i think it looks a bit like the star wars at-te. edited by skipper 24, 19 july 2008 - 04:22 pm.

4 can't wait, ~vbbn~. i probably won't buy it, but it'll be nice to see a review. well, the awesome mars mission set was matched with an awesome review! good job ! edited by adam, 21 july 2008 - 02:25 am.

4 best mars mission set ever deserves a great review. :d

2 anyone know the us release date?

4 wonderful review. i'd die if i had to upload that many pictures... man, this is it: the pinacle of mars mission's second and final year. man, this baby is flawless. there are so many indications that the designers took care in designing this kit - like the space for the pilot's backpack, the compartment for the mini flier, the sturdy leg design - etc etc etc. kudos to tlc for making mars mission go out with a bang. i have high hopes that whereever the space theme goes next year, tlc will make it worth the wait. edited by grevious, 20 july 2008 - 05:43 pm.

0 nice review! i don't mind the set, but, at the same time, i'm not particularly fond of it.

0 sweet review, metalandi! this set always looked a bit too busy for my liking, i guess i just didn't expect to see a set so tall. after seeing your review though, it is growing on me. i like all the play features, and at the very least it's a great parts pack. two things i'm confused about though. in this pic, is that dragon being used as a swing set? and i don't get why the area where the witch casts her spells on the second floor is green. green in castle means grass (or forestmen... ), and having grass on the second floor of a building is just weird. i understand that it's modular and thus it would make sense if it were placed on the ground, but dark grey would make just as much sense, and would look much better than the green there imo. anyway, i'm just fussy. thanks again for the cool review, will we be seeing any more? ~peace

2 i love the reviews of older sets that i never had. also, tiny thing, but you said it has 7 minifigs, but the group shots only include 6. the last guy isn't shown until the very end.

0 @iamded: yes it seems the dragon is used as such in the picture of the alternate model, but i guess bad and evil knights also wanna have some fun sometimes you are right with the green plate on the second floor, it does look a bit disturbing. but that can

4 sandy, on aug 5 2008, 06:21 pm, said: my first post in this topic looks foolish now that i bought this set from ebay. i just really wanted the minifigs (although i already had the batlord and the black dragon) and the parts. they will help me greatly in building the impenetrable fortress of the dragonwarriors for my princess quest comic. by the end of this week, this set will be in my clutches! great! can't wait for the next installment! good review, the pieces are so shiny and new... all my space sets aren't shiny... or new... this is an excellent castle, i got it the day it came out, it has a lot of playability.

4 metalandi, on aug 6 2008, 01:40 pm, said: well, that the bricks look new comes from that they are new. i got this set new and unopened i know, pretty good deal!

4 lovely!! i can't stop making comparisons between this fire station and last year's, which is also very well detailed, with great features and awesome playability. the concept design of the second one it's very much like the one reviewed here. this is good as tlg is taking back those great values to make the new excellent sets we all are enjoying by now!

4 great review. i love tis set too, the best firestation ever made by lego. mainly because the '80s sets are the favourite with me. only i miss a helicopterplatvorm, well i made a little modification:

4 i am a proud owner of this set this is one of the best fire stations ever. what amazes me is what the designers made with only 368 pieces. you get a very nice looking building in good size, a good baseplate, 2 cars, 4 minifigs, accessories... and great alternative ideas in the back of the box (like the fire boat or helicopter). this is a great example of lego design.

4 i must agree great fire station, i love the fact that in the classic sets you were given a base plate and some other great idea's. i do miss the addition of base plates and alternate building idea's. the only newer set i have seen with any alternate build photo's is the 7239 fire engine. i miss back when.......

2 great review of a great set! sadly, i don't own it. as for the alternate building idea's on the back of every box - yes, i miss that as well! i really miss it!

4 great review, great set. nice look, great features, very playable.

2 this brings back a lot of memories as i used to have that set when i was a kid..... great review!

4 fire copter 1 this is fc-1, over. i'm making my way to main street now. the smoke is coming from the legoland hotel, over. that's a roger. i'm going to shoot the 500 gallon now, over... fire in your tabletown? no problem. lego's set 6685 fire copter is sure to put it out - classic style. set #: 6685 year released: 1982 piece count: 99 minifigs: 1 list price: unknown here's a great fire-themed addition to your classic legoland display. starting with the instructions: the set includes one classic fireman with a nicely printed fireman torso: what a great little detailed helicopter. i love the use of the red and yellow colors: the front opens to allow your fireman to quickly climb in: in the back are two round yellow 2x2 bricks for the water supply and a hose connected on each side. unfortunately, i lost one of the hoses. and the entire set. isn't she a beauty? 6685 fire copter 1 is a great supplement to set 6382 fire station released one year earlier. after buying this great little set, i had fun puting out fires all over my tabletown. oops, i think i smell one now...

2 here you go: edit: all done edited by jameseh, 21 july 2008 - 05:41 pm.

2 oh thanks, im curious to know, did you get an extra set of clone gear, someone said they did.

4 thats much better. so far looks like a great set! thanks a lot for the review1 dp ps. pspguy, i sense some subtle product placement in your sig.... edited by darthperson, 21 july 2008 - 05:40 pm.

4 it looks amazing, i cant belive its actually bigger than the first one. id still like an answer to my first question, but my mind is set im going to get two !!

2 can i see a close-up from that bacta tank?

2 skyotic, on jul 21 2008, 07:18 pm, said: can i see a close-up from that bacta tank? also, could we see a close-up of the inside or the gunship and cockpit? (inside meaning the the back view, rooms, compartments...) thanks

2 i have a question, what is the door above the gun for? (pic)

0 this sounds very similar to the first one. i'm glad i'm saving this one till later in my purchasing cycle. all the sw walkers have a skeletal fram with almost nothing inside. it's very disappointing, but i guess filling them in would up the piece count considerably. does this beast have any good handholds for picking it up? i seem to recall a handle or something coming out of the top in the pre-release pics.

4 so basically, you cited as faults what everybody had been complaining about since the first information of the set arrived? skeletal interior and lack of clones? although i didn't realize it didn't have numbered backs. that really is just ridiculous. lego finally comes up with a very intelligent solution to the frustration seen when building large sets, but then they neglect to implement it. wtf? lame. still, this may be the only clone wars set i buy besides the exclusives. the exterior, which imo is the only part that matters, looks so fantastic. i don't care about clones, i have enough of those already. and at 90$ it's still a better buy than the rgs. the torrent is cool but not as cool as the fighter tank or dgs imo. awesome in-construction pics.

4 funny minifig actions there. i do love the at-te, a definite buy for walker fans.

0 probably my most wanted set(rgs is too much), but this seems a 'lil overpriced, i mean $90 for a skeleton? ii'll wait fr it to go on sale(which i doubt it will)

2 cagri, on mar 10 2009, 10:10 am, said: sorry for reanimating this topic. there is a technic brick in the mid section of this set. does anyone know the function of that ?? presumably for the handle which we now the use for (laat/c)

2 thank you that was what i guessed :) but i didn't see any detailed pictures of 10195, do we have the instructins or something now? is that how dropship lifts the walker ?

2 i dont think we have instuctions yet... but on topic, i have an at-te in the mail, on the way, so i should have a review of it in the next week or so. jifel

2 exactly kim, that's what i meant. i pondered and wondered that for a long time :) i decided to ask here when a friend wondered the same thing. i hope it fits with the new droship. it would be really cool. and it's also great that tlg knows what they'll be prodcuing a year later..

2 yeah, when i built it, i wondered for a long time. i considered many possiblities temporarily, like either tlc had gone crazy or i had missed a page in the instructions.

4 7676: republic attack gunship number of pieces: 1034 number of minifigs: 5 price: 119.99 usd brickset hey everyone, i just got the rgs yesterday at tru after i came home from camp. i saw all of the topics that i missed, and noticed a mini-review and a review with one pic, so i thought i'd make a huge, shiny new review that has lots of pictures and all of the requirements of kimt's index. note: i did not apply any stickers to it, as a personal liking. so, lets start by looking at the box: a shiny, clean, and futuristic box, quite different from the other star wars box designs before this. there was so much clone wars merchandise with this font and design in the huge display at the front of my local toys r us store, and not just lego. it so beautiful, with the white and sky blue... anyways, for some reason, the boxes of the new clone wars sets seemed more shiny than usual. maybe it's because they were just shipped, but once you pick up the boxes, they will feel really good in your hands, despite the fact that only about half of the space in the boxes are used... the back of the box: the back shows all of the main features of the set, plus pictures of the three other clone wars sets meant to be released alongside this one (although i did spot the twilight and homing spider droid, which were supposed to be released in september or october). so, on to the gunship: built straight from the bags. it took me about 4 1/2 hours, with breaks. it has an overall great design, but somewhat fragile, especially when building it. the cockpits always fall apart when opened, as well as the bubbles on the wings (which i will get into more later). the color scheme is very well done. you can always find the piece you're looking for thanks to the color diversity: red, dark red, lime green (ooh!), blue, black, tan, light bley, dark grey, yellow and white. also, split down the middle vertically, the ship is almost all symmetrical. front: side: now, lets start with the many features that this set is hiding. the front has lots of lime green, a rare color. but more importantly: ...a rotating gun is found on each side. they rotate in a pretty wide range, although fragile. cockpits: there are two main cockpits, right next to each other. not very detailed, and are the same. and for some reason, the whole cockpit element flips up to reveal: ...nothing. just the skeleton of the ship. probe droid storage: above the cockpit lies a plate that can be flipped up to reveal a storage area that holds: two of these probe droids. at least, that's what i think they are. hull: in this pic, two features are hidden. mobile command center: the first of the two is a mobile command center, but essentially just a hover chair. it is found by flipping up the two panels on either side of the hull. bacta tank: the second is the bacta tank found by just sliding it out of the storage area behind the mcc. one half of the tank opens: ...so a minifigure can go inside and heal his/her wounds obtained in battle. cargo hold: now, this is probably the main feature for this set. the two sliding doors (two on each side) slide open thanks to a clever technic mechanism. not much in here, just a gun holder and a place where the passengers wait to be dropped off in battle. speeder bike: i guess you guys saw it, the speeder bike. it is found by opening the rear flap. the bike is very cleverly designed by using a brown trike body. it's only a few centimeters shorter than the bike found in the clone battle pack. rear gun: just a gun similar to the front ones. engines: huge engines (or are they cannons?) that are really fun to build. they really give that cartoon feel to this set. missiles: in between the engines are two sets of four flick-fire missiles. bubble cockpits: there is one bubble cockpit on each wing that supposedly control the turrets at the front. very fragile. storage containers: two storage containers on each side hold the clone accessories. but, i wouldn't recommend putting them in there, because the antennae can fall out, or you might forget about them. sticker sheet: the dreaded sticker sheet (dss) has all of the stickers you need for this set. unfortunately, mine was crunched up. i don't like stickers much anyways, but i might still apply some. note the republic symbol stickers, why couldn't tlg just use that printed piece from a few years back? also, you get to choose between a bird-rat thing or a sleeping twi'elk as your hull decal. what they're for, i don't know, looks like the movie or show will explain it though. minifigs: finally, the five minifigs of this set. they are all great figs, including: commander cody: amazing, especially with the gear. the orange is nice, but i thought he was yellow. clone trooper: again, amazing. the gear is great, and the new helmet and torso are great! all of the clones in the clone wars line have the same heads. also, you can see the flesh beneath the helmet. asaaj ventress: not so happy about this one. the torso and dark blue legs are cool, but the dress is pretty ugly. the head is alright, but could do without the cartoon-y face (yeah i know, its from a cartoon). also has purple markings on back of head. obi-wan kenobi: pretty cool, besides the face. cool hair and torso, though. plo koon: beautiful! the true gem of this set, in my opinion. the head is the same material as kit fisto's. and the tosro is awesome, good for making a custom ki-adi mundi. well, that's about it, here is the... final verdict: build: 8/10, very fun and easy, should take the seasoned builder about 4 hours. somewhat fragile. playability: 9.5/10, lots of fun features, although some can break easily. swooshability: 3/10, i wouldn't recommend flying it around much, as you can barely pick it up safely. but with two hands gripping the bottom firmly, it can be moved around, but not spun or swooshed, etc. minifigs: 8/10, all very great figs, especially plo koon, but could have included more clone troopers. design: 7.5/10, some excellent ideas included in here, although some spots are very fragile. price: 7/10: should have been only 100 usd if not for the new molds. plus, at tru, it was 130 usd. overall score: 8.5/10, a great set to have for your star wars/ clone wars collection, with some flaws. save up for this one. so, how did you like my review? your feedback is much appreciated! jimbutcher, out. edited by jimbutcher, 15 september 2008 - 03:06 am. indexed

2 okay, if this were the first review of the set, i'd understand your want to reserve a thread for your review, but seriously, there are already reviews out there. couldn't you have just waited at least until you had actually built the thing, or even better, until the review was actually done? sorry if i'm being to harsh but i'm quite sick of these "blablabla set review - will be up soon...". it's getting quite annoying. ~peace

2 thank you oky wan, and apologies to the rest of you guys, i guess i was rushing a bit and didn't think this through, it was wrong of me to reserve a review, if someone does an in-depth review before me, someone please close this topic. otherwise, i guess i will do it. again, many apologies for opening this topic before i actually had a review, bad example from me, very sorry!

2 thanks for the positive comments everyone i’d noticed that although much discussed, no-one on eurobricks had written a comprehensive review for it. i thought this set more than deserved one! i’ve just posted my newest review of the dwarves' mine defender here: http://www.eurobrick...showtopic=19931

4 when i first saw this topic, i thought, "oh, great, another review of this set..." however i'm glad you posted it now, your pics are great and, well, it was just a generally good review! i'm looking forward to seeing more... ~peace

4 whitefang, on jul 30 2008, 12:56 am, said: pedro, for your first review, you have amaze me with your photo session and the strucutre of your review. i am very impressed by your high quality pictures. you have done an excellent job! i completely agree. this is an amazing review - bits of humor, great photography, and detailed descriptions/photos. based upon this review i've placed an order for this set (along with some convincing from amazon's 20% sale ). the only drawbacks in this set that i can see concerns the tower with it being 1) small compared to the seige tower and 2) missing a few walls. however, this is also the joy of lego as one can simply purchase a few bricks and build their own walls and/or expand the tower's size (or even attach it to a castle). of course, this increases the price of the set, but considering how cheap bricks are on bricklink, tower raid is still a very good value. i hope you continue doing reviews, pedro.

4 i have one of these and must say that this is the best castle set in the theme, and the most useful parts pack for its size yet.

4 nice short review, although a little hard to read. i agree that this set is a really great one.

4 i really liked this set, it's cheap and comes with a good supply of flesh heads and the new hair mold. i love the tent too. i'd give it a 10/10.

4 i give it a 10/10 for the parts. that's the reason i got mine.

4 i picked this up last weekend, mainly also for parts. it came with two mutt heads instead of a irena head. :( but anyway, it's a nice little $10 set...we need more sets like this that include these myriads of "detail" parts.

2 i was tempted to go buy this setbecause i havn't got a indiana jones . but when i went to get it and there was none .i still havn't got a indiana jones

2 hello again! wow, this really is an in depth review! at first when i pictures of the set i thought... "yeah, kinda boring." but after reading your review, i think i might buy it (when it's cheaper). the pieces look very good, and i love the droids and their accesories! thanks for the review! also, awesomestar, i knwo it is a default thingy but it would be good if the quote was taken out of your post as it does clutter up the topic (or "yopic" as dsr calls it).

0 darthperson, on jul 29 2008, 07:15 pm, said: did you really need to quote the entire review, i had to scroll down for about five minutes to see the rest of the thread.... well sor-ree! alright, i'll remember next time.

4 it's definately the street sprinter for me! there are many reasons for that, most of which have been mentioned by others already: i hate yellow, it's the most useless color, but i love tan and dark red. it's bigger and more detailed than the coast guard one. plus, i think there is a hinge in the back of it, so there is apparently some more playability to it as well. i love the post-apoc style fig! it's detailed and simply looks cool! also, while the digger fig has quite an individual look to it, the coast guard driver has the generic hero head and coast guard uniform. it's an overal better deal, especially if you count the ludp which gives the set a whole lot more playability, no matter how u the ldp may be. tan & post-apoc figs on!

4 i like the coast guard one, but dinos eat coast guard people, so dinos ftw. and i think the dino bike would fit in with my collection pretty well.

4 dino attack for me! you just cant say no to a huge bazooka! though the tan and dark red works for me too

4 the rancor, on aug 2 2008, 09:39 am, said: i wish i had that but i'll have to make do with the much less violent european version (dino '2010' not 'attack') here's a comaprison... european version: usa etc. version: there's a subtle difference, but i prefer the us one i did not know that europe had a different quad (or at least one without the bazooka). interesting that the gun was removed from the european sets, or added to the us sets. i sort of like the chain. i also notice a big difference in the boxart. destroyed city to prehistoric volcano. i wonder if the story was different as well? thanks for sharing a good picture. ----------------------------------------- well, it does look like the dino quad has the upper hand; almost double the votes.

4 price: 569 kr minifigs: 2 pieces: 592 stickers: 9 (my sticker sheet wasn’t curled up) overview: before i start i will apologize for the bad quality of the pictures. it is getting dark here right now, so some of the pictures are a bit dark. 1) minifigs: the set comes with two of the new clone wars clone troopers, which in my opinion are pretty cool. it also comes with two short blasters and a bag of clone accessories. figs with helmets: figs without helmets: 2) the tank: this thing is huge (25cm long and 22cm wide), and far oversized in my opinion, but looks great nonetheless. i very much like the white and dark red color scheme, mixed with a bit of lime green (even though there is no lime green bricks ;) ). left side: right side: back side: both of the wings contain a hidden compartment to store the blasters and a part that rotates to reveal three flickfire missiles. the front opens up as well to reveal the engine. the side guns and the gun on the top rotate. inside the cockpit is space for two figs; one seated in front of two computer screens and one placed in a moveable seat, which moves up and down, allowing the fig to pop up the top hatch and staying hidden while the hatch is closed. this function is triggered by opening the backdoor. hidden compartment and missiles: engine: top hatch (open/closed): interior: 3) rating: build: 9/10 not much to say here. minifigs: 7/10 an extra fig or two would have been great; eventually a jedi or a commando. design: 8/10 this only looses a couple of points for being oversized, but it’s a great looking model. parts: 10/10 at 592 parts, this is one of the cw sets with the best parts/price ratio. price: 8/10 sure this thing is great, but i think its overpriced at 569 kr. (approx. $120). when build it feels more like a 450 kr. set. final verdict: 9/10 despite some flaws this thing is definitely recommended, and it looks great on your shelf, too ;)

0 finally a review of this, thanks! 120 bucks? this tank looks tiny and though it's amazingly detailed it should have been smaller and only 40/50 bucks at most. it just doesn't play that big a part man. good pieces and mechanisms but no one's going to both buying a 120 buck tank, no offence, not unless it it's the at-te.

4 thanks for the review, christian, i was hoping for one soon . this set really looks good, but as you said, rather big. the figs are good, and i agree that ki-adi mundi should be included. i like the hidden compartments for the blasters and missiles, and the cockpit is really cool, considering it seats two (i thought only one). i will surely pick this up sometime.

2 deinonychus, on aug 1 2008, 08:06 pm, said: one question... do the top panels on the rotating rocket assembly mounted in the skids pop off regularly when you flip them back and forth? the ones on the version i built from the instructions posted online seem to eject with the slightest provocation they do fall off from time to time, but not as easily as you describe. skipper 24, on aug 1 2008, 08:13 pm, said: i'll probably get this in hong kong where lego is cheap next time i go there to visit my relatives. also pretty nice review, a few more pics couldn't hurt. also are there just two of the same white control computers for the controls? that's what it looks like in the instructions. yes. its two identical white slopes decorated with computer screens.

0 thanks for posting the review, i’ve been wondering about this set. to me it does feel a bit fig light, for £50 i’d expect maybe one or two more clones. i’m not to sure about the oversized issue, it seems to me it’s better to have something a bit to large and have a better level or features than something smaller will less.

4 4478 geonosian fighter review parts:169 figs:4 price:?15.00 (i think) here is a review of the amazing geonosian fighter set, it was my first ever star wars lego set! here go's... 1. manual not much here although it's an old style manual cover. random shot. back. 2. general set and minifigs a pic of the entire set, it has 2 reddish tan battle droids geo pilot, geo soldier, geo star fighter and geo turret. the 4 figs, the droids come with backpacks. geo soldier. i prefer this gun. give him a cane to become poggle the lesser the geo leader. detailed legs are always nice. the bodies are a little fat for geonosians i guess but nice printing on them. the head. the wings. 1. 2. 3. voila! all done 3. the star fighter it has a landing gear type thing. the detail on those plates. the pilot in the cockpit. cockpit with canopy. 1 of 2 ball joint things, this is the engine. 2nd ball joint which is the front gun. 4. the turret the turret by itself. turret with the soldier. a printed round plate. 5. overall build: 7/10 a little repetitive but enjoyable. minifigs: 9/10 4 that's pretty good for a set this size. design: 6/10 the fighter dosen't really look right nor does the turret but they are both strong. parts: 8/10 lot's of interesting parts and comes with two of the ball joint things as well the minifig parts being good. price: 10/10 cheap (for the uk) considering the amount of minifigs and parts. playability: 5/10 not much but you can have mini battles with the turret and starfighter. overall: 8/10 i gave it 8 because of the design which was not accurate and the low number of parts. thanks for reading and hope you liked it as much as i did . edited by kimt, 04 august 2008 - 11:42 am. indexed

2 i wish they made more sets with those colored droids as well. we should have got them with the hailfire droid and dwarf spider set i think. i also just noticed look the ball turret on the manual there's no markings on it.

2 nice review. sadly my dark ages came right before this set was released.

2 thanks for the review. i love these affordable little sets. not so affordable now because of the cool figs but i'm going to have a look on ebay and bricklink right now just in case! an army of tan red droids would look great. maybe we'll see some if geonosia appears in the new seires somehow unlikely since the confederacy was defeated at the battle of geonosis. i wish i could have bought this set when it came out but i'd just left university so i was super skint and had to miss all the ep.ii sets now they all cost loads even in used condition. at least now there has been a re-design of the gunship and at-te from the clone wars series that i can buy.

4 great review! man doi wish i had those red droids. i'm using the dell xps-1, and holy crap is it clear. those pics were beautiful!

4 i am fairly confident that something involoving geonosis will be released in 2010 but any way i had this set ( one of my first ones) but i droped the ship and it blew up. i found all the pieces but in never rebuilt the ship. although i still have the figs ant the canon. overall this set was above average in my opinion. great review!!!

4 thanks for the review. i actually like the older tie better, since it had a stand for the tie. not really a fan of the lu figs either. no matter - a tie is a tie and this is a must have fighter for any lego sw fan out there. never can get enough ties, except the tie advanced or vader's tie...they don't rock... kimt

2 and now for something completely different: tiny turbos belonging to the racers line! when i saw 8147 bullet run on s@h for half the price i couldn´t resist buying it. we had a lot of fun celebrating a bag-build at our event using the 8150 zx turbo of that theme so i knew what would expect me with this "extended" set. price: normal 49,99€ now 24,99€ (well i paid 34,99€ in a lego store but that´s another story...) bricks: 796 minifigs: - hey, this is tiny turbos, stupid! stickers: don´t ask (or read further) the open box reveals seven polybags, some with more smaller polybags inside, the instruction booklet, 2 ramps and the sticker sheet. of course i put all of the bags on the table and not on the floor hey, tlc didn´t print this on the first page of the building instructions! and you won´t see any piece callouts as well. on the other hand this is not adifficult build, so why show them? still there is an inventory list of all bricks at the end of the instructions. note the giant sticker sheet! we all now the dss, but that is a new kind of extra super large sticker sheet. it holds 82 stickers! more to that later on. the build is quite basic. the only non-conventional parts of the build were the two slammers. and the most annoying part was fiddling the rubber band of the holder without destroying it. bag 1: easy beginning: building the lime car, the limo and the two slammers. nothing exciting about the lime car, but the limo was neat. it´s an 18 studs long car! the normal racers are abot 10 studs long. nice way to put the horns on the back! the slammers. mmmmh. nice invention if they would actually do something. they are supposed to give the tubros a kick in the butt to speed them up, but the result is a 80 cm long "run" and that´s it. i had expected more acceleration from the slammers. but it´s also fun to play with the cars without slamming them. bag 2: convoy time: the tow truck and the fuel truck the tow truck is a great idea and a good addition to the set. the cars are supposed to crash - how do they get back home? well, here´s the answer. quite american layout of the truck and it´s very well done: horns, 5 flashing lights and a right color choice. you can move the arm up and down and pull out the hook. note the metallic silver antennae. the fuel tank has got a "secret" function. it may break on the middle of the trailer. therefore it has a hinge build in the bottom. city fire mayhem! and there´s no fire engine... bag 3: long, longer, how long can a "tiny" truck be? the pipe truck, an unexpected buggy and the red racer. 36+ studs long: the pipe truck breaks every convention. the cabin is almost the same like the tow truck and the fuel truck and that is the good part of it. the trailer has to carry pipes and is functional as well as it can commute sidewarts. it looks quite unrealistic as well and you cannot drive this beast on tiny roads. good for another crash. but there are more cars in this bag. now this was a surprise: a buggy? this is the only 6(+)-wide car, but just because the wheels are large. monster truck madness? i don´t care for those cars. personally a disappointment, i would have preferred another racer. + for variety though. did i say another racer? here we are: the red devil. great looking, a real fast shape and red. the best racer in this set. vrooommm! this is the most "played with" car of the set. (not only from me ). as you may have noticed i didn´t put any stickers so far. i don´t like stickers especially when placed over two or more bricks! and here you are supposed to do it several times. of course the cars look better with stickers on, but they are also great without stickers. only the fuel truck looks boring without. my sons didn´t know there were supposed to be stickers and they didn´t ask for them. so everything is allright! here´s a closeup of the sticker sheet (did i already mention it was 82 stickers? ): the only exception i made using sticker was for bag 4: bag 4: you go here? you pay! the highway toll booth. the only immobile part of the set, but great to brake though the barriers. that is fun! i only put on stickers on 2x2 plates where i had the idea to use those plates further on on different other mocs. this looks a bit boring without the other stickers i admit. but still no cut off to the playability! there are also two ramps belonging to the set. these only make sense if you are able to speed up the racers with the slammers and hit the ramps correctly. i had problems with that, so they are on the shelves now... could be a lot fun making a contest though. like this (picture of the inventories frontpage) all cars put together: the usual leftovers: all in all this is a great set to call ones own! i did not regret buying it, especially when it was 50% off! even normal price would not have been too much. build: great for smaller children, boring to afols: 5/10 special bricks/colors: none, all basics: 3/10 design: i love the tiny turbos´ size and design: 9/10 playability: -1 because of the slammers, another -1 because no minifig-scale. but that is not the intention of the set: still 9/10 price/piece ratio: dang! it´s not on sale any more. but if you hurry you could still grab one in the lego stores. 10/10 all in all: 8.5/10 and a clear recommendation! it was and still is a set to play with your children. the size fits perfectly to matchbox cars and that was exactly what my younger son did: can you find all of the cars included in the set? p.s.: after buying this set i won an ebay auction with another tiny turbos set - 8135 bridge chase. this is even more fun! i will soon care for a review with some never seen photo-tricks as well. stay tuned! edited by whitefang, 23 may 2009 - 07:02 pm. indexed

4 tiny turbos are good for parts, but i'm not so keen on them as they have no minifig drivers. so, i wasn't sure about this set. but your review has made me like them more, i probably won't buy the set but i appreciate it more. thanks for the review!

4 thanks for the review! i have quite a few tts.(tiny turbos). i never got this one, but if it's on sale....

4 as my summer holiday was kinda wet for 2 weeks, i decided to shop some sets. i crossed the german border and bought me this one mainly for the parts. to get time going, i built the models and made this small review for you to enjoy (or hate) high resolution pics can be found here when public. set# 4994 title: fierce creatures price: 9.99 euro / 12.99 usd pieces: 193 minifigs: 0 the box: the box looks awesome! it has some great animations of the 3 models in the instruction. the rear of the box shows some nice up-close-and-personal drawings of each model. i think it works better having the models drawn instead of a mere photo of them. somehow it allows the great colour-scheme to really show. the instructions: the instruction is easy to follow and shows which pieces are used in each building step. that makes it all a lot easier, especially with so many small pieces as in this set. the bricks are divided into 3 polybags and the instruction is a fine small book, which can be easily stored along the rest of your ever-growing amount of booklets and pamphlets printed by tlg. the models: model 1 is a spider and it’s nasty. the 2x2 modified brick with the hole would allow one to hang it from a string. this beast is sure to give you several nightmares, were it hanging from a string in your bedroom. – so i wouldn’t do that (plus the fact that my wife threw away the box and ordered me to take the spider apart when she saw it – she’s an arachnophobian and does not take spiders lightly). it looks real, in a brickish-non-real-way. model 2 is a snake. there’s not much to say other than the head is awesomely designed and the rest is bad. the body is poorly designed and does not live up to the coolness of the head. build the head, ignore the rest. model 3 is a flying scorpion or something. not as realistic as the spider, but still a great model with a cool head. the tail is a bit poorly designed, but it’ll do and it does offer some good ideas on how to use bricks. all in all verdicts: this is an ok creator set. it holds a lot of fine pieces and the models are an ok inspiration. given its size, it’s an ok set. but it’s nothing more than that. i’ll give it an average score. i enjoyed building the models and fumbling with the bricks in the shade during a “siesta” on my vacation. and that’s what it is, an enjoyable build and a little inspiration on a hot day with a erdinger dunkel weissbier in my other hand. kimt edited by whitefang, 23 may 2009 - 06:29 pm. indexed

2 i have mixed feelings about this set. it's one of the sets that sent my into a dark age (the birth of my son contributed heavily). when i first saw this set i was convinced that the earlier snowspeeder (7130) was superior in every way. i liked the look of the 7130 version better, i liked the coloration of it better. the turret was better (it used a webbed 6 x 6 dish). after seeing this review, i realize i was wrong on some accounts. the cockpit is much more movie accurate. the 7130 version had two separate compartments. this version also came with a tow cable, something that was lacking from the previous set. while i still am unimpressed with the overall look of this set, it is much less blocky, which is always a good thing. overall, i still prefer 7130 to the 4500 version. but the 4500 isn't nearly as bad as i first assumed, and i regret never buying one of these when i had my chance.

2 skipper 24, on aug 4 2008, 12:52 pm, said: podracer not sure where you got that from (i didn't have them out)? i noticed the minifig between the grievous starfighter & the mod-dino2010 vehicle and it looked like a little person sitting in the pod of his podracer. guess my eyes are playing tricks on me -- my eyesight is shot & my wife keeps pushing me to go visit the optometrist.

4 thanks for the rewiev! a nice set indeed, to bad i din´t buy it when it still was in the stores.

0 kimt, on aug 3 2008, 03:22 pm, said: not one of my favourite sw sets. kinda boring and the set is poorly designed imho. we do get the general, but that's not nearly enough. thanks for the reivew and fine pics. kimt gg has a cape...a custom cape!!!!!! what more do you want?

2 thanks for the review. it looks like an interesting set, even if not as good as boba's. skipper 24, on aug 3 2008, 08:11 pm, said: i never got the original boba fett's slave 1. i wish they would make one to scale with the minifigures. i would be so cool. you mean it would be so cool? i agree that it would be, if they made a large minifig scale version like with the ucs millenium falcon. i would probably try to buy that. edited by shoc, 03 august 2008 - 08:31 pm.

2 very good review! there's only one thing you did wrong: [quote name='skipper 24' post='337180' date='aug 3 2008, 08:46 am']the controls. i got this set for a very low price as well, and for that, it's a very nice parts pack with 2 neat, exclusive figs!

0 that was indeed a set that never appealed to me. its build was just plain wrong and awful. i only bought it because i found it on clearance at around 15€ (and they had 4 of them. if i had known better then, i'd have bought all 4; seeing how much that jango fett minifig is worth now... ) but i ended up heavily modifying it in its propoions and now it looks ok next to the new slave one (which is the best one of its 3 incarnations, i think)

2 very good review! i have he newest slave i and i like it more than this one. dsr

2 okay i have fixed that pic (thanks oky wan). i have modified this but then yesterday i built it back to its original state to review it.

2 good review. i always wanted to know how it was different to the boba fett slave i. i would probably only get this though for jango fett. the newer one looks sturdier and proportioned better imo.

4 a very nicely done review. i remember getting this slave i - it was my first large star wars set.

4 manta, on aug 3 2008, 10:33 am, said: wish it was still around. even though, little sets <$10, like the new coast guard 4wd & jet, and the quad are great little city sets. lego seems to be returning to good quality small sets with their latest city line-up. metalandi, on aug 3 2008, 10:46 am, said: i remember having this set (actually i even still have it, at least the pars are somewhere ) when i was a child, and i used it for making races, as it is there for. you should look for them and resurrect it. it really feels good after you've found all the pieces and put a set back together again (as it was when you first bought it).

2 this little set really makes my point small playable inspiration to build the set into a few other models, great set i wish i had it my town is going to need more vehicles. i really miss main model instructions with alternate build idea's.

2 i can prodly say i own this little bugger. it's not much, but it is a nice addition to the series. they are also easy to build, so you can get a rally going quite fast. stauder.

4 7261 clone turbo tank parts: 801 figs: 8 price: £70.00 (ouch! ) edit: new box pics added. my version of the set comes with a normal mace windu figure and an extra clone trooper. also the mace windu, barc trooper and jet trooper minifigs were exclusive to the set (well you could make the jet trooper yourself) . also my set came with 4 extra blasters (you'll see them later) and baby blue vent things instead of trans blue. 1.manual & box the front of the box. the box compared to the motorized at-at and the hailfire droid and dwarf spider droid. minifgs. the back which has pics of the sets functions and alternate models. inside the box it has a white cardboard divider probably for strength seeming as the box it so flimsy. pretty hefty manual. the tt manual compared to the one of the at-at ones. random shot. another random shot. poster at the back of the manual 2. general set and minifigs the whole set. i accidentally left one of the plates up when i took the pic. close up of the figs. two battle droids come with blasters and a mini turret. the republic. from l-r: jet trooper, mace windu (not lul), barc trooper, normal clone, the commander, look out. jet pack. mace's torso. barc trooper legs. barc trooper torso. he has got to be my favorite clone trooper by tlc. the mysterious commander. on lsw he was called cody (right) but he has star corps armour making him commander bly (left) . normal clone and the look out clone with electro binoculars. 3. speeder bike side view of the barc speeder. menacingish front view. (is menasingish a word?) printed back engine piece. one of my shield things came with a crumpled handle it is worse than it looks in the pic. 4. the turret the turret. it can rotate and point upwards. but what if you want to blast all those battle droids that are shorter than the height of the turret blasters... add another hinge in! that extra hinge in action. 5. the tank it's to big to get a decent side view pic johnny the cabin boy on the crows nest. front 2 seater cockpit. the 2 seats. better be careful you don't fall off your seat there are some pretty big gaps down the sides. back cockpit with dual missile launchers. the back seat. the engine. the large central storage. the turret controls fold down to lock into place so it doesn't fall out when driving. you can put 2 minifigs up top. mace and a clone driving. you can see those 4 extra blasters, 2 orange at the front of the pic and 2 between the chairs. the turret and jet trooper. barc trooper on the barc speeder. the commander on the lift chair in the back cockpit. another shot of that chair. 6. overall build: 8/10 quite enjoyable because it incorporates technic and system parts. minifigs: 9/10 on a set this size it has quite a lot including some exclusives such as the barc trooper but it could of had a droid or 2 more. design: 7/10 way out of scale but generally pretty strong due to the technic frame. parts: 7/10 lots of plates and nice minifig parts. price: 6/10 justifiable because of the amount of figs in the set. playability: 7/10 includes some cis units to fight the clones. overall:8/10 needs more droids and it could be bigger. i will also probably have a break form reviewing for now seeming as i have just put out a whole load of reviews. edited by kimt, 09 august 2008 - 08:51 pm. indexed as 7261 review 2

2 skipper 24, on aug 4 2008, 04:04 pm, said: did your version without the lul mace have trans blue grill things (like the ones on the back of the speeder) ? or was my set a one off. i bought mine online, thinking it was the new version but i ended up with that very lame lul fig. i just hate that fig... it's completely useless, we can't use any part of it for anything (although, i only discovered yesterday that the lightsaber blade was a standard one and not glued, as i always believed, so all isn't completely lost) in the end i still was rather disappointed by the set. it's too full of holes ( hum; i think there's kind of a paradox in that sentence...)... but the barc speeder and green clone are indeed fantastic. oh, and yes, mine came with sand blue grill parts instead of the trans-yellow ones... didn't realise it at first, and i spent half an hour cursing, thinking they forgot to put them in the box. but in the end, i don't know if the replacements are any better , since they're supposed to represent some kind of thruster light or something... all in all, i think it's my worst set... not necessarily for the set itself which is ok, but psychologically, there's too many things that went wrong with it...

4 nice review again, skipper. i passed on this one because of the price, but it's a nice set. good for you for getting the newer version with non-lul mace and an extra clone. that purple blade sure is a beauty. the tank itself is alright, just an at-at on wheels, in my opinion. the turret is great, though, and so is the speeder bike. i didn't realize that the jet pack had two "nailguns" (harpoon guns) on it. i thought that the nailgun was a new piece... but the jetpack is very cool.

4 an ancient set revived from kimt's collection! just take a look at the box art. this is one classic space minifig pack which deserve high rating, and i gave it above average. i never had any of these classic space figs before. if tlg could ever released this again, i am pretty sure i will grab multiple packs without a glimpse. you need to build your space agents/astronauts with a little bit of accessories added to explore the unknown space. i love this pack very much. thanks for sharing!

4 pretty nice set, but the newer minifig packs had greater variety in both the figures and equipment. my favorite one among all of them is 6704, which is also the only instance of both blacktrons appearing in one set. quote i wonder why this set had no blue or black astronauts? whatever the case, i always loved the small minifig sets that lego released, as i could never get enough astronauts. my favorite was the set of futuron astronauts. i think the blue and black guys hadn't yet been released at the time of this set.

0 i voted below average since i'm not a very big fan of classic space.

4 good set, nice accesories, and a good source of yellow figs, which seem to be rather rare... kdog, on aug 7 2008, 12:27 am, said: wearing a cape, hat and bandanna and nothing else makes it creepier! it's nude man! when he flys his butt whistles! don't turn your back on him! anyone who spends time on the internet should get the reference, i am lucky enough to own both shows on dvd :p staudie. edited by stauder, 07 august 2008 - 03:16 pm.

4 7674 v-19 torrent number of pieces: 471 number of minifigs: 1 price: £49.99 the v-19 torrent starfighter was an assault fighter with exceptional speed and maneuverability used by the galactic republic during the clone wars.it was a predecessor of the alpha-3 nimbus-class v-wing starfighter, in terms of purpose and usage. it first appeared in the genndy tartakovsky?€™s clone wars 2d series. basics box front: the box art shows the torrent flying above tatooine, with the new blue and white ?€œclone wars?€? style packaging, box back: the back shows some of the features of the set including the lifting mechanism and adverts for 7679 republic gunship, 7675 at-te and the 7673 magnaguard starfighter inside the box, there are 2 instruction books, a very small dss and 9 bags that are not numbered. bags: instruction books random manual shot parts list book one is mainly the construction of the body and one of the engines, book 2 is the other engine and the wings. for better pics of the manual look on lego's website. sticker sheet: a very small sticker sheet is included, which includes 2 republic insignias and a nose sticker. minifigure one minifigure is included, a clone pilot. the whole "omg only one minifigure in this set" and "its not movie accurate, i hate you tlc!!!11one2" has been beaten to death, so please don't make this review turn into that and to be honest i don't care because its an awesome figure. tlc have made the effort to print the life support device onto the chest plate so props to them. he has the "clone head" like the rest of the clones have in the cw releases, there are no extra clone bits apart from a long blaster, that's not included here. interesting/other pieces printed piece! rare/unusual pieces: there are 2 pistons included, as well as 2 weird looking technic pieces that serve as the landing gear during the build. which might explain why the set is quite expensive, it musn't have been cheap to manufacture them. the build it starts off relatively simple, the first 16 steps is getting the basic shape of the cockpit and the mechanism to make the middle wing move up and down. after that the next few steps are getting the landing gear/wing folding device done, it's actually the same thing so when the wings move into attack mode the landing gear retracts. this is then locked into place by the white beams that form the basic shape of the fuselage. up to step 46 is the fuselage, as well as fitting the hydraulics. this is what it looks like when the fuselage is complete. the cockpit is not "air tight", there's is quite a big gap top: bottom: the final few steps of book 1 is the construction of one of the engines, here it is attatched : the yellow bar is not permanent, its used to keep the white bit at the top from moving downwards. the steps are repeated in the second book so that both engines are now in on to the wings! first one attatched, the middle one is attached now: and finally the last one: it is now finished! the pieces that are left: so, you're probably wondering, how does it enter attack mode? well can you see this bar? push that bar to the center, and pick it up, the hydraulics move the central wing downwards as well as the side wings to enter attack mode: the outer wings have flickfire missiles on them, they obviously don't work, but it increases the playability of the set. the cockpit opens in a similar way to general grevious's starfighter released last year, using a sliding mechanism for other pics see here : http://s25.photobuck...eview/?start=20 and i'll be taking other requests for pics, maybe a video of it switching between modes. build: 7/10 very symmetrical build, the mechanism to move the wings might annoy some people. minifigs: 5/10 1 fig in a £50 set, however it is a starfighter design: 9/10 very accurate to the source material, lego have really made the effort to make the movement feature work. parts: 8/10 lots of technic, white and dark red pieces price: 7/10 could be slightly cheaper, playability: 6.5/10 need to buy some enemy sets to get the most of it, flick fires don't work. comments, requests, questions and criticisms welcome. edited by kimt, 04 august 2008 - 06:48 pm. indexed and poll added

2 erhm... where's the review? it would be nice to have a few pics of the v-19 itself and a few comments on it. could you please add that? kimt

2 i'm still reviewing it, the internet broke half way through it

2 simonjedi, on aug 4 2008, 05:57 pm, said: i'm still reviewing it, the internet broke half way through it the internet broke? that's bad news to all. did you push this? i am eagerly awaiting the rest. kimt

4 nice review simon jedi. the v-19 has been one of my favourite ships since the release of cwa and this is one of the sets i've been considering most about buying. it's great to see tlg's treatment of it. it looks like no expense was spared making it as aesthetically and functionally accurate as possible - though i think the cockpit windshield could maybe have been slightly bigger, but that's just me i'm sure. it looks pretty big compared to other starfighters too. did it take a long time to build?

4 the v-19 was my first tcw set. i buyed it, when i was visiting my father. i just wanted to build it there, and i do so. but how do you will get sth.big like this with in the train?? so i had to destroy him. when i was still home again, i had to build it 3 times, because the mechanic dont works i only can say that the v-19 is one of the best tcw sets. thanks to you for the review simonjedi , i just wanted to make one in german. but now i needn`t to make it

4 thanks for this excellent review simonjedi . this looks like an awesome set and this is the set i am most looking foward just as well as the separatist spider droid (7681) .

2 rayman, on oct 4 2008, 11:11 pm, said: hydraulic wings! i am very impressed and am now considering getting this set purely because of this funciton. i am just curious as to know why are there sand green parts on the bottom of the v-19. is it visible when the model is completed? i am also pleased to see tlc giving us a printed cockpit computer this time around. while i do like the functions and they way it is built, i cannot get into this model. first the price is a bit steep. i know all the cw sets are expensive but this one just seems more so to me. i mean there is only 1 fig in here. second to me, there is no playability or display-ability. i gave below average.

0 in addition to my last comment am i correct in saying that the left over yellow technic part was merely to hold parts together while building? edited by skipper 24, 10 october 2008 - 09:10 pm.

2 rayman, on nov 29 2008, 10:16 pm, said: yes i believe that the yellow technic is only used for the building. however i didn't find it neccessary. what a strange step... its to hold the wing connectors in the the same place while the wing is being attached.

4 having just bought myself a copy of the wonderful metroliner (4558) i felt like doing a review. before we start i'd like to thank greenhair for selling me one of his metroliners for a mere 80 euros. granted, the motor, "trainstation" and tracks weren't included but i did get an extra railcar instead. - * (please note that i have included the fourth wagon in the final pic but that the official set includes just three wagons.) the metroliner was released in 1992 and was extremely popular amongst lego fans. the set a picture of the box showing the set completely. (pic taken from peeron) and one of the minifigs and the accessories.: as you may notice, tlc was extremely generous, supplying us with a grand total of 11 minifgs amongst which no less than 4 female minifigs. ah, the population crisis is finally over we also have three suitcases, three cups and a small freight parcel and freight handling thingy. normally this would include two bicycles; a red and a black one. a general side view of the three carriages. (thanks to greenhair and the brickster) and here's one of the extra carriage. (thanks to greenhair and the brickster) moving onto the front and back carriage, which are externally identical. please note that greenhair changed my back carriage's headlights. these would be yellow in the normal set. all the doors in the entire set are printed pieces. (sorry for the bad picture quality in this one) the interior of the two however is laid out a bit differently. the space in the front carriage is occupied by a cockpit (or whatever it is called in trains) and some space to store your cable connecting the front lights with the engine. i can imagine it must get quite cramped and dangerous for the minifig driver with all the cabling. further back we have a quite random, weird looking engine. one part reminded me rather of a jet engine on a commercial airplane. the engine is accessible by means of the two side cargo doors. at the end of our first carriage we hit what looks like the train's restaurant, two tables and no chairs. the two middle carriages are identical, both have a small sink nicely hidden from the intervening and impolite looks of fellow passengers. the carriage further contains two tables and four seats. two cargo spaces are nicely tucked away from view below the tables. our final carriage has a back cockpit as well but differs from the front carriage in the central cargo area - where our train employee is hard at work earning his lego nickels - and the rear sleeping area. the bed is a double one, the upper one able to be flipped up for somewhat difficult access to the lower one. the train station i could not take photos off since it was not included in the purchase. judging from the building plans however i feel it was thrown in at the end just to add 'something' to the set. its construction is very simple, consisting of a few grey plates on top of a few pillars. access is provided by a plate which is connected to the platform with a few hinges. there are however two lamp posts, a timetable and a few chairs so if you don't like the platform you can still use these parts in a variety of other constructios. to end off i took a pic of the complete set (with extra wagon) and a friendly surprised train driver opening the door and greeting the camera man. conclusion being a '90s set, the train basically builds itself. the entire build cost me two hours and a half (i lost quite some time simply admiring the set) and was extremely straightforward with no suprises at all, but i need to admit it has its charm. the exterior is simply amazing. the sleekness of the design, the colours, it matches perfectly! i believe however that a width of 8 studs would be more to scale but 6 wide still looks amazing. the interior is somewhat simplistic but is easily moddeable with a few extra pieces. i basically bought the train as a parts pack. the standard set (three wagons) includes no less than 8 train doors with windows, 14 train windows, 4 smaller longer ones and 4 freight doors. the front and back of course count as unique pieces as well. one feature i am displeased with are the printed doors. i like printed pieces and while the blue-white-red stripe looks beautiful on the side the printed doors kind of limit mocing capabilities to carriages with a stripe on the side. i considered simply removing the stripe but i found out i could just get normal grey ones from bricklink for a fair price. i am very pleased with the train but since you already know my opinion, feel free to tell us yours of this fabulous set! edited by thebrickster, 09 july 2009 - 01:51 pm. poll question was not multiple choice, switched to radio group

4 i remember to literally jump of joy when my grand-father offered it to me for christmas... it's an amazing set, the train is really beautiful and it comes with 11 (!) mfs, so can somebody ask for more?

4 outstanding train set. the legend of the entire train series, is the metroliner. this is a "super 5" set. the color, design, minifigs is just so perfect and lovely. it resemble the trains which we see on our rails in our daily life. i can't find any flaws on this at all. the only flaw i noticed is my mistake of not able to buy this set at all. in fact, i had never seen this set in the shops before in my entire life. thebrickster, on aug 5 2008, 09:23 am, said: how cool is that? and 11 minifigs - when was the last time lego included 11 figs in a single set? there is another set fufil the criteria above, which is also a well known legend. it has 12 minifigs which is the 10159 city airport aka century skyway airport.

4 nice review i collect all metroliner i can, i have 3 metroliner and when i can, i buy a other . my aim : have the more big metroliner collect, in france ( in first time ) it's my favorite set

4 this is a great review of a great set, hairy ruben! i voted for outstanding since the only thing you can say about this train set is that it is outstanding. it has been the best passenger train in all the time from lego's beginning on until now. i bought the rereleased version of it in 2003 - and i really, really do not regret it! klaus-dieter

2 panda9001100, on aug 16 2008, 07:37 am, said: only strange they named it metroliner. in holland when we speak of a metro, i need to think at short distance trains only used in big cities like rotterdam. it was only named metroliner in the us, because of the color scheme is similar to the real-life metroliner. i believe in eu it was called the euro-express, and probably just "passenger train" wherever that would be suitable. the product-number 4558 is universal, though. hairy ruben, you don't have a review of the double-decker/club car on the way, do you? i myself never got it, and i am seriously considering buying one from bricklink, plus it is more-or-less an requirement for this train (one of very few double-decker cars to actually stay within the general outer dimensions of the train).

4 my favourite, favourite, favourite old set. it's too bad i was born 2 years after its release, i would have had a major interest in classic town. i might actually get this one on bricklink... not that it'll go for a good price (i'll only buy if it does you see). an "outstanding", a highly useful and well-made set that really just stands out from its counterparts. edit: nevermind. edited by dovchenko, 16 august 2008 - 10:25 am.

4 i never got this set i spent a long time after one christmas trying to get and failed miserably, admittedly i was much younger then. it has however remained one of my most sought after items but i’ve still never got around to getting one. the set generally makes me rather nostalgic for a time when the trains were painted in simple liveries like that one! anyway it seems an excellent set from what i’ve seen and the figure selection is amazing. i hope lego produce something as good as this when the new trains are released next year.

4 super review, thanks. simply put, i'd have to admit this is one of the best indy sets. and in such a small package. it's a very detailed lil' jeep, and that's why i like it. i have this too, but i don't want to open it since it's exclusive. wait, i thought we were calling it "rown" and not "frown"

4 thanks for the review hinckley! i love this set! i still haven't renewed my bm subscription, but i'm sure i can find this on ebay or bricklink. and what an addition this would be to my army. edited by ~vbbn~, 05 august 2008 - 01:32 am.

4 thanks for this great review hinckley! i agree with you this set has to be released as normal set. i just recognized how clever the building technique is, you couldn't see that on the packaging shots we got before. hopefully i'm able to grab this off ebay or somewhere else sometime!

4 surprisingly well designed set for lego overlords... i mean brickmasters!

4 6804 surface rover review set#: 6804 set name: surface rover released: 1984 pieces: 16 minifigs: 1 (white classic space minifig) brickshelf gallery peeron.com bricklink brickset.com introcomment: i have to keep my fondness for space going and since i'm no fan of the still "new" life on mars mars mission theme, i've decided to give you another review of a small classic space set. more to come in the following days. the box. unfortunately i haven't got the box for this set. but peeron.com was kindly enough to support me with a proper pic. and as usual this is a small easily brought home sized box. oddly tlg doesn't add the "flip" on top anymore. i remember standing in toystores, pulling 6 or more sets down from the hanger before accesing the one i wanted. it gave buying lego sets that threasure hunting touch. [snaps out of his daydreaming]... a small box with a picture of what you get. i've got no rear pic, so i can't tell if tlg did the same as on the 6701 set (split up the inventory). the fig: one single white classic space minifig. this is the worst one in my opinion. i never liked those white guys. and they get easily damaged by the sun. nah! give me a red or yellow instead (later blue or black). the surface rover: both i am the lucky owner of two of them. (yes this is a small showoff ) side though small, i still think this is a neat little set. compared to the modern "impulse" sets, this is high competable. i like the simplicity of the small classic space sets and this is no exception. the sr is made from very usable bricks, that can easily be used for making ship/base/craft mocs. rear as you can see, one of them has been used for surface exploration for many years. it could do with some replacements, but i haven't had the time, yet. the verdict: a fine little classic set. not much more than that. it holds some useful bricks and worked fine as an "impulse" back then. the classic children's birthday presents during the early 80's. i got quite a few space and town sets back then. remember to vote your opinion on this set. i gave it "average" for the bricks, the price (back then) and as an all in all conclusion. kimt

4 thanks for this review, if you'd only know what memories you brought back! i think i remember this set better than any other i had, when i was a child. some time after i got it, i decided to disassemble it and combine it with the jeep from 6552 rocky river retreat. it came out pretty good, though. as it became the main attraction point of my town (beeing the car of my favourite minifig back then, and, and, and... looong story ), i kept it assembled that way from this day on until earlier this year, when i finally disassembled it because i needed the parts. edited by metalandi, 06 august 2008 - 03:57 am.

4 a nice set to go with the outback theme. i am kind of dissapointed they they didint continue the theme, as i only managed to grab 6487 and 6550, none the less, this set is very interesting as it's one of the few to feature working suspention. stauder.

4 great review brickster why exactly did the outback, adventure etc. themes never quite catch on......just a thought. what a great set! i wish i had it, but in 1997 i was just back from my whirl wind trips around the world and had drifted away from lego i don't know why. but i will say this i love the actual suspension that came with this set and the trains sets i have been trying to buy up as much of it as i can, and now i see i need to add one more set to the "i need to get that"

4 stauder, on aug 7 2008, 06:17 am, said: the great thing about the copter was it had 2 suitcases, which as far as i can tell ain't a common part, not rare, but still nice to have. and it had the guy with the green jacket. the winch wasn't bad either, the only flaw was it was a "standard" lego copter, meaning similar ones where avalible in quite a few sets. do you plan to review it? oh, i wish i had it. i don't recall seeing 6487 in the stores back when i purchased the other outback sets. i'd love to see a review.

2 ok, this is the big one. the controversial one. the one everyone either hates or defends... what do i think? read on. the figs: bandana man masked dude dude with shades good figures, i miss scarface. comes with his torso, though, which is my favorite (the one with the ammo strap across the chest). one figure short of the figure-to-price value, but we can deal with that. the dino: the dino. it's the one that comes with the chopper, in green. any questions? the tank: and so it begins. i think it looks a lot better in person than on the box. the left side. good time to mention that the treads run pretty easily, and this is a very playable set. right side. keep an eye on that flap in the center... ... and we have a folding ladder! the back. probably the weakest point of the set, apart from the dino. the turret, turned and tilted. the mechanism works extremely well, and the gun seems to work better than others for some reason (or maybe it just seems that way). the front of the cockpit. i'm at a loss trying to figure out how those tiny windshields defend them against 40-foot mutant tyrannosaurus rexes with radioactive breath, laser eyes, and what have you... anyway, another one of those neat steering wheels, some viking horns, and some stickered control panels (oh yeah, this set has a good amount of stickers. probably around 20-ish.). the back of the cockpit. i love the little gun, it turns 360 degrees and tilts up. oh yeah, and those green barrels they've been using are awesome, i can think of tons of uses for them. the verdict: 7.6/10 playability: 9.4/10 pieces: 7.5/10 figures: 8.8/10 dino: 3/10 value: 4/10 the main downfall of this set is the price. i would easily pay $30 for this, no questions asked. but $40 was a hard sell for me - i gave in merely to see what i would think of it, and also to help you guys find out the same. this is a great display set, and a great play set. the pieces are good - lots of nice blay beams used in the construction. but the price, people. that's the killer. pick this up only if you have everything else or you find it on clearance. and thus ends my dino attack review series. hope you enjoyed them! until next time, bloody jay

0 quote i would easily pay $30 for this, no questions asked. but $40 was a hard sell for me is it easier for you to "eat" if you know that this would cost you around $60 if you live in denmark :|

2 heh...$40? you're lucky...they sell those for $60 here...am i getting ripped off?

0 i'm confused there's two topics of this . anyway allon-sy,nice review i quite like this set i'd buy it if it had just 2 plain clones please tlg how are we supposed to army-build!!! edited by foxy, 08 august 2008 - 12:59 am.

2 agentrick57, on aug 8 2008, 03:50 am, said: i'm confused about that too. whats up with that? thanks for the review. the pics are....acceptable. perhaps you could redo them in sunlight and with a different background than a carpet? i'll add this to the index soon. and i agree at that pirce this set is definately an ok buy

4 well, here is another separatist set that looks like it is worth getting to me. my gunship is going to be outnumbered pretty quick. nice review.

2 well, i haven't been keeping up on what was going around in lego starwars,but i think this review would be an average

0 hollisbrick, on dec 29 2008, 10:20 pm, said: this is a great set it's too pricey though if it was $10 or so cheaper i'd get it! actually its on sale now. or at least for americans.

4 hollisbrick, on dec 29 2008, 11:22 pm, said: damn americans jk nah i'm aussie mate oh that sucks. actually im 1/4 aussie. but i dont live there. i love this set. i dont see how people dont like this. this is exactly like in the movie and personally if you thought it was supposed to be different i think you should study your star wars a little bit more.

4 i'm definitely getting this soon. a good value for money, a cool set, and another part to my clone wars collection!

0 i got this yesterday on sale (only 5500 yen>>>$60 american) and was a little disappointed. i'd avoided it, but all the new sets are at least a month away here. it looks a little weird in photo, and the actual build is worse, just a flat little disc with a cockpit. only special points for the color, which will probably just look better with those 2009 sets.

4 general magma, on dec 30 2008, 03:51 pm, said: crud..i wish i took this gunship instead of the lego indiana jones game.. i take that there back. i'm getting two of those gunships, for 25,19 each on a sale at s@h! edited by general magma, 10 january 2009 - 10:00 pm.

0 i am a proud owner of this set. like others, i got it discounted and couldn't resit the parts pack. this is the type of lego sets that bothers me. when you look at it now, you'd be tempted to say "hey not bad", but at the same time, some years ago, it wasn't good enough to buy it full price. i was kinda disappointed because usually sets using that kinda baseplates are excellent (castle, paradisa), and this one is just "ok". one really minus point would be the lack of any opponent faction in the set

2 thanks for the welcome everyone! though i'm still wondering where the drone minion/commander idea came from.

2 another outstanding review by the "awesome set reviewer"! i enjoyed reading this review very much and i felt that you have redress twilight in an approriate manner. i have very mixed feeling about this set especially with its design. it seemed i will need to watch the clone wars movie in the theatre before i compared with it. most of the time, when this lego set is used in a movie, you will tend to compare it and what is the actual purpose for twilight, same as the rest of the sw vehicles and aircraft. for a high price like this, i can actually top up a little more and get the at-te, with the same batch of minifigs plus commander rex. if there is a special figure such as the v19 torrent (clone pliot), it will be a much ideal scenario. at the moment, i have not bring in any clone war sets into my collection, and i am quite sure twilight is not in my priority list especially when i am not a full-pledged star war collectors or i have strong intentions to complete the entire range in this recent release. therefore, i need to prioritise my purchase, and likely to get two rgs, since that is my favourite ship in clone war era. i am not comparing it with rgs. both sets defintely have their pros and cons. oh, i love that postcard you made. certainly looks very nice! svelte_corps, thanks for doing up this superb detailed review which had given "twilight" the neccessary attention it should have.

4 really awesome review svelte_corps . you did a really complete and in-depth review of this beast and with your nice pics is really enjoyable reading your review, so congrats . i like this ship even if it looks so bulky but i need to buy first other sets, so maybe this beast will be landing in my collection the next year (or this one if i am lucky ). i can just ask for something, can you post a pic of all your clone wars sets together with this one (all the sets in one pic, not many pics with this an each set ) please . edited by darkrebellion, 12 august 2008 - 02:20 am.

4 thanks for the review. now i thinnk i will buy this set. btw, i really like what you did to the back. i might do the same to mine....

2 i read the visual guide recently and learned a bit more about the twilight. i won't get into spoilers but it seems that the ship becomes a sort of endearing family van for the characters which is neat. big bulky, uncool, but it gets you from one place to another. if it factors into more than just the 90 minute film, i may pick this up. it seems that there's room for a lot of personality in this ship once you see the film. it is a corellian freighter smuggling spice for the hutts. that's cool right?

4 zzz, on aug 12 2008, 09:00 pm, said: and i simply love that there is space inside. you said there is not really some cause of the landing gear mechanism, but it seems it should be easily fixed. do you think there is enough space to put some plates over the landing gear and add some beds, kitchen und tv? i think this set is so perfect to mod it into a clone wars mobile home, your back garden ist just perfect for this. it does have that homely feel! there is room inside with technic beams to lay plates etc on, the only issue is that it's kind of fiddly to access. you could do it from either the side door or rear door though, maybe move that tow line at the back. i have to say, it is a set that grows on you

2 thank you svelte_corps for the review! i like the inside, nice and cosey! i also like your little garden! for me, this put the twilight different in a better perspective than my first perspective of the twilight. i voted outstanding. greets the-force!

2 seems like tlc has done a pretty accurate representation of the ship. the real fault for the ship's messy design has to go to lucasfilm, not tlc. my guess is lucasfilm is trying to recapture that "what a piece of junk!" magic of the millennium falcon. i guess we'll have to wait to see the movie to see if they succeeded or not. the idea of a "space mobile home" reminds me of the winnebago from "spaceballs." great review!! informative, entertaining, and opinionated. so many people shy away from stating an actual opinion in their review for fear of offending anyone. what's the point of making a review if you don't state what you think about it???

2 svelte_corps, on aug 12 2008, 02:19 am, said: hmm... dior. i can smell it now the ship doesn't look too swooshable (but, then again, more than the heavy rgs) i really like that review svelte corps! so much detail! unfortunately i would only get this if it was a very low price, like in a sale.

4 i think some people agree that this ship is better than when we first saw those pictures, at least i do. it looks like it has some nice accessories that come with the ship as well. my favorite of you custom things has got to be the octopus it's so funny and a great use for the headdress thing. great review. edited by skipper 24, 13 august 2008 - 11:24 am.

4 this is an awesome set in my opinion. i scraped my crossbows for mocing recently, but the set is still an amazing army builder. for the price for the sw battlepacks, which have 4 minifigs and a cheap vehicle, you get 4 knights ( this is 2 sets to equal the price of a bp ), 2 skellys and 2 skelly horses, plus 4 crossbows, 4 good wheels, and some other good dark blue and brown pieces for my ever expanding castle town. great buy.

2 i should really get one more of these for the figures, shields, and weapons. this set is the only one with the scythe in pearl-grey, by the way. "the only thing that puzzles me is; why would a crown knight joust a skeleton?" good question. for a joust to make sense, this set should contain two human knights instead -- which would be fine with me so long as they had differing armour and colours. edited by tenorikuma, 13 august 2008 - 03:51 am.

4 you know what i think this set has? charm. lots of it. i'm not a big fan of castle, having very few sets, all of them spanning different nations/armies, but i couldn't resist this set. and while not obvious at first, it really is backwards compatible with every castle set with a horse in it. nonetheless, i think this set is great. it's simple, cheap and has charm. that's good enough for me. plus it has that fantastic grinning knight and the black skeleton horse. those just made it better.

4 good review kimt. pictures are clear and show each of the pieces in great detail. i agree with your comments as well. i'm a bit curious, does the knight's helm have a hole for plume? i've been debating whether to purchase this set or not. i'm not a big fan of horses so i'll likely barely use them, but i do like the unique minifigs, weapon rack/weapons, and the fact that the divider has a few useful pieces that can be added to other sets. however, i just don't feel the set is worth $8 when compared to crossbow attack and the knight's catapult unless the buyer is really wanting some mounted minifigs. luckily, amazon just lowered their price of this set from $8 to $6 (along with another 20% if using bill me later... just in case anyone was also in the same situation i was in). at that price, it's damn well worth it.

4 first things first. the knight's helm does have a spot for a plume. now, i really like this set and it was the first one i dug into when i got my collection in the mail. it has a great selection of equipment for good or evil figures and the barding for the horse is outstanding. my only wish was for one of the long chrome swords for the knights. i think the new knights with the tall shield and chrome sword look excellent on foot and on horseback. it would definitely be neat to revisit this set with another human knight instead of the skeleton. make that change and add a lady to joust for and it'd be bang on.

4 indexed name: holiday villa theme: lego system / town year: 1988 pieces: 197 minifigs: 2 price: usd ? there were quite a few sets in the 1980's that weren't sold in the us. i remember reading once that it was because they contained wine glasses and tlg felt they wouldn't be able to market a toy that encourage the drinking of alcohol. this set was one of them. i remember seeing this in a catalog that came with a fabuland set and wondering what it was and where i could get one. i wrote to lego and got an overseas catalog which had the futuron 6990 monorail transport system in it before it was available in the us. i was amazed. i ended up buying 6349 holiday villa from that catalog but, for some reason, gave it to my best friend for his birthday. i've always wanted this set and finally bought it from bricklink this year.... my purchase included everything except the box. i really like the boxes. but, in lieu of a boxshot, here is the instruction manual: i imagine this was the image on the front of the box: the parts one of the things that appealed to me about this set is it's abundance of rare parts. this base plate is an excellent piece and was only available in two sets: classic lego telephone: technically, these blue windows 1 x 4 x 5 windows are only available in this set, according to bricklink. it was available in different form (with and without fixed glass, trans blue glass) in other sets. regardless this size and color window is rare and the blue door was only available in 4 sets. this was a huge selling point for me as i'm a window monkey. never heard that term? it's like a parts monkey (a collector who buys mulitples of sets just for parts or large lots of bulk from bl and sorts them into bins) but just for windows. tell your friends i coined the term: these sloped windows have endless possibilities in many themes (maybe not with the curtain decals applied) but are another great rare part that appears in this set: the build remember this piece? i'd like to see a badass agents car built on this car base! : i am a fan of the six-wide car but i see the appeal of the four wide. it has a very nostalgic feel to it: there's no denying that this is a beauty of classic lego 4-wide cars: this set comes with two mini-figures, one of which appears to be a painter. classic vintage lego figs: onto the house which begins with the basic floorplan: a kitchen that's open to the rest of the house and a little oven and hood vent is one of my favorite touches. it's one thing to throw an oven into a house set, but the designer of this set made it a cool part of the architecture of the house which gives it a unique feel: the completed first floor and carport: i do wish the sides of the roof were white with a little overhang like an actual roof. this method of white on bottom, red on top looks more like a child's drawing than a real house. this is easily fixed with some modifying. still, you get a lot of roof pieces in this set: here we have the completed set. the husband cleans the yard while the wife gets plastered on wine. don't tell the american kids! another angle: working in the kitchen: getting smashed before dinner. i think she may have a serious problem: the bedroom. a little stark, but the bed looks comfy: overall shot of the interior: rating playability: 9/10 (the possibilities are endless with drunky mcwine-wine and husband. really, playability is up to the imagination of the player. it's a house, not really very action-packed.) design: 9.5/10 (great design with plenty of rare parts. love the classic car, too! loses half a point for the all red roof...) price: na (i believe this was inexpensive, but since i have no proof, i will have to leave this factor out of the overall rating.) overall: 9.25/10 (classic sets like this all deserve 10s in my book, but looking at it with an objective eye it's excellent, but not perfect.)

2 well, technically it is 4 wide...

2 hinckley, on aug 13 2008, 11:10 pm, said: do you like 2-wide cars? seriously though, anyone? i love them: just see my brickshelf

4 this is my favourite house which i owned during my childhood. although it's in the crypt, but i hope to build it back one day. looking at your review makes me so envy of you to own a complete set. the baseplate is very unique especially for its stoned pattern. classic lego telephone is just so lovely especially when its printed. the entire house layout is simple and very nicely constructed. in fact, the simplicity just showed how much lego could do with such parts. there are many nice furnitures included in this set such as the little oven/stove, dining table, bed and car porch. the little black car is a classic example of a true 4-studs car. i love this house very much, and my verdict is a full "5". no doubt about it. thanks hinckley for this lovely review.

2 i've 2 of these sets. one is for sale .....

2 cool review! i never knew that those wine-glasses could be the reason for this not being sold in the us!

4 has anyone noticed the dwarf in one of the completed shots? nice set, alot better than the new city sets...*looks at an army of firefighters that have no fires to put out and the police officer army* edited by indianajones, 21 april 2010 - 12:06 pm.

4 hello all eurobricks members and town lovers, today, i will be doing up the third item in the shell promotional series in 1998. three out of the eight promotional sets are under town theme. the third in the line is the exterme team sub theme which is promoted in 1998. extreme team is a bunch of adventurous, daring, breath taking individuals that risk their lives for an unforgettable excitement of the lifetime. their vehicles range from land, air and sea type of extreme taking types. extreme team is one the unknown themes ever released in my "dark age". i only had this small lovely set in my entire extreme team collection. hope we are able to see more interesting reviews under extreme team as well. name: extreme team raft theme: lego system / town / promotional / shell year: 1998 pieces: 19 minifigs: 1 price: usd$2.00 an image of a 2537, extreme team, raft this will be an exciting water adventure! this is another great addition to your female population count. she is one of thhe daring individuals in the extreme team, that take her raft beyond limit, into the rough waters where she might face possible dangers. look how confident she is, with those witty eyes of her. i am very sure she will survived the course of her entire journey. raft's design this is a very simple design, with just a big piece of wooden plank and a couple of logs tied together on the side, and it is ready to take it down to the water. speaking of some real adventure, do you dare to take this raft in the unknown waters? there is a small holding area, where she is able to place her critical equipment to ensure her safety throughout the journey. bottom of the raft excellent range of equipment this set actually provides very good range of equipment. there is a pair of oars, hammer, life vest and backpack. the most wonderful piece of equipment is the pair of dynamites. first of all, they are printed. next, they can be used in wild west or any playing possibilites which involved in explosives. this is a very good impulse set to stock up these accessories. i wondered what she need to use these dynamites for? her extreme team black jacket is very nicely designed, with their logo "x" or another way of saying "xtreme". i find the green arms and black jacket matched pretty well, with that blue cap. front view relaxing herself, listening to the calm sea to summarise, this is one of the better impulse sets ever produced. it comes with a simple raft with tons of good accessories, and a very cheap way to obtain dynamites. in fact, these are my only 2 piece in my entire collection. somehow, this set managed to find its way to my collection in my dark age, and i am very pleased to have this. no major flaws on this set, it fufill the conditions of an excellent impulse set! summary review playability: 9.5/10 (high playability involved. you can used it as an indy, adventurers or whatever purpose for the raft) design: 10/10 (very very simple design with superb great accessories. for a promo/impulse set, it's very good) price: 9.5/10 (a very inexpensive set based on the 1998 pricing. great way to buy this to add in some adventures of your own) overall: 9.7/10 (this is a fanastic set, mainly for its accessories. get it if you still see any of these. it's defintely worth the money, if its reasonable) i gave it a "5" based on my review score card. what about yours? hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine. comments and critics are strongly welcomed. pictures can be found in my brickshelf (when moderated)

4 this would be great for any pirate fan, the extraback pack for the soldiers, some spare owes for the row boats, a female face for a wench, and a rather simple raft for that unlucky pirate lost at sea! over all a nice set, i am a little confused by the dynamite though... perhaps an easy way to go fishing or perhaps to clear a rock in the forseen future? or is it that she is just a suicide bomber attacking the white house water (joke not ment to be tasteless or offensive to those lost in the act of terrosim, greatest respect to those who have lost loved ones) great review, regards cpt. pb

2 cpt. pegleg blockbeard, on aug 14 2008, 03:29 pm, said: over all a nice set, i am a little confused by the dynamite though... perhaps an easy way to go fishing hilarious! i bet she threw out the penicillin and flare gun to make room for the axe and dynamite in her survival kit. who wouldn't? maybe she's a lost escapee.

4 overall, an excellent set concerning the price range. nice review, whitefang!

4 glad some of you like this set for the wide variety of good accessories. it seemed some are unfavour of the raft's design. well, i think for an impulse set. the raft's design is quite good. at least, it took care of the color scheme well. it's just a simple raft for the adventurer to move onto the river stream and throw some dynamitte to blow some obstacles away. cpt. pegleg blockbeard, on aug 14 2008, 03:29 pm, said: this would be great for any pirate fan, the extraback pack for the soldiers, some spare owes for the row boats, a female face for a wench, and a rather simple raft for that unlucky pirate lost at sea! your comments make me feel like i has just done a pirate review instead of an extreme team review.

2 water and lit dynamite isn't a good match.

2 cool, then i think i'll do a review of 6451 river response later today or tomorrow, stay tuned!

4 i got this set as well as a res-q hovercraft. this set is cool because of all the accessories and it come with a x team guy. your set is also in much better condition than mine. you have made me decide to rebuild it. another great review thebrickster. keep up the good work.

4 the helicopter looks nice and the resq minifigs were nice. the diver minifig had once been a personal favorite of mine.

4 i've always wanted this set and the hovercraft... too bad i never did. great set.

4 what exactly makes you feel this set isn't realistic? it has got nothing what wouldn't be on a real helicopter, imo. and for the futuristic design, yes, it looks modern, but it works. and actually, most of today's real helicopters also don't look like in the 70's anymore.

2 metalandi, on aug 24 2008, 04:17 pm, said: what exactly makes you feel this set isn't realistic? since the question was asked... 1) tiny rotors 2) dual cockpits (only seen on a few military copters) 3) stretcher extends beyone edges of fuselage when inside the vehicle 4) extra long canopy (really only seen on military helicopters), and "military" design. 5) black colorscheme for rescue vehicle. the the stretcher, minifig designs and rescue logo are the only things about this copter that really suggest that it is a civilian rescue aircraft. it's a toy set with alot of play value, but i agree with karto that these kind of desgins really turned me off to alot of the town and city sets of the 90's. on the positive side, the new city sets, with thier realistic non-futuristic designs have really tempted me to buy more vehicles.

4 wow. i loved this set, i still have it actually... in pieces though, i took it apart quite soon after i got it, then managed to lose the instruction manual

4 if you still have all the parts, try to rebuild it, you'll see that it's a great feeling!

2 nice review i collect castle too and the ghost isn't really rare (i have one too) but it's not really found anymore so it would be a good thing to keep it. anyway great review edited by mammymarf, 15 august 2008 - 08:48 pm.

4 very nicely done - this cart is a striking resemblance to the crossbow cart we got in 2007.

2 quote even though many people don’t like frightknights. i don't really like fright knights either i just happened to have this set.

4 this is a pretty nice set. i really like the torso and its "genericness" so it can be used for other factions. and at least this set has 2 shields (althought i prefer the triangular ones) instead of just 1 shield you get from crossbow attack (from the wrong fraction, i'd have liked a crown knights shield 100x better). some improvements for this set would be a normal bow and a sword instead of 2 of the 3 crossbows, smaller wheels and triangular shields. 4/5 from me (actually 3,5 but i'll round it up)

4 great review! this set has cool features. i just wish that lego would release this as a lego legend and release it to australia too, since this is a set about australia. i would've bought two if this were a lego legend. that is how good it is. i like the building with latticed window and windmill. i also like the cargo airplane, windsock, and radios. plus it looks like it's got great minifigs.

4 this is really an ideal small set. in spite of its size, it has nearly everything: • three minifigs • a vehicle • a building • numerous minifig accessories • numerous rare and useful parts • nice model design (especially for the time period) too bad outback came out during my dark years.

4 this is probably my all-time favorite lego set. it was originally given to me for my birthday by a close friend of mine back in the release year of 1997. the cargo plane was, by far, my favorite vehicle ever. unfortunately, someone stole the plane from me when our families went on vacation and the rest of the set was given to my cousin's oldest son when i was no longer interested in my lego collection. now that i'm back into lego, i use that building's construction for various projects, especially as a dr. inferno look-out shack using parts from extra mission 3: swamp raid. the shack compliments the original set greatly. edited by skorpius47, 19 august 2008 - 01:44 am.

4 this was a cool set i thoght of it as i was building the post plane.

2 whats wrong with another yoda and some nice light blue bricks? i probably would destroy this set, and keep the minifigs intack tough, chrome lightsabers on!

0 thanks for the review kimt! oldies reviews(old sets ) are always appreciated. i feel this set isn't that great. 1- yoda: he is by far the best part of the set. although, is his weapon blue? 2-lord tyrannus: pretty nice! i feel the middle part of his torso is a bit bland, but that isn't a problem. i wish they would make a fleshie one too. 3- speeder bike: i always hated this design. the back looks terrible to me. way too bulky in my opinion. it jusn't give me the image that it's the same as the movie. the lightsaber is amazing! why is it only in this set? 4-yoda-lifter: what? that is terrible. but at least it has some nicely colored parts.... a fine set, but not the best imo.

4 you think it's not a great thing that we get a yoda fig in an affordable set like this?!? that was the main reason why i got this set! and what do you mean by "another"? wasn't this the only one that was ever released except for the one in the dagobah/x-wing set? sure, he is not the best fig with the unmovable legs and all, but still: it's yoda! besides, he doesn't move his legs a lot in "real" life either. nice review, though, and thanks for telling me what that liftarm-thingy was meant to be for. i never got that and thought it was supposed to lift up the speeder for some reason. i got two of this set, and the printing on those blue parts were off in the second one i got. edited by oky wan kenobi, 18 august 2008 - 08:45 pm.

2 no, yoda was released in no less than 3(4) sets. ok, so i remembered wrong. i just have plenty yodas and one is more than enough for the set list click here thanks for pointing that out.

2 thanks for the nice review kimt . i like this set especially by the fact that it is the only set containing the dooku minifig and the curved lightsaber , i also think that the minifig is cool but i also own the dagobah x-wing and the wookiee catamaran sets so i have enought minifigs (a clone wars version would be very cool ) and the extra-thingy is well, just ok. the bad part is that i don?t buy the set when it is out and now is go for $40 on ebay and bricklink . edited by darkrebellion, 18 august 2008 - 09:51 pm.

2 cheers for the review kimt! of the initial episode ii lego releases this set was the least inspiring, but the minifigs were must-haves. you can't go wrong with count dooku and yoda! i like the design of dooku's speeder in the movie but lego missed the mark a bit with it here and gave him a dodgy flying boat instead! the speeder cradle/yoda jumping mechanism was just a waste of parts unfortunately. i'd like to see dooku's speeder re-imagined by lego. they've come a long way in the way they design a lot of the new star wars sets

4 thanks for the review. it's always good to have a 2nd opinion on a set. i've added the usual poll and i'll index it tomorrow (must sleep). super pics and great to have "in-build" pics a fine set which i'll surely buy when i find it.

4 thanks for the cool review vbbn . i think this set is really cool and very neat detailed to be a small set , also thanks for the clear pics . edited by darkrebellion, 18 august 2008 - 10:30 pm.

2 nice review! thanks for the clear pics. also, if you place a brick so the axles on the bomb mechanisms tips are touching the brick, the bombs should stay on. jifel

4 thanks for the review. i have had second thoughts about purchasing this bad boy and i think you made it clear that it was a nice buy. however, i would have loved the maf too!

4 niuce review! i voted above average, it's very cool but not awesome.

4 cloneme, on aug 28 2008, 05:11 am, said: i don't know what it is about this set but i love it. i can't get enough of it. it looks amazing. nice review. you've said it all that's exactly how i feel about it. i've not got a single clue as to what this thing is or why. but the colours and the design are awesome. might be a little small....anyways i'm getting it.

4 thank you for that very interesting review, metalandi. a cool set with a lot of features and some nifty vehicles, very playable and well designed indeed. perhaps a bit too colorful for my likings, but pretty impressive in its conception for sure. i wish we could see some more landscaping coming along with todays vehicle sets as well...

4 rock raiders was the shit back in the day. awesome theme! i had this set as well as the tunnel transporter, which was amazing.

2 thanks for the review! rock raiders was one of the last new themes i knew as a kid before my dark ages came. unfortunately i never managed to get any sets from it, beside a few months ago the 4910 the hover scout, which i review a while ago. wish i can get some of the bigger sets in the future.

2 i do like the set, although i don't own it. i do remember lusting after it when i was a kid, though (mainly because of the female minifig and the colors). it's a bit simplistic, but comes with a few great parts. you also did a great job on describing the set, and the pictures give the full impression of the appearance. for the review, i just have to point out a few things, to give you constructive criticism: first of all, it's chef, not "chief" (entirely different professions), and secondly, the scale you give in the poll isn't very even. "above average" jumps to "outstanding", which is a too big of a gap in my opinion. you should've used "good" or "great" in between them. but these are only minor faults, this is a good review anyway!

4 i rate it a full 5 too. and i wish lego would make a set like this in 2010. a town needs pizza! edit: don't always trust peeron. sometimes they miss some pieces, and sometimes they just can't count them! edited by the cobra, 24 august 2008 - 11:41 am.

4 a very good set indeed, we have at least 3 of them, but we like them all.

4 this set looks really cool, especially for one this inexpensive. the van is neat, and the hidden storage compartment i back is the icing on the cake. i like the back with hidden oven as well, and the rare sink piece makes it all the better. with five pizzas and three minifigs, it's and excellent set to behold.

4 one of my greatest lacks in my town...i can remember going to the store to buy this one, and ending up with another set (pirates) at home :p thank you for the review, it might put me on track in finding this set on the web and purchasing it to correct my childish change of mind, so long ago ;-)

2 whitefang, on aug 24 2008, 04:12 pm, said: flyut, if you need decals for the stickers that are featured in this set. hang around here until imperialshadows drop by to give you a little surprise if he is free. imperialshadows, on aug 26 2008, 10:53 am, said: surprise? free? i'm not even close to free, i'm rather expensive, but i do have a surprise for everyone! i think you'll be interested in the companion article to this fine review, my first set restoration project. that's great, maybe i'll be restoring my 6350 - pizza to go in the near future, thanks . now to figure out how i can get my printer to do what i want (sometimes that thing has a will of its own ) great thread about restoring pizza to go

2 nice review,3 or 4 years ago my dad picked up two large boxes full of classic era legos (classic town,some pirate,and alittle episode 1 star wars etc)i couldn't find the building in this set but i had the little van from this set.its very sturdy, i should know my idiot friend dropped this from my second floor window and it styed togethersure the pizzas fell out and they probably got cold thanks for the review!

2 wow. great review!

4 i got the original version as a surprise one christmas. my parents liked the design so much they got it for me. this is one of the best town sets. if it didn't have the delivery van it would have been on par with 6683 hamburger stand, a great set in its own right. the van, and they way the back holds the pizzas, is ingenious and bumps this set up to the highest levels.

4 this set is great and so is this review! i really like seeing reviews of classic sets like this and hope to see more in the future. the chef in this set is the base for my sigfig in fact! the classic sets have a totally different feel to them than the newer sets. they look more human. great review!

2 it's defintely nice to see this past classic town review re-surface again. i tom bricks, on may 15 2009, 10:05 am, said: i used to want this set so badly and i almost got it when it was rereleased. i still wonder why i didn't because with a building, van, 5 pizzas, and a then very rare female fig. this set would have been perfect for someone with a smaller collection like i had then. what surprised me the most is how well this set still holds up to others today. off to bricklink! i agreed that this set is perfect for someone with a small collection. in fact, i feel that this set is one of the "must have" set that can allow you build your pizza franchise in your town. posades, on may 15 2009, 10:45 am, said: definitely one of my favorite sets from my childhood; i still remember my sister getting it for me for my birthday and me building it that same day. too bad i had it displayed all these years on my windowsill so the pizza delivery van and pizzeria have become yellowed. is it possible to restore it by getting those bricks or parts again? yellowed bricks is really very saddening. it reminds me of my breezeway cafe. those were the days where we are too young to know how to take good care of our toys. alywin, on may 15 2009, 10:59 pm, said: i also always think the girl minifig is supposed to be a customer... lego is really up to everyone's own imagination... you are right! the girl could have been a customer. i thought of her as a staff. misrepresentation could be so easy, but then again, the box nevr stated its role too.

4 nice review. i have this set, and i like it alot. its a master peice!

2 do you mean this one http://www.brickset....aspx?set=2962-1 ? i would also like to get that, alone for the fact that it's the only res-q set with a female fig

2 i just built this set in mlcad as a requestfor a fellow eurobricks member. somehow i missed out on this set completely when it came out. i was really suprised how long it took to build (virtually). despite its size this set is packed with details, minifigs, vehicles and tools. thanks for all the pictures! gif xml: 6479 emergency response center edited by missouri_bb63, 31 december 2009 - 09:32 am.

4 there are very few late 90's or early 00's sets worth ever having and i wish i had this one. with it's futuristic look and yes, that tow truck too, oh yeah heaps of equipment ! it's not over junorised, there is still plenty of building in it. thanks and have a happy new year, 'metalandi' !

4 hi everyone, this is my first review on lego sets here. hope you guys like it. and i would like to apologise for the bad quality pictures. hope you guys don't mind. first i will start with the box art. box art: i guess this is the first time that lego star wars sets use white and blue colour for their box. i like the new colour scheme, a nice blend though. here's the front: the back: not to waste space on the box lego do some advertisement to attract us to buy more sets. :grin:the more the side: at the top side there is this minifigs scale picture. it is great as we get to know the real size of a minifigs. contents: the contents consist of a sticker sheet, instruction book, and 8 packet of bricks. the packer are not numbered. but it is ok as there is not much pieces. instruction book and random page: as usual the instruction book have brick checklist, other sets pictures, and tutorial on how you should assemble your set (i mean the very first page). sticker sheet: there is not much sticker sheet and is a great news that the republic logo on the round plate is printed unlike republic gunship. anyway, i didn't apply the stickers. the commander gear: this is a new thing to minifigs as well. well is like batman accessories, they pack it in one small packet. however, you only get one commander gear pack in this set. anyway, i didn't use them. the minifigs: well, we get the the new minifigs. the ugly face clone, new printed torso and new mold of helmet. however i not really like the new head stud, i prefer a black one or at least the one like jango fett, black colour with face. the helmet: everything is printed, no holes at the visor there, but there are hole on the both side. this new helmet mold also made the headgear turn 360 degree freely. without helmet: with helmet: you can see the flesh tone at the hole beside. the blasters: @ short blasters were given instead of long one. is great, at least they give us two blasters instead of one. the tank: here is the pics of the tank. it was not badly design nor nicely design. but it looks great if you didn't saw the beneath or under the tank. view from front: view from side: view from back: what's beneath? under it was 4 wheels, to make it move fluently. it is made by the thread supporter like the one we fet from tie crawler or bat-tank the functions: well firstly, you can open up the hood (i guess) to see the engine. secondly the side cannon that can move upwards. the thing is quite tight (see random instruction page) and there is barrier to block the cannon from going downwards. the cockpit: well the cockpit is small and the space is limited. the monitor stuff is printed brick and is another great news. you have to remove the piece (pic below) to reveal the cockpit and put your clone to pilot it. pop-up gunner mechanism: well the backdoor have a thing to attack to the seat of the gunner. the top hatch is very loose. so it there is a clone as a gunner and you open the back door, the clone will pop-up and automatically open the hatch on top. this is how the top looks like without a clone. there is this movable cannon (upwards, left and right) and a little keyboard thing with it. but the cannon fall off quite easily. the flick launching missile mechanism: the mechanism is on both side and you need to turn the thing inwards to reveal the flick fire mechanism. below are the pic of how it is turned. you can keep you blaster at the front of the side. there are place for you to store them. it close nicely. completion: this is how it looks like. extra parts: there quite a number of them. overall: this set is not bad. the price is quite expensive but you will like it. the pop-up mechanism is something new (to me) but this set have more function and 2 clone trooper with a pack of commander gear. pros: -2x clone troopers -high playability -nice design cons: -a little expensive -sticker sheet -cannon on top falls off quite easy edited by kimt, 27 august 2008 - 12:16 pm.

4 bad quality pictures? what's wrong with them? this is a great review and thanks! i was planning on buying this set and no others but the price stunned me. thus i bought the at-te and the rgs.... the set is better than i thought though; i might do as mutley did and make my own!

2 mattzitron, on aug 13 2005, 11:30 pm, said: the strange thing is, for the first time i can remember the minifigs came decapitated, and there's no neckwear. i recall jake saying something about it being new lego policy to supply the minifig heads and torsos separately. what with the expenses-trimming and all, it's apparently one of the many little quirky things they've discovered in the manufacturing and packaging process that people have done for years without thinking (in this case, putting the heads on the torsos) but that turns out to be a surprisingly significant expense (timewise, i suppose). think it was in one of his blog posts, but not sure. too tired (ie, lazy) to go hunting for it now, sorry >-|

4 thanks for the pics so far. will you have high-res pics of the other sets in the instructions?

0 they have made a special middle piece in this 4+ set: http://www.brickset....aspx?set=7075-1 the only problem is that it's red.

4 good work samsta! no wonder i wasn't aware. 4+ pirates and all...

2 sam89, on aug 17 2005, 03:08 pm, said: thanks for the pics so far. will you have high-res pics of the other sets in the instructions? there's just the back page ad, but i'll scan it.

4 i'm interested in the scan of the back... i have an idea for a new avatar. :)

4 woohoo!!! thanks for these pics. i'm probably more excited about the dark red 1x4 arch than anything else. i have a large project that i'm doing in dark red, but there has only been the 1x6 arch made in that color....until now! now to figure out how to score about a hundred of them :/ -jeramy

4 [burns]excellent...[/burns] i love those parts shots, great stuff in there! this really is a good sign for the new line, hopefully there'll be the same level of usefulness in the others. thanks for taking the time to finish it up! did you scan the back of the instructions?

4 i received this set with a $25 gift card, so it was a great buy. it follow with a similar build to the 2007 trucks, but has a few improvements. of course, the name of the set could have been a bit more creative... and yes, this was an academy review. set name: truck and forklift number: 7733 pieces: 343 theme: city year released: 2008 price: $25.00 usd, ?19.99 gbp, 24.00 euro 1/box now the box follows a design similar to most other city sets. it has the set information and photo of the set on the front, (sorry for it getting cut off, i will remake it). now the back of the box shows what each bag builds. bag 1 is for the forklift, bag 2 is for the cab, and bags 3 and 4 are for the containers. it also has the set's features. 2/contents the instructions: there are 2 books included with the set: one for the forklift, and one for the truck. minifigure(1) the first minifig you build is a simple cargo worker. interesting/new parts: here we have some interesting and new parts. they include a yellow seat, a 1x2 plate with clips, and a 1x4 slope. 3/the build cargo1 the first cargo palette has a few crates on it. i really like the sticker on the small box. forklift: the forklift is a very fun extra to build, and it is probably the best forklift that we have had so far. it is very realistic and is very strong. cargo2 the next piece of cargo is some octan barrels on a meter. i am not sure what it is supposed to be, but it is still a nice addition to the set. minifgure(2) the second minifigure is a classic driver with sunglasses and a coffee mug. very nice. new piece! this is a very nice new piece that is included in the set, a hollow canopy. i believe it is also in white with the police mobile command station. truck: now anyone who has had one of the lego city harbor sets from last year, then you will probably find this build to be very similar. mostly in the cab part of the truck. the trucks build is very solid, and very realistic. i sense ths will bring the ratings up quite a bit. mystery cargo: for some time specualtion has been going around, what exactly is this? it seems like nuero poison.. i am very happy with those 2x2 cylinders in trans-yellow. in fact, you can join in and guess what it may be in this topic. containers: the first container is built to hold one palette. it fits onto the truck. it produces a very pleasing result, and has a better look to it than the containers from last year had. the second container has the ability to hold two palettes, and has a design similar to the first. then, you build on the wheels. the back ones have beautiful mudflaps! finshed set: ---------------------------------- parts: 10/10 (lots of useful pieces, great colors, and some very cool new pieces.) minifigs: 8/10 (i would have liked another but it was $25, so i guess its okay.) price per part: 10/10 (almost 350 pieces for $25. ) playability: 8/10 (forklifts are always fun, and there are lots of things to do with this set.) overall: 36/40 90% a- this is truley an outstanding set, and it will make a great addition to anyones collection. mocers would aslo like this, due to the fact that it has some really nice parts. it has a great build, and utilizes some awesome new techniques. it also has details, something you might look for in a set. highly recommended. hope everyone enjoyed the review! if you have any pic requests, questions, etc., please ask! i look forward to hearing your comments, and the judges comments as well. 7733 peeron.com 7733 bricklink catalog 7733 shop at home

4 metalandi, on aug 27 2008, 03:26 pm, said: thanksfor this review, i also got this set recently, and i'm very happy about it. i live the design of these new trucks, and the forklift is also great. not to forget the good amount of cargo. btw., i think the "mysterious cargo" only are normal fuel barrels thanks! normail fuel would be in those octan barrels...

2 kimt, on aug 27 2008, 05:00 pm, said: hmm...good question. let's hope our reviewer can help us out here. and i can. the set is exclusive to lego brand retail stores, lego s@h, and toys "r" us only.

4 today i shall be reviewing 8290 mini forklift, which i recieved when i went to tru to get a technic set. so enjoy! set name: mini forklift number: 8290 theme: technic parts: 89 price: $10.99 1/box the box for this set is suprisingly small. it's about the size of a $3.99 set. it shows the main forklift, and the set information. the back of the box features the dragster. a very cool model, and the suspension works perfectly. 2/contents we have two instruction booklets; one for the forklift and one for the dragster. the bags: here are a few interesting pieces: the long double pin in blue, a bionicle connecter joint, and a yellow l joint. 3/build we start off build nice and solid, with your average technic build: the following steps build up the detail of the bottom part. next comes the cab. it's pretty simple yet effective. after that comes the forks. they work very well, but if you have the palatte on them, and you let go, it might topple off. hint: put the edge of the palatte on the small lip on the pieces that connect to the forks. this will hold it on better. the finished product and palatte: extra pieces(keep them, as they are used to build the alternate model): here is something that i found- how to put a minifigure into the cab. first, remove the side doors. then, set the fig into the cab, with his arm sticking slightly out the gap. and finaly, seal off the cab. a nice way to put system into technic for your towns. ---------------------------- parts: 9/10(loving them all.) price per part ratio: 8/10(somewhat pleaseing) playability: 9/10: works in any system town, and has a great dragster alternate model. overall: 26/30 86% b+ overall i would definatly recommend this set to anyone, whether you are a system or technic fan, this is perfect. it has great parts, and is pretty cheap. the alternate model is also very good. i hope you all enjoyed my review! i have made the pictures the requested size on my camera. i look forward to hearing your comments. edited by ~vbbn~, 27 august 2008 - 07:02 pm.

2 what that? looks like a walker! an imperial walker? no?€?.. theme: space, blacktron i set name: alienator set number: 6876 number of pieces: 82 figures:1 released: 1988 list price: £?.99 (it seem no source online has the price) peeron.com bricklink.com as always lets have a look at the box first as i?€™m luck to own a boxed version of this set. walking across a planet with a grid pattern sky! the back shows a great selection of alternative models. after opening the box we find a single instruction booklet inside the instruction booklet now we come to the man in the black visor the mark i blacktron and black and industrial he look. in my opinion i think he probably has the second best lego space torso. before the focus group decided they needed to be brighter now turning to the walker itself, it?€™s a simple build which i don?€™t think even i with my great skills for messing up could get wrong. the final unit is built in three key parts. the command pod which is attached to the body by two pins at the back. the walker legs, this is pure design genius. simply built easy to replicate and no fancy parts. the top section which open to reveal the blacktrons high-tech tools. time to put the entire set together, i think you?€™ll agree it looks great for such a simple build. looking like you could take on the universe. a side view of the finished product. a frontal view of the alienator what the hell! how did that take down an at-at. this is one of my all time favourite lego space sets. actually i didn?€™t have it pre-dark age and only recently bought one. what attracted me to it was an old boxed set, but since then i?€™ve discovered a set that i wished i?€™d owned long ago. the rating system figures: 8/10 (i love the dark industrial space look) parts 7/10 (yes it may be nearly all black with some yellow highlights, but is have a good range and they fit to make several great models.) fun fun fun 8/10 (it walks well and it?€™s a great set, it has a large number of possible mods.) design 10/10 (it?€™s ingenious the walking mechanism is so simple and yet so good i can?€™t fault it price ?/10 (while i could tell you how much i paid i was luck on ebay so this remains a question mark) grand total 33/40 (reduced top level due to lack of price knowledge) conclusion. a set which in my opinion showcases what lego was about in the 1980?€™s. the set has an excellent design ethic and looks great, with very limited parts it retains great action and functionality. twinned with the great main model you?€™re shown that there are a number of other great models you can make with the same parts. this set is what it?€™s all about for me, i?€™m very glad i bought outside my normal theme when i saw this. actually on the strength of this set i recently order 6894 blacktron invader and can?€™t wait to get it and see if it lives up to the alienator.

4 as i've told you before, this is a great set and now it has a great review. thanks for this

4 i loved all of these "walker" sets. it was such a smart technique. i made one myself with what i had ...ahhh good times! thanks for the great review.

2 the y-wing is the work horse of the rebel alliance. it’s well armed and heavily armoured, but you’ll need it because you’ll be moving like a sleepy hut! – general rieekan set name: y-wing starfighter set number: 7658 number of pieces: 454 figures:2 released: 2007 list price: £39.99 lets us begin with the box. the front shows it in all it’s swooshing glory. http://tdy.org.uk/images/7658-02.jpg the back shows some of the many features of the set and also others you might like to buy in the star wars range. after opening the box we find a single instruction booklet now we come to an important aspect of any star wars set the figure, here we’re provided with an anomalous rebel pilot and his faithful r5 droid. the pilot comes with the fairly standard lego star wars non-hero helmet printing. what’s he going to do with the blaster taken on the entire empire? one of the more interesting parts is the assembly of the engine, which if like me you don’t pay enough attention to the instructions when building you can end up getting wrong. the key detail i got wrong. just before fitting the last engine. if we look carefully on the side we can see a missile launcher. i didn’t think torpedoes or concussion missiles were fired from there but i may be wrong. after fitting the engine the models looks like this. in all it’s glory. manning one of the alliance’s fighters. not so ready to take on the empire was he? so overall we have a well designed model, which is in my opinion far superior to the original we were offered with darth vader way back when lego star wars was new. this y-wing is sleek and looks great in my opinion, the firing missiles are also a great touch. the rating system figures: 5/10 (for the same price the last x-wing had far more figures) parts 6/10 swooshability 9.5/10 design 9/10 price 3/10 grand total 32.5/50 not to shabby. conclusion. so finally the answers to the questions you’ve no doubt want to know is the set worth the price. i’ll be frank £39.99 is too much for this set. despite this i currently have a squadron of three y-wings, the reasons is this set has been on sale a number of times at £30 it’s certainly worth the money. lego recently placed them online with a price of £20, this i think was a great price for the set and well work picking one or more up if you wanted to start your own rebellion.

4 thanks for the review. i'll add it to the index. the y-wing is one of my favourite rebel fighters and this set justifies the coolest fighter

(yoda has my email :p hehe) actually i had read of the naked swooshing before, but alas, my y-wing swooshing was in my workplace where it's generally accepted that you keep your clothes very much on. it's a completely different story when i'm at home though...

4 i like the model, it is one of the best rebel sets out there. but i don't like it that there is no landing gear. when you set this one on the floor/ your rebel base it looks like it crashed or something and looses its look of superiority actually quite fast. it needs to be at least 2 studs high, if not more, from the ground. tlc is in these days afraid of flimsy landing gear, as they gave to us in the early sw time. now they want something sturdy for playability. but i think there should have been some details on the bottom, especially a landing gear that unfolds. i also don't like the mistake of tlc (that they changed this year with the release of indy hopefully) to give the pilot a usual smile face. the old yellow version of gold leader even had a headgear. i hope tlc realised this year that we want more detailed faces. well, the licenced sets we got proved that, but who knows. the upsides of this set are the amount of pieces and detail, especially the engines were fun to build and perhaps the most interesting construction i have seen in years. also it is big, bulky and looks sleek at the same time, just wonderful. and next to the 4502 x-wing it looks in the perfect size! i gave this the highest rating, even if the underside disappoints. but whatever, it is lego, you can add some landing gear on your own! thanks for the review, your pics were really really good, next time make more of them please!

2 i think it is a fair to ask questions here with the expectation of a new y-wing in the coming year. i came here to look at the review even though it is a few years old. no images to go with the review. bummer. i'd like to see a more friendly tolerance on dated threads being bumped.

2 fallenangel309, on 19 september 2011 - 03:43 am, said: not a threat at all - i was simply pointing out that yodalikespie made the mistake of inquiring about the new y-wing before we had any information on it. to my understanding, it's not so much the fact that he bumped the thread as the fact that he bumped it for no good reason. i'm not certain where the moderators stand on this issue, but i feel that yodalikespie's question would have been better received had he posed it after a substantial amount of information had been gathered on 9495 - as i've said, there simply isn't much one can go off of at this point to determine its value relative to 7658. roger that. sad that the original review pics aren't available any longer. would be nice once the new set is released for comparisons.

4 and lo! it came from the east (denmark) the set which had been foretold the cheap army builder and there was much rejoicing amongst the castle fans. the cardinal then asked was all the rejoicing justified….. set name: the knight set number: 5615 number of pieces: 21 figures:1 released: 2008 list price: £2.00 lets us begin with the box. the front shows us are knight and his rack of arms. the back shows us two sets from the castle range. moving inside the box now. the contents of the box, it doesn’t look like much. the instructions to help you through the build. now the reason you probably bought the set, well at least why i did the knight. this features the new torso for 2008 and is the height of fashion. this brings the number of printed torsos from the crown knights to three, which allows for a greater variety in building your armies. a new fashion sensation and all the must have accessories for this season. with a more heavily armoured look he’s ready for anything. the rest of the set is a weapons rack, i assume that once you’ve got a few of these set you’ll probably like me give up building them and part them out. but anyway here are some pictures of what the rest of the elements are spent on. a long and complex build begins. after 360 hour finally it’s finished sadly five minfigs were hurt in the construction of this rack. now the money shot, where we can see it all come together. it looks great even the rack doesn’t look to bad. sadly are hero wasn’t ready for other themes just yet. in total we have a good army builder which castle fans have wanted. however there remains a question in my mind as to if this set is good enough on it’s own. without any other castle sets i can’t see it being to much fun so it’s not a good present. the rating system figures: 9/10 (great new fashion for this season ) parts 8/10 (shield, sword, spear, helmet and armour what more could i want? well two shields.) fun fun fun 3/10 (sadly it’s rather dull on it’s own i can’t think or to much else to do.) design 7/10 (yes it’s the army builder i’ve wanted design, well apart from that pirate one.) price 9/10 (at £2.00 what more can i say.) grand total 36/50 (let down by being to small to stand alone..) conclusion. so let’s answer the question, is it the army all castle fans have wanted? well yes and no is the answer. while it is a great set and at the now reduced uk price of £2.00 amazing value. i still think it’s inferior compared with the army building capability of cross bow attack, i much prefer army building both factions at once.

4 nice to see a well done review. this set is one of the few exo-force sets i haven't built myself yet, but i will get it on sale, guess soon. i'm do not like the use of slizer-style ball-joints in exo-force, even though they are modified to 2x2 bricks. in this particular set i think the arms look weak, and they lack elbow joint like the "green 2008 mech" set. (forgot name of this years green mech). quite a shame, i find it really hurts the functionality of that "green" set and could imagine the same with the "tiger". i guess with the new pyramide brick as cockpit, the cockpit is still open from the sides and the back. i modified my "green 2008 mech", which use the same cockpit design, with a few green bricks, and it is now completely closed from all sides. i rate the tiger at average, but i may change my mind when i get to build it myself. front

4 i think this is almost the best set in the exo force line. i really like the orange cockpit peice

2 wait a second, a "troll"?? isn't that an orc? i thought that this is a troll:

0 i'm not really impressed by this set as much as other impulse sets. the knight impulse set #5615 offers more in my opinion since it gives two helmets, two weapons, a shield and an armor piece along with the weapon rack. i'm not a fan in the slightest of flickfire missles and projectiles like on the cart, and the previously mentioned one piece axle limits the wheel usage in other mocs. i would've liked to see an added chest armor piece at the very least and a shield would've made this great. those things are so rare and it would've bumped the piece count up to 21 to match the knight set. since both are showing the same price on s@h(in us dollars at least), it would've made sense.

0 thank you for the nice review. the set is not that bad, but a shield would be a nice addition. i also don't like the flickfire missile. a camp site with a fire and a chickenleg would also be nice about the rat; isn't it just foodsupply for the troll? the only problem would than be that the food is running away.

0 more firefighter, there must be a pyromaniac in legoland somewhere! theme: city set name: firefighter set number: 5613 number of pieces: 25 figures:1 released: 2008 list price: £2.00 (gbp) $3.50 (usd) 2.99 (euro) 5613 peeron.com 5613 bricklink catalog 5613 shop at home starting as always with the box i didn’t know red cylinders were flammable. interestingly an action shot and not other sets you might like to buy. the contents of the box. looks much like every other impulse set. firefighter, not sure there’s much else to say apart from i wish they’d included breathing equipment. looking pretty pleased with himself if you ask me. the equipment rack is fairly standard and easy to build, it does however include a fire hydrant. inbuild shot, will i be able to finish this complex build.[/. unsurprisingly i did. i nice selection of kit is provided. all together, i think the fire is a bit odd but it does add playability. if you want to increase the number of your firefighter and their equipment this is a great way, though there is something missing in my mind. the rating system figures: 5/10 (fairly standard i already have a fair few) parts 6/10 (good selection of tools, but lacks the breathing apparatus i’d expect in a set like this) fun fun fun 5/10 (there’s clearly something to do even if you just own this set.) design 5/10 (not going to win any awards but it’s robust) price 8/10 (nothing to complain about, you get a lot of accessories for the price.) grand total 29/50 (reasonable design and good accessories a good set to improve any fire department.) conclusion. this isn’t a set i’d necessarily buy, but while i was at bluewater today i decided i should try to review every impulse set myself, so that why i bought it. still i think it has some good playability and a good set of accessories if you need more firefighting kit, i just can’t get passed the lack of breaking apparatus, that would have made it a better set in my view.

2 quote if you want to increase the number of your firefighter and their equipment this is a great way, though there is something missing in my mind. what's missing?

0 i wasn't all that impressed with what you get in this set for the price. but you have an interesting point; that the robot can be considered a reference to the classic space bots. makes me think i ought to try modding the robot later...

0 nice review and quite funny now i'll never turn my back on a robot again. poor set. i find this set bad, even for an impulse,. the robot is poorly designed and without any use. the space minifig is ok. i'd rather get another impulse set than this. except the other life on mars mars mission impulse sets.

2 something i forgot to mention is that great review xenologer, on aug 28 2008, 08:28 pm, said: makes me think i ought to try modding the robot later... mod the robot? why? you should see the interior! stauder.

4 kimt, on aug 28 2008, 09:52 pm, said: i'd rather get another impulse set than this. except the other life on mars mars mission impulse sets. actually i kinda like the crystal hawk impulse. the default model isn't that great but you get a few nice wing plates to work with (after rearranging it looks pretty good). i guess this one though, is good for some nice parts, tho its pretty limited in what you can rebuild it into, and it seems less value because the astronaut has no vehicle... best impulse set has to be the troll warrior... feels very 'complete', and space orcs are always nice to have...

2 i saw two stickers next to the window. one said "whack him" but i can't make out the other one. can you post a picture of it? good review, by the way!

4 cues the indy theme song let's follow indy on his pursuit on the stolen ark. indy rides full speed ahead on his white horse, but the nazis are pulling away! will indiana jones be able to grab on to the truck and reclaim the treasure? or will the nazis and their high-powered mercedes trucks prevail? let's find out! 7622 race for the stolen treasure set info set name: 7622 race for the stolen treasure theme: indiana jones released: 2008 price: 29.99 usd 34.95 euro 24.99 gbp pieces: 272 minifigs: 4 price per piece: about 11 cents and now, the main event! first, the box shots the front shows a nice image of indy on his horse, trying to make it on to the truck, and the attack truck taking aim. the back this side shows some of the features of the set, in little pictures on the left. instruction manual not much to say here, as it's the same picture as on the box. inside the manual on one of the last pages we have a nice picture like the one on the back of the box, showing some features of the set. random manual pic here we have the nice piece call-outs that we have come to expect lately. the bags were numbered as well. the pieces a nice selection here, especially if you like black, dark bley and bley. "cool" pieces the golden treasure chest has a really nice sparkle to it. the set also has a good assortment of coins and jewels, and some wonderful silver 1x1 dots. the canvas covering this is quite nice. it has a nice dark tan color, and some nice detail on it as well. the minifigs first comes indy's beautiful white horse. i always like lego animals and this one is no exception. here are the figs on the left indiana jones, and his nice stubble, printed legs, side bag and the best lego hat in history. and the nazis, peter, hans, and klaus. their torsos are very nice and the hats are amazing. they look really nice with all of their tan. the extra parts here you get two of the nice silver 1x1s, some clear 1x1s, and the usual technic pins and levers. now the finished set! first we have the attack truck the truck looks very good. it looks very military like with the colors and the design. it is designed wonderfully with really nice mudguards and a well-detailed front. the only fault of this is i think the top part where the gunner stands is a bit bare. the front here you can see the front, which has a nice smooth look with some nice details as well. the front ridged piece works well here. the gun this is well made. it is built by attaching a lightsaber hilt in a sort of videocamera piece. the actual area where the guy stands is pretty bare, but not too bad. backside of the truck the spare tire here is a simple, but nice touch. a side view the mudguards are smartly built by clipping wing flaps on to handle plates. this part gets a bit tedious, but the end result is worth it. the big boy cargo truck! this is another really well built truck. it has a lot of the same design elements as in the smaller truck, such as the mudguards. front view the front of this truck is as nice or better than the other truck. it uses good snot building, and everything fits in well. a close-up view of the tire area just behind the tire you can see those silver 1x1s being used as the suspension. this is a really nice addition and it looks great. note: it's only visual suspension. it is not supposed to work. the canvas cover in action now the canvas attaches by putting the holes in the canvas, on some little blue technic pins and then clamping them down with the hinged pieces. it looks really nice and curves nicely. the windscreen treasure! my favorite piece in action. i took this picture with the flash on, so you can see how it sparkles. i think we have waited far too long for this great piece. the complete set! everything all together. indy is chasing fast! indy's got it! brickshelf folder now, for the ratings! price: 9/10 (not bad, but could have slightly more pieces. at least it has 4 minifigs and that makes up for it.) parts: 9/10 (a nice selection of parts, lots of greys and black.) design: 10/10 (the trucks are really well-designed, the mudguards are excellent.) playability: 8/10 ( i always like rolling the trucks across the floor. ) build: 9/10 (pretty good, but gets a bit repetitive in some parts.) overall: 45/50 brickset bricklink entry peeron lego s@h even after intense fighting, everyone always gets along when there's food to be eaten... "hey indy! vant some mustard?" "how about some ketchup?" summary this, and all of the other indiana jones sets are some of my favorites. they all have nice colors, good design, and great minifigs. although i need indy in a different outfit pretty soon. his outfit is starting to smell a bit ripe . this set in particular is very well designed, and i can't wait for some more indy next year. thanks, and happy building! edited by erdbeereis1, 29 august 2008 - 03:47 am.

4 very good, informative review. i really want this set but i never got around to buying it. i thought all of your photos are great and of good quality. keep it up!

4 very good review

4 great review, i was debating on whether or not to snag this up before its gone, and i think i will, great review and thanks again!

4 welcome to another sunny day in legoville...today we will be joining the mailman on his daily route delivering the day's mail. when i first saw this set, i immiediately liked it.i think tlg should make more of these everyday life type sets such as delivering mail, going to the grocery store, things like that. anyway, enough blabbering, on to the review! 7731 mail van set name: 7731 mail van year: 2008 theme: city pieces: 66 price: $7.99 pounds 4.99 euros 5.95 price per piece: about 12 cents we'll start with the box shots. the box is an interesting shape that i have never seen before. very rectangular. the box art is pretty nice. the back shows the mailman delivering some mail. the picture on the front is the same as on the box. random manual shot. the manual does not have the piece call outs, but on a small set like this, i don't feel it's needed. parts list. decent selection of parts. i really like the mail pieces. image at the back of the manual showing all of the cargo sets together in a little scene. i like it when the manuals have images like these because it's nice to see all of the sets together. all of the parts spread out. the parts in this set are pretty good. unfortunatly the car base is one large piece, however, we do get 2 printed mail pieces which are always nice. our trusty mailman. this torso i think is very nice. the little envelope is a nice touch. extra parts. not much to say here... the finished set! i really like the design of the van. it looks very smooth and somehow looks very lego to me. the colors are my favorite part. the red and yellow look nice together a nice mailbox. however i wish the letter on the front was printed. the front of the van is nice i think. the textured brick on the front gives it a different look on the front which is nice. the back of the van. the doors open to store mail, although it doesn't have much room, i like that they included this feature. delivery! the mail bricks slide right into the hole at the front. this adds nice playability. the van's all loaded up! we are ready to deliver! ======================= parts: 7/10 (pretty good piece selection, but for $8, should have included a few more.) playability:8/10 (it's fun to deliver the mail to all of your town's residents.) design: 9/10 (the design is very nice, except i feel that some of the stickered parts could have been printed.) overall: 24/30 after a long, hard day of delivering mail, there's nothing like enjoying a nice pizza and letting your hair out. why do they make us wear those silly hats anyway... this is a nice set that i can definitely recommend and i think tlg should certainly release a post office to go with this and the air mail set. i really like these everyday life sets rather than always fighting crime or putting out fires. those guys have normal lives too! brickshelf folder: http://www.brickshel...ry.cgi?f=338718

0 good review, thanks! for the mail van, while it certainly adds interaction and fun to a lego town, it alone lacks details and playability, and thus not a good set, especailly taking its price into consideration. its value is pretty much just like, if not less than, some impulse sets, in my opinion...

0 rriggs, on aug 31 2008, 02:55 am, said: i actually like the use of the old style car base and mourned the day that these became exitinct the first time round (c1990). i don't hate the piece, but i did object to the way this set fills in the middle recessed area with a 2 x 2 plate that is nearly impossible to get out again without doing some damage to it. what's more, if you fill in the recessed area, you've eliminated the only rationale for using the car base in the first place.

4 what an outstanding review of a great set. i esp. like your intro. i have this set, but have not opened it yet. it looks like a fun little beach set. the new coast guard theme is very nice! edit: this set could almost pass for classic town, except for the use of orange and the lack of opening doors on the car. 5 stars!

4 a very good review of an especially charming and lovely set, thanks! the whole cg theme looks very nice to me with a good and detailed set design, and this one´s no exception. although it would be nice to see more car doors and some new mf faces, though.

2 it gets placed on top of this piece.

4 the coast guard sets are very eye catching. the color scheme is making me want to pick up the entire line, although the off-shore platform hasn't been released state-side yet. i've had my eye on this particular set for a few weeks now and is near the top of my to buy list. with instructions provided on lego.com, i build a dr. infero version of the jet ski to replace the one used in mission 2: swamp raid. it's a very sturdy design, bulky enough to make it feel like a real vehicle. great review, too. thank-you for the closer look at the set.

2 erdbeereis1, on sep 3 2008, 04:36 pm, said: it gets placed on top of this piece. i thought so, so thanks for confirming!

4 i had to vote outstanding on this set because it simply is, great minifigs, a cool head sculpture and a nice little boat means unlimited playability, great review though man!

4 great review, well done for sure!! i love these reviews of old set, and this one is especially unique. i must agree with you the color scheme is magnificent. makes me want to go to ebay and buy it now! to bad for spongebob though, he got in with a real bad crowd...

0 thanks for the great review. this set is pretty standard as islanders go, but it is such a cool subtheme that i don't care a bit. i totally agree with your comment about old and new sets. i don't think i would enjoy lego as much if i didn't have a decent amount of kits from pre 1999.

4 very solid set. 5 minifigs and plenty of weapons to go around, adding up to great playability, what more could you want? (aspecially from a set this size) only i would have liked another cutlass, a musket (instead of 1 of the pistols) and for 1 of the pirates to have another head, but those things are no big deal, it is still a lot better than sets nowadays. edited by fluyt, 23 december 2008 - 09:50 pm.

4 valentin, nice review! i was thinking of doing this review, and realised there were 3 reviews being done for this lovely set. i must admit this is an amazing set, after buying it in tru for sgd$49.90 (15% discount). i like the comparison of both spider droid even though one is not lego. thanks for doing this lovely review. it's enjoyable to read.

4 valentin, on sep 13 2008, 10:35 pm, said: thanks. keke, imagine the horror that gripe my heart to see the discounted price on the sg's toys 'r' us flyer about a month after its release into retail. anyway, looking forward to your other reviews too. hey valentin and white fang! glad to see fellow sgs here! more reviews pls....

0 to be honest, i am going to give this set a "1"... that is my lowest rating i will ever give to a set in eurobricks. in fact, this is the only impulse set which i do not have it at all. after looking at your wonderful review, i am going to give it a "2" and actually consider it to buy at least one to complete the entire impulse set series. i don't really like the design and the alien at all. in fact, i prefer the mars mission astronaunt more than the aliens. i don't really like the set but i like your review.

4 fantastic review! this is one of the classic minifigs pack which is so great for gathering massive number of minifigs. i miss those days where they sell 5 minifigs together in a set. thanks for this lovely review.

0 thanks for sharing this review with us. i think this one of the sets. in europe this thing is waaaay overpriced and thus makes it a crappy set. we pay nearly double the us price. so i rated it poor. also because the figs included does not make it great. the hailfire is well designed and looks great, but that's just about all there is worthy of a positive mentioning. sorry. [on a side note: as a bronze-awarded student, where's the price in eur and gbp? and where's the poll?] [nevermind the poll, i've added that one for you ]

4 thanks for the review, jimbutcher. i really like that set. it combines interesting and good design with some awesome cool parts and a neat amount of charm.

4 great review. i agree that this set is underrated. the hailfire is supposed to be a little taller than two battle droids, so scale-wise it's nice. the dwarf spider droid is amazing in my opinion. i just wish it wasn't brown, it makes me feel like it's on geonosis. we never saw a grey varient of the hailfire, so it's fine with me that it's brown.

4 this is a great set, i have 2 of them now, and i plan to get more. it is much better than the droid battle pack. for 10 bucks more, you get better battle droid arms and some canon "vehicles", good enough for me.

4 asuka, on aug 30 2008, 10:37 pm, said: thank you for that good review, jimbutcher. i think that this is really a pretty interesting and original looking set. maybe it´s not very stable, but it owns some special 'war of the worlds' charm for sure... yes that's it. i couldn't remember what the spider reminded me of, but that's it.

2 this is polar-1, over... it's day 5 at arctic research base 76. we are experiencing radio difficulties since discovering a number of strange radioactive arctic life forms which seem to be effecting our signal, over. we have encountered a large polar bear which by all account appears to be friendly and playful. our food supply; however, has diminished quickly, and we have to venture north from the base to a frozen lake in search of fish. our cordinates are currently 46Â°45â?²4â?³n, 741Â°21â?²7â?³w. we do plan to take the snowmobile to the lake after we get our provisions in order. this is polar-1, out. polar explorer bonus pack set #: 6569 theme: arctic year released: 2000 piece count: 76 minifigs: 2 list price: $10 (usd) in 2000, lego introduced a new theme called arctic. it was something completely new and different for lego as no mini-fig scale sets and/or adventurers had ever ventured to the arctic. the set offered new orange pieces and combined elements of blue and white pieces to provide a number of sleds, vehicles, a mobile outpost (6520), and even a large polar base (6575). the theme was unfortunately short lived and did not see 2001. this particular set is a "value pack" that combines sets 6578 (polar explorer) and 6586 (polar scout) at a reasonable price of $10 (usd). i may have even paid a few dollars less at a discount toy store back in the early 2000s. a picture of the "bonus pack" with the two sets combined within the box: the backside features an advertisement for the lego club and pictures of other arctic sets: starting with the smaller set, the polar explorer (just a tip of the iceberg ): instructions front of box back of box both sets include the same minifig, an arctic fig with glasses and a thick arctic coat: here's a shot of the fig with his hood on. i always thought the hood is a nice piece that would work well for hoth rebel snow scenes. the set includes a few nice accessories: the set actually creates a small ice/snow formation that can even be placed on water to represent an iceberg: here's a close-up with the blue ice spider: the complete set: next, the polar scout: front of box back of box the polar scout instructions picture the same image as the box: but i really like the real arctic imagery on the backside: the set includes a small sheet of decals: included are some great arctic accessories: and some interesting arctic creatures, like this neon orange scorpion in a ball of ice: i love the polar bear, a great addition to snow scenes: but the best part of this set is the orange and black sled: the back sled attachment (u-haul) has some tools and a removable storage cover: the top comes off easy to store tools and equipment: here's the arctic fig with a great metal detector (or other snow research device): and the sled itself: lastly, a picture of the complete polar scout: final thoughts: i'm a little disappointed that arctic was a short-lived theme. at the time, i wasn't too interested in the arctic, but i still regret not buying the large polar research base after seeing it at a discounted price. i was able to pick up this set and the mobile outpost that i never opened. i'd be interesting in reading your thoughts in regard to this set and the arctic theme.

4 thank you for that fine review, thebrickster! i really like how this two small sets create an intense and adventurous atmosphere against the backdrop of a pretty exotic region. the sets´re well designed and very nice with a fine amount of rather unique and well fitting gear. the whole theme offers a lot of playability in a set-up that´s a little different to tlc´s standard sceneries for sure. and... it always reminded me of 'who goes there?', too...

4 hi! great review on one of my favourite themes! i never realized how cool it was until just now, when you did your review. anyways, i remember my one set of the arctict expedition, the arctic expedition pack

4 a very nice review! i really miss the arctic theme. i didn't own any of the sets, but after looking at the pictures in this review and reading the instructions on brickleys words and brickfactory, i want them.

2 i find it amusing that the numbers on the decal (for the flag) were chosen so that it wouldn't look stupid if you put it on upside-down by accident.

4 nice review brickster! the arctic theme is very nice. the minifigs have a great look to them especially with the hoods. the colors for the arctic sets i have always liked, and somehow the idea of minifigs exploring the arctic is fun to me.

4 thanks very much for this great review thebrickster! i love the arctic sub-theme, but unfortunately i never got my hands on any of the sets, since this theme had its time during my dark ages. this one is a really neat little set with a great amount of accesoires, especially these snow shoes and the backpack which i love

4 great review, i hope tlc does another. i rember reading a book once based on the theme which stated the scorpions and thespiders and such were aliens .

4 it's amazing! it's stupendous! it's almost like whitefang is a reviewer with previous experience! it's almost like i wrote all of shadow's lines! it's almost like staudie is being as annoying as ever. oh wait, that's all true! great review of a neat little set. i used mine as the air conditioning unit on the roof of my chinese restaurant. then some dork told me it didn't look believable or something. i liked it. um... so. great review! thanks for presenting it! i give you a and, let's just take a moment to get sentimental. a year ago, today, staudie had a lame idea: interview the members of eb. he flailed around with it for a few interviews, including the infamous one where hinck attention whored sinner into a corner and sinner were featured, reprising their roles from the whacker and the walrus. it was quite memorable, but then, a short time later, someone new joined the team, bringing it to a new level of polish and bad jokes. still, this tribute isn't dedicated to that genius of the written word, nay, it's dedicated to the whole staff, including the new guy who is still a secret so don't bother asking, i'm not telling! ha! i salute you, eb news, it's been a damn fine year! i hope i can survive another.

4 great review, whitefang and co.! a thoroughly enjoyable one, i'm glad we have a series of reviews that you can expect to be packed with humour and craziness. looking forward to the next! ~peace

4 2872 witch and fireplace review theme: fright knights parts: 18 figs: 1 price: unknown (bricklink $5.00+) year: 1997 brickset peeron brickshelf bricklink ever wanted to turn into a animal, wanted to curse your enemy or just wanted to be rich beyond your wildest dreams. you should go visit the witch and her fireplace. she can brew you up a potion for any occasion or purpose. so head down to see the witch right now. although this set is from the fright knights theme it can easily fit in with any other castle theme due to the lack of specialised fright knight parts and printings. the set comes with no astounding parts but looks like the source for our good magician impulse set from the current castle theme. i think i got this as a promo set. official pic. the box art for the set has the standard fright knight background and lego system logo followed by the set number. down the left hand side of the box a cat is attempting a head stand. also i think this box display the contents of the set in an attractive set up as usual. 1. the whole set minifigs and all here is the witch. on the torso there is a spider amulet which is a little hard to make out due to the low res of the image. the witches wand is the same as the bellville fairy wands except in trans red like a lightsaber blade although it is completely useful as a lightsaber. as you have probably noticed the witch has no legs instead she has a slope brick with the dress pattern printed on witch (get it witch-which) looks better than asajj ventress' from the new clone wars sets in my opinon. (for this anyway) the fairysaber (new word) duel. this is the old run down fireplace of the witch. at the base there are two smouldering coals instead of fire witch (it's not funny any more is it?) doesn't make that much sense seeming as it is a fireplace. the little triangular brick on top doesn't really do anything i also accidentally put the wrong one on while building, it should be a sloping brick. here are the coals. the old trans orange studs are less translucent than the new ones. i like how they have places them above the main baseplate on a 1x2 plate so they are in line with the rest of the fire place other wise it would look wrong. here is everything else i haven't covered yet, the crystal ball, the pets and the magical potion vial. the crystal ball is identical to the one included with the good wizard impulse form the current castle theme. i like the molds for the cat and the bat although if the cat had some yellow printing for the eyes like the white cat had black for the eyes it would be much better. i think the trans green tube things are a little uncommon but i'm not worried about that. 2. overall build: 6/10 extremely puzzling and difficult do not attempt alone . it's pretty simple but seeming as it has a load of stuff you can move around it is good. minifigs: 9/10 i really like the witch and it couldn't have really come with anyone else also it came with the wand which is really good too. design: 8/10 it should have come with some fire and maybe some more orange bricks to put at the base. parts: 8/10 the minifigure isn't bad nor are the animals or the trans green part. price: 10/10 i am guessing this was pretty good. seeming as i think i got this as a promo i gave it 10 because it was free. playability: 7/10 as wth all impulse sets there isn't much here but at least it comes with some animals to have a fight with or give the witch rabies. overall: 8/10 if it came with some more stuff for the fire place and the cat was more detailed it would have scored higher but because this set can easily be intergrated with other castle sets it got a mighty 8. 3. mini comic ! hocus pocus magic shocus turn my pets into dinosaurs (not to catchy is it?) *poof* oh know i think i might drink my magical potion glug glug glug oh! my

2 you already know how i feel about the review. as for the set, i'm not entirely sure. it's a fine witch, but you've already gotten her in the witch's windship and a few other sets. i vote average on this. a good minifig (though one does not have the need for more than one witch) and some fine additional parts.

2 this is a very good review, no doubt about it. about this set, this is a cheap way to buy this set with a witch and some nifty accessories such as the black cat. in fact, i think this is the first time i had ever seen a black cat. it's simple, but not very useful in my collection. because other fright knight sets also offer the witches too. i don't need many witches. overall, i feel that this is an average set.

4 yay, another fright knights review! odd comic at the end. skipper 24, on sep 1 2008, 07:05 pm, said: ever wanted to turn into a animal, wanted to curse your enemy or just wanted to be rich beyond your wildest dreams. you should go visit the witch and her fireplace. she can brew you up a potion for any occasion or purpose. so head down to see the witch right now. sounds like a song or nursery rhyme, somehow. anyway, to the review, it is a great review, such a small set but you've summed it up well. this is one of the few unpromo fright knight sets i didn't get, sadly. not 'sadly' because of willa the witch, i have about four of her, but the special cat, and the other bits (one can never have too many lego bats). i voted the set outstanding, i think it is for its size. kimt, on sep 1 2008, 08:16 pm, said: you already know how i feel about the review. good or bad feelings? edited by shoc, 02 september 2008 - 11:45 am.

2 i voted "average" think the minifig and black cat are great.

2 usernamemdm, on sep 29 2008, 10:07 pm, said: for some strange reason, this is my favorite lego castle set. you're damn right, that is strange why is this your favourite? please explain, i'd love to find that out

2 ok, i see. actually they still make those small boxes. the duracell promotionals are released in them.

2 jimbutcher, on sep 1 2008, 07:53 pm, said: the plate with the hole in it is for an easy grip when you push it around, i think. nice review by the way. i think the telephone piece is great, if a little bit over-sized. i never thought f that but i guess that's what it is for unless it is for a trailer.

4 this was a great set for the price. ten dollars for a cool minifigure and a decent sized ship is great.

4 i love this battlepack! i bought two last time i went to legoland california, and it certainly gave the knights a good variety of new troops. however, i have one complaint, and that is the guy with the lance. i am wondering why he has a lance while fighting on foot. if tlg really wanted to give him a lance, they should have given him a horse.

4 great review of a neat way to bulk up your castle guards and their associated weapons and shields. i hope we continue to see sets like this in the future, they have to be a good money maker for tlg and they always please the fans. francis marion, on sep 2 2008, 10:39 am, said: they should have given him a horse ... with that lovely new barding. nobody would complain about the price then, even if it was $15.

2 i've been thinking about buying this. i haven't bought any castle sets since kk2. plus i really need that scared face.

2 i was going to get this, but when i rang up s&h, apparently they'd sold out already. price is a little on the steep side as well, and i can only see it going up on sites such as amazon as the number of people wanting them goes up, which it will it it's anything based on the star wars battle packs.

2 swman, on oct 6 2008, 07:27 am, said: how were you able to get three small shields. i only got two in mine. i am going to check the trash just in case. i think it only comes with two. the extra one probably slipped in from another set. sorry for any confusion!

2 i think this battle pack is a little expensive, but the minifig ,their heads and weapons and stuff are very very nice! but because of the price, i'll rate it " average" ^^

4 i love this set. i bought one when i went to the lego store at downtown disney, and went home and bought another online. i love that it gives you a variety of weapons and figures. i like using the bowl helmet guy to man my catapults and crossbows.

4 great review! i still don't plan on getting this set. i want to get more important stuff like the new medieval market... edited by lego12, 07 october 2008 - 12:19 am.

2 it's an ok set, but it's extremely overpriced where i live. i simply couldn't justify paying $17.99 +tax for 5 minifigs. the fact that these figures are featured prominantly in other sets makes this set a difficult purchase. given the price, i find it hard to look at this set with much enthusiasm.

0 it's way to expansive for what you get, besides you pay more for the package then its containts...

4 today we will be joining mr. brickop and his dog stud on the tough job of being a police officer. let's join them now! 5612 police officer set info set name: 5612 police officer theme: city released: 2008 price: usd 3.49-gbp 1.99-eur 2.95 minifigs: 2 let's begin! the box a very nice small square box with the policeman and his dog on the front. and the back which shows the officer running to the scene of the crime, walkie-talkie in hand. instruction manual the back of the manual has the 2008 police sets and impulse sets pictured. it is interesting that the good wizard is on here even though i bought this set in the u.s. on this side you see how to build the model in 8 grueling steps... the parts not much out of the ordinary here except for the lovely printed road sign. minifigs here are the 2 figs, stud and mr. brickop! they make a great team don't they? extra parts this set comes with a surprisingly large amount of extras for such a small set. all built after it's all built, you get a pretty nice set. the road sign looks nice, but it is a bit strange seeing that arm stick so far out. the little equipment rack is pretty nice. brickshelf folder the ratings price: 8/10 (decent price, but could be 50 cents cheaper) parts: 8/10 (nothing special except for the road sign which is a big plus) minifigs: 10/10 (you can't wish for more than 2 in an impulse set!) overall: 26/30 lego s@h brickset bricklink mr. brickop has finally put legoland's most notorious criminal behind bars... summary this is a great impulse set. having 2 minifigs really sets it above some of the other ones. the set make a great gift, or a good cheap present to yourself. it is great if you need to expand your police force as well. i would definitely recommend it. thanks, and happy building!

4 i really love these impulse sets at a low price point for lots of minifigs this police one doesn't appeal too much to me at the moment, but who knows, with your reference i may need it with a future project! hmm... it's actually a good way of getting those dogs cheaply

2 i like this set mostly because it has some very usable pieces, but also because of the amount of minifigures in the set, which is a whopping three and one large animal (skeleton horse). the one thing, however, that i don't like about it, is that one of the catapult operators isn't armed. in my opinion, this would have been a good time for tlg to release a suitable dagger piece (not the kitchen knife) for its castle line. great review, by the way, it captured the key elements of this fantastic small set.

2 millacol88, on sep 6 2008, 01:55 am, said: i've experienced that problem too. i find my knights outnumber my skellies about 3:1. a crownie dies easyer than a skeleton. it's so hard to perforate the lungs or pierce the heart on a skeleton with a spear or crossbow bolt, isn't it? a great set with a reasonable price. thanks for sharing it with us. added to the index.

4 dark times in lego castle land... the poor knight is being held prisoner in the skeletons' prison carriage. we must help the brave knight on horseback free him at once. let's ride! 7092 skeletons' prison carriage set info set name: 7092 skeletons' prison carriage theme: castle released: 2007 price: usd 19.99-gbp 14.99-eur 19.95 pieces: 193 minifigs: 5 animals: 4 price per piece: about 10 cents review time! box shots our first pic is the front of the box, which shows a dark image of the knight attemping to free the prisoner. and here is the back, showing some features. the manual the image on the manual is the same as on the box front. random manual shot no piece call-outs, but the color distinction is not a problem. the parts 193 pieces doesn't seem like a lot, but many of them are quite large. the selection is pretty good. lots of greys and black. minifigs with this set comes a whopping 5 minifigs which is amazing for a $20 set. the knights are very nice and one has a double-sided head. the horses adding to the already large minifig count are the 4 horses. 3 skeleton horses, and 1 great brown horse for the knight. extra parts now, the finished set! first, we have the brave knight on his brown stallion. the horse's head covering looks very nice. and the knight gets a nice long pointy stick. the main event, the prison carriage! the design of this is excellent. with the bionicle piece and the white horns, it looks very spooky. the tower this part is one of my favorites. it uses white horns to give it a great creepy look. one problem is that there is barely enough room for the 2 skeletons. the driver here you can see the driver and his whip. you can also see the bionicle spine. a side view when you look from the side, you can see the great design of the prison. it is placed on tiles for easy removal and looks great with the round white 1 x 1s on the corners. horses' harness this is another very well designed portion of the set. the harness attaches easily to the horses and to the carriage. the prison look at the poor imprisoned knight. let's try to free him! the back of the prison hinges down! the knight is freed! everything together all together, the set looks fantastic. the carriage has a great creepy skeleton feel, and getting 9 minifigs is amazing. brickshelf folder ratings price: 10/10 (193 pieces and 9 figs is fantastic for $20) parts: 9/10 (lots of good large pieces) design: 10/10 (captures the spooky skeleton look very well) playability: 8/10 (it's fun to try and free the prisoner and the carriage rolls well) build: 9/10 (easy but fun) minifigs: 10/10 (the sheer amount of figs is great and they look great) overall: 56/60 the future of lego castle... summary this is an amazing set for the price. a huge amout of minifigs, combined with a great design and good playabilty makes the set a winner. i would certainly recommend this set to anyone that remotely likes lego sets. thanks, and happy building!

4 one of the best sets from the new castle theme. we havent seen a carriage in a long long time. and it looks so spooky and sceary! lots of minifigs new skeleton horses (3!) this was the first set i got from the new castle theme!! outstanding!

2 that’s a nice review, though i do feel the price was a little high but as you said you get so much in it. last year argos in the uk reduced it to £7.99, which was a true bargain and sent me all over london looking for a store with more in stock. again as with all the lego castle sets i think what makes it work so well is that lego are now providing a much larger number of minfigs and that’s often what makes a set.

4 i bought this set to have the scared minifig, but i found a lot of cool pieces and stuffs... i love this set ^^

0 other than the minis, accessories and animals, this set is 'meh' at best.

4 i really do love this set. it has 5 figures, which is unheard of for a $20 set. it comes with plenty of weapons and accessories and has a great design. the detail is really well done and for anyone who wants to just buy one set, this set allows for hour of fun just by itself. i already have one of these, and hopefully will be getting a second.

2 this set is alright but it doesnt have that pizzaz feeling you know what i mean. i would prefered a knights carrage realy but the design is ok.

4 i'm a little late in the coming (okay, a lot ), but regardless, i'd applaud you for another fantastic and insightful review, erdbeereis. out of all the castle sets, this one remains one of my favorites. i got it for christmas in 2007, before i intended to spend much money on the new castle theme (that changed once i managed to get the king's castle siege for a very good price). it's really a wonderful set all around - the design accomplishes the spooky undead feel very well, and it contains a good piece selection and a phenomenal amount of minifigs. seriously, this set is almost unrivaled in modern lego in the final area - i'm still amazed at how many minifigures tlc put in the kit. i also appreciate that the carriage has a far more realistic horse arangement - after all the sillyness of the one-horse pulled siege engines in kk, it's good to finally see a carriage pulled by multiple horses again. all in all, an excellent set, and well worth $20 imo.

2 big cam, on nov 20 2009, 10:41 am, said: you say in the review it's great to get 9 minifig's, but there are only 2 minifigs and 3 skeletons?? he's probably counting the four horses as well.

4 nice review! i just recently purchased it for our future son and had to break into to it to get a first hand account of the merchandise! i am not that big into the castle theme...being a city/town person myself but i must say that this set is awsome!

4 this set pulled me out of my dark ages. thanks lego!

4 indexed going through the boards i was amazed to find out that no one ever attempted to review one of the best lego classics, the 6399 airport shuttle. while i was studying for exams a few weeks back i decided to take a break, built the monorail and take some pictures of it. resulting in the present review. along with this i made my first ever poll. here we go: first, some data: setnumber: 6399 setname: airport shuttle released in: 1990 in holland, though bricklink says 1991 number of parts: 731 number of figs: 9 price: unknown, prices on bricklink vary from $261 up to $2300 (!) but this was an expensive set even in the nineties the box: mine is a bit battered by the owner before me, but there's still plenty to see. this is one of the largest boxes i have (look at the minifig in the down-right corner for the comparision) and it is a really neat storing facility for many sets. the box shows the set, and in the background the silhouet of the set that is to accompany this one: the airport from 1990. i like the angle of the box, showing the two stations, track and train in one picture. the back of the box shows some really nice ideas for other setups, why oh why has lego abandonned this kind of showing what's possible with one set...? inside flap of the box, showing details of the set and the functions, detail on the front of the box, displaying the dimensions, it really is a huge track layout for one set! the instructions: there is a nice little booklet showing the same picture as the box art with the figures lined up underneath. the last page nicely folds out to show the entire setup of the tracks, the figures: a brilliant selection of minifigs including airport people and a cook. all figures that are supposed to go on the shuttle carry a ticket and there are also some suitcases (tickets fit inside, of course) station # 1: the set includes two stations. here is the first, depicting the airport. there are lots of details: a phonebooth, two seats, some flowers, a map, luggagelockers and of course the streetlights. a detailed shot of the station showing the luggagelockers and ticket-validating machine, part of the beauty of this set is the fact that it is so extremely detailed, just look at the signs to show where to go next (stickers), and the scenery opposite the street... the station has the same shape as the airport shuttle logo, how sweet is that? the station pictured as part of the layout. the stations ends are made with airplane wings to smoothen the arrival of the shuttle. station # 2: here is the second station, my personal favorite: an elevated stop with a little snackbar underneath and stairs leading to the platform. some chairs and streetlights here as well plus two old fashioned trees, the part of the set that can be used in any layout: the snackbar with hamburger sign (sticker). yes, those hamburgers look tasty indeed! also notice the lights hanging from the platform overhead and the ticket-validating machine at the bottom of the stairs. here we have the platform with information panels and seats. also notice the two trafficlights for the train. here's how it works: the train will travel in the direction the arrow is pointing. when turning the knob the two grey blocks will move towards or away from the track-center, activating a button on the centerpiece of the train (the motor) which makes the train start it's journey around the track. there is only one speed and the train can only be put to a stop or change direction at stations. the station as part of the layout. the shuttle: now on with the train: there are two carrriages connected to a centered motor. the power is provided by means of a batterybox containing a 9v battery. the batterybox is in one of the carriages and displays: airport shuttle. a total of five passengers can be seated inside leaving room for their luggage and two drivers. the front carriage with the button for the batterybox showing. the underside showing the gearwheel (metal) that brings the power from the motor onto the geared track. the black pointy things alongside the gear-wheel react with the direction knobs at stations. this is how the shuttle negociates with height differences, everything hinges and rotates, making the shuttle capable of performing steep climbs. the motor is powerful enough to not slow down at such a climb! detailed shot, showing the first set of covered wheels in hinged position. the shuttle on the layout. the full layout: this layout is quite huge, involving lots of track pieces, ramps, ten large stanchion-poles and the two stations. to show the movement of the shuttle i have made a 20 second movie, which can be seen in my brickshelf gallery of this set. conclusion: well, to conclude the review, some final thoughts: this truly is one of the more detailed sets around (at least from the nineties) and one of the largest in dimensions. the monorail system is cleverly thought out and works excellent. track extensions are hard to get however and very expensive nowdays (especially the switchpoints and long straight track pieces). the tracks included with this set will provide you with hours of fun though, because there are a lot of them. it can be quite hard to incorporate the monorail in your town without having a clearly-based-on-the-monorail-alone town. i tried to incorporate it some years ago (link here), posing a real challenge. the ratings: price: 8/10: this is an expensive set, if you can get it for under $200 get it!), this set is rare in any condition. parts: 10/10: lots of rare pieces, cool minifigs, 9v system, roadplates, lots of minifigseats en red trainwindows. originality: 10/10: there are very few monorails released, this one being the only town set. compatibility: 8/10: can be a bit hard to incorporate in a town, but hey: you got the monorail so no complaining here! total: 36/40: i can only reccommend this set to anyone, it is my personal favorite set upto this present time! if there are any questions, ask them, all comments are welcome of course!

4 yes, this is one of the best town sets ever.

4 who was the one who rated it "above average"?

4 an aweome review of an outstanding set.

4 just funny that everyone likes this set outstanding. i love this set also and glad i own one. it looks fantastic with trains running underneath it. good review .

4 very nice review indeed. b.t.w. a lot of children just love this set. one year we had it with us to legoworld and children asked a lot of questions about it.

4 *gasp* blasphemy! someone voted this set "below average". *brings out hunting rifle* ahem, back on topic; i remember wanting this set badly, for years. and i still want it, just no as much, because it's expensive and, as this review proves, takes up a lot of room. i've already got my trains to think about, and i won't be getting this set anytime soon. i also have a faint memory of this set being featured in one of lego's advertisements, more specifically someone narrowly missing it, hitches a ride, races the monorail to the airport and catches the plane. i am yet to find it on the net, as old lego adverts are hard to come by, especially the european ones. now, to more important matters... *starts hunting* edited by freddie, 07 september 2008 - 10:03 pm.

4 good review, who voted this below average??? i own one and managed to pick it up off ebay a few years ago now with the track expansion pack for £150, in very good condition so glad i did, an all time classic

4 definitely the best garbage truck ever, the color scheme is great and the design is awesome. outstanding, without a doubt. i must have it sometime

4 this truck is simply beautiful! it's on my brickset wanted list! i love the colour scheme. red and yellow are the right choice for this vehicle! the back part of the truck can be opened, so it can discharge the rubbish like real garbage trucks. you've also mentioned that in your review, and i find it a wonderful detail! thanks for the review, jopiek!

2 tenorikuma, on sep 7 2008, 08:30 am, said: it would be cool to see a review comparing this set with the newer orange garbage truck. well i might want to do that, but then in a different way as the railroad maintenance: i will then review the orange one and make comments on it compared to this one.

4 greetings! just looking through the review index when i came across this one. i recently acquired this set through ebay which came with a practically perfect box and instructions. i would almost say that no one played with it much as all of the parts were brand new. anyway, i just wanted to say that this is a great set that was worth the $14.99!

2 6206: tie interceptor number of pieces: 212 number of minifigs: 1 price: 19.99 usd/ 17.99 eur/ theme: star wars: episode vi year released: 2006 brickset folder bricklink catalog welcome to my ninth review the boards, today's review is the long awaited tie interceptor. but does it live up to expectations? well, let's find out. i believe this is the first and only time tlg made this set. so, let's begin the review. the box the box is standard for it's time, with silver font. the background on the front has some planets and the death star ii, clarifying that this set is from episode vi. overview this set comes with the interceptor model and one fig. the interceptor has a very sleek, futuristic design, with four wings and a ball-shaped cockpit. the tie interceptor is a stealthy, speedy vehicle in the imperial fleet. it is used for scouting missions, and not meant for attacking due to it's weak structure and low arsenal. front this version of the tie group is very attractive and cool-looking. it has an aerodynamic shape, giving it looks and speed. while not accurate to the movie's grey and black colored ties, the blue in place of the grey is just fine, and does not alter the "coolness" of the design. thankfully, there are no stickers in this set. cockpit here you can see the ball-shaped cockpit. be very, very careful when opening it; it's very flimsy and breaks off almost every time. fortunately, both the windshield and the dish on top are printed, and not stickers. please don't mind the dust. cockpit interior this is the inside of the cockpit. it is very roomy, airtight, and one of the few cockpits in sw sets that are this good. it makes up for lack of detail by giving the pilot plenty of room, so you should have no trouble there. it is also very smooth in the back and where the windshield folds down. this is by far the best sw cockpit i have ever seen done by tlg, good job! the only bad thing is the two tan bricks that clash with the rest of the color. wing attachment this is how the wings are attached to the cockpit on each side. unfortunately, the design on this part is not so good, and sometimes the wings break off. plus, this part is very blocky, and there is a big juniorized piece on the base of the wings. wings here is what each wing looks like. there are three parts on each wing: a middle and two fins. the wings are very aerodynamic, with a diamond-like design. note the imperial insignias and the blue tiles lining the wings. wing attachments cont'd here, again, you see how the middle wing part is attached to the base (juniorized piece), and the fins attached to the base by hinges. the hinges allow the fins to fold in and out a bit, but again, this is very fragile, and the fins often break off. gun placements this is an example of four guns on the ship, one on the tip of each fin. the guns consist of a tile with a tenic tunnel hole on the bottom attached to a technic pin, which is attached to a black bar. a good design altogether. back here you see the rear of the cockpit. you can see why the opening mechanism is so flimsy: the whole top and front is connected to the body only by a weak hinge system, as seen in the picture. also note the small, trans-blue dish and the four trans-red studs. minifigure finally, here is the single figure that comes in this set, a tie pilot. it is an all black figure, with a life support system decal on the front and a helmet with silver imperial insignias. an overall good minifig, with a different helmet mold than the stormtrooper or shadowtrooper. well, i suppose that's about all, let's get to the final verdict: build: 6/10, a little difficult due the flimsiness of the ship, but should only take the average builder no more than 30 minutes. playability: 7/10, it's fun to fly around ( ), but has no real functions. swooshability: 7/10, you can swoosh it around fairly well, just be careful not to accidentally break it. minifigs: 8/10, a good fig, although having only one leaves something more to be desired. design: 4/10, very, very flimsy with the wings, windshield, and fins, but good for display. price: 7/10: i think it was actually 30 usd when i got it, but i'm not sure... overall score: 6.5, an average set. very delicate, so much that you can hardly pick it up, but good for display. the minifig is okay, and having no stickers is good. i would recommend this to a hardcore ot fan. that wraps it all up, please vote your opinion on this set in the poll, and i'll see you next review! edited by jimbutcher, 15 september 2008 - 03:10 am.

4 nice set, but nicer review! looks like the set has quite some nice parts.

2 perfect perhaps the front sprouses are for foaming the runway? you've certainly kept that set in near mint condition, haven't you? now all we can wish for is a new firetruck combining this l&s version and the new

4 i remember my cousins having this set. both are in their permanent dark ages now but are not willing to give their lego to me if you have one of those old airports, then this set is what you need to have even more fun since it makes a great addition to the airport. excellent review! 10/10.

2 jopiek, on sep 8 2008, 12:24 am, said: thanks of course for the flattery but, do you then from your profession understand what the purpose is of the front 'spouts' that even can be hide, since that puzzles me. it can be that the lego designers thought it was a nice touch and didn't bothered about the realistic value of such a feature but i don't suppose that that is the case here. somehow, i had just noticed your reply. to be honest with you, the aes in my country does not have front spouts in their fire engine. i do not remember seeing this feature before. it is a possibility that this feature is included in some models or an imaginative addition from our lego designers. i will need to check this out. kimt, on sep 9 2008, 03:16 pm, said: perhaps the front sprouses are for foaming the runway? that is a logical answer.

4 nice review cobra. thanks for sharing. i esp. like the doctor's torso. i rate this little set a 4 based on the design of the vehicle and the classic doors. blogged! edit: i must have missed this review after it was posted back in sep. i went ahead and kept the blog, since it's always enjoyable to look at these reviews.

4 found this set on a flea market in munich, yesterday. just 25 years after its release. the instructions for a total of five models, two of them printed, the other 3 are just photo instructions in the book. it still has the box in good shape, despite some wear from the age. sadly five little pieces were missing, and 5 wrong pieces inside instead (2 complete wheels and a classic 80s-90s plane wing (dumped into my bricks). but i was able to replace the missing minifig torch and the 4 missing plates with identical pieces from my collection. the box and contents the set still has the original box. inside the pieces, plastic insert, instructions and a 1987 technic catalogue, imagine that set livespan today. four years and the 8841 is still in the catalogue. classic technic design from early 80s showing a function drawing of the steering and the main model a small set, but with a flap shoeing the contents. all pieces in the inner box and the papers included. 5th model: soapbox racer this is more or less a soapbox racer with working steering, but no engine. it's got a rather blocky design, but still looks sleek enough and is a simple build little over 100 pcs out of 180. the soapbox at step 2 just included the steering at step 6 completed and ready to race downhill. total: 7/10 simple, but effective 4th model: simple chassis very simple and boring alternate using just 1/3 of the 180 pieces in the set. it even hasn't got a seat construction. it's just a plain steering mechanism attached on wheels with a spartan chassis of just a few pieces. this is the whole model at step 5 just attach the steering mechanism and wheels and you're done total: the worst alternate model of the complete set. just a boring 4/10 3rd model: balance very original small model. it's a small model of a working classic balance. and it works with small parts laid on the scales, altough they've got just a 4x4 footprint. it's a fast build. just 15 minutes and you've done it. the model as it looks at step 3 finished. easy build with just 63pcs out of 180 total: very original model, it actually works with small weights, but a very simple build. still a 7/10 alternate model: tractor with equipment this is the second model. it's a simple but boxy design featuring a harrow and a plough. the tractor has a similar design to the very first tractor set, but much smaller. the plough is about 24-wide and the harrow is completely snotted even back in 1983. has two functions: working steering and the coupler for the equipment. uses almost all pieces of the set. the tractor at step 8, the steering isn't completely attached now this is the completed tractor the complete harrow finished alternate with the plough attached. total: nice, but quite ugly and boxy design for a tractor with 4 wheels of the same size. takes me to a 6/10 main model: desert racer this is the main model, with a nice (for early 80s) but boxy design. it has two functions. steering and a working 1-cylinder rear engine, which is of the old 2x2 piston type, since the small piston design wasn't invented back then. this is the only model of the set, which has piece callouts in the instructions. the printed alternate model has no callouts, they weren't invented on both models back in 1983. the three smaller photo instruction alternates have a piece callout at the beginning showing all needed pieces. the seat is a nice, but blocky design and use a primitive snot technique. this is the model at step five. the piston is already attached. imagine this state on step 5 in modern sets. back then lego had challenging instructions, not the step madness like today this is the engine just made of plates with a hole in the middle for the piston step 9. the piston engine is completed. on step 12 the roll bar and the seat are installed. only the steering isn't completed yet. front view of the finished model. just 15 steps needed back then. bird's eye view of the whole set displayed on the box model verdict: nice design, especially the colorful seat in snot technique, but quite boxy especially the engine, since there were only the huge pistons. still a 9/10 set verdict: design and models: 7/10, very boxy designs, due to the age. the chassis alternate sucks build: 9/10 classic 80s technic building. quite challenging but fun sturdyness: 7/10: rear section damaged after the table fall, but rather easily fixed fun: 9/10 blast from the past. overall: 8/10 mfg widdi edited by widdi, 07 september 2008 - 04:11 pm.

2 nice classic set. are those hoses around the engine pneumatic tubes? that technic catalog looks interesting too. i have the catalogs for the next several years but not that one. quote this is the model at step five. the piston is already attached. imagine this state on step 5 in modern sets. back then lego had challenging instructions, not the step madness like today the most extreme example of this was the engine step in the 8865 set, which uses over 120 pieces by itself.

2 name: electric passenger train set no.: 7725 theme: lego / system / trains / 12v / train set year: 1981 pieces: 485 minifigs: 1 price: usd 70.00$ (which equals about eur 50€ and gbp 40£) introduction: our most favorite theme is 12v trains. actually i got my first 77-series back in 1981 (5th of december, i was 2,5 years old) just a week before my brother was born. some years later i got the 7740. after our dark ages we (my brother, cousin and myself) got all 12v trains at least once. this 7725 was gathering dust in my brothers' room. the train in all its splendor. as you can see it doesn't occur at the back of the 12v era train instructions although its larger brother the 7740 does. some investigation learned that all the sets at the back of the instructions date from 1980 so the 7725 wasn't released yet. here you can see the front of the 7725 with the driver in the cockpit. the driver is in fact the only minifig that was included in the set. as you can see, our version of the train has a different front than the one in the instructions. apparently the former owner used 7861 (lighting set (12 v)) to upgrade the train with working back- and frontlights. i like the original lights but didn't notice that the train had those double lights until i did the review. maybe we will give the train again it's original signs and put custom leds in it or so so that the train can drive into two directions with accurately working lights. another thing about the lights that puzzle me are the backlights. while typing this i realise that the former owner might have added those, so let's have a look at the instructions then. as it turns out, the lights are there also in the instructions. i recently learned that only the last car or coach of a train has it's red lights on. so unless the train drives with only the front car it will never use those red backlights. here you can see the cockpit with the engineer. the cables don't look very pretty but well, the train at least has working light. here you can take a look at the inside of the engine car. while the 7745 has a nice 'fake engine' there, just the weight bricks and the ugly cables, apart from the engineer and his cockpit, no other nice features here. b.t.w. lego always used tiles in such a trains to make it easier for kids to take off the roof and have access to the minifig passengers etc. here the 'proof' that it is an electric train. the pantograph of the front car. it has the same kind of panthographs that the 7745 has. the middle car has 4 chairs. as you can see, some vandal must have nocked over this one. hope they leave the cables alone. this early morning train seems to have one passenger: a workman. i like the small 2x3 windows from this car very much! they give this care a nice look. also the door in the middle adds something special to the train. as far as i know, no other passenger train has the doors in the middle. here you see the side of the train, just after the train has left brickingham station where the worker, probably from set 6647 (highway repair) that was also released in 1980. a closeup of the last car with steering stand to allow the train to travel back and forth without having to 'make head', in other words: putting the engine in front again. the train, shunted to an end track so it can be cleaned (i think it is apparent that it definitely needs cleaning very badly). this set can be found on: peeron lugnet brickset bricklink entries playability: 5/10 (the train is fine, but with only one minifig not very playable without other sets; also no accessories at all!) design: 7/10 (nice train, the inside could have been a lot better, but i really like to original front lights!) price: 7/10 (the train came with motor so not a bad price, goes now for quite some money at ebay.) overall: 6.5/10 (nice set but the 7745 is a better train i'm sure) well that was it for today. i hope you have enjoyed this review and got tears in your eyes seeing how nice the 12v era was... it never comes back, but maybe lego rereleases some of this sets in the 2009+ train era (very likely that this is just wishful thinking). edited by jopiek, 12 september 2008 - 04:56 pm.

4 freddie, on sep 7 2008, 11:52 pm, said: a very nice review, jopiek! you know, i was wondering how lego could justify having two 12v-powered passenger trains at the same time, but after reading the review, and seeing the lack of figures and accessories, i guess i understand why (plus the train is rather compact). oh, and i can't help but think that the chairs in the middle carriage are somewhat oddly placed, because those placed next to the door are unusable because the door takes up room needed for figs' arms. also, it appears that your set also has the newer couplers, i.e. there's no hooks for the decoupling rail to grab hold of. with the light assembly it really won't matter, play-wise, or if you don't have any decouplers, but it's still a bit of a bummer. the chair was just loose so it should be placed on the 2x2 plate that is also visible in the picture of the middle car. b.t.w. the front magnet is the old type. i have some decouplers but we don't use them because they are not really that reliable. lego just release a whole line of trains at the same time. i just discussed with my parents and they told be lego had those sets longer in store back then. i must have gotten the 7745 somewhere in 1983 or even 1984 although it was released in 1981. i started of with the 7710 (push along train) and then upgraded the tracks with current rails when i got the 7745.

4 the best 12v legotrain is for me the 7740. the 7725 is still a goodlooking train and the only one with short wagons in a electric version. before i started to with bricklink, i started to build this train in blue. i've build 4 trains of it and sold 2 of them. still one for sale . you can also build this in other colors, like a yellow one: or you can build a black version, which i made a death train of it. driven by a skeleton . edited by panda9001100, 17 may 2009 - 08:01 am.

4 great review! i would buy the sets, but sadly tlc doesn't sell them anymore. i have one question only: how can you be reviewing at this time at night!?! i would never dream of doing that! well i can't wait to see the other reviews!

2 i had never seen these sets before in my retail stores before. however, i do remember the existence of its video games. look like an interesting set for great outdoor enterainment and fun for lego citizens whom is out for real thrill and excitement. this theme never really got me excited back then. after reading your review, it's quite useful for some new addition to your town features, such as including a skater boy, holding the pizza instead of using the pizza van. the high fuel cost must have caught up to them, to resort using skate board for delivery. as for the street surfer vehicle, it's a cool looking vehicle with unique construction. pardon me, i have not seen such design before. i will actually tear off the wheels, cover up the sides and used it for wind surfing! that's the whole idea. after giving some thoughts and weighs its factors, i will have to give it a "3" for this set. i will probably get it if its on sales. once again, brickster this is a lovely review which has showed us a new perspective of island xtreme stunts.

2 wout, on oct 16 2008, 01:00 pm, said: the hippie guy is called " snap lockit" and the pizza guy is called " pepper roni". i think the legodesigners had a cosy evening with much beer when they thought about the names. thanks for that bit of info. i'm not familiar with the computer game or the characters, although i may have heard the name pepper roni. do you know the island girl's name (not included in this set though)?

0 her name was sky lane. it's quite sad, though, to actually play the game--the "xtreme tower" is the only set that made it into the game itself, and it was a really watered down version of the information center from the first two games. but the island was, in the game, filled with incredible buildings that would have made really cool sets.

2 thanks for the review! i loved this theme, it had some of the greatest pieces ever arranged in any theme, brilliant printed parts and figures, and some good colours. snap lockitt (hippie dude ) is a great figure with a cool name, i own him from another set, but unfortunately not this one. it looks like a very good set, no stickers and good printed parts too. nice review. pencoin, on sep 9 2008, 05:21 pm, said: hippie dude? thats snap lockitt, island xtreme is one of the best themes ever, im trying to get the sets off bricklink, thanks fo the review i need this now. hahaha. that made me laugh for some reason... i don't know why though, i agree with it.

2 thanks erdbeereis1 for your kind words. glad you liked this set. just wondering whom has rated poor and below average. i will like to know why you voted this way. perhaps, you could share with me and the rest on your thoughts and views.

4 one of my favourite sets! me and couple of buddies got this set back then. the fig was so cool, sun glasses, fast boat....

4 nice truck indeed, but the yellow one is better i think, at least if you put them on a roadplate it seems to me that those road plates are too small for that. also it will not empty completely because of that panel. well, for the rest it is a nice set and a fine review!

2 nice review. this is a very nice vehicle, one of my favorite of the newer city ones. jopiek: there are two generations of road plate that are wide enough for six-wide vehicles like this. the current plates are dark grey with plain white printing, and look not great in my opinion. the previous ones are imo the best road plates of all time - green with dark grey road, white dotted line/zebras, drain covers and yellow verge markings (just like we really have here in ireland). for urban area i would still choose the green-edged plates and just cover up the green - the markings are so much better than the current plates.

4 what a great set and a very nice review erdbeereis. i think the only improvement to this set would have been the use of chrome exhaust pipes and front grill. i bought this set with a lot of excitement, but unfortunately have not put it together yet. what are your thoughts on these larger 6-stud wide detailed vehicles as opposed to 4-stud wide classics? here's an image of 6668 recycle truck released in 1992: ps. i like the use of "taking out" sponge bob in your review.

4 thanks for this review. i really love this set. it's perfect for my town, and brings a sense of "classic" when i see it.

4 that's a really nice mod badsneaker! the added bulk serves it well.

4 that looks like one of those big strange recycle trucks from new york city, i like it!
