306 lunar landing plates year released 1979 piece count 2 minifigs 0 list price unknown as part of the classic space collection lego offered two sets of moon plates one was a set of two crater plates and the other this very useful landing plate set not much to review but worth sharing a few images the landing plate and tplate the two plates connect to form this very nice classic space landing platform set 497 galaxy explorer included the landing platform but the one that i had was lighter in color than the one contained in this set at least the yellow circle future lego space sets could benefit by having similar road plates share your thoughts	neutral
these are pretty good but i think they look too much like the standard town roads from that period i like the black space plates from the early 90s better 6710	negative
cp5670 on jul 7 2008 1004 pm said i like the black space plates from the early 90s better 6710 awesome i had not seen these before they would really make nice plates for a sw death star scene thanks for sharing	positive
whitefang on jul 7 2008 1142 pm said actually with only 2 plates i could not do much serious expansion with it instead i merged it with my old city baseplates and used it as a docking station for scientific purposes or restricted facilities that is guarded by the police you make a very good point there ive used these plates to represent restricted areas and even as simple airport runways beyond their space uses i never liked the black plates they were during my dark ages anyway so ive never really seen one up close but i have seen them used in a death star display as suggested and it turned out fairly well	neutral
quote oh how i love these plates afew years ago i found a local retail store with about 67 sets of these in their basement warehouse i was given special access to along with many other old space goodies hehe i love the things i have loads and ive used them for multiple space bases and battles along with afew grey crater plates and the large grey plates 15x the size of a normal baseplate you can get quite a monorail layout going sigh i should really clean up and get one set up again so i can take some pictures wow nice you probably have enough to make that scene on the box picture i got one pack off ebay a while ago and have another octagon plate from the blacktron 6988 base im building my carrier moc around one but dont have anything planned for the others these baseplates are still relatively common on ebay for their age i see misb packs on there every few weeks and they tend to sell for around 20 the older kind in the op are much harder to come by edited by cp5670 09 july 2008  1018 pm	neutral
lokix on jul 11 2008 0300 pm said by looking at the pictures used to display this set ive a sneaky suspicion it did not come with instructions but meant for the pictures to be ideas the whole set was suppose to teach children to use their imagination giving them instructions would somewhat defeat this while trying to figure how to build things from looking at pictures would be a much better educational experience but i dont wanna use my imagination	neutral
thebrickster on jun 22 2008 0141 am said it looks like your boat is in really good shape considering its 30 years old excellent review i know i got it for a song on ebay most 1970s sets dont seem to be in much demand	neutral
thank you for the nice review sinner holodoc on aug 1 2008 0859 am said nice review sinner the old sets i donÂ´t know  every old set especially equipped with the old nonmoveable arms minifigs look very odd nowadays i agree with you with the hull shape and its possibility to be extended but every other aspect the lack of detail the keel itself you canÂ´t float it in shallow water keeps me from rating it higher than 310 in my opninion the best police boat so far is 4021 click to enlarge well if youre meaning really old sets than i agree with you but a lot of the sets from the very late 1970s and onwards are still very nice this set just isnt a good example thats all oh and i also agree with you about that police boat however the newer one in the city line is also great imo the only thing that weighs against it is the giant size which makes it feel awkward in more classic towns edited by grevious 03 august 2008  0630 pm	negative
snefroe on aug 7 2008 0753 am said my parents always needed to keep my quiet during the 3day trip and the best way to do that was to buy me a lego set this still works nowadays quote i often saw large quantities of lego sets in those gas stations though i remember seeing yellow castle and the galaxy explorer standing on a shelf these were the times although i donÂ´t recall lego sets in fuel stations in the past i would appreciate to see lego on the go now itÂ´s holiday time and i have two sons you know	positive
as you may have seen in my topic in general lego discussion i received a bunch of old lego from my stepgrandmotherinlaw among the bricks were instructions and pieces for an almost complete set 345 from 1969 i was very excited to find this out so i put it together i recently took it apart and reassembled it taking photographs along the way for the sake of eurobricks so without further ado set 345 house with car first off is the car this was still constructed in the bucket of bricks i received so i never took it apart next ill show you the instructions lots of added bricks per step which was fun however the angle of the instructions sometimes made it difficult to find where things were supposed to go the inbuild shots finally an allaround view of the finished set sadly i dont have much time to post more pictures or thoughts however ill try to come back and update the review later this week until then enjoy	positive
nice review mariko this set is way past my time the baseplate is okay though i hate those dots the car is pretty cool too	positive
way before my time tooin fact this set came out twenty years before i was born the baseplate doesnt actually have dotsim not sure if they were there once and then rubbed off a possibility as the studs are rather smoother than i imagine they once were or if this particular one didnt have the dots this set also shows that the difficulty lego has in doing vehicle scale isnt new the house is the perfect size for microfigures from the lego games however the car is massiveover twice as tall as a microfig	neutral
great review mariko this set is way before my time too i like how lego used to create simple one story houses instead of the really tall house that we see in todays town theme such as 8403 city house one story houses such as 345 just look more realistic to my eyes the simplistic minimalism vibe that i get with this set is something that is hard to find in todays much more detailed sets although trust me i love love love todays detailed sets  the brick is epic	positive
nice review i havent built yellow castle for many years but i do remember the fun i had building it when i was young yellow castle just opened up an entire new world for me also i liked all the alternate models on the box od wish i still had that	positive
toothbrush and mild soap  and lots of time gently scrubbing a cleaning and great review  i love that set wub wub im sorry that you seem to miss the stickers  if you find somewhere to download printable copies of them please let me know satis kimt	positive
kimt on dec 29 2005 0640 am said imperialjohn on dec 29 2005 0206 pm said you might find the stickers here ive searched that page before  it doesnt have the stickers but it has a lot of other useful ones od thebrickster send me a link to a page that has remakes of the good old classic shields and more you can find it here thanks brickster satis  kimt from wwwclassiccastlecom i opened the shield images then copied and pasted them into powerpoint they do need to be resized in us i converted them to 59 inch width you could do the same in cm by converting to 15 cm wide i did the same with the torso stickers  same ratio i ended up with a powerpoint sheet of multiple shields and torso designs printed on sticker pages from a good quality photoprinter gives you very nice stickers the hard part is cutting them the results are the four knights pictured above the web site also has forestmen and custom torso and shield designs that are very nice	neutral
heres a shot of a custom forestman these really work well im using just regular sticker paper how do you stick transparent plastic on top	neutral
wasnt this the first castle lego released	neutral
thanks for the feedback guys indeed this is a great set and im very attached to it as far as i remember i got it for say my 2nd birthday i think but it is not my first lego set youll learn more on this in my next planned review	positive
great review for a classic model i love it	positive
thanks for the review luxorv an interesting old set though i find it hard to imagine a square smoke stack instead of roundish it truly has that classic lego simplistic build with all studs showing and making do with standard partsm except the few you havepointed out luxorv a nice flashback 35 years agonow thats old school anyway brick on everyone 	positive
indexed 410 â€“ payloader theme legolandvehicle piece count 28 year released 1973 msrp  links brickset lugnet peeron bricklink note this set was released under the number 604 outside of the us ah classic legoland a time before minifigs ever existed and cars and buildings could be made with just a few bricks the part selection was pretty basic bricks plates slopes windows and wheels were all you needed to construct an entire town heavy machinery could be modeled in 4wide and be just a few bricks tall for this review we will be taking a look at the 410 payloader one of legoâ€™s first sets of a bucket loader so grab a hard hat we are heading to the construction yard box image courtesy of bricklink box contents here we have our instructions which are obviously the older style of lego instructions the steps used much simpler imagery but they get the job done they show how to build the payloader in seven steps this small set has all of 28 parts in it the more interesting parts of note are the red digger arm the bucket the blue 1x2 brick with arm holes and the blue 2x2 brick with the classic lego logo printed on it construction in the first few steps we start building up the base then add the arms and start building the cab add the bucket the trailer socket and finish the cab throw on some wheels completed set and with that we are finished with our nice small model here is the back right side notice how the back of the cab was left with an empty spot here is the left side notice how on the top of the arm they made it so you could just push down on the tips it to make the arm lift instead of having to grab by the arm itself on the front we have the nice lego logo shown to remind the forgetful of what they were playing with you can also see how much space is in the bucket itself which cant hold more than a few small plates finally on the back we have the trailer socket this was a nice addition to make it able to tow trailers from other sets like 685 just donâ€™t try to bring it into your layout populated by minifigs they may have a problem trying to get in other thoughts considering this set is nearly 37 years old i myself am still surprised by how well the bricks have held up i purchased this set from a thrift store a year ago for a mere 25 cents normally when used lego is purchased you can expect to see scratches marks wearing discoloration etc but boy was i surprised to see how all these parts are in mint condition even the instructions still looked like they came from a new box and not all ripped up and tattered the pieces still connect to each other nice and tight and the metal pieces for the wheels havent rusted this just shows that with proper care these things can last a lifetime i really would like to get a small display case to show it off conclusion playability 810 in addition to the standard of having rolling wheels you also get a fully movable bucket assembly with it you can pick up smaller pieces and unload them into a dump truck design 710 like all other legoland vehicles it has a very basic design but you can still easily identify what it is simple yet effective parts 710 like most other older lego sets all you really get are a few basic bricks and plates however you do get a bucket assembly and the 2x2 brick with the classic lego logo on it is very cool it was also nice of lego to include the trailer socket so you could tow around your trailers price 810 bricklinks history shows them to sell for around 10 usd used while that is a bit much for a set this size it is pretty good considering this set is over 37 years old however if you are looking for a new boxed set be prepared to fork over about 50 usd overall 810 this small machine would make a nice addition to your collection as a reminder of legos past so what are your thoughts on this classic set edited by thebrickster 01 june 2010  0555 am	positive
i voted outstanding regarding this set i found mine at a consignment store it was inside of a larger set from the same time period	positive
woah 25 cents for a mint condition set thats amazing	neutral
this classic space shuttle is simply superb i love the layout of this shuttle in fact it reminded me as one of the space fighter jet that roam around in space defending the boundaries from intruders i just love these old grey bricks very much and the printed computer brick is just lovely its such a pity that i did not grow up with classic space in my childhood these are actually great stuff and formed the base of the space theme in lego brickster thanks again for another outstanding classic review	positive
this was my first space set ever 1979 1980 dont know anymore but i do remember i got this together with 897 for my birthday when we where camping with a little luck i may even have an old film from my dad opening the boxes well what to say it looked soooooo aggressive with those two engines but i never knew why you needed two steering wheels on it they probably just thought a symmetrical model was better  i cant blame them what a nice set it would even sell today no doubt looooots of swooshability	positive
the computer is my favorite part sadly i dont own any classic spaceexept for some space police and a blue classic space man	positive
great job i love reading vintage reviews as it reminds of our childhood days glad to see this in very good condition by the way i will move this to lego trains  town to see if thebrickster will like to include this set inside the review index over there i believe he is maintaining vintage town set reviews over there and this suits there well	positive
im sorry you had to move this topic white fang when it was in the reviewers academy the teachers agreed it belonged in other themes shrug i guess it ended up where it belonged eventually	neutral
here is the spirit of st louis just go there washington and have a look of this legend  cavannus on jul 15 2009 0940 pm said in 1977 trans or yellow slopes existed already and using them would have made the plane more realistic i dont think so there is no 45Â° slope in the original plane design  and no front cockpit window quote a third rear wheel would have enhanced playability and design rather than this ugly black round brick except that it wouldnt have been the spirit of st louis this set is a great one and i wish id bought it in 77 it is the spirit of the 70ties 	positive
daoudbazaar on jul 15 2009 0526 pm said  there is no 45Â° slope in the original plane design  and no front cockpit window  except that it wouldnt have been the spirit of st louis oooops youre completely right the spirit of stlouis didnt have any front window nor rear wheel anyway i think a standard ryan m1m2 plane would have been a better choice less a legend but more a flexible plan for multiple uses	negative
i really like the design it has an aesthetic value lacking from most official lego planes and follows closely to the real thing minus the colours something that cant really be claimed for more recent sets	positive
i always thought that that grey thing on top of the rocket was some kind of satelite xenologer on jul 4 2008 0525 am said huh did they not think of putting a technic axle down the center of the rocket come to think of it when were technic axles invented i had this set as a kid and i dont think there was a technic axle inside that rocket but if i remember correctly some of the later cs rockets did	neutral
wooow what a set not all that large most defenitely not as sophisticated as the message intercept base from 10 years later but in those this was all a kid need to have hours of fun soooo many great parts on this one technic hoses computers rocket parts trans yellow parts the perfect outpst really it was actually my sister who got this one but it only took an hour before i claimed it edited by snefroe 14 july 2008  1236 pm	positive

hey ebers i got my market street on monday and finished building it last night i know its not such a nice review like yoda did the last times but i hope you enjoy some of the pics first a pic of the complete building the 3 minifigs and i pic of the stairs one of my highlights at this set more pics you can find here my opinion about the set i like this set very much it was really fun to build it im happy that that i got some more cherries and a croissant now sweet  a funny idea is the salad in the one box at the front i think normally its a hairpiece of an exoforce fig i also like the colours of the house the dark blue is sooooo nice i think i have to take more of this soon the lighter blue is also nice this set has really nice details like the stairs or the owl at the entry of the market or the balcony i paid 8999 eur a fair price for a really nice set greetings sandra	positive
thanks for the great review sweet now that ive seen the set im afraid im a bit disappointed 8 1 the color combination doesnt really do it for me blue dark blue grey black tan white theyre all mixed together without any over all design 2 is there any interior it doesnt look like it and in any case you can only reach it if you remove the modules hm  now it looks too much of a box 3 there are most certainly some nice ideas in this model and some great parts the best part of the model is the staircase 4 i dont think he spent much time in thinking about the design as apo said the chimneys on top of a garage is kinda weird theres also a gate next to another gate which is weird as well also if this is supposed to ba a grocery then the owner has done a lot to hide it the croissant is nice but next to the brown box with vegies theres nothing that suggests this is a shop 5 the white lamp and the the yellow cylinder are at the same level of the tiles imo it should be above the level of the tiles 6 imo not worth the 90 euro edited by snefroe1 20 june 2007  0903 am	negative
thank you legocastlegirls for your quick review y its the first time i realize the back of the market street the tan bricks are a replacement for some windows id guess i do love that building especially the top floor with the neat balcony wub of course you are again left alone filling the interior but i just had some food parts ordered at bricklink xd one thing id like to know this is an onlineexclusive right can i order it at a legostore kln  oberhausen and get the sum rewarded on my voucher booklet sweet i heard it here but im not sure 8 if anyone is looking for how to fill it with interior go read the latest brickjournal 8 theres a whole chapter written about designing the rooms interior on	positive
hi thanks for posting those great pictures i got the cc some time ago and i really looking forward to get my hands on the market street i think the colour scheme of this set is great maybe because blue is my favourite colour just check my wardrobe i really like the design of the roof and the staircase i am not so sure if i like the gateways but i believe they will grow on me when i get the set myself snefroe1 on jun 20 2007 0902 am said 5 the white lamp and the the yellow cylinder are at the same level of the tiles imo it should be above the level of the tiles i am totally agree with snefreo1 the yellow cylinder and the lamppost should be on a level above the tiles actually i have put a 2x2 plat under the lamppost on my cc looks much better if you ask me unfortunately shop at home does not send to norway so i have to purchase this set in billund yes i am going to legoland this summer or on ebay	positive
im not much of a city fan but this looks great i guess this is the closest we can get to legoland miniland quality sets and considering this is a three floro small structure and its over 1000 parts just imagine pun not intended how many peices are in ll californias empire state building or wtc freedom tower models both are large and in real scale over 100 floors thats a lot of bricks anyways ive got a friend who loves city im sure this one would make a great addition to his town setup gotta tell him about this new set y	positive

well now that i have some money a trip to toysrus was obviously in my future especially since my local tru has much of the summer 2007 lineup when i got there almost all the smaller castle sets had been sold out but there was one left the one i am now reviewing for both eurobricks and bzpower  the box well for starters the castle theme boxes are beautiful the blended clear and stormy skies give a great clash of the titans effect and the action poses help as well  the back is equally nice featuring a photo showing kids how to use the crossbow and the brave axe wielder taking a swipe at the skeleton foolish soldier that wont work on skellies see later on in the review to find out why and of course we have a small box with the link to the official lego website where tlc can advertise even more lego sets p the contents after opening the box a single bag of pieces with a couple loose ones the instruction manual and necessary catalog  p  and a new wider rubber band holder spilt out the instruction manual is clear as a bell no color trouble here folks also its worth mentioning the nice background with the mountain and kings castle silhouettes  sorry that theres no picture but ill take one if someone wants to see it  the pieces for being a 5 dollar set well seven in my case darn your above average prices tru crossbow attack features a lot of nice pieces as does the entire castle lineup notable elements include two large brown spoked wheels two brown modified 1x1s a pearl gold slope end and six dark blue modified 1x1x23 slopes the bulk of the pieces however are nothing special ill let the picture do the talking for this the accessories are by far the best parts in this kit two different helmets in a beautiful shiny silver are my favorite but i also really like the scythe looks good for mocing and the round shield  wub  which are both brand new parts and can anyone not love the classic axe and crossbows oh and theres a black lightsaber too but thats rather boring compared to the other parts p the minifigures can you say four figures including the horse that has to be a record for a regular 5 dollar set at least in the present age of limited figures per set well start out with the two crown militia a regular soldier and an archer both have old faces but they look spiffy with the shiny helmets and the superb torsos ill name the soldier bravo the stout and the archer angler the precise for future references now we come to the skellie although some people dislike the new skeleton design i personally prefer it to the old ones since the arms are now poseable and the face much meaner the only problem is that the arms hang too low but its not too noticeable when they have weapons in their hands and last but not least heres the elusive skeleton horse i for one am very happy that tlc took advantage of that awesome prototype piece and made it into an official massproduction mold however the horse is unfortunately one piece but since regular lego horses are as well i dont have a problem with it i do have a problem with the pose however the legs are in quite an odd position and i wonder why tlc didnt make the front and back leg poses symmetrical ah well the finished set i have only two pictures here since this set is so small first heres the completed crossbow i must say finally no more ridiculous horse mounted catapults or crazy fire wheel launchers now we have realistic siege weapons including the one included with 7090 plus it actually launches okay although not the best heres the other main attraction the completed skeleton rider and horse i think its rather dramatic with that pose and the dark background dont you think  playability okay so theres not much in this set but a bit of imagination brings plenty of possibilities to show you what you can do heres a little story made only with this set  overall rating presentation 910 pieces 810 minifigures 910 finished model 810 playability 810  final score 8410 crossbow attack is a fine introduction into castle so i recommend it to any lego fan whether they are a castle nut or just want a cheap change of pace tlc has a knack with making great small kits these days and i more than ever support them in their amazing rebound from their dark ages between 1997 and 2004  edited by kimt 10 august 2008  0133 pm	positive

here is a review of the new monster dino creator set with power functions first lets start with the box which is much larger than it needs to be it is one of the new style recloseable boxes rather than the rip the sides style this set is typical of creator and comes with three sets of instructions the monster dino a kind of spider and a crocodile the set comes with two of the new motors one small and one large a sound module plus the new ir controler and receiver there is a mix of techniques in this set the core is mainly studless technic there are some studded technic parts and most of the details are standard creator style there are two mechanisms one to control the legs and one to control the head and arms the leg drive is from the large motor and the arm and head are operated from the small motor the completed mechanism will stand on its own without any detail added the detail is added to the base unit to complete the model the operation of the dino is very good the design for the motors and drives is very compact and well thought out the walking motion works well although there is no steering and it will fall over it it encounters obstacles the sound module is built into the head so when the mouth opens the dino roars sort of glyman made the comment that this set is ugly as sin and i tend to agree i think there are too many colour variations with different shades of grey black and that lime green p which confuses the look of the finished model but i guess it might apeal more to younger kids i also do not like the spikes along the back which glow in the dark because the are loose and keep falling off this set is not cheap at 70 but i guess this is because of the motors and ir controller while on this i was surprised how good the range was on the new controller it would still operate ever when not in direct line of sight i would give this set a 1010 for playabilityit has kept the kid amused for hours i would give it 610 for value for money it is a bit pricey overall 810 it took approx 3 hours to build and has been well played with i have posted some more images and some videos of the finished models on my brickshelf page here if you have any questions please ask pete edited by whitefang 23 may 2009  0628 pm indexed	positive
thanks for your review ickelpete y nice little movie you made whats on tv in the background  d after reading i wonder more than before what this dino has to do with creator wacko the complete mechanism is technic only the designpieces on top are classicstyle i agree with your comment on the colourselection x is that turquise next to lime looks like  well im not telling you what i think of right now  pretty lego set but not for me im waiting for the first pics of the ferris wheel or even better the 8275 technicbulldozer  wub new motors on	positive
thank you very much for that interesting review ickelpete y well the color schemes pretty bad and the design of that dinos a bit to blocky for my liking but the two alternative models youve builtre quiet nice at least therere a lot of possibilities coming with that set 	neutral
tks a lot for your review ickelpete  i saw that set at tru a couple of weeks ago but was really not interested due to the design  i am not a fan of those motorized lego sets  i guess the lime colour is to please kids as well as the general design far from a real dino  i am sure that its going to sell well to a younger croud let me quote you here quote the walking motion works well although there is no steering and it will fall over it it encounters obstacles hum i really hope it works welll because i will have to buy that motorized atat and i dont want it to crash p yoda	neutral
ickelpete on jul 9 2007 1119 pm said first lets start with the box which is much larger than it needs to be pete no lego box is too big my friend xd  nice review y as for the set i dont like the colors myself surprised xd  and it seems a little blocky otherwise the set is cool i really like the head	positive
 such a beauty the functions are great cool video i want to get this set so badly great review y	positive
the box is has really strange dimensions  its very flat but has a large front  the 11 scale regarding the spines because theyre made of the softer nonabs plastic the stuff the 1994 cutlasses and brown muskets were made of they lose their shape a bit and so are hard to grip they simply fall off i suppose tlc use loads of different colours because a single or twocolour dino isnt very nice to look at especially when the surface isnt very smooth  it takes your eyes away from the surface and puts it on the colours someone should make an all terrain dino that can walk everywhere from this set  i dont have the skill with technic  i always end up layering and never finish any models 	negative

paulc on nov 4 2007 0221 pm said i kind of like the design of this but more importantly i really want to get my hands on the power functions motors and ir control system id prefer the 8275 technic bulldozer but theres no way i can stretch to the 100 price tag so i was thinking i would have to see if i could get a 4958 monster dino cheap in the january sales if you really want the power functions the bulldozer is better value as you get two large motors two small motors and two receivers compared to the one in the dino set alos watch toysrus and argos both have had the bulldozer for 7075 in there pre christmas sales usually for a week only i am hopeing they will be on sale soon as i want a second bulldozer to get some more motors	neutral

i ended up buying a misb set recently from a lego collector who is clearing up his collection excellent set to get the ir remote and ir receiver and other motors without paying insane amounts for the bulldozer now there is a quite a number of parts in power miner lime green and 1x1 white teeth plate for the mouth and claws the dino alone has 20 teeth in its mouth the glow in the dark antennas on the backbone of the dino is a nice touch as you can let him walk in the dark somewhat i do agree with the reviewer the box is insanely huge i dont think lego wanted to show a 11 scale dino they just wanted to promote the power function stuff as large as possible also the remote is smaller than shown in the picture as the hand holding it i think is smaller	positive
great set really impressed odd that lego didnt include stickers for the controls  cant think of a reason they wouldnt have and why do only 3 of the 4 figures have leg printing i just cant understand lego at times	neutral
thanks for the early review how tall is this next to the most recent recreation of the atat im picturing the two of them standing next to each other looking silly due to the scale differences	neutral
its a different helmet ezras is an imperial cadet helmet the same one he wears in breaking ranks	neutral
thanks for the review and pics this is a really nice looking walker one question  how snug are the atdp drivers sitting in their seats the cockpit looks good actually im not crazy about the atdp helmets on the show but i dig the minifigs good stuff awesome facial hair for kallus	neutral
hi i need some helpwhen i atach the pod to the place where the legs are placed the small piece that unites the pod to the legs is loos from the bottom so the top of the walker just moves around freely wich is different from every video review that i have seen where they can rotate the pod but its not loose the small piece that serves as the axis isnt staying locked on the bottom piece and i have reassembled it all and still its the same  help edit sorry i found out what went wrongdidnt push hard enough d edited by mrpinache 05 july 2015  1210 am	neutral

legos affiliation with six wheelers go back a long way i think the first one was released in 1981 more than 25 years ago this year lego added another one to the family mars missions rhino 1 as its title sounds its been a while since ive bought and opened a large box so maybe this isnt a surprise to most of you but the box does not open at the front as with many larger sw boxes but at the side the two printed sealsor whatever people call them have gone as well being replaced by one larger print in the middle of side the box also isnt as thick as a large sw box like the sandcrawler the general size is however still quite large pict0001jpg 28191k 102 downloads the back side shows the mars mission theme sets eccept the rhino i guess it shows this set will be released as a tru exclusive or something only to show up in legoland shops and maybe lego shops its a shame really because this is by far the best set of the theme pict0002jpg 28542k 89 downloads when you open the front cover you see a larger picture picture of the rhino obviously it seems to be some sort of multifunctional truck i think the basic function is to drive around and explore for that it has a drilling device and six giant wheels pict0003jpg 2737k 82 downloads the set comes with two instruction books im afraid to say they did not resolve the grayblack colors issue colorwise the real thing does not look like the instruction book because of it pict0004jpg 30263k 75 downloads the rhino looks really big because of the six giant wheels i guess its more or less the same size as mtrons magnetiser with the big difference between the two being that the wheels have been turned around creating a unique wheel design for a lego model pict0285jpg 29059k 83 downloads pict0277jpg 28626k 80 downloads the wheels look very cool even though the first couple of wheels stand a bit closer to each other dont know why that is hm  and they could have used a bit more body but the design is pretty good i know armagheddon isnt far away  pict0292jpg 21675k 70 downloads the suspension of the wheels is a bit flimsy sure it allows the truck to move around in a more realistic way than the old sets but its not as flexible as some older sets like sws ctt nor do the wheels have much body the black bars you see on top of the wheels are more window dressing then functional pict0293jpg 24478k 88 downloads the over all shape of the rhino is kinda bulky it looks more like a beatle than a rhino if youre asking me it has three major sections but i wouldnt call it a modular building though the cockpit is the first section its spacious and detailed pict0290jpg 26277k 0 downloads pict0291jpg 29975k 87 downloads the cockpit hangs down from a weird angle its attached to a large vertical technic brick that is part of the rhinos main structure so its not a seperate spaceship which is a shame oh well you cant have it all i guess pict0301jpg 29113k 78 downloads ah yes stickers all over the place but theyre cool the mid section of the rhino dominates the basic shape of the model its as if those two large white parts form a strong and thick shield protecting whatever is inside from whatever is outsde pict0007jpg 21322k 67 downloads unfortunately there is nothing inside its extra space needed to house the spaceship thats really a shame a command center of some kind could have given the rhino a bit more panache pict0286jpg 25135k 87 downloads however whats really great is the way in which they fit together one side has an orange 1x2 plate that fits in between two white 1x3 plates of the other side creating yet another unique shape for a lego model but again its a shame they didnt do more with this section xo pict0283jpg 28775k 82 downloads the third and last section is a platform for a space ship pict0299jpg 2895k 77 downloads pict0287jpg 19978k 75 downloads the platform itself isnt really special no details no stickers its just a skeleton to carry the spaceship nothing more nothing less no your space ship doesnt fall off even if you rotate the platform into a launch position pushing the weight of the ship backwards in fact the position of the ship onto the platform is so solid its kinda difficult to imagine how this ship flies off  the ship on the other hand is pretty cool its all sorts of things at the same time it seems it transports two aliens but also a small car that reminds me of the small sets of spacepolice 2 blacktron 2 pict0295jpg 3074k 85 downloads pict0298jpg 26813k 75 downloads pict0294jpg 27684k 76 downloads the shuttle reminds me of a star trek shuttle and i think it needs some modding but i do think it looks pretty nice sure the cockpit is a bit too low a pilot needs to lay down instead of sitting down and the dropping mechnism if there is one at all isnt all that brilliant either the main structure is a bit too technical for me i prefer actual parts with studs not these lego technic bars and pins pict0006jpg 22443k 74 downloads the crew pict0276jpg 23943k 70 downloads ah yes theres also this green plastic residu think they are supposed to be the aliens and theres also this weird alien craft but i didnt bother to build that sad good wub great innovative design lots of potential i even like the colors sweet lots of playability its a big attractive model i dont see any weak spots in the design that could compromise stability or structural integrity not so good  too many technic parts some sections on the model like the gun and the drilling device are a bit to flimsy id say 758510 price 750 danish crowns about 105euro	positive
wow this year my wallet size has been bugging me sigh still its a goodlooking set and i will get it too many big sets	positive

kahgarak on jul 16 2007 1253 am said please build the alien craft im sure that we would all like a review of that  bleh i dont care much about the alien ship they all look too much alike the humans would kick the aliens crap out of them	neutral
i wish the wheels would be arranged like the turbo tank this one looks too movable	negative
the life on mars theme was so much better with the aliens dominating mars instead of the humans and the aliens were so much better with their own names etc good times anyway i think this is the best set in the series it looks so neat and reminds me of the pelican form halo xd edited by iamded 31 august 2007  0511 am	positive
i think the life on mars series was great although i didnt click until the line was gone that the red hangar on the alien base was for the red mech and same with the blue one man i was gutted when i realised that i want those mechs however the base was great with the small mech and the flying crafts could the lom mechs have been the spark of life for exoforce 8 edited by iamded 31 august 2007  0515 am	positive
lego 41062 elsas sparkling ice castle lego managed to get a frozen licensed set in the new wave of disney princess sets however im very surprised by the size its a 40 set and comes in a small friendsstyle box roughly 12x12 size  i almost didnt see it on the shelf when i was looking for it because its so small i mean i know its only 40 but its a friggin castle and why did lego only make this a smaller set if theyd made a 200 frozen castle they still would have sold every one they could produce they made big harry potter hogwarts sets and those sure sold and have you seen the toys in the frozen section of stores huge playsets for barbiesized dolls but i suppose im getting the cart before the horse here reviewing before ive even opened the box so name elsas sparkling ice castle set number 41062 pieces 292 price 3999 minifigs 3 theme disney princess year of release 2015 links bricklink peeron brickset the box the front of the box is standard lego fare other than the large anna and elsa in the bottom right corner oh and surprisingly nowhere on the box is the normal minifig lineup the only way to know what characters are included is to look at the set pictures the 11 this set uses one of the minidolls as the actual size sample thats probably not a bad choice since the minidolls are not nearly as well known as a minifig the back on the back the play features are shown in insets around a rear view of the castle like friends sets you also have an array of play accessories the seals is this standard on 2015 sets or is this specific to this set ive never seen 3 tape seals on a set even huge modulars or technic sets only have 2 so 3 on a set this small seems excessive perhaps lego expects people to try to steal the dolls if so why bother with extra tape a tiny pocketknife makes quick work of the tape so the third strip doesnt even slow you down the contents in the box are 2 instruction booklets bent a white plate a sticker sheet and 3 numbered bags of parts the stickers these are very hard to photograph since theyre shiny i mean polished chrome shiny those dark lines across the corners are not really there theyre reflections of my ceiling the manual backs the back of one booklet has a friends win girl the other has an ad for the lego disney princess website that site is so girly theres even sparkles following your mouse cursor around so i didnt stay too long or look too deeply the sample page the interior pages of the manuals are on lavender backgrounds its standard lego instructions with part callouts and insets when needed the build 1 the first thing you build is anna but im not showing that yet then you build this little picnic scene its tiny but effective and nice to have something not icy in the set since the movie has the in summer song for olaf im curious whats in that sandwich though  green and pink after the picnic is the olaf build but ill save him for later too the build 2 next is this small sleigh it has an amazing amount of style for something so small the curved front and decorative whips on the back make it look sleighlike instead of blocky but come on it already had pink accents are the pink flowers really necessary technically yes so the whips can mount to them but still its just overgirly for my taste the build 3 the sleigh needs a ramp to help it rocket along for a couple inches at least the ramp starts like this with a hidden lime green jumper plate that gets a cookie on it i couldnt remember anything in the movie like that so i asked my wife and she couldnt either a hidden cookie under a hill the build 4 after putting the tilting 2x8 onto the base and adding decorations this is the result a lime green bucket holding a pair of ice skates a flower in the snow really green and white round studs that i assume are supposed to be grass and snow the build 5 the sleigh looks huge sitting on top of the tiny hill but it actually works pretty well assuming youre on a smooth surface like a table you can give the sleigh a little nudge and itll shoot down the ramp and a few inches across the table the unevenness of the slopes vs the blue tiles holds the sleigh in line well and the bumps in the slopes dont seem to hamper anything the build 6 moving on to bag 2 man thats a lot of colors in this base already and im already starting to feel like theres transblue cheese thrown around randomly the build 7 continuing and rotating some steps and even more colors thrown in magenta in elsas ice palace i sure dont remember any of that the build 8 wait seriously an ice cream stand in the castle that is what the magenta is for i kinda actually like the looks of it but it doesnt fit the set the build 9 spinning back around now theres a light aqua spiral staircase added along with a roof this is where im really starting to wonder about legos thinking those light aqua stairs and the light aqua 1x4 tiles are exclusive to this set as far as i know its possible some other 2015 sets use them but nothing in bricklink yet seems expensive to produce to me when theres no huge reason to need them another blue for the tiles would have been fine and the spiral stairs really elsas castle is known for staircases but not spiral ones there should be a huge straight ice stairway out front or sweeping curved stairs inside but not a spiral the build 10 and now we finish the tree again why where is there a tree next to elsas castle and so weird with ice hanging from green branches that have both snow and flowers on them huh did lego watch a different movie the translight blue bits before looking at the upper level a brief pause to look at some other parts heres the 1x2x5 brick in translight blue and the 2x4x6 rock panel in glitter translight blue do those look like the same blue to you and again another unique part for this set why do those rock panels need to be glitter when lego made the same panel in trans light blue in 2013 and 2014 for superheroes friends and chima sets apparently disney really wanted glitter because there are a bunch of transglitter parts in the new princess sets theres transneon green cones for jasmine ariel jasmine and sleeping beauty all get glitter trans purple cones so theres a bunch of new glitter parts for 2015 the build 11 back to building  time to add the upper level we get a bedroom with a decent bed although stickered the build 12 the other side of the bedroom has some little accessories perfume and a crown i assume the build 13 time for walls and a roof i like the small white macaroni bricks for a wall but whats with the lavender fence piece in the center ill grant that it looks nice a common white fence would have been a little boring but its another unique piece to this set the build 14 the very top of the castle is built separately not a whole lot to say here other than why is there a torch in an ice castle the finished castle once the roof is put on the castle is done and that big purple star on top says everything to me about the styling it just doesnt look like modern lego to me it looks like this should be an old belville fairy tale set from around 1999 if i saw a photo of just the castle with no figs or picnic blanket id assume thats what it was the oops not actually done yet accessories at the end theres a few bits left to add there are these dark purple skis yup another unique part in the lower level let me tell you theyre a pain to get into that location at least with my big man hands more accessories the top level gets a stickered book the sticker has a nice castle image on it that is while not quite exactly the castle from disney world very disneylooking i actually had to google and see if thats the castle they use in their logo nope but its the same style the leftovers there are a lot of extra parts in this thats almost 10 of the part count in the set right there they are pretty useful overall though its great to have an extra carrot and brown branch for olaf since you know those will get lost as hes played with the figs finally the reason for the set lets face it the castle set is just an excuse to make these figures and theyre great i mean just fantastic the print on them is just such a good match to the real characters compare to the cartoon version from the front of the box elsas hair is a little darker than the cartoon but overall these are just dead on if i had to pick out a flaw its the spell elsa is holding its too bad she can only shoot it forward with her arm down like that itd be nice to have the end of the splash part bent 90 degrees so she can have her arm forward and the spell shooting forward too oh one other thing the minidoll heads dont press down tight to the body like minifig heads do theres still exposed neck it looks nice but it means elsas cape can swing around the fig backs elsas cape is glittery on the back and you can see the removable bow in her hair the full set one final issue when you put anna on the sleigh her cape doesnt have enough flexibility since its a wraparound kind and so it folds out funny thats why on the back of the box it shows her standing on the back of the sleigh with elsa in the seat edit how on earth did i forget to comment on those orange flowers to each side of the castle im pretty sure elsa did not have any flowers blooming outside her castle the conclusion hm i really wanted to like this set but i just cant quite bring myself to it feels like lego pulled a random castle design from the files then redid it into white and trans blue to look icy and allow a frozen tie in set the figs are great but the castle isnt i guess the real castle in the movie would be a boring set and this one has play features but it just is too different for my taste the ratings value 710  40 for less than 300 parts is high especially when so many of the parts are tiny but on the other hand theres a lot of rock panels and 1x2x5 trans blue panels but the figs help save it design 410  not one of legos best not as bad as the lows in the 90s but not a great set minifigs 1010  possibly even a 1210 they are the reason to buy the set  playability 810  there are a bunch of play features but they actually detract from the design so i had to knock off a couple points parts 710  a bunch of impractical unique parts how often do you need dark purple skis or a lavender fence piece but also a bunch of nice parts if you wanted to make your own icy scene overall 710  a great bunch of figs but id recommend not bothering with the manuals just use the parts to build your own castle thats better	neutral
very nice review mostlytechinc once i saw this set i was interested in it for the colours and piecesthanks for this review to shed more light onto it	positive
thanks for the review mostlytechnic i too wish they had done a real castle for this set it certainly deserved it my sons and i figure they could have used the old rock monster mold from rock raiders in white for the missing snow beast i will pick it up though for the figs and unique pieces	positive
yep my family all thinks they should have made a bigger set added figs and just been printing money this feels massively rushed into production which is weird the other princess sets that just came out look worlds better	negative
i wish elsa had more of a white hairpiece rather than blonde but it could be worse not a bad set overall although olaf doesnt look right without the twigs on his head anna is a really nice and accurate fig	positive
i think the transglitter blue panels can be icy or snowy just fine im sure thats why they used them for this set now if youre looking for realism like the photos in your sig seem to be it might be tougher but ive been thinking about using those big glittery panels to make a waterfalltype scene	positive
well the good news for you is youre in luck whenever you find sets since the figs sell for a good bit of money  right now the bricklink value of the 3 figs is about 30	positive

hello everyone i am back to share with all of you another of my legends of chima polybags review it will be pretty comprehensive since the finished built will be quick and will be focusing more of what kind of fun that you can derive from there this polybag was bought in september 2013 when i visited legoland malaysia and i did not hesitate to put this in my shopping basket name 30253 leonidas jungle dragster theme lego system  legends of chima year 2013 pieces 30 minifigs 1 minifigure price usd na gbp na euro na sgd na resources brickset bricklink an original polybag image of the 30253 leonidas jungle dragster back view of the original polybag image of the 30253 leonidas jungle dragster the road scout of the lions tribe this polybag design is definitely plan to be the quickest and fastest dragster to recce enemy front by making a swift scout for the lions tribe i believe by the sound of the name jungle dragster it might just be suitable to use in jungle terrain well i dont quite agree that this is a dragster even though it has the kind of open view concept of rolling in fast but it does not have the length of a typical dragster similar to this town polybag design for example still it is nice to have smaller variants of their vehicular supremacy instruction manual front instruction manual back the lego building content with just 30 lego elements you can be pretty quick to be able to display these laid out content after the built is completed these are the remaining spare parts i am fond of the wheels which are some useful parts other than that there are nothing spectacular about it my name is leonidas and i belonged to the lions tribe do not be mistaken of his name leonidas to be the king of sparta who led the brave men of 300 spartans warriors to fight to the death against the persians instead this character is based on the bio resided in legocom you will realise that he is aligned with the lions tribe and is a proud lion footsoldier he may have that goofy idiotic look but he can be very serious in his commitment to discharging his duties you are able to observe his nice back view printing which reveal his black and blue sash leonidas has a dual facial feature to reveal his much serious appearance leonidas is one of the common characters available in the legends of chima universe it can be found in a total of five sets it is a great pity that there is no weapon being made for him in this polybag design which will certainly make a fine addition the completed built of the jungle dragster this is the main design of the jungle dragster which is very simple looking there is no distinct fighting capability from the vehicular design and it look just like a regular patrol vehicle one thing i like about this is the close distinct colour schema of the lions tribe other than that there is nothing special about it moving off with my jungle dragster to conclude this polybag is really meant for lego fans or collectors who appreciate legends of chima or wanting to sample the legends of chima theme it is a very simple built but yet could form a decent force size for recce purposes before sending in the big arsenals to whack their enemies either way i will only suggest you to buy it if you really love this theme at an inexpensive price otherwise it is perfectly alright to give this a miss summary review playability 410 you need to have more lions tribe vehicles in order to bring the best and fun out of it since this is more of a supporting vehicle design 410 simplistic built of the dragster and main focus is just acquiring the minifigure price 410 bought at about usd7 which is not an awesome price so get it if you can get it more than half of this price overall 410 if only you are a huge mega fan of the legends of chima then you need to get this i gave it a 2 based on my review score card what about yours i hope every one of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine comments and criticisms are strongly welcomed pictures can be found in my flickr	negative

christian on jul 18 2007 0821 pm said i would love to have this set but the price is just to high here far worse than i had expected ill be better off buying the battank which is much better priced actually there is almost no price difference between the batcopter and the battank here wacko that is insane wacko 450 and 500 indeed you should just buy the tank comparing the price of the tank to the batwing you seem to be getting quite a good deal there both are over priced for australians and the tank is twice the price of the copter they are 60 aud and 120 aud i am still not sure if i will buy either  edited by sinner 18 july 2007  1147 am	negative

what about the cartoon batman the animated series will always be the definitive batman to me the two tim burton movies were okay they havent aged well though and i really dig what christopher nolan is doing with the new movies christian bale did a fine job in batman begins  but when i watch the movie i hear kevin conroys voice in my head the cartoon rocked and as much as i enjoyed the justice league unlimited cartoon my biggest complaint was always more batman please	neutral

7665 review part 2 the second half of the build goes quicker than the first once you start to add the engines the ship really begins to take shape the main body of the ship has a few surprises hidden away under a removable cover inside you get some retracting guns a storage box a little shuttle and space for a droid and figure here is everything you can fit inside the guns are concealed behind the side vents pushing them forward causes the vents to open closed and open the final feature is the passenger areaescape pod inside is plenty of space for two figures the pod cleverly attaches by pushing the front section of the ship forward sliding the pod in then returning the front everything locks together and is held securely in place by an elastic band  heres a couple of pictures of the final model its not the most beautiful creation ever but it is an excellent representation of the ship from the film the angular shape actually suits a lego build well theres one more useful feature the whole ship can be safely and comfortably picked up by two ball ended technic pins towards the back end it balances well at this point and does allow you to swoosh the ship around much more easily this was the most enjoyable star wars build ive had in a long time everything progresses nicely with almost no repetitive bits the ship looks good and is also huge sweet compare it to the 6211 isd and youll see its only fractionally smaller when i first saw pictures of this on the internet i thought it looked ok once you see it for real it is much more impressive for 6999 in the uk im not complaining its the best value star wars set of the year so far to conclude pieces 910 minifigures 710 would be a 9 apart from the stupid quigonobiwan head error playability 810 originality 910 set design 810 overall 8210 the box says this is a limited edition set whatever that means so if youre planning to get it id suggest you grab it at the first opportunity im glad i did xd edited by kernow 22 july 2007  1056 pm	positive

nice review i like the buildingport the most mmmdark blue plates wub pity it is a toysrus exclusive in the netherlands there are only toysrusses in the greater cities	positive
shakar on aug 1 2007 0134 pm said third note is it just me or did you attach the two black gate pieces too high shakar no i think this is correct the upper plate with clip for the door is a little high on top of a dark gray 1x1 brick so if you want the door to operate well you have to place it like that i just put the clip under that brick a very easy fix so my door now is lower which looks better imho and no sneaky skelly can crawl along under it xd	neutral
not sure i like this one much i like many of the new parts but the boat isnt that great and i would rather get each seperately so i can avoid the whole skeleton army nice review though	positive

excellent set the snowtroopers are just amazing most lego imperial troops are really good however its sad that except from luke all the rebels have the same face which is what is more the most unexpressive that you can find for the rest the quality looks excellent the snowspeeder is far better than the first they realized but only one thing it looks a bit too white to me i think i remember they were grey and orange rather than white in the film and the echo base door is really cool really nice set edited by lord beckett 02 august 2007  0414 pm	positive

man the stickers on everything are really starting to irritate me a lot im not sure i like the white 3p0 in a set that is primarily made up of whites doesnt stand out enough the snowspeeder looks a lot shorter than previous versions steve	negative

a great review jim just finished building this set a couple of steps required abit of lego stressing to get together when there was an easier way just made it into rc  almost finished it in ldd which was easy to do as it has so much room for nearly any configuration of motors and not have them showing a great set edited by jonorocky 13 march 2015  1053 am	positive
wonderful review but i am still not sold on the set if we get more sets with the bright green i might be tempted to get it but until then it is too few parts in bright green too few different types not the number of pieces to be able to use that colour effectively in making mocs	neutral
true but i must say i like the new colour very fresh looking compared to the rather dullish regular green cant wait to build mocs with it	positive
sinner on aug 3 2007 0120 am said thank you vey much for this review i do have some questions 1 what are the white clutches geared into 2 is the engine geared to one or both drive motors 3 how well does it go on carpet 4 can it doze without breaking the blade the clutches are for the shovel and claw on the front and back the engine is driven from only one of the drive motors it works fine on our rugs but we have mainly wood floors not sure if is fairly strong i have only chased the cat at the moment 	neutral

grand moff viceroy on aug 3 2007 0132 am said excellent review thanks what is the cost in us not released in my area the shovel is obviously my favorite area it looks detailed and strong i love the treads because i need them to move the 4 x 4 barrels on my superscaled turbolaser turret very good pics too what color are the treads i never had them they are plastic or rubber the treads are dark grey i not too good with naming colours the treads are the same as in the snowmobile set released earlier in the year they are a hard plastic	neutral
lordgalewind on aug 3 2007 0317 am said ah mani wanted to review it with mine oh well here in the us it cost 150 and has 1355 pieces total the pins and axles did seem a bit difficult in putting them into place a problem i have been having is the batterys are done after about 4 hours of play which i really wish they would last longer   overall it is a stupendous set and it is really nice to see our old friend the studs make a return you found it in the us where im really liking this set its looking better now that im seeing more of it at differnt angles imvery curious how wellit pulls and and can pushdoze before the clutches start slipping	positive
thanks for the great review of this set ive been looking forward to it as well and i am excited about the wireless controls like the dino i too am curious if this set has been released here in the us i was told that it was a sept 1 release i agree about the battery life my dino set lasted about 4 hours too	positive
thank you very much for that neat review ickelpete y your picturesre very interesting and your videos really good that set looks very beautiful to me a formidable new technic set that quicklyll turn into an everlasting classic for sure  im just a little sorry for those quality problems well i hope that tlcll work on that matter and fix it soon 8	positive

thanks for the review i cant help but think the minifigures are the weak part of the set snake and apu are great but the rest i dont know they kinda redundant now they could at least give us new torso printing like homer wearing his jacket or bart wearing his blue tshirt or marge wearing her coat or as i said in the discussion thread id have included jasper in cmf series 2 and a frozen version here overall the set looks kinda smaller than what i thought snakes bag needed a  symbol printed because it looks like he is stealing gargabe  pretty good review overall	positive
thanks for all the feedback you guys robert8 on 12 april 2015  1125 pm said i cant help but think the minifigures are the weak part of the set snake and apu are great but the rest i dont know they kinda redundant now they could at least give us new torso printing like homer wearing his jacket or bart wearing his blue tshirt or marge wearing her coat or as i said in the discussion thread id have included jasper in cmf series 2 and a frozen version here overall the set looks kinda smaller than what i thought i agree but so many people were complaining about how the simpsons house should have included the most common versions mostly because the eyes or whatever so i think lego played it safe and just included the normal versions it makes sense since series 1 is gone forever and the common versions were in there and this set is bound to be in stock for a very long time like the death star i never really agreed when people were complaining about the alternate eye prints personally but i guess this is a good business choice based on previous feedback edited by just2good 13 april 2015  1206 am	negative
hello everyone excellent review english is not my native language but i want to express my opinion simpsons house was the first of its kind and i can say without exaggeration that this is the most impressive set that im going my collection httpbricksetcomsetsownedbyceleb  i look at the video from the kwikemart and is difficult to say how good it is compared with the house the main disadvantages that i said to myself is this build the walls of the large panels next is access to the roof gray parts in front of the back door i think they represent the stairs is not on the level with doors on the roof and when you open them you can see the white block is openly trash my points of view boxes on the left of go to the store and powersauce box i want see make real and not just a cube fe such as in the unreleased star wars set about minifigures i fully agree with robert8 two more of the same homer marge and bart personally i put my set as a scene and all the replays minifigure are inside the house that was not identical characters next and also absolutely terrible barts accessory this set is made parking for bikes and it looks very cool but damn it is hoped to see the bart or lisas bike instead of useless balloons with paint the walls are made with convex inside panels why so can anyone know have not seen any pictures with such walls in tv show why did not they turn i personally really like how realized roof but my brother says that it is terrible  garden could do more in the series there were almost jungle i do not know how to be considered here maybe anyone can express any opinion or idea i look at the simpsons house and then look at the photo of this emart i can not understand in the house we have a garage two floors cool floor a lot of furniture all the rooms and walls collected from cubes many additional accessories and where is all this detail here it looks much smaller maybe even poorer if they still will release next year comic book store it will be even less of course it is difficult to estimate without seeing it live we have it will be sold only in may at first sight it does not look so impressive as the house can certainly the case in the limit on the amount of detail but why it was impossible to add  50 to the cost and make jasper the more detailed the roof the walls of the smaller elements that it was not convex sad thanks all for attention edited by celeb 13 april 2015  0510 am	positive
can you post a pic of it next to the simpsons house just curious about size comparisons	positive
incredible set thanks for the pics so many details and unique prints and colors im not that into the simpsons but definitely a top tier set	positive
heres a size comp to the house click for a bigger image	positive
thats actually not bad sizing imo sure it looks like you get a lot more with the house but the kwikemart has a lot more of those little references that make it simpsons i agree with some of the complaining a real jasper behind a transblue panel would have been cool you could always bulk up the roof with more foliage i think it has a great foundation as a set but could do with a few mods to make it better thanks for the pictures i greatly appreciate being able to see reviews like this before dropping 200 on a lego set	negative
great review just2good honestly i love this set lots of great details and references	positive
one thing that may justify the price it has 527 different parts if i counted correctly i alway heard the more different parts the more difficult the set is to produce the simpsons house already had an astonishig amount of different pieces but this one is even more extreme	negative
nice review im building it need to finish it but im at work right now with the printed piece you forgot to show the chocolat milk 1x1 brick which is exclusive to this set yet it isnt referenced on bricklink yet only the blue one the set is really fun to build with a lot of little pieces for the fridges i havent put the stickers yet will see the final product to put the essentials ones	positive
i recently acquired 90 of this set so i thought i would do a review of it please note that half of the minifigs are wrong and there are some part substitutions this is the only set that comes with this plate there is a depression under the grey plates to the back the pool depression can be easily covered by three quarter circle plates which just happen to be included in this set good set design lego the stairs are old fabuland ones and have been used in a few other sets this is the only one that has them in parapink however what is the difference between parapink and pink dunno the big windows are in only two other sets both of them dacta ones the smaller ones were in one other paradisa set the interior while simple works very well i love the coffee machine a cute car came with the set as well the bird house is a nice idea as well once the current visitors leave i will probably be breaking this set i wish lego would go back to these sets as they always had some great parts in them	negative
nice review sinner y my favorite part of this set is the parrot in the front window wub	positive

due to a larger bl order in the us i couldnt resist to add two hopper waggons to my train layout heres a review of this fantastic set the box well theres nothing really special about it the open box with three polybags note that there are only three different colors used in that set actually there are 4 but you cant see the dark grey ones great color composition by the way wub and  no stickers   d oooops  i opened the bags too fast help me im drowning sing not following the instructions i built the wheels first to get the larger pieces out of the way keep on rolling this is the load of the hopper waggon 11 round bricks altogether when i opened the set i was curious if it was a new colored set or an old one luckily enough it was an old one with old dark grey i dont know if tlc ever produced this set with bley from the following pic you can clearly see that the set is an old one look at these slope bricks see what i mean all bricks are looking exactly the same buy a set today means get at least three different textures on the slopes and maybe even more shades of tan x  i have said that in many other threads here and im saying it again back to the roots lego you were able to produce good quality show us you can still do it sad but now to the building its a 6 x 24 train base plate youre building on did i say i liked the colors d this is the mechanism to unload the waggon built in the waggon with open gates  and with closed ones almost done this is the first time i realized that minifigs actually can step on those ladders  a short lift and the wheels are fixed this darn mechanism wait im coming with my monkey wrench  who opened that door again do i have to do it all on my own  finally the work is done now have a brake one shot from the frontback you can see the car is really huge 8 i put it behind the red car of the 4512 that sure looked very strange wacko the set fits a lot better to the other cars of the my own train theme than to the older ones the score brick selection 1010 excellent color and brick selection these were the days playability 910 great unloading mechanism pricepiece count ratio 810 at peeron it says 20 i got it for 3995  30228 bricks not really cheap but worth every cent  overall rating 910 and a definity must buy for rolling stock lovers sad enough its not available on sh any more but there are still sets on bl and ebay thats for now folks thank you for reading i have some job to do	positive

man that spongebob head cracks me up hilaritythis is a cool set although i much prefer the chum bucket set i dont see whats wrong with the course then again i can see why afols wouldnt like it its just playability really i like the breakable wall though the building is cool a few modifications ie making it more realistic real chairs for a start and it would make a cool little wharf for your lego town and to sw4j mrs puffs legs are connected at the feet if you look closely so thanks for the great review yoda	positive

lego 31036 creator toy and grocery shop thanks to eurobricks for making this review possible for years lego has offered a house of some sort in the creator line each year  with the standard creator 3in1 instructions thats given us a very wide variety of housing in 2014 they added a business option with their 31026 bike shop and cafe set this continues into this years toy and grocery shop set these shops are smaller than the very detailed modular buildings but that should help them fit in better with the other city sets and this also lets them get into more kids cities with their lower pricetag name toy and grocery shop set number 31036 pieces 466 price 3999 minifigs 2 theme creator year of release 2015 links bricklink peeron brickset the box the front of the box shows the a version model out of the three plus insets of the b and c versions i like the sortaeuropean looking backdrop it goes well with the styling of the buildings interestingly the main model is shown opened up for play while the two insets show those versions folded the box top on the top of the box lego helpfully shows that with 3 of these sets you can make a whole street the box back on the back you get to again see all three versions together but this time folded its a little creepy though with those clones running around  the manuals yep three actual printed manuals theres nothing indicating them as being a b and c models but its pretty obvious looking at the designs which is the main model and which are the alternates the contents bags of parts and two plates nothing terribly exciting to see here the minifigs nothing new here but two nice figs nonetheless well bricklink does say that both figs are unique to this set but theres not any new parts to them the closest thing to rare is the female head  its only in this set 2013s dragon mountain castle set a uk store grand opening set and one of the 2014 holiday freebie sets the faces arent that unique but i guess this exact combo of two faces on the head is i love the kid torso with the spaceman on it the minifig backs no back printing on anything here except for an alternate female face sorry i do like that her two faces are so different though thats much better than when a head has a scared and a more scared face the c build enough with the basics lets build im going to review them in the same order i built them backwards since you can tell immediately looking at the 3 designs that theyre going to use different numbers of pieces and so forth i figured id build the smallest first lest it seem like a letdown all three have some basic similarities  the two plates are hinged to give a building that opens for play they also do have interiors which you can see starting to form here the c build front its a pretty quick build so its done already heres the front of the building with it opened up like this it appears to be two separate stores a newsstand and some sort of shop you can enter all the printed tiles help give the newsstand a detailed appearance but im not sure why theyve got a 100 bill lying on the ledge the c build rear from the back side the interiors are pretty plain the shop half has a plant in a jar and a weird chair and the newsstand just has a register the c build sides heres the two sides of the folded building on the hinge side theres a bunch of windows in a disjointed wall with random colors on the other why did they put in a huge window when the set does include a transclear door that could have gone there and you get a small patch of plants like so many sets seem to have these days the c build extras thats a lot of leftovers there and not just little stuff  multiple doors stairs etc and unused sand green is always a little sad the b build 1 a pretty similar start with the hinge and little garden and some tiles along the ground the b build 2 now we see a big windowed wall some details like lights and how it has the usual alternate model weird part usage  like a 1x4 brick with side studs being used over the doorway even though those side studs will not get used the b build front the finished building gives us a nice little post office with a lettercarrying bird on the roof hope thats not their normal method of delivery something about the colors just doesnt work for me though the combo of white  light grey  dark grey  black  sand green plus tan is just too much the tan window and door frames i dont like the b build inside on the inside things are weird the counter on the left is ok but the light above the door with a yellow clip ugly is too big and everything else over there by the door doesnt make much sense either the b build sides i like the front side here except the colors are still too much the bench greenery mailbox on the corner and streetlight are all nice the boy is a little creepy though  binoculars in hand plus a telescope on the roof of the post office why the hinge side shows more of the weird colors you get in the wall but thats going to be hidden when the set is open plus we even see that on big modulars at times so its not so terrible the b build leftovers again a lot of leftover parts its obvious this was another alternate but itd be nice to see more of them used to make a bigger building but lets move on to the model that does use them all the a build 1 the first half starts like this maybe its just my bias but it already feels like a more detailed build bottles on the wall the yellow and red awning over the window etc the a build 2 the other half starts off with detailed work too i think thats a red vending machine the stairs are also very solidly built i also appreciate the effort to get that diagonal base where a door will be  its such a nice touch to have sections of a building that arent right angles the a build 3 not too much has been added but i wanted to showcase the tiny toys before they get hidden by a wall that robot and train are just fantastic little micro builds the a build 4 things are coming together quickly the walls windows and doors get the first floor nearly done im still not big on the sand green and tan combo but i do really like the red and yellow awnings the a build 5 it appears the shop owner lives upstairs since weve got a bedroom forming here the bed is a little plain but the table and lamp on the other half are great and my big fingers did not like putting all those railings on the balcony with the telescope posts and tile tops knocked quite a few off before i got them all done the a build front and its done all the details make this set really feel like a minimodular the roofline has great greebling and the shop contents and on and on its not perfect though the tiny car above the toy store door isnt nearly as good as the toys inside and the kids yellow scooter the wheels arent even on the ground much less able to roll the scooter looks decent though so that counts for something well at least as long as you are at this angle since the boys only got 1 foot on the 1 stud wide scooter the a build inside most of the interior has been seen already the roof though does a nice job of being interesting for a roof a skylight the edge rails etc and you can see theres not much wrong color in the walls the a model sides an interesting building when folded up very tall and skinny you can tell its not really meant to be displayed this way  its meant to be open the good  lots i like the awning the diagonal door the flowerbox under the upper window the folding gate on the balcony that lets it be used in open or closed mode and the green  white  blue colors the bad  well the stairs end short of the upper door i still dont really like the tan doorframes i think black would have been better and why dont the upper floors match up in size the a model leftovers ah thats more like it just a few small pieces left as spares the errors you might have to click through to the fullsize versions but i did catch a few weird errors in the manuals first in the photo of the newsstand the map in the front corner is on there sideways the map does have a clear north arrow printed on it on the second image the boys feet are hanging off the edge just unusual to see an alignment error in the manual like that the comparison here are this set and the modular detective office side by side theres a huge difference  as youd expect but is the difference more than youd expect this set is 466 parts 40 the do is 2262 pieces and 160 5 times the parts 4 times the price looking at them side by side id expect a bigger difference in both the conclusion so whats my conclusion on this model i love the main model but the alternates are meh its a nice set for someone looking for a town building other than police and fire stations but who isnt ready to move to the modular line compared to the modulars though it seems overpriced part of that is because the huge modulars are actually a great deal compared to other lego sets im also a little surprised that its so small when you compare it to the city sets like a police station those are generally designed with much more open space letting them be more of a playset this one is small and cramped so itd be tougher to play in its not really a city set though the ratings value 710  its under the 10 cents a part mark but thats largely due to having a ton of tiny parts all those flowers and decorative 1x1 round studs add up quickly design 710  good and bad on the colors and theres a big difference between the quality of the main vs alternate models having so many leftover pieces is one thing when the creator set makes 3 very different models ie a boat plane and truck when its 3 buildings it seems wasteful to have so many parts leftover minifigs 610  im not sure they both fit the set i suppose the boy is going to the toy store and the woman is going to the grocery but theres no storekeeper in either the woman doesnt look like a storekeeper to me so thats why i assume shes another shopper i love the boy but the woman is just soso  except that i do appreciate the head having two very different expressions but again that doesnt fit the set i cant see her scared face being used playability 610  the shops are detailed with registers and so forth but its all so tiny itd be hard to play with the figs in it parts 910  tons of windows and doors plus nice sand green bricks but some things the large blue curves used on the roof for example are weirdly specialized and would be hard to use in another building design overall 710  id recommend doing what i did  build the alternates first then the main since thats how youll want to leave it id really like to see the price a little lower compared to other sets again the part count is inflated due to so many tiny parts and the finished building is tiny but its loaded with neat details	positive
great review very thorough its not a set which makes me run to tye store but it definitely has some fun elements i do like your new grey background your pictures look great	neutral

im a big fan of anime and have watched some mechas like full metal panic neon evangelion genesis it is a mecha and chobits well she is a robot so i was curious to see what this new exo force line was all about the colorful sets and mangalike characters didnt persuade me right away but the urgent need for a couple of white 3x3 wing plates made me purchase this little thing it cost me 70 dkr as you can see on the box this is 930 euro or about the same an american has to pay for the new republic cruiser pretty expensive for so few pieces 90  a spare technic pin the box an actionpacked box with one of the sides being oddly empty except from the legologo whats inside there is a small building instruction two polybags no bag building here and a sticker sheet with alarmingly many stickers the build it takes so little time to build this set that i didnt get to take any pictures of the process every step was accompanied by an element description although i doubt most of you will need that with so few pieces to keep track on most of the dark green bricks have a sticker  even the slopes where the rough surface makes stickers fall off easily there should also have been a sticker on the windshield but i wanted to keep that piece clean for better usage later im one of those who keeps stickers on the bricks the model you want to see this model from the front as the back is pretty much neglected there isnt much for the pilot to grab a hold on either he is pretty much a sitting duck up there with the screen giving him only partial cover there is a huge wrench next to him which kind of symbolizes the crudeness of the mech the set isnt called cyclone defender for nothing the right arm might hold an ordinary light assault riffle but the other has a spinning disc with samurai swords which you can turn with the yellow knob on the backside those of you who have seen robot wars might remember the incredible power of this melee weapon from a robot named hypnodisc it would have been nice had there been a pullback motor to power the disc im sure lego has a lot of these in stock but the simple mechanism still works reasonably well the riffle comes off and a pin makes it easy to hold with the hand but the disc is fixed to the arm it is also a problem that the swords get misaligned quickly during play the minifig i really like this minifig because of the neat idea with an expression on each side that lego has made a standard for exo force posability most mechmocers show off their creations using gundamlike poses with two joints per leg one being the ankles and one for an arm i thought of some less serious poses crawling silent like a ninja belly gliding kick off upside down final rating i have to disappoint you here this is my first set in this line and i have absolutely no idea of how good it is the last robot i bought was the awesome 6889 spyrius recon robot for the same price but it is in a completely different genre the set had what i expected two white wings and is as such a nononsense set i guess it would be of more use if you have some more exo force which i dont 610 ups has great minifig weapons and is easy to build downs crude design and a bit too expensive for what you get brickshelf gallery	neutral

thank you sinner for bringing the pictures of the hovercraft i think it is a really cool model but the steering wheel doent work too well it doesnt turn easilly all the way around and when the craft turns it doesnt stay stable on the three wheels because the front wheel turns quite alot into the opposite side now to the third model this is quite a basic helicopter with the functionality of having the rotors turning it doesnt use that many of the bricks and doesnt even have a landing gear i have a question to all of you as you can see i prefer to show one or two large pictures and have the rest as clickable thumbnails most people use only the relatively big typically 640x480 pictures so that you dont have to follow links what do you prefer it is no problem for me to do it the other way but i would like to know if you have any preferences	neutral
sinner on sep 21 2007 0919 am said i agree errr sorry if i have annoyed you by posting the pictures looking at your brickshelf folder you had taken photos of the hovercraft as well and i seem to have stepped on your toes i prefer bigger pictures as i get tired of clicking waiting clicking waiting if the pictures are all there all you have to do is click then wait p  you didnt step on my toes because i took the pictures after you posted them p i just wanted to add them for completeness i can see the loading issue when you click a lot of pictures i normally hold ctrl down so that they open in their own tabs but they still have to load any other opinions	neutral

it is no secret that marvel is one of the most successful companies right now from the avengers to the xmen and down to even the most obscure characters like antman every one of their movies has been a big hit until now the latest marvel movie fant4stic was released last month and while i have not seen it yet im sure its just as great as their other movies i mean it has the word fantastic in the title after all and being the smart business that they are the lego company decided to get in on the hype early and capitalize on this movies undoubtful success two years in advance by making a set featuring fant4stics main villain dr doom now thats what i call forward thinking but did they do a good job with it or were they being overhasty lets find out set number 76005 name spiderman daily bugle showdown theme marvel super heroes subtheme ultimate spiderman year of release 2013 pieces 476 minifigs 5 price 4999 usd sh description quote swing into the daily bugle and stop dr doom™ dr doom™ and his henchman beetle™ are attacking the daily bugle in their speedy jet to steal spidermans™ secret identity its up to spiderman™ and nova™ to swing in and stop them trigger the daily bugles explosion functions to cause destruction as the jet fires missiles stop dr doom™ from hitching the jets anchor hook to the safe with spidermans secret inside knock beetle™ off the building with the swinging web attack and drop dr doom™ inside with the rooftop trapdoor then fly nova™ in through the broken window with the dumpster catapult function and send those villains back to where they came from includes spiderman™ nova™ dr doom™ beetle™ and j jonah jameson™ with accessories and weapons the first thing that comes to mind after reading this description is wow thats a lot of tms anyway here are some resource links for this set brickset bricklink rebrickable the box since this set is based on the ultimate spiderman cartoon the box has the usual usm design with the red marvel super heroes background an illustration of spidey in the upper right corner and the usm logo in the lower right as usual there is a minifig line up in the lower left and since this was before the terrible redesign you can see the full body of the minifigs i really miss this type of line up there is quite a lot going on here doctor doom attacking the daily bugle in his jet while simultaneously reaching for j jonah jameson below with his jets claw spiderman reluctantly swings in to save him while nova fights off the beetle its a pretty cool scene even though its not very accurate to the show in beetle mania the episode that this set is based on the beetle was indeed out to kill jjj but it was in order to stop him from exposing his identity not spidermans although spidey was next on jjjs list and while he is a recurring villain on the show doctor doom had nothing to do with this plot and didnt even appear in the episode aside from a brief cameo its awesome that they included him anyway though so im not gonna complain note that the tower is so tall that it wraps around the top of the box there you can also see a scale reference with the spiderman minifig on the back of the box you can see the interior of the bugle and all of its play features which there are quite a few of since this is a playset its all illustrated pretty well although legos choice of sound effects is still a mystery to me i dont get why they dont go for spidermans signature fwip instead of fazzing and i didnt know that a breaking window made the sound btoom but i digress contents inside the box you will find three instruction booklets one smaller than the others a comic book a fairly large sticker sheet five numbered bags and two loose pieces a white string piece and a gray 16x8 plate there arent really any notable pieces and nobody cares about the comic bock no offense to the artist so lets get right to the instructions they are pretty straight forward and easy to follow some of the pages have a ghostly image of spidey nova and dr doom in the top right corner which is fitting since these are all minifigs that appear in this set which is strangely not something that can be said for many other super heroes instructions with this type of artwork minifigures as with most super heroes sets most people will get this set mainly for the minifigs so without further ado lets talk about them spiderman is the same old bootless one you get in almost every usm set not much to say about him some might complain that we dont get spideys alter ego peter parker in this set but in the usm cartoon mj is actually the one who works at the daily bugle not peter curse the creators of this cartoon for ruining our chances of getting a new peter parker minifig by trying to mix things up next we get j jonah jameson he appeared in a spiderman 2 set before but this is a complete redesign he now has a blue suit with a red tie a unique face print and that combedback hair in dark gray this new hairpiece doesnt suit him at all and the old flat top hair was perfect for him in my opinion so i dont know why they changed it the good thing about this change however is the fact that this piece is exclusive to this set in that color nova on the other hand is spoton he comes with a new helmet mold and some nice torso printing however he too is missing his boots tlc should have started making dualcolored legs a long time ago here are some reference images to compare them to okay so jjjs hair may not be completely black in the show but i still think they should have given his minifig a black hairpiece his suit is also not quite the right color he rarely appears in person in the show including the episode this set is based on and is usually seen on screens around new york so this is the best picture of him i could find i guess i should be happy they included a minifig of him at all in the episode it was actually mary jane who was at the bugle during beetles attack so it would have made more sense to include her but we got her in the spidercopter set one year later so thats ok all three of them have back printing in jjjs case im using that term loosely since it is only comprised of two lines but its nice that they went through the trouble of adding them both jjj and nova come with angry alternate faces it almost looks like theyre trying to outangry each other who do you think looks angrier let me know in the comments section below now lets talk about the bad guys even though he would be better off in a fantastic four set its great to finally get victor van doom one of the greatest marvel villains ever and in comics in general he comes with a dark green hood which was new and exclusive in that color at the time and he is the only minifig in this set that has leg printing beetle is a regular minifig with wings the metallic printing on his face and torso is pretty nice but i wish it would have continued onto his legs as well the beetle looks quite accurate to his onscreen counterpart the only thing that could have improved him is a new helmet mold with pointy eyebrowsantennae doctor doom however looks nothing like he does in the movie i just dont understand how lego could have messed him up so badly maybe they were working off of early concept art or something here is a back view of doom and beetle beetle would be a pretty boring minifig if it wasnt for his wings which are awesome with their holographic texture they are so mesmerizing i could look at those things all day this piece also appeared in trans light green in the galaxy squad sets which came out at the same time here they are without their gear as you can see they both have back printing as well and no doctor doom does not come with an alternate facial expression which is fine since you cant see much of his expressions due to his mask anyway heres a look at dr doom and nova without their headgear some say that dooms face looks too cartoony but i think it looks fine nova is wearing stylish goggles as a way of explaining his white eyes its a far better explanation than the batsweatband they did the same thing with the masked wolverine later here are all the figs with their accessories jjj comes with a camera so that he can take more pictures of spiderman beetle comes with one of those overused adu guns which is a very poor representation of his wristmounted blasters i hate to say it but even those bulky new stud shooters would have been a better representation of his weapons spidey comes with his usual string of webbing and nova comes with some iron man style translucent studs the weird thing is that they are red while his powers have a blue glow in the show doctor doom sadly doesnt get any accessories but who needs weapons when you have a jet with a claw and flickfire missiles the build the first bag contains spiderman a brick separator and the parts to build the ground floor of the dbc building after a quick and straightforward build you get this the dumpster and street lamp are separate from the building and since the lamp post is not built onto any baseplate and is quite topheavy it gets knocked over pretty easily maybe its meant to be that way but i would have preferred it if you could stick it onto the baseplate of the building on which there is unfortunately not enough space to do so as you would expect the second bag has the parts for the first floor of the building this is also the bag that contains beetle after another fairly simple build youll find yourself with a two story building with a spiderweb one side and a fire escape on the other however you have to apply three stickers during this section of the build which is never fun can you guess whats in bag number 3 yup the second floor of the building you dont need superpowers to predict that one also this bag contains nova and jameson the build of this section is a bit repetitive since the second floor is mostly the same as the first and it takes slightly longer to build since you have to build the rooftop as well also in addition to the two window stickers you have to apply ten 2x2 tile stickers trying to do this without having any of them being crooked is a real pain in the megablocks the next bag contains doctor doom and the cockpit of his jet dooms cape is in the usual square white box and the string for the claw is folded up in a piece of tape heres what you get at the end of this section looks more like an escape pod than a jet at this point the final bag is the smallest as it only includes the few parts needed to finish the doom jet once you build the wings and tail you stick them onto the cockpit via technic pins and youre done spare parts these are the parts that are left over after the build there is the brick separator of course an extra antenna and the usual little bits and bops whats really awesome though is that they give you an extra pair of beetles wings considering what a neat piece this is and that this is the only set in which it comes in transblack make this a very welcome spare that you can use in your customs the finished set here is the complete set the dbc building looks quite tall especially when you count the antenna comparing it to a screenshot from the episode the general look of the building is there although there are some inaccuracies aside from the fact that it is obviously way downscaled the screens that show jjj ranting about spiderman should have been hexagonal not square and should have wrapped around the building however considering how many stickers you would have had to apply if they would have made it accurate im actually glad they kept the screen mercifully small much like doctor doom himself the doom jet didnt actually appear in the beetle mania episode however it did appear in a later episode titled not a toy in which spiderman plays around with captain americas shield accidentally drops it in doctor dooms latvarian embassy and has to try to retrieve it and yes that episode was as godawful as it sounds heres a screenshot of the jet from that episode like with the dbc they managed to capture the general shape of the vehicle although it doesnt look quite as good as in the show the color scheme is too dark and it looks kind of blockier lets take a closer look at the jet there is no real way to reel the claw in unfortunately however there is a stud on the back of the jet that you can stick it onto needless to say this is not the ideal way of storing it i would have much preferred it if they would have attached it onto winch instead the engines on the wings can be turned even though they dont turn in the show and there is a flickfire missile on each side even if its not much to look at at least its a very swooshable vehicle on top of each wing there is a tile with the emblem of latvaria there was no such emplems on the jet in the cartoon but they are useful pieces that make it clear whose jet it is so im glad they included them there is nothing inside the cockpit except for a seat and unless you want to ruin dr dooms nice dark green cape i wouldnt put him inside of it they could have at least printed a control panel onto that empty 2x2 tile play features since this is a playset lets look at all the play features it has to offer like all playsets the building is open in the back so you can play inside on the ground floor there is a potted plant and nothing else seriously is this all they could come up with for this floor they could have included a security desk a lounge a second plant or anything else as it is its just a boring empty lobby the first floor is a bit more interesting there is a safe a swiveling chair and a pin board with various pictures of spiderman there is one tile that reads the true identity of spiderman which is supposedly what the villains are after i wonder how jameson got this information in the first place speaking of jameson the second floor is devoted to his office where he can sit and yell at his nonpresent employees demanding more pictures of spiderman it also has a swiveling chair as well as a desk with a lamp and a computer there is a technic beam connecting his desk with the ceiling of the first floor which you can remove in order to take off the upper half of the building but its difficult to do so i dont recommend it as you may have noticed in the picture above there are a few red pegs sticking out of the building these are for triggering the play features most of them are on the roof there is one on what looks like an air conditioning unit if you place spiderman holding is webstring on the jumper plate in front of it and push the peg spidey goes bungeejumping off the building wee there is also one that sticks out of the side of the building which when pulled triggers a trap door the third red peg on the roof can be used to pop off the dbc sign why is it called the dbc you ask it stands for daily bugle communications since in this version of spiderman the daily bugle is not only a newspaper but a news tv station as well one that promotes its own highly biased views so basically the fox news of the marvel universe i guess if youre an old school spiderman fan you could just leave off the c and have it just stand for daily bugle the sign above the main entrance wont be so easily modified however there is also a peg between the first and second floor which when pushed pops out one of the windows on the first floor the safe is only attached to a couple of jumper plates and has some jumper plates on top of it as well so you can easily attach the doom jets claw to it and rip it out of the building as seen on the back of the box there are also some snot bricks on the corners of the building that you can attach spiderwebs or spidey himself onto for some wallcrawling and webslinging action this is not so much a play feature as it is just a feature but as i mentioned earlier there is a fire escape on the left side of the building this was a neat idea as it helps it feel like a building in new york city but it is executed very poorly there is no hole big enough for the minifigs to climb down through so they would have to climb down the ladders from the outside which makes no sense no wonder spiderman always needs to rescue people from burning buildings there is one more play feature in the form of the dumpster you can open the lid put a minifig inside and make them jump by hitting a tab in the back remember this is before the introduction of super jumpers but nevertheless its a pretty strange place to launch minifigs out of i guess even super heroes like to do some dumpster diving you dont think this was funny no well me neither but thats the type of humor that this show loves to use sigh anyway lets get on to the ratings ratings design 25  the set looks ok despite many inaccuracies the dbc building and the jet somewhat resemble their onscreen counterparts and dont look too bad but they definitely could be better build 15  a mostly unchallenging and repetitive build with an attrocious amount of stickers minifigs 45  definitely the strongest point of the set some of the figs could be better but four out of five of them are exclusive to this set doctor doom is easily the best and probably the most desirable one  unless the fant4stic movie portraits him so badly that nobody will be interested in him but thats impossible playability 45  as you would expect from a playset the playability is quite high although i still feel like there could have been more parts 35  not many rare parts if youre looking for parts for building your own skyscraper with tan walls and lots of doors and windows though this set is for you price 35  at 476 parts for 50 this set is a bit pricey but it is somewhat justified by all the large window and wall pieces overall 35  this set is mediocre at best playsets are always a good choice for spiderman sets since they give spidey something to swing from but unfortunately they are rarely pulled off well the jet is blocky the building is barebones and the price feels too high the only reason to get this set are the four exclusive minifigs this set was discontinued early this year but if you still see it on clearance somewhere go ahead and get one for the minifigs and parts or buy multiples and use the parts to build a better dbc building i hope you enjoyed this review it is part of the reviewers academys 7th anniversary were not doing a big celebration this year due to other commitments but look out for more reviews with the 7th anniversary banner soon now if youll excuse me i am off to see fant4stic i hope its as fantastic as it promises to be 2 hours later i was wrong i was horribly horribly wrong	positive

i think im the only person in the world who likes fant4stic was it the best superhero movie not even close but i didnt think it deserved the hate it got it was just incredibly and clumsily mishandled anyways great review i might pick this one up if only for the beetle fig	negative
this set seems to appeal more to the non superhero crowd it is one of the only marvel sets i bought mainly because i thought that the building was a nice return to the old style of city sets i would love to see this sort of backdrop for a more realistic agents theme i also liked that most of the figs in this set were easier to merge into other nonsuper uses thanks for the review god bless nathan	neutral

wow that box is big but i somehow thought it would be even bigger still it looks like for once lego are actully using all the space inside and not just a fraction like with other sets cant wait to see more dunamisyou lucky megablok 	neutral
thats awesome man lucky that you got it i want it so badly and it has a huge box too zots	positive
xwingyoda on sep 27 2007 0918 am said many tks dunamis for doing that its really great and i cant wait monitoring your progress on the beast 8 like it was mentionned in another thread the box looks less gigantic than i thought  remember the isd box  that was a huge box  is the instruction book in the pizza box  how big is it  im sure its really big and i hope for our sake that the colours are clearly marked xd if you know what i mean d  yoda interesting question regarding the size of the box vs the isd here ya go also ill be posting more on the size of the manual a little later im going to be building for the next few hours sweet	neutral
tks for that comparison pic dunamis  ok the box is big  i pictured it a tad smaller though  i know what i dont like its the fact that it has the regular lego star wars logo on top with vader ucs sets should have a different iconography like they did in the past sure its a trivial detail but it adds to the fact of owning something special  after all its the most expensive set ever as of now  happy building  and well wait patiently for some cool pics later on p yoda	negative
great review so far i am looking forward to additional posts as for the number of pins  from the peeron inventory for the set there are over 400 technic pins of various lengths insert the my fingers hurt from building emoticon keep the pictures coming	positive
the minifigs as you can see the minifigs are really nice they even throw in an extra fleshie head no doubt these will fetch quite a bit on the bricklink and ebay markets im keeping mine continuing the build this photo shows how well this model is put together notice that they use four of the threehole beams per side to hold this together i remember reading that you can hang this model from the ceiling i dont doubt it these right angle technic pieces are used to reinforce the structure of the model you can see them used here i was shocked at how many light gray plates are in this set i have two tubs full of these the infrastructure is now complete i got hung up for about an hour looking for one of these turns out lego gave me an extra left wedge and shorted me a right wedge so frustrating i had to stead one off my 6211 star destroyer it is not a very common piece by the way	neutral
thanks for the review and tons of pics ive been wanting to pick this one up since i saw it i thought the 4956 creator house was nice but this model town house is in a completely different league i also like the alternate models that you can see in the catalogues	positive

its that time of year again when the days get shorter the nights get colder and children all around the world stare longingly into warmly lit toy shops and prepare their wishlist to send to santa this is also the time when the lego group releases their latest winter village set which has been an annual tradition for the past seven years these sets have been very popular especially among afols and are always highly anticipated however while some entries in this series have been more popular than others none has been as controversial as this years set the winter toy shop which is a rerelease of the first winter village set 10199 winter toy shop from 2009 it seems that many think that this set didnt need to be remade and would have preferred a new set instead or that it is not different enough from the original and will be redundant in a completionists collection does it deserve all the hate lets find out disclaimer i dont own the 2009 version so i cant compare them visually but i will do my best to let you know what is different in this version if you do need a visual reference you can refer to sveltes excellent review of the original set number 10249 name winter toy shop theme creator year of release 2015 pieces 898 minifigs 8 price £5999  7999  6999€ sh description quote welcome to the winter toy shop the holiday season has arrived and the toymaker is busy finishing off his latest creations outside children ski and snowboard and a freshly built snowman sparkles in the light that shines from the toyshop tower help decorate the huge tree that stands at the center of the square play with the curious kitten on the cozy wooden bench or join in with the carolers beneath the ornate streetlamp this charming set also features a ladder trees in various sizes jackinthebox a toy biplane helicopter rocket train race car truck robot tugboat teddy bear and a wrapped gift have fun building this enchanting winter wonderland includes a snowman and 8 minifigures with assorted accessories a male caroler female caroler a woman 2 men 2 boys and a girl sh bricklink brickset the box the box art of this set is similar to that of the original but there are some notable differences the christmas tree is on the right side of the image this time while the park bench is on the left and of course it features this years design for creator boxes with the dark blue stripe along the right side and the expert logo in the top right corner theres also a small picture of the back of the toy shop and the background looks less cartoony than on the original the back is also very similar showing a different angle of the toy shop along with some closeups although this time there is no minifig lineup instead the minifig lineup is on the right side of the box it also includes the accessories that each minifig comes with and some of the toys on the left side of the box there is a thumbnail of the box art and the set name in six different languages they also want to make sure that you know that there are batteries included by saying it in dozens of languages the top of the box features the inventory and a 11 scale reference with the female caroler on the bottom there is a picture that reminds you that there is a light brick included in this set in case that wasnt clear from the front of the box and it confirms that yes it is a bad idea to put it in water in case you were planning to go swimming with your winter toy shop the contents inside the box there are two instruction booklets and two groups of bags one for each instruction booklet while two groups of bags is not as many as there usually are in other sets of this size its still better than the first version of this set where the bags werent numbered at all so this makes the build a bit easier the large bag in group 1 and the two large bags in group 2 have a white stripe going down the middle of the bag and only have one group number printed on it along with some other number and some kind of scan code i have no idea why they made this distinction for these bags or what that code is for so if any of you know the purpose of this please let me know in the comments below here is a random instructions page as you can see the building steps can get quite challenging as they sometimes include many different pieces in one step especially when it uses a lot of brown pieces which are very dark and hard to see in the instructions living up to the sets status as an expertlevel set most of the time though the instructions are pretty clear and easy enough to follow there are some parts in new colors in this set that werent in the first version or any other set until now such as that large flat technic arch in dark green the jester hat in orange and blue one of those new 2z2 round jumper tiles in brown a golden frog and a snowboard in dark blue there are also some rare friends parts that make their creator debut here such as the skis in azure and that new clear 1x1 round tile with a tiny tube coming out of it which is usually used as a stand for friends accessories and is a very useful piece especially for snot techniques and no im not talking about the type of snot that many people usually have stuck in their nose around this time of year there are some printed parts as well such as the clock tile the letter tile and the register slope like in the first version of the set we also get a new face print for the white cat which is more in line with other modern cat designs but the best part is the shop sign which is printed this time around it features a lovely wood pattern the words toy shop and a toy soldier on both sides of the sign which is ironic since the shop doesnt seem to sell any toy soldiers like this but it looks so good on the sign that i wont sue them for false advertising the minifigs lets start with the most unique figures in this set the carolers these two were also the highlight in the first version of the set but in the original they both had the same head this one   which featured a very questionable facial expression that could easily be taken out of context in this version they have unique faces which look much better and help distinguish their gender the male caroler uses lord vampyres torso which looks quite snazzy on him maybe this is lord vampyre before he became a vampire the female caroler is easily the best minifig in the set though because in addition to her exclusive head she also gets an exclusive torso and skirt print a huge improvement over the generic unprinted one in the original she also gets the queen hair in dark brown and aragorns lined cape instead of two combined regular capes this set truly is the return of the queen the snowman is technically not a minifig but as you can see here he is exactly as tall as one and he is the first thing you build after the minifigs so i included him here he has mostly the same design as before except this time he has robot claws for arms instead of levers which is good since they allow him to hold accessories such as his broom his carrot nose is included separately again the carolers both have back printing while the snowman looks no different from the back than he does from the front here you can see the black side of the females cape this lined cape is so much nicer than the solution they used in the original next up we have what i assume is a married couple who are likely the parents of at least one of the kids as well as the toymaker who i will call geppetto the man in the pinstripe suit was not included in the first version of the set so hes a bonus minifig these guys are fairly generic but they have some detailed torso prints so they look pretty nice geppetto seems to have gotten younger since the release of the original set since his gray hair has now turned dark tan and he doesnt seem to need glasses anymore the men both have back printing but the woman is the only one in this set who doesnt get a back print why you gotta be so discriminating against women lego last but not least there are the kids one of the boys wears dark blue pants a green jacket and a wool cap he looks a bit like a lumberjack so lets call him lumberjack boy or jack for short the little girl wears an outfit that wouldnt look out of place in the friends theme with a lavender scarf and pants ill call her lavender the second boy is wearing an octan jacket and a sports helmet which makes it ironic that he is the one not doing any winter sports on the box art ill call him president business junior or pbj for short all of the kids have fairly detailed back printing which makes up for the fact that much like the adults they are made out of mostly common parts pbjs helmet and scarf cover up the back of his head nicely which is important as you will see in the next picture whats also great about these figs is that half of them have a doublesided head here you can see pbj doing his best macaulay culkin impression i also removed his scarf so you can see the printing on his torso better but hes not the only one who seems to be easily scared the mother also has a very alarmed expression maybe she got surprised by the jackinthebox or maybe she just realized how expensive toys are nowadays you can see the female carolers back printing here her alternate expression is a nonsinging face which is very nice to have and i wish the male caroler could have one too she looks quite cute with those rosy cheeks but the most adorable out of all of them has to be the little girl she comes with a pouting sad face that will melt your heart please dont cry ill buy you any toy you want just stop looking at me like that the build the first half of the build is dedicated to the surroundings of the toy shop it includes the christmas tree the park bench the snowman the toys the carolers jack and lavender the large bag contains two smaller bags with small pieces a white box that contains the carolers cape and the jester hat in its own little bag the first thing you build after the minifigs and the snowman is the toys this version of the set has a lot more toys than the original which is good because i always felt that the first toy shop was a bit light on toys also the ones that were in the original have been updated for example instead of the two pairs of skis you now get one pair of skis that use the new ski mold and a snowboard the jackinthebox is mostly the same except it now has an orange and blue color scheme instead of the red and blue from the original this change was probably not necessary but hey at least we get a new jester hat out of it and instead of the brickbuilt teddy bear you get the new teddy bear mold i have mixed feelings about this change because i actually kinda liked the brickbuilt teddy design and using a specialized mold seems to be going against the spirit of creator sets but on the other hand i cant deny that the molded teddy looks better than the blocky old one meh the new toys include a tugboat which has some rounded technic pieces as its hull a biplane a rocket a helicopter and a truck that cleverly uses roller skates for its wheels these are all quite brilliant designs that feel like micro versions of lego city sets and make a great addition to the set here is a back view of some of the more complex models as you can see the friends accessory stand has been cleverly used to hold the biplanes fin in place and to provide a stand for the helicopter the jackinthebox has a hinged lid the only thing that bugs me a bit is the tpiece on top of the helicopter that holds the rotor in place but i cant think of any better way they could have done it next is the ladder that is used to decorate the tree which is exactly the same as the first version the supports are on a clickhinge so they can be adjusted or folded away then you build the tree itself you begins of course with the stand which is mostly the same design as before but this time the plates at the bottom are brown instead of white and have golden studs as feet next you build the first layer of branches the main difference in this version of the tree is that this one actually has a brown stem rather than just a technic axle on which you stack the layers of branches one by one you wont be able to see the stem in the final result but i like this change as it makes the tree more realistic then you add the second layer of branches this one doesnt have lightscandles and attaches to the lower layer at an angle using the four transyellow studs close to the stem the third layer is added this one has lights again each layer is similar in that they are all made out of green plates that are built around a 4x4 ring plate but they get smaller each time and are constructed differently enough for the build not to feel repetitive with the addition of the fourth layer we get close to finishing the tree lastly you add one more layer and the tip of the tree now its time to decorate the tree however its not as fun as it sounds since that requires you to add lights to the two chainsropes first which can get a bit repetitive the clips holding the lights to the chain were white but this time theyre pearl gold which looks much nicer in my opinion the next part of the build is the park bench with the streetlamp and the little tree this is a fairly quick build with not much to it the fishbowl helmet parts are a useful piece that you dont see too often so its nice to get them again in this remake the design is pretty much the same as in the original set except for the wreaths on the streetlamp which use a green life preserver instead of a round 2x2 plate this is another instance where they use a specialized piece instead of a brickbuilt solution but im okay with that because unlike with the teddy bear this part was not originally intended to be a wreath so its still nice part usage the second half of the build is dedicated to the toy shop itself and includes the couple geppetto and pbj please note that there is a fourth 6x10 plate burried under the parts you begin by tiling the floor setting up the walls and adding the interior items such as the fireplace the cash register and the toy displays next you add the walls windows and the door and the ground floor of the shop is finished so far the build is the same as the old toy shop except this time they decided to have the white stripes on the marquees be the longer ones instead of the dark red ones for some reason i dont know why they did this and kinda would have preverred to get dark red 1x1 plates instead of white but it doesnt detract from the look of the shop so i dont really care now we begin with the upper floor this is where things start to look a little different can you tell the difference the difference is that this time they attach the roof using cliphinges instead of bulky technic constructions which gives you more space on this floor and allows it to look more like an actual attic they even tile the floor next to the frog clock aftter adding the roof the build is finished the main roof feels a bit loose since its only attached to the building by one side im not sure if this was an issue in the old toy shop but its not a big deal i just wouldnt pick the set up by the roof what i do like is that they used double cheese slopes on the awning on the outer wall of the tower instead of singles which makes it a bit easier to build i like how the supports under the tower roof now match those of the main roof the wreaths have also been updated like the ones on the streetlamp and those technic arches under the roof look a lot more like garlands now on the original they were dark gray so i didnt even know they were supposed to be garlands and assumed they were part of the architecture the shop sign looks a lot better now that it is printed the old one just looked like a white flag i also like how the small plates under the marquee give it a wavy look and they included two trees in different sizes on the right side of the shop the back is nice and open and allows you to see the rest of the toys the robot train and race car all of which have just as much of a simple and clever design as the other toys the clock looks much nicer with the new golden frog because golden frogs make everything better spare parts there are quite a few small parts left over including a roller skate and one of those friends accessory stands which will come in handy the complete set here you can see the full set together it looks quite nice and festive with all the little details and there are many scenes that you can play out with it you can have the minifigs decorate the tree have the kids play in the snow have the carolers sing by the bench have the toymaker build some toys in his workshop or have the parents buy presents for their kids its a festive toyfilled winter wonderland the fireplace looks cozy and i like the brick pattern going up the chimney the entrance of the shop looks a bit empty aside from the cash register i feel like they could have displayed some more toys here but oh well being a set targeted at teens and adults there arent really any play features aside from the light brick which is attached to a hinge so you can either activate it by pressing the button with your finger or tilting the brick upward so that the button is pressed against the roof however since the roof is not connected in the middle and only attached on the sides it tends to split open a bit when you do that so im not sure if attaching the roof this way here was such a good idea nevertheless it looks quite nice when the light is lit ratings design 55  this set is as gorgeous as it was back in 2009 the small updates that they made are mostly good ones although the absence of a brickbuilt teddy is a bit disappointing and the new way the roof is attached while not as bulky as before makes the roof slightly unstable but those are just nitpicks build 55  there are some interesting building techniques here such as those on the tree the roof and the toys the fact that the parts are only split into two groups and the part callouts can get fairly complex makes it a challenging enjoyable build minifigs 55  they did a great job updating the figs in this set while only 3 of the torsos in the original had any printing all of the torsos have printing front and back in this set even the skirt and cape of the female caroler you get two exclusive heads and half of the heads are doublesided plus you get 8 instead of 7 minifigs you really cant ask for more in a creator set playability 45  this set is more meant to be displayed than to be played with but there are plenty of things to play with if you want all the different minifigs accessories and set pieces make for endless possibilities for play its especially fun to swoosh the micro vehicles around parts 35  there are lots of good parts here most of them are fairly common but there are some rare parts and some even in exclusive colors price 45  this set costs 20 more than the original but considering that this set has nearly 900 pieces including some rare and exclusive ones as well as more minifigs with much better printing i think 80 is still a fair price overall 55  so whats my opinion of this set for a remake i think its great they managed to make a good set even better are the changes minor yes are they an improvement mostly yes were they necessary perhaps not but its good that they made them instead of just rereleasing the exact same set so if you didnt get the first winter toy shop i can highly recommend getting this one if you do already have the old version this one might still be worth picking up for the hugely improved minifigs and rare parts alone as for the controversy over rereleasing the winter toy shop i can see where the haters are coming from but i find their complaints to be quite petty i can understand if youre disappointed because you already have the first winter toy shop and were looking forward to a new set this year but theres always next year if youre a completist and feel like tlg is forcing you to buy a set you dont need youre wrong nobody is forcing you to buy anything but yourself if you decide to buy every set in a theme no matter what it is thats your problem not legos so put down your torches and pitchforks and just be glad that they improved the set design and gave us another chance to buy this classic set there are far worse things that can happen in this world than lego rereleasing one of their most popular sets sorry for that little rant so what is your opinion on rereleases like this please cast your vote in the poll above i hope you enjoyed this special eurobricks reviewers academy review and would like to thank the lego group for the opportunity to review this set happy holidays everyone battoys by okay yaramanoglu on flickr	positive
thanks for a great review first of all i do like the upgrades and changes made from the original 2009 set more colours and parts are offcourse available today than back in 2009 it does look like a great set and i would really realy have loved to get it myself if i had the funds however their are so many other sets thats first priority for me this december and next year so sadly i might have to pass on this if its not that i can get it redicioulusly cheap at some point and yeah we should appreciate that lego does keep sets coming even if its just upgrades from earlier releases town is known for a new police and fire station every year cant see why a new toyshop is so upsetting once again thanks for a great review and happy holidays to you as well	positive
great review you almost make me want to buy one i dont know what it is with these sets on the one hand they are so nicely designed and cute on the other side i never seriously consider buying one i cant explain what it is that holds me back	positive
great review i just built the original and this one has clear advantages over the original though i wish lego would stop putting torsos with defined breasts and curves on children i really like pretty much every change i wont be getting it and id be lying if i said im not a little disappointed for the first four years my motherinlaw got me the new winter village set for christmas after the last two which didnt really fit thematically in my display i had hoped for a new oneparticularly since my daughter is getting to be around the age where she can play with them i mention her specifically because ive seen lots of people dismiss those who are a bit disappointed as rabid adults who dont care about kids getting cool sets and i dont think thats fair i may have to see how much some of the parts go for on bricklink the rerelease is better than the original but not good enough that id want to spend 80 to get a set thats nearly identical to one i have edited by tea weevil 29 november 2015  0431 pm	neutral
i missed out on the first one but i love the improvements made in this version like the tree having an actual brown trunk so it looks less like an artificial one and the carolers as well i may pick this up but im sorry to those of you who already have one	positive
cheers for putting up the review some nice improvements but not enough for me to pick it up the original set is good enough for me pity the poll has no option yes but only in addition to new sets not in stead of new sets edited by withacee 01 december 2015  0938 am	neutral
thanks for the review they definitely improved upon the original but since i already own the original i cant justify this set also unfortunately it seems to be the trend but im sure there are a lot of first timers out there too that will snatch this up since it is a really lovely building and the updates make it better for sure	neutral
thanks oky for this fine review i agreed with your sentiments on the unnecessary rants i also owned the 2009 version and even though there are minor improvements there must be a logical reason for its release again but is not entirely the same i felt is an excellent opportunity for others to acquire this design especially after six years ago as for myself i will probably buy this if my spare funds allow me to own this set	neutral
thanks for the kind comments everyone i like hearing your opinions on this set withacee on 01 december 2015  0937 am said pity the poll has no option yes but only in addition to new sets not in stead of new sets i dont think that would be a realistic option as that would mean that they would have to spend twice the resources on this theme which i dont think they are ready to do but if more people would like this option i can add it to the poll joebot on 01 december 2015  0833 pm said after mocking people for holding a particular opinion you then turn around and ask people to express their opinion no thanks i guess ill keep my opinions to myself i certainly dont want to be labeled a hater im not mocking anyone i just think that some people need to calm down a bit and that tlg is getting more hate than they deserve for this set but thats just my opinion and youre welcome to disagree with it everyone is entitled to their own opinion including you and me and yes i would love to hear your thoughts on this matter because i would like to have a friendly discussion on this subject	neutral
oky on 02 december 2015  1249 am said im not mocking anyone i just think that some people need to calm down a bit and that tlg is getting more hate than they deserve for this set but thats just my opinion and youre welcome to disagree with it everyone is entitled to their own opinion including you and me and yes i would love to hear your thoughts on this matter because i would like to have a friendly discussion on this subject thats cool and i appreciate that but i would recommend avoiding the use of the word hater then thats a perjorative term thats loaded with negative connotation as im sure youre well aware its the flipside to me calling you a mindless fanboy or a corporate shill those arent terms that invite friendly discussion they shut down discussion by belitting the other persons opinion and implying that they lack the maturity or intelligence to think critically i dont actually care all that much about this set you just hit on a pet peeve of mine is all and its one that i see spreading throughout eurobricks which is a shame the use of terms like hater whiner or fanboy are becoming much too prevalent around here	neutral
thanks for the nice review the landing mechanism looks quite cute arent the yellow axles 5l not 4l very strange that they would release such a part	positive
it says 5l in the parts list	neutral
hi there nice model great review i almost reverse engineered this model but used wrong parts for landing wheels didnt know how to fix the nose proper and so on so i was very interested in this model and i like playing with it i love the reviews but i think i have to mention that the yellow axle must be a 5l the picture shows a 5l and a 5l would fit the size of the model the cart has also a 5l in yellow what sitze is the yellow axle in this seit really 4l as written in the text greetings robert	positive

i am definitely getting set for the panels	positive
set is only interesting for the panels thats all it is to me	neutral
i just built the a model and i rather like it it is much bigger than it looks from the box  about 30 studs long there is only one function  the landing gear  but it works very nicely apart from that its a very solid build and achieves an elegant shape with an absolute minimum of parts i dont usually get excited about small sets but this one appeals to me i like the feeling that every single piece has a purpose	positive
boulderer on 27 december 2015  0544 pm said my favourite of the 2016 sets ive built so far id go so far as to say this is the best budget set in years i would have loved this when i was a kid  great swoosh ability  good to hear that im gonna check the toy shops in my lunch break tomorrow see if they got their shipment in yet if they have ill definitely buy one of these little sets	positive
thats a cool little mod two small nigles though 1 your navigation lights are flipped on the main wings 2 the panels on the tail i think were supposed to be the intakes for the jet engine by using them to close up the tail youve turned it into a glider cant wait untill i find one of these on shelves	positive
theitalianbrick on 01 december 2015  0932 am said jim great reviews but can i suggest you one thing take some pics before you apply the stickersand some with the stickers on it helps to have a comparison you are right i came to the same conclusion when writing the review i tell you it doesnt look that good without stickers but i dont have a picture to prove it to be honest i compared it to the model posted in the 2016 topic a few days ago i applied the stickers before building the model so i wasnt able to make a proper comparison i will keep it in mind for future reviews thanks for the suggestion	neutral

cool mod by effe but the original model out of the box is one of the poorest models tlg ever released looks from front to rear as a cheaped out set with really lazy design effort a shame for the responsible lego designer parts assortment seems to be ok but this should not be the most important criteria sry jim i really appreciate your always very well done reviews and offen i agree with the overall judgementsverdicts and of course tastes are different but especially that review sounds like gushing praise in my ears just my 2 ct edit ooops just saw the review isnt done by jimblush so sry jim now my final comment belongs to mostlytechnic edited by kumbbl 27 december 2015  0733 am	negative

majklspajkl on 05 december 2015  1145 pm said my opinion on the frictionless axlepins is that the flex axle might be easier to stick in them than in regularblue axlepins didnt actually try it though  frictionless pins have accurate round hole while blue friction pins have something squarish flex axle will fit in both but using tan pins doesnt require strength conncetion with tan pins is weaker too	neutral
great review im a bit undecided on the set though it has some nice parts 4 cil engine in such a small set and it looks good but also a bit small and simple not sure if it stands up to the standards of the small tracked loader or similar for sets of this size and as a parts pack for panelsflaxles the display team jet is infinitely better ill probably pick one up but right now i really want another tracked loader last one was sacrificed to the mod gods	neutral

review  42038  arctic truck introduction arctic vehicles arent new to lego back in 2000 the town theme already had several small orange arctic vehicles in 2014 tlg again released a number of arctic sets in the city theme formerly known as town some of these sets are actually pretty big containing over 700 parts looking back in history it seems that arctic sets may have found their origin in the technic theme although these sets were white instead of orange they are unmistakenly arctic the 1986 technic arctic sets contained the infamous technic figures unfortunately the 2015 arctic truck doesnt contain any technic figures but nonetheless its great to see a new arctic vehicle in the technic line not counting several snow scooters lets see if the new arctic truck lives up to the expectations note all images can be clicked for hires versions set information number 42038 title arctic truck theme technic released 2015 part count 1219 box weight 2110 gr box dimensions 478 cm x 280 cm x 72 cm set price msrp € 7999  us 8499  £ 5999 price per part € 0088  us 0093  £ 0066 links brickset bricklink the box the box measures 478 cm x 280 cm x 72 cm and weighs around 1385 grams the box actually feels pretty heavy which means its filled properly this seems to be a trend in the technic theme slightly smaller boxes can save shelf space for retailers the front the front of the box shows the main model and in the lower right corner theres a image with the dimension of the model its 40cm long and 18cm wide the back the upper part of the back of the box shows the functions of the main model the lower left section shows the bmodel which looks very promising more on that later the lower right section shows the motorization options for the main model the crane partially and the bed can be motorized besides motorization some leds can be added as headlights the side on of the sides shows one of the newer smaller style panels this is the first time it appears in orange when you take a look at the sticker you can see that its not symmetrical not sure why tlg cut of one of the sides of the stickers since the position of the panel is very suitable for a continuous sticker content of the box the box is pretty densely packed which is better than semifilled boxes it feels like you actually bought something which matches the box size the box contains 2 booklets 1 sticker sheet 8 bags booklets  sticker sheet unfortunately the instructions and sticker sheet havent been packed with cardboard protection which results in a curved sticker sheet and slightly bent instructions in my case this wasnt so bad at least no real damage highlighted parts this set proves to be a great parts pack especially when you might have missed some of the 2014 sets black link treads usually the link treads come in dark blue grey but this sets includes 96 black treads which is great if youd like to replace the dbg ones in your mocs or other official sets undercarriage and suspension several parts are included to build the undercarriage driving the treads four large tread sprockets and eight small tread sprockets which are used as return sprockets also included are four steering portal hubs and four steering portal axles for driving and steering the vehicle several frames including two cshaped pivot frames and two steering ball joints to create an undercarriage much like the 4x4 crawler the set even includes two hshaped frames aka dog bone frames new changeover catch parts this year 2015 three new parts have been introduced to improve the changeover catch more on these parts later new pin connector another new part for this year 2015 is the 1l round pin connector which looks like a pin connector but acts more like a bush new pins furthermore this sets includes quite a large number of three relatively new parts 17 x pin with pin hole 14 x 3l pin with 1l axle and 11 x 3l pin with 2l axle which have been introduced this year 2015 when the new 3l pin with 1l axle was introduced in 2014 it was only a matter of time before the new 3l pin with 2l axle would appear both new pins are a great addition to the parts portfolio panels last but not least this sets contains a fair number of orange panels including the 3x11 panel in orange which is the first time weve seen this part part list below is the entire part list for the 913 parts as usual this part list can be found at the end of the second booklet the build the build immediately starts with some of the new parts used to build the compact gearbox in the center of the model notice the two 20 tooth bevel gears one would have been enough to drive the 12 tooth bevel gear so the second seems to be useless tlg probably used it in the amodel because they needed it in the bmodel which you can see later the front and rear suspension are almost identical the front side also has the 13l gear rack used for steering the picture below shows the steering rack on the front suspension in more detail at this point you have more or less finished the chassis the gearbox is in place and the majority of the functions has internally been connected to the right gears the small turntable shows where the crane will be attached later on at the end of the first booklet some of the bodywork has been attached to the chassis the orangeblack color scheme never fails to please me throw in some cool stickers for the extra effect and we have a winner if you decide to motorize the model using pf the top of the cabin can be lifted to accomodate the battery box the chassis uses lots of orange and some black panels to give the model its distinctive look the protective black bumberrailing is a nice addition which adds something to the exterior the dumping bed at the rear can tilt to empty its load its operated by a mini la the treads which look very cool in black are driven by a large tread sprocket and returned by two small tread sprockets the front and rear sections are identical building the undercarriages feels a bit repetitive which is a problem for most tracked vehicles finished model adding the crane to the model finishes the build your model should look something like this when you take a close look at the finished model you realize this is something else its trully a unique vehicle the color scheme is brilliant and the fact that its an arctic truck is really neat its a welcome change for the technic line to see a vehicle like this this picture emphasizes thats its a very cool vehicle imagine this beast plowing through the snow as far as i know its not based on a real life vehicle ifs probably a combination of several vehicles and some imagination i can be totally wrong though the rear of the vehicle shows the crane and drum placed on the tipper bed from this angle you can see some of the internals of the model the gearbox behind the cabin for example the crane can be partially motorized rotation and base while the boom is operated manually what i like a lot is the protective railing around the vehicle left over parts some leftover parts nothing noteworthy features and functions this set has several functionsfeatures steering driving suspension crane tipping bed steering as you can see in the image below the steering mechanism has quite a bit of negative caster please correct me if im wrong which causes the treads to rotate a bit upwarddownward instead of only to the left and right driving you mention driving as a feature yes i do and let me explain why normally i would ommit this as a feature and take driving for granted however driving this vehicle on a flat surface causes it to simply slide over the surface for other arctic vehicles this would be a plus but with a tracked vehicle it limits playability this is one of the main drawbacks of these tread they simple dont work properly on smooth surfaces suspension the suspension is working properly you do need to apply some pressure but all things considered its not too bad crane the crane has four degrees of freedom base rotation lower boom upper boom hook it does what its supposed to do base rotation and lower boom can be motorized and switched using the gearbox while the upper boom and hook are operated manually tipping bed the tipping is operated via a mini la conclusion while the set does offer various functions and features driving and steering is a serious issue therefor this set is more likely to be showcased than to be played with bmodel instructions for the bmodel are of high quality looking at the image below you will see what i mean heres the finished bmodel a tracked jeep with a communcations device this alternate model looks so good it could easily have made it as a main model one thing that does pop in mind how would this look with tires more on that later when you are in the artcic region its imperative to have proper communication channels since theres no internet backbone you will need a big antenna of some sort this bmodel actually features a small trailer wagon with a transmitterreceiver heres more detailed image of the bmodel without trailer wagon i would buy this model in a heartbeat if it were a main model simply gorgeous the side view doesnt give away that this in alternate model the stickers also work really well in this model and again nothing to complain here the model even has a small crane at the rear operated by the mini la here you can see the arctic fleet comprised of both the amodel and bmodel i bet these two can get some work done a bit of a messy picture but this should give you an impression of the size of both models leftover parts not too many parts left which is obviously a good thing alternate model with tumbler tires just like me you probably have been wondering how this model would look like with tumbler tires well here it is as i imagined it does look great admittedly these are not the type of tires we ought to use but to be honest i dont really care again the negative caster results in quirky steering the tires are a bit too big so they hit the chassis when you compress the suspension while this has absolutely nothing to do with an arctic vehicle i really love this picture summary were almost at the end of my review so what do i think of this set lets start with getting the elephant out of the room this set lacks proper driving and steering does that make it a bad set definitely not its a great set but it lacks some playability when it comes to moving the vehicle the crane and tipper bed do work properly so theres still some playability left does this set look cool definitely i think its one of the coolest no pun intended and most original models of recent years the orange and black color scheme works great and the stickers are well designed the bmodel is of very high quality and some might even prefer it over the amodel and if you are not interested in either of these models this set provides you with a variety of great parts all in all i think this is a great set maybe not to play with but it scores high on all other criteria pros original model great color scheme lots of interesting parts great bmodel cons steering and driving dont work too well repetitive build of undercarriages minor con score below are my scores based on different categories 8 design original and good looking model 7 building experience fun to build albeit a bit repetitive 8 features packs quite a few features 7 playability some features work some dont 9 parts comes with interesting parts 9 value for money two great model in a single set 8 cool as a bonus heres picture of the main model with tumbler tires why because we can	positive
very timely review jim my wife has just surprised me by giving me this set a few days ago and i have just built the a model two days ago and b model yesterday i agree with all that you wrote above i dont have tumbler tires but i have 9398 tires driving is smooth but steering  suspension will be bad as you said due to negative caster and tires hitting the chassis anyway tonight i will destroy the b model and rebuilt this httpwwwbusterhau8cmodelhtml	positive

here is the reviewfor broadsides brig 6259 a set from 1991 with a handsome count of 64 pieces 3 figures and a sale price of 875 the buildingand parrot well start off with the front it looks like a good solid building to hold those scurvy dogs we yonder over to the left side and see a nice open back and yonder to the plain right side back to the left we find the corner with a nice area to rest your tired soldiers we see the platform in the corner a lovely place for soldiers to stand on its a bitskimpy so watch your step the middle is blocked by some stones assuring security but still open enough to stand in the jail is cramped and fits only two people but we only need one prisoner in this set   moving up is the watch tower a place for your soldier stand and stand watch or for silly parots to sit on heres the front middle part again those stones blocking the way figures and accesories we have a delightful number of a soldier a sailor and a scurvy pirate a lovely parot and a generous assortment of weapons that concludes our review overall its a fantastic little set and great for army and supplies and bricks gathering i cant find any faults with this set its just the neatest little thing youve seen in a port wub highly recomended y  and to end our review a comic	positive
a fine little set with 64 pieces and 3 figures for under 10 may have seemed a bit steep in 1991 but i wouldnt know id passed into my dark ages already so alas i havent a copy of this set looking at the parts list i could build one out of my current inventory though issued today for 10 id buy no less than 14 of them even though it does lack the obligatory rowboat for the pirate to make his escape in very nice review and comic thanks for doing them y edited by imperialshadows 20 october 2007  0610 am	positive

thanks for that very good review mr mandalorian y i think that this is a plain beautiful set oh how i wish that tlc wouldve taken that direction from the beginning  the design is much more practicable with fewer nonsystem parts and technic beams with studs this makes everything much more easier to mod and a lot more useful at least imo y so its for sure not very hard to make the wonderful enclosed cockpit one brick higher and even that little alien ship looks decent and nice xo and the fighter looks sleek and elegant too in both modes thats just very cool compliments tlc now all we needre aliens with moving arms and here we go classic space on forever xd	positive

picked up from the lego shop in bluewater yesterday front of box back of box price 250 gbp contents a very small instruction manual instructions front intsructions back 25 pieces 23 used in the model regular construction mini fig start of the assembly roll in the drum just attach the drum a little tap with the hammer hammer not included wheel it into position time to start mixing also time for a well earned tea break the cement is all ready now and the 2 left over bits extra cement is always useful and not really wasted overall a nice little set and i am pleased to see little sets appearing again at long last the only negative is with the drum of the mixer although the angle can be adjusted you cannot tip the contents out of the mixer all in all i would say 810 for a good little set comments   edit by hobbes replaced pictures with clickable thumbs and corrected set number	neutral
great review and nice touch putting the minifig in the mixer y and i think you are the first to review this set so all in all good work steel	positive

omg i absolutely love how you reviewed this set i think you are the only person ive ever seen on eurobrick with such a thorough review i read eurobricks daily and this really raises the bar in terms of how a person does a review please do not resize your pics they are perfect crisp large thorough and clear it gives anyone who really wants info on the set just about everything they need to know about it i had no idea they used that lil thing to have the cement mixer spin cool idea   nice set but perfect perfect review thanks much xd	positive
thanks for this review lots of minifigs is a plus although half of them are junk jellies but dang the base just doesnt seem impressive it looks so cheap like a skeleton the tubes are just ridiculous but hey at least it comes with two cool spacecraft thats nice	positive
i agree it does seem very scarce but ive taken apart the nerf launcher made a new module with the tube the launcher used and beefed up the base with some computers and other things for 90 dollars i would pass i agree on sale it is lovely though and none the less ive been entertained for ages with them flyin through the tubes d	neutral
should be heres the completed base and my knee in cordoroys sp great review	positive
thanks for the photos and review brickmaster im hoping to find this on sale as well no luck so far i love the white ship and i think the base would be amusing but ultimately hard to reuse incidentally that long axel is common in recent technic sets but i think it was orignally made for the hockey sets d	positive

so here it is the long expected  review of the town plan i bought it at the legostore riem arcaden last saturday i paid 14999 eur for 1981 pieces this set is separated in 4 parts 1 the servicegasstation 2 the cars the petrol pump and the fountain 3 the cinema 4 the town hall the service station has a lot of really nice details like tools for the car repair or the table with the cashpoint and the foodstation theres a croissant a banana and a apple in this set one of my favourit parts is the trolley with some tools you can see it at brickshelf at the second part are only a few pieces and i needed not much time to built the 2 cars the fountain and the petrol pump theres something at the truck i dont understand maybe i did something wrong but the truck has no backlights wacko i like the petrol pump thats why i post a pic of it the cinema is the highlight for me it has also really nice details like the popcorn table or the gumball or candy machine the colours sheme is really nice the front of the building with the big displays is a cool idea overall a really nice building the town hall has also a really nice colour sheme i love that dark green mixed with the white stairs a lot of plants around and in the town hall as you can see some figs who married there not more to say about this building see the pics and enjoy it overall this set is a must have it was really fun to built it this set reminds me of the back to the future movie with michael j fox the whole gallery is at brickshelf there you can find a few more pics i hope you enjoyed this review regards sandra	positive

sorry for answering so late but i was very busy thanks guys for your comments y tedbeard on dec 28 2007 0808 pm said sorry to disagree with anyone however but this was not a great review i appreciate the effort sandra made but a great review would include more details such as what are stickers and what are printed pieces a great review points out flaws or limitations as well as what works or is really neat a great review would have analyzed the price per piece and compared that to other setsthemes one might look at the recent reviews of the indy sets or the new spongebob sets as examples of really good reviews the pictures are good but a great review above all should provide the reader with some new information perhaps even answer questions posed in the prerelease discussion thread i learned nothing new about the set from this review that said it was a good review for someone who had not seen the prerelease discussion and she did a good job of showing said person what they could expect in the set its good that you told me your opinion about my review it was my third review i made and i have to say that i made this review not for analyses just only to show the eb members some nice pics and to tell them my opinion lego is fun for me i dont like to analyse the pieces bricks prices colours i just want to build something thats why im at eurobricks and not at an other big legocommunity in germany lego is fun fun fun and everybody knows that lego is a expensive hobbie so why should i write it again and again julencin2000 on dec 29 2007 1007 pm said very good review thanks sticker sheet pic with 1 megapixel film posters thanks for the link julencin  xwingyoda on dec 29 2007 1025 pm said ps  tedbeard  do tone it down youg man  if youre not happy with sandras work do provide one yourself instead of bitching on how you view a review and on how sandras post is veryt far from one according to you  yoda thanks yoda sweet copmike on dec 30 2007 0130 pm said thanks for the review legocastlegirl  excellent work y i agree with you the best part seems to be the movietheater thats perfect because i just love to watch movies in the theater so far this year ive seen 46 pictures and had some popcorn to  this is a mustgetset town on copmike thanks copmike  so it will be a good year 2008 for you therell be a lot of good movies at cinema next year i cant wait for national treasure book of secrets the second movie after national treasure with nicolas cage	positive

xwingyoda on dec 29 2007 0125 pm said ps  tedbeard  do tone it down youg man  if youre not happy with sandras work do provide one yourself instead of bitching on how you view a review and on how sandras post is veryt far from one according to you  wow i have not been called a youg man by which i assume you mean young for a while as a forty year old with three kids thats unusual sweet i tried very hard to remain positive in my critique and complimented her on those things she had done well i felt that given the somewhat juvenile omg bestreviewever tone that was creeping in amongst the replys that it needed to be tempered with some thoughtful suggestions as to how a good review could be made great your ad hominem approach is offensive and far more negative than i was and to suggest i should do my own review is ridiculous i live in canada and we do not even have the set available here yet thus i am interested in seeing reviews of this set if i already had the set i would not be so interested and next time you propose to critique a critique perhaps you should actually read what i wrote i said she wrote a good review for a specific audience i did not say it was awful or whatever you seem to have assumed i meant saying something is good but could be improved can hardly be characterized as bitching 	positive
happy new year everyone i went to my local walmart looking for an exclusive bionicle set yesterday but was amazed to find everything there sw bionicle ef indie the works i nabbed the jsf and the rogue shadow and scampered home to take pics with my new camera wub the box the same as the other 07 boxes nothing new the back shows the various features with pop out r2  luckily the intruction booklet and the dss were intact not folded like the last mm set i got  the dss not too bad but printed parts would have been great the figs anakin is amazing imo wub fits the cw anie great i noticed on the sh reviews the kiddies were saying how ugly he looked  they need to see the cw cartoon for the sake of my health i should probably stop reading those d the build i wont go too indepth on the build since vader posted a very indepth review here the start of the build the body of the fighter starts out long and skinny the jsfs landing gear allows it to sit comfortably without getting in the way while swooshing r2d2s launching device r2 in position when launched he often gets stuck if you dont press the button hard enough  looks like r2 needs to lay off whatever it is robots eat so far the flag stickered its a big sucker sticker completed i forgot to add the nose stickers before i took the pic warning the nose cone sticker is actually two stickers i thought it was one peeled of one of the stickers and put it on the middle of the two 1x8 plates and didnt notice the other sticker wacko various completed shots i think this was a beautiful little set r2s launching unit and the flick missiles are annoying but easily fixed i plan to add proper cannons in place of the flick missiles anakin is a great minifig but he doesnt look so well standing next to my other figs the brickshelf gallery when public will	positive

okie guys and gals here s time for some droid exploration with my review of set 7670 as a general statement i have to say its really a neat set that is not that expensive for what it holds 1 box art like always i will start with pics of the box art btw notice anything guys  no bloody crappy dss yes finally a set without stickers and that feels great d 2 the mfs nothing really spectacular there the only novelty lies within the inclusion of the new commander yellow torso bd apart from that there are 2 bds and unfortunately yet another sbd i like those but i have a huge amount of them and i would rather had something different you have 3 short blasters and a couple of extra parts 3 the spider droid i think its a pretty cool little buggar its a rather simple yet classic construction i think it has sweet parts such as the bd body in dark bley it really has a spider feel unlike the previous ep3 one 4 the hailfire droid this baby represents the pice de resistance of this set i truly love it  sure its a bit under scale but i dont really mind that its conception is superb even if i totally dislike assembling those technic treads especially 80 of those small things the ellipse of the treads is well balanced and that trans disc is a brilliant idea the great thing is those new flick fire missiles they dont fall unlike the other ones and they do look good on this baby also you can put the wheels together and the missiles to gain some shelf space easy storage on d  in conclusion those druids re really sweet and are perfect target practice for the upcoming rgs hehe  i hope you enjoyed that review and do not hesitate to comment and ask pic requests if any  yoda	positive

trudop561 on jan 5 2008 0421 pm said they released the battle droid commander in 2000  while there was a yellowmarked battle droid officer in the 3343 minifigure pack released in 2000 the battle droid commander from 7670 is different the new 7670 commander has a torso made of all yellow plastic whereas the 2000 battle droid commander had a tan torso with yellow printings and a tan head with yellow printings so while we have had a bd commander before the 7670 commander is new	neutral
wout on jan 5 2008 0927 pm said a druid battle pack would also be a nice idea for the castle sets may i ask what you paid for this my first and second idea was that 25 euro was a bit to much for this  xd whatever p bloody typo i say however the upcomming castle advent calendar might include druids p i paid 30 for it  dang 1 cent more expensive as sh d  trudop561 on jan 5 2008 1121 pm said they released the battle droid commander in 2000  yes another nice tone meessa so happy  first you are very welcome for my review of a set present in your wishlist then the commander you are talking about has a tan body with oreange markings only check  and the commander here has a full yellow body like in the spiderman set doc ocs hideout 4856  therefore those 2 commanders are 2 different mfs yoda	neutral

great review as weve come to expect from yoda y nice to see that tlg is finding new and interesting ways to get around the no minifig only sets restrictions with hasbro clearly this is another army builder with a minimal vehicle as were becoming accustomed to heck even the diminutive hailfire is technically a droid as well thus making this all minifigs from a certain point of view only negative it is a bit overpriced ill have a better feel for that when i get one treadslinks always drive up a price so it might just be fair the spiderdroid is a winner even with the unusual parts assortment i like it when lego thinks of different ways to use things i think it promotes the same from us im not sure what i think of the new battledroid commanders but at least i can make extras easily if i need to as i bought a bunch of yellow droid bodies off bricklink once thinking i might want to make some kind of new droid out of them they were cheap at the time now i expect the price to go up just because of this potential use between those and the grey ones its good to see more becoming available hopefully well see black and a few other colours produced for some nice customizing possibilities all in all a nice little set with a great army building potential especially on a buyonegetonehalfoff or better type of sale until then ill grab one or two and be glad to have them	positive
thanks for the takes on these two sets yoda stickers or not i still think these are charming sets with all the essence and nostalgia of the older sets back in the 8090s am i the first one to notice the new doors used in the back of the van not only is it using the popular new frame but the old container doors have been redesigned to fit with the new frame as well pity theyre not yellow though	positive
very nice cheers yoda ill definitely be getting the post van not sure about the plane though both are awesome but i think i have enough planes can you tell me though the wheels on the van are they rubber or plastic they look a bit tacky	positive
aww man is tlc really getting too cheap for printed parts shame on you tlc despite those stickers these are two really neat sets especially the airplane classic wub reminds me of that little plane my dad bought in an airplane not sure whats the set nr the window at the rear of the van looks like a normal window frame without the clips for the shutters i never knew those existed 8 might come handy for ship building thanks for the review yoda	positive
thank you for the nice review pity of the stickers but the design is nice 80ies on	positive
i need to do some catching up here p matn on jan 5 2008 0516 pm said could you tell me how much you payed for them i think im gonna buy them tomorrow if they have it already or if i dont see any cooler sets i paid a tad more than the sh price i paid 15 for the plane and 8 for the van sure its a tad more expensive but i didnt want to wait for tru to get them freddie on jan 5 2008 0610 pm said am i the first one to notice the new doors used in the back of the van not only is it using the popular new frame but the old container doors have been redesigned to fit with the new frame as well pity theyre not yellow though great remark there i guess i totally missed that one  and i agree that yellow doors would have been better but those dark bley do not look that bad  mr hobbles on jan 5 2008 0910 pm said can you tell me though the wheels on the van are they rubber or plastic they look a bit tacky rubber off course  they do look a tad tacky but its because they are the thin type like with the racers and i am not a fan of those  phoinix on jan 5 2008 0935 pm said cant wait for your next one tks  me neither though p marvinblue on jan 6 2008 0331 am said i reckon lego could enhance this subtheme by releasing a post motorbike with or without a sidecar and post office obviouly the office would be the hub of all the activity while the post bike would take care of the postal run this would free up the van to take or recieve bulk mail or parcels to or from the airport it could then also do the parcel deliveries around the city the office would also serve as the reciever for all the parcels the new goods truck might deliver so true 8 at one point i was thinking of a impulse set with a yellow bike postman post and letters that would rock  i hope tlc adds to this sub theme and keeps that retro feel wub a yellow dirtbike with sidecar would be a sweet 5 set  also a small town feel post office would be so cool like a 2030 set  we can be sure of one thing though this years advent calendar will have a postamn and small post office  post on  yoda	neutral
thebrickster on jan 5 2008 1012 am said i wasnt real fond of the postal truck at first its so different than those in the us good point b this design is just too foreign to my eyes for me to enjoy i dont like either of these sets very disapointing  the postal theme has so much potential i dont really like the torsos either  too plaincheap as kanal suggested and i will agree that the wheels on the van look cheap i was sooooo impressed with city 2007 this is a real let down though i am happy to see a small set with a postal box so even though all that aside ill probably buy 6 of the van  just for the yellow mudgards postal box and stickers to populate my city and i think this set will provide some excellent piece to moc a yellow civillian convertable with sweet  bm	neutral
im glad to see the mail van has the doors that used to be on the older cargo containers i had given up on those older ones but now that theyre still out there i may invest in the older cargo system instead of the new 6wide ones both sets are good enough ill get both im hoping for a postal building too even though i have the smaller of the old post offices a nice big modern one would be great im not too hung up about the design of the plane ive got the neat old cargo plane with the tail that swings open one of the best plane sets for big packages the truck is goofy looking but if i get sick of looking at it i can rebuild it into a classic looking one great review by the way the pictures are some of the better one ive seen in a review recently	neutral

beach house reviewed by dunamis set 4996 522 pieces 2995 from target build time 90 minutes yet another interesting creator theme house this one comes fresh of the 2008 line of sets and promises 3 different models packing 522 pieces albeit a lot of 1x1 plates for only 2995 it was hard to pass this one by as i was foraging for the new 2008 star wars sets at the local target plus i was itching to do another review since i had finally fully recovered from my marathon ucs falcon review which took the better part a month to complete the box the box is pretty standard creator type box which shows off the three models beach house caf and towering apartment building the back of the box shows some of the features of the three models interesting features of the three models prominently displayed on the back include  food counter complete with coffee espresso maker and food warmer with chicken leg  home office complete with laptop and the ubiquitous coffee cup  flip up roof granting access inside of beach house note the satellite tv dish and even rain gutters along the roofline opening the box is a matter of breaking two seals were back to the reusable cereal box type tab system that we saw so often in 2007 sets note the parts inventory is on the side of the box as well this is a nice feature once inside the box we are greeted by eight sealed bags plus two yellow 16x2 plates and a green 32x16 baseplate thank goodness there is no dss dreaded sticker sheet but alas there are no minifigs in addition there are the three manuals one for each model and they were stuffed into my box with the care of kid trying to put 10 gallons or liters if you prefer of candy in a 5 gallon bucket but hey were not collecting manuals here so who cares if the manuals are all bent and warped the manuals the three manuals are 74 72 and 48 pages in length they are laid out well and are pretty standard with all the usual trimmings  piece call outs for each step  parts inventory at the end of the primary model build  page numbers color separation in these manuals were fine for me plus we get the usual verbose lego instructions on not dumping all your pieces outside in the grass and not to dump all your pieces into a single pile thanks for the tip tlg parts list the pieces pretty standard stuff here and as i mentioned lots of 1x1 plates and tiles at least 100 however we do get quite a few windows and a couple of doors a majority of the color is black and yellow i did see a few pieces that i was not familiar with so im going to show them below keep in mind im not a parts jockey so bear with me if i think a part is brand new for 2008 and it was actually released with the classic space line 2x2 window fixed and 4x3 window that opens the follow photo shows the window glass same as in corner caf door glass and new black parts turns out these black parts are used as wheels i showed the window glass because it still contains the molding circle just like they did before it is hard to see from the photo but it is there the door glass i think might be new i dont recall seeing these 2x2 round plates with clips before and i thought i would show the mail only because it is printed and not a sticker i know these are common but didnt they have four studs on top these only have two how about this sloped 4x3 window that opens overall a nice assortment of parts with nothing juniorized the build the build was fun and was fairly straightforward once you figure out which of the three models to build it goes pretty quick here are a few shots see how the inside is made look at the detail with the flowers and even the outside water faucet outdoor seating area upstairs being built upstairs with opening roof notice the satellite tv dish check out the patio on the upstairs complete with outdoor light and rain gutters heres my favorite the bbq grill at least we know where those new parts go finally check out the tree no juniorization here here is what is left over so far i have only built the primary model the others look interesting especially the caf the design the design was well done very rich in detail i love how there are no juniorized parts the house is accessible by taking off the top floor like caf corner and market street there is an internal staircase as well there is no interior to speak of in the beach house but there is in the other two models the only real negative is that it is kind of small when you get it done it would be nice if it was about 50 bigger here are a few views of the beach house with a few minifigs thrown in check out the closeup of the caf which i think looks great also here is a photo of the interior of the apartment building where you can see the office and computer overall thoughts it is a really nice set a tad on the small side but it has some great detail and lots of features quick enough to build all three models and would fit real nice into an existing town plan is minifig scale but does not come with any lots of window parts and black slopes is a nice diversion from the onslaught of clone wars ships that we cant remember seeing from the movies final rating 84 build 910 pretty quick and fun functionality 910 it is a creator set so you have multiple varied builds diverse enough to keep the kids entertained design 1010 excellent and well thought out outstanding detail for such a small model parts 610 fair nothing earthshattering but lots of slopes and windows price 810 price ratio is good but you get a lot of little parts would be better with minifigs edited by whitefang 23 may 2009  0638 pm indexed	positive

1 before buying even if i am city fan those new sized planes are really not mine cup of tea my love to lego is firmly frozen somewhere between years 19801995 main reason to buy was that i wanted to write a review at czech afol web kostkyorg i bought it three days ago via web advertising price was  35 usd 2 after opening the box as presumed some very big parts and three bags and as an additional bonus lot of danish air free of charge first sight told me that this will be really short and easy building 3 impressions during building and it was really true 30 minutes of lazy building bag 1  plane bag 2  plane gondols with supports bag 3  wings and propellers when i saw the way how is this plane made i was strongly thinking to play money for nothing from dire straits as a music accordant with whole set 4 impressions after building  lookout juniorized creeps this is my first plane in this scale and for 99 the last one lack of details lot of ugly big parts from whole set you can see the main development target  to keep rrp at some certain low level inner space of airplane absolutely undone no details no luggage no computers nothing at all just a lot lot of air the very only details in whole plane are the stickered pilots desk and some kind of seat constuction 5 impressions after building  playability but what is playability at this set hydroplane which cannot float as seen on enclosed photos  if tlc will make some new kind of big parts used for gondolas to make the plane floating they will for sure make no other damage juniorization couldnt be higher you even cannot drive across the carpet with the plane so how to play open the doors open the cabin part and turn with propellers weak weak weak 6 resumed impressions sadly i must say that at limited release sets tlc boat seems to sailing to the worst part of the coast after quite good 7344 perfect 7899 and 7900 strange but acceptable 7998 juniorization came back with 7906 followed with this ugly playmobilized 7732 7 final word in fact even 15 usd seems to be too much for this kind of set 35 usd expected rrp in our country is really overpriced to hell neither set nor minifig is not interesting tlc maybe knows about juniorization as well as nowhere on the box the number of pieces isnt written if you my afol friends want to spent your bucks better give half of the price to african orphans you will save your money and you will have a good feeling all the photos you can see below as i cannot upload onto this topic due to some limit httpwwwkostkyorc15954newnew edited by kanalk1 16 january 2008  1032 pm	negative

i have to agree with almost all of the replies here that this set is the most ugliest looking lego set i have ever seen if i have never seen this set and ppl showed it to me i would have thought it would be some little kids moc or something no offence huge juniorized pieces bad color theme i would say it would look better if the wing is white no interior and huge dss i will avoid this set like the plague i own the entire city line except for the airport and planning to get all the city stuff that lego releases but this set will ruin my plans coz i will avoid it unless someone gives it to me for free haha wacko boo lego boo x	negative

well today i finally got my hands on set 7038 now since the moment i first saw pics of this set i knew it was for me so lets start with the new troll helmet and torso these are both great this troll really stands out as a leader when next to the usual trolls in the dwarf mining set ok so heres a few shots of the front of the set now one thing i really like about this set is the way that lego have placed the back wheels higher than the front this allows the set to really appear to being pulled here we have a shot at the missiles on the wagon these are better than some around i have to say if you look just behind the bottom missile you will see a simple firing device simply push it down and then let it go to see those missiles fire the troll flag is moved behind the missiles for firing one thing that does bother me about this set is the lack of anything on the rear ok its easy to fix with a little mocing so its not the end of the world but i would of liked something placed there now lets move on to the crownies wagon this is simple yet good for holding weapons as for the crown knights themselves well there the ones from the impulse sets which is great imo heres a few quick shots of the 2 larger trolls we have so far i prefer the sand green one what about you well thats the end for now requests for pics and comments are welcome overall i rate this set as a must for anyone whos a fantasy castle fan i know ill be getting more of this set as for the new wagon well its joined up with the other trolls i do hope the impules crownies i bought today can handle them oh and yes i did change the knights heads xd  fantasy war on vader	positive

great review vader  as ive said before this is a nice set but doesnt really come with anything that doesnt come with the other sets of the line for this reason it will be somewhere at the bottom of my list for 2008 also i like torso and helmet of the dwarf mining orcs much better the colours make the torso look rather dull and boring while the other more brown one looks much clearer and more exciting i think i like the knight helmet better too looks more covering and threatening than this one although ill save my judgement until i have one in my hands thanks again vader  edit forgot to mention hilarious pic in your sig vader d edited by tinypiesrus 19 january 2008  0828 am	negative
thanks for the review of a set i would otherwise probably have passed on out of curiosity how did you know it was for you you seem to be building quite a collection why castle now was the fantasy element all it took just curious thanks again and god bless nathan	neutral
general kannon on jan 19 2008 0510 am said im guessing the main difference is the fact that the box says special edition its either that or its a toysrus exclusive set as my armoured drilling unit box also had special edition on it	neutral
i got this set last week and just to add a few of my own points cons  the forklift spring feels a bit flimsy  i dont know how long it will last or how much stress it would take  and the end coil isnt really heavily secured to the lift mechanism time will tell on that one  30 stickers its the exoforce of city sets the truck set does look less plain with them on though i would reccomend lining them up with the green brick in the second container rather than applying the first lot without a guide or they may end up uneven  its very hard to put the minifig in the forklift without dismantling or breaking open the set slightly  the cargo box attached to the main cabin of the truck doesnt hold very strongly  minifigs are dull  that dark blue torso with pattern is way overused  green stickers are a different green to the bricks themselves pros  lots of nice pieces including the large white panels and cargo pieces and i like the green white colour scheme  the cargo doors open well and the hingeing mechanism doesnt stand out to the detriment of the rest of the set as some people have complained about the mail airplane  studless floor in cargo containers makes it easy to move pallets in and out  fits in better than the heavy hauler to a minifig sized city  new 1x1x4 slope at least i hadnt seen it before overall  nice set with some good pictures although a bit flimsy and way too many stickers  the same issues i have with the cargo plane as well although that had more colour issues	positive
nice review your camera is much better now i look forward to more of your reviews  i just went to toyworld today and got a wizard and 4 knights  and on top of that they were having a 20 off sale sweet i might go back and get some more tommorrow the wizard is pretty good and comes with some good parts owl beard legs hat round table crystal ball it would be nicer if he had a torso with printing on it but i can understand why they didnt	positive
iamded on jan 20 2008 0529 am said his belt has 4 gold crosses as seen in if you look closely the new crownies torso and the crownie archers torso and a belt buckle and the legs have a bottle a coin and a small bag nice little wizardey items i think the coin is actually some kind of amulet or locket nice review keep them coming sweet	positive
thanks for the review of this nice little set for its price 3 euros here in holland it contains quite a lot of useful parts the only thing that could have been better in my opinion is the wand i always liked this one	positive
not bad i could see picking up a couple of these guys along with a few of the new knights i actually prefer the wizard as these impulse items are simply too expensive for army building imo later	neutral
iamded on jan 21 2008 0503 am said sorry i knew you had done a review but i didnt think you had to post a link to all other reviews already done on that set  its just expressing my opinions and sharing my thoughts about the set as well as giving people a bit of info the way i see it i dont really have to post a link in the first post but you can feel free to post a link to your review if you want to give people your thoughts and opinions on most message boards one doesnt duplicate the topic of an active or recent thread theres a good reason for that the boards would soon become a mess if that practice became widespread i assumed that keeping posts on the same topic together was also the rule here and therefore expected any posts like your opening one to be a contribution to my existing thread on this topic it appears though that i was mistaken on these boards one is free to start a new thread on an existing topic in future i may well do that thank you for drawing my attention to that back on topic i thought your review was pretty good as were the pics y edited by amperzand 21 january 2008  1220 pm	positive

well since noone seems to have done one for this set here we go heres the complete set in all its glory yes i really like it but then tabletown has the capacity to support it and my green army have their eyes on it as a potential military transport as well  ill start out with the little airport ground car thingy  very neat and functional here are views front and back next up the steps which allow the plane crew to embark and disembark and to round off this little trio the cargo loading platform here in its lowered position note the prong thingy sticking out from the rear and here raised the prong thingy is now hinged up to support the back of the platform and keep it level heres a slightly different angle so you can see the pieces under there the allimportant cargo itself hmmmnot much for a plane this size the cargo pallet slots neatly onto the loading platform heres the complete set of ground equipment  all attached and so onto the plane itself note that unlike the other large planes the main wing sits at the top of the row of bricks making up the side of the fuselage i took it apart a little so you can see the internal construction of the fuselage note that the cargo area is really small right at the back what else is this thing carrying illegal immigrants  a picture of the rear of the fuselage just because i like the sticker front landing gear way better than on the other large planes i dont know if this is a new piece or what but ive had no problems with it at all and my kids have been playing with it as well the rather sexy rear undercarriage  this area reminds me of one of those giant russian transport planes  wicked those angled grey slopes atop each side of the rear undercarriage annoy the heck out of me as they keep coming off whenever i pick the plane up i think a 1x4 plate on top to bind them together might solve that a slightly blurry view sorry from underneath the gear looks like it might be capable of retracting internally but alas no this is a shame as theres certainly enough room in there and its a wasted opportunity imo might have to modify that a view of one of the four engines i personally think they look too small and should have something under the wing as well to make them rounder cockpit crew door open i love the smooth action of these doors and the way they seal flush against the fuselage when closed cargo door open crew door with docked ladder cargo door with docked loading platform cargo slots inside and locks into place the same way it sits on the loader neat the minifigs sorry this one is a bit blurry and that concludes this weeks show and tell dr s	positive

at my local walmart there was most of the 2008 sets including the indiana jones ones  i picked up this one and the motorcycle chase name 7621 lost tomb price 2000 parts 277 figs 3 box art first off we have the great indiana jones box art i must say the designers did an excellent job on it i love the little temple design with skulls as well as including indy in the right hand corner the back of the box is just as cool showing all the neat play features of the set as well as an advertisement for the indiana jones game figs first off we have our hero indian what the hell why is there a freaking cw anakin head on indy there was a production slip up as instead of indys head i get anakins   i open the box up and there staring me in the face is his ugly face tlc is defiantly doing to here a gnarly complaint from me  ok now here we have the  real indy fig that is supposed to come with the set d i just noticed that his fedora hat goes down in the back bonus picture time here is a jacketless indy with his sleeve torn off like he looks in the temple of doom sweet the next figure up is our lovely marion wub wub wub plus her head is reversible with a scared face xd love the new hairpiece in black finally we have our undead skellie with second style head and poseable arms the well of souls the set itself is a nice model and playset the anubis statues are very cool and i love all the hieroglyphs on the walls 8 here is the sw link with artoo and 3p0 xd the ark in its resting place the ark removed its very cool indeed but tlc should have made the whole thing in chrome gold  not metallic gold with brown and yellow the closeup of the anubis statue yes the eye is a sticker but at leasts a gold color playability first off you can pull the pin on the anubis statues which send them falling and taking out the walls behind the wall a skellie swings out there is a lever in the back of the model where you push down and the snakes shower down upon the figs hehe with the snakes all around marion is both modeling with the new carrot torch and fending off viscous cobras d in the meantime indy uses his whip to scale the wall and avoid all the snakes which he is afriad of in the meantime leaving marion behind to fight them off p the whip is bendable but it will always snap back into a coil its some type of bendy hard plastic scoring figs 910 model 810 playability 8510 overall satisfaction 410 would be 910 if it wasnt for the stupid anakin head error in the end this is a charming set and could easily fit in with the adventurers it has the cool anubis statues as well as the ark plus indy marion and a skellie great selection of figs but sallah would have been better since he actually removes the ark with indy however i am still wondering the point of the anubis statues this set does seem pretty silly p p	neutral

very nice review lord of pies thanks for taking the time to put this together and especially for all the detailed pics y i very much regret that my dark ages occured when they did basically i missed out on all the cheap and easy troop building sets and this one is certainly no exception the big sets are nice but these are the ones that always make me wish just a little harder for a return of lego pirates  i gave it a 4 out of 5 just because id buy 4 out of 5 sitting on the shelves today were it possible	positive
great little set i bought this set only a few years ago misb and i am still very happy about it the hut is simple but very effective as a castaway building on some deserted island the palmleaves are a good addition to any lego collection this set had a nice amount of weapons two for each pirate and two of those weapons are flintlock muskets as opposed to just pistols nice poll as well but you made sure nobody can give this set a 1 which is very nice but probably a little mistake d  i gave it the toprating y	positive
a nice review and a nice little set for anyones pirate collection a 55 for the review	neutral

truly an awesome review thanks dunamis i ordered my two copies one to build one to store in the vault last week cant wait to get this one the attention to detail here is what makes the set great theres nothing to criticize about this set its really the closest thing to perfection that i have seen from tlc the difference between this set and cc is the interior detail and because of that gg now become in my opinion the best set ever released by tlc do the ccggms sets fit well with the 50th anniv town plan my impression is that out of the box at least they dont which is too bad however i dont think it would be hard to mod the town plan so it looks like it belongs in the same town as ccggms these sets to me are what i have always wanted from tlc as an adult i hope they keep up the line and add more elements to this excellent lineup	positive
a very fine review with great and informative pictures thanks dunamis y and what a wonderful set a masterpiece and far beyond everything i wouldve expected just one year ago the amount of details is exceptional from the different railings to the mousehole and the radiator sheer brilliant  and two female mfs or hippies you never know and a child only one adult male character who nearly looks like well anyways its simply a milestone and a very creative and inspiring beauty wub easter parade on and sweet gg will you marry me 	positive
a very informative review indeed thank you so much for doing so now i know that the price is worth every penny leaving my pocket  what do you guys think is tlc putting up as the next modular set is it asking too much of tlc to produce 1 modular set each quarter 4 times a year	positive

thank you sooo much for this amazing review dunamis i absolutly adore this set and youve review has prompted me to certainetly start saving i have a bit left over form christmas that will come in handy d  i love the little fridge downstairs the fire escape and the mouse hole alot more good ideas that we can all use in creating our own buildings this line is by far my favorite lego line ever yes even beats starwars but only just   hooray for dunamis xd	positive
great pictures especially the perspective from overhead this is one of my favorite technic models because it packs so many features in a relatively small space and im working on documenting this one in technicopedia right now thanks for the photos eric	positive
thanks for another fun review this set is high on my list of things to buy i love cranes built many and bought many including the classic 8460 from 1995 and the more recent 8421 that threaded axle never stopped intriguing me it was use in so few sets i believe 8851 contained one as well and i still dont know why its better than any other axle congratulations with a near mint copy of this set 	positive

bernddasbrot on mar 10 2008 0556 pm said youve just motivated me to go on a senselesspreliminarydesignerrorshunt man this set is a disaster what were they thinking d p i just remembered one other fun aspect of this set the crane hook can be attached to the underside of the rear bumper to hold it in position while driving along but when things are like this and you try and wind up the cable the winch is strong enough to break the original provided lego rope it worked with my copy d so this set is capable of demolishing itself but still one of the best technicsets i have with all stickers intact im not so sure about that flag though must check on that	positive
blakbird on mar 10 2008 0935 pm said hey why do you only review sets which are red d i exactly thought that today as i made the pics for my signature xd at my school leaving examination i made a model in blender3d and explained to the board of examiners how to build a car and how to animate it it needed a color so i took red because all beautiful and fast cars are red my physics teacher contradicted 	neutral
i also happened to receive this set this weekend virtually misb the seals on the side of the box were loose however everything inside was untouched this little beast a joy to build and even more so to play with as indicated by eric on the technicopedia page its crammed with functions for a mediumsized set i think i love it even more than my son does	positive
i read blackbirds technopedia page on this truck the other week went onto ebay and picked up a misb copy for £25 gbp bargin great to get old sets unopened peeling the plastic off of the specialist parts was always cool love the front suspension	positive
that price is exceptional its less than what i paid for mine 9 years ago and is even less than the original price of the set note that the stickers in this set are the bad variety that will crack and peel over time if you want to preserve them the technic flag in particular you will need to tape over it	neutral
somehow i also managed to get this set in very good condition including box instructions and all stickers for a mere €22 a few months ago this is indeed a very special set and was a pleasure to build the only flaw i noticed was weak support of the rear drivetrain which was easily corrected with a few extra plates	positive
grepin on mar 24 2010 1237 am said  the only flaw i noticed was weak support of the rear drivetrain which was easily corrected with a few extra plates huh like where dont have that much problems with that rear train at least if i you dont trow the model down the stairs or something like that	neutral

hi this is my forth oldschool technic set review since blakbird pointed out that all my technic reviews are red i chose a yellow dune blaster for today just kidding this set is red as it should be dont worry my next reviews will be yellow and black uhhh forshadowing   i will start with some facts 277 elements and released in 1994 thats enough 1 the box 2 the parts 3 building instructions and catalogues wow no folds no wear marks  simply wub was lesen coole kids  klick das super magazin fuer coole kids how obvious 4 building no differential i really love the way the 1x8 technic bricks on the sides will be positioned later fun fact the engine contains no 2ltechnic axle and finished a real quick build 5 spare parts for the alternate model the yellow technic handle should be from 8412 maybe a bonus feature from the seller 6 random shots 7 final thoughts this is my second 8829 and i also noticed that the engine turns very hard the alternate model is really sorry to all those of you who like it crappy i mean a nice idea but not with this wheels  anyway a really beautiful technicset reminiscing this word exists does it thanks for viewing the pictures i hope you enjoyed it please comment if you want to edited by bernddasbrot 21 march 2008  0209 pm	positive

hello all apologize for digging out a such old post recently i got a bag of lego technic parts where there have been mixed three sets 8858 8829 and 8235 the resurrection of 8858 has been described by me in a separate post going back to the dune buggy – when i saw it for the first time back in 1994 i did not like it as i was always big fan of 8840 which i consider to the day the best looking buggy and set 8829 looked to me ugly so there were those all parts in the bag… then i though why not build it  and i started to do it when i finished i was very surprised how the final look of this set is really taking my words back unfortunately in the bag there were missing some parts and i could not rebuild the back spoiler so i made some changes to it and make it from spare parts that i have and it came out acceptable i also added some additional parts such as “fake” steering wheel “rally” logo antennas i have also reverse mounting of the rear tires – why lego did them like that i never know – as i think they look better this way set well the review has been already made by owner of this post so i will only add few things into it engine – v2 aired cooled is driven by 4 gears  from the single wheel no differential as in 8840 using two old school z14 tooth bevel  then by z24 tooth crown and z8 tooth type 1 actually the as in most old sets the pistons are moving very fast not as in current sets and smooths – i needed to extra clean all engine parts as there was a lot friction suspension – set has “engine bay” working using two old gray shock absorbers 65l – the movement is not big but works very nice better then in 8840 in my opinion steering – this is a bit odd as there is no direct connection to hog as in most old sets but first the gear rack is moved by z8 then two z14 tooth where reverse movement is taking place later connection of two old school z14 tooth bevel goes to hog details – this is the most that i like in this set specially how the use of axle pin connector perpendicular and 1x10 bricks with 3x3 cut corners and plate 1x5 toothed ends 2 studs with center axle hole are making the body shape – is just wonder tires – the balloon rear are pretty nice the front is a new version of those that were in 8840 what i do not like 1 missing of technic figure 8840 had it 2 no steering wheel in the original set 3 no differential – but having in mind that lego has introduce 2412 teeth would be difficult to build the transmission in such small space where the engine is i will shortly upload new pictures and post them here later on  over all – i think it is worth buying it as it is very payable  actually very payable and runs smoothly  the steering suspension – perfect thank you and regards	positive
pictures of my restored set 8829 i was almost 96 complete and for missing parts i add of my own the seat is black and not blue as one was missing in my 8858 the spoiler is different steering wheel added not connected to wheels and some additional items to make it look better this is how i change the tire orientation the new rear spoiler i still need to clean front rims edited by aow 26 november 2015  1232 pm	neutral
wow this buggy was my very first lego set i like this review  it remembered my childhood i also liked its body with those 8 studs long bricks on sides i can also remember trying to build engine in such way that it works smooth without success anyway i think its studless version  set 8048 is much better	positive

thanks for the review it looks beautiful my father was a backhoe driver so understandably i used to drool over this set in the catalogs i never did get it though as lego was so expensive in australia then i had around 2000 pieces and i thought i had loads d anyway last year i bought 8455 which i love it works great with a compressor i made too sweet i wish mine had a real cab though  do you have 8455 as well id love to see how they compare side by side it looks bigger than 8455 but i dont own any of the big old chuncky tires so i find it so hard to tell by the way i have been reading all of your reviews but i have been a bit busy of late so i havent had time to comment i hope you have more planned any chance of a supercar one	positive
thanks for your feedback i like both but i would say 8455 is far more than just a studless version with 10 pneumatic cylinders and 2 pneumatic pumps its a wonderful set for every pneumatic freak unfortunately i dont own the 8455  yet  sinner said i hope you have more planned any chance of a supercar one i foreshadowed a black review a few days ago guess which one xo xd	positive
yesterday while building i accidentaly dropped a axle nut of course im working in a total mess and so it tool some time til i found it again there are 324 axle nuts on bricklink with an avg price of 089 i didnt know of this accessoryset 51102 you can buy it for 4000 8	neutral
quote there are 324 axle nuts on bricklink with an avg price of 089 i didnt know of this accessoryset 51102 you can buy it for 4000 8 i was thinking of getting one of those off bl several years ago back when the price used to be more like 15 or so but i realized that i hardly ever use the couple that i already have p they came out with the modern turntable the year after this set which mostly negated the need for these screw axles i think their only use now is to hold nonlego objects onto models like the technic pen in 8094 i guess you can try to make linear actuators out of them but theyre often too rare and fragile for that	neutral
bernddasbrot on mar 23 2008 0232 pm said hi this is my forth preoldschool review as promised a yellowset  my 8862 arrived today survived the washing machine coaster and actually was real fun to build the finished “boom  jib  scoop thing” bjst  xd thanks for viewing the pictures i hope you enjoyed it another great review and a wonderful set of pictures i like your nomenclature for the bjst acronyms always sound nicely scientific much better than digger no one would know you made it up until they found out what it means i also really like what i will call your kinetic photos they convey a sense of motion and show the range of the mechanism without the big file sizes of animations how long of a shutter speed did you use the secret to not getting too much friction in the turntable is using extra nuts and jamming them together you dont want to actually clamp the nuts tight across the turntable you want to jam two nuts tightly together at each end which prevents them from unwinding but still leave a little free play gap this way it will hold the assembly together but not prevent it from moving mine moves quite easily this same concept is used on the pen plotter or 8094 slewed i think thats a word how about slewn or slain or slewifacated i think rotated is best sweet eric	positive
quote how long of a shutter speed did you use 15 seconds quote by the way dont forget to build the alternate model of 8862 i will review it too and post it in this topic quote slewed i think thats a word how about slewn or slain or slewifacated i think rotated is best actually i took it from your site xd quote white is pretty rare unfortunately i dont own 8480 but i think 8824 is also a very good though small white set 8462 rocks as a blue set i just got it a few weeks ago lets see 8462 also is one of the last technic sets i would call oldschool 8479 okay too but 8458 is imho not 8868 and the totally mysteriously black set will follow quote i was thinking you could somehow attach a 16tooth dark gray gear the one that spins freely around axles to the nut which would make the axle move in and out when the gear turned and convert the gears rotary motion to linear motion in a fairly compact package did you had something like this in mind if the toothed 10l axle rotates the axle nuts want to rotate too but they cant because of that 2x4 technic plate so theyll decide to move along the axle the 1x6 bricks on each end make sure that the axle wont move in or out thanks for your feedback	neutral
bernddasbrot on mar 25 2008 0346 am said 15 seconds wow thats a long exposure i would think you would get way too much light and overexpose the image the aperture must have been tiny quote i will review it too and post it in this topic cool i am also planning to write about the combine on technicopedia combine quote actually i took it from your site xd i thought that word sounded familiar quote unfortunately i dont own 8480 but i think 8824 is also a very good though small white set 8462 rocks as a blue set i just got it a few weeks ago lets see 8462 also is one of the last technic sets i would call oldschool 8479 okay too but 8458 is imho not 8868 and the totally mysteriously black set will follow you dont own 8480 that is unacceptable it is imperative that you put a mortgage on your house immediately to get it sweet yes 8824 is a good white set i also see from your room photos that you have the 8839 supply ship which has lots of white this is a really nice set 8462 is hard to call old school but at least it uses regular beams the air tanks are the best part of the set i wish lego had used them more often especially on the highly pneumatic sets the tank makes all the difference on 8459 you are right 8458 is certainly not old school but it is a great set with wonderful suspension it is of the same era as the super street sensation with all of the panels for body contouring 8868 is technic at its best there is nothing else like it especially with the compressor quote did you had something like this in mind if the toothed 10l axle rotates the axle nuts want to rotate too but they cant because of that 2x4 technic plate so theyll decide to move along the axle the 1x6 bricks on each end make sure that the axle wont move in or out thanks for your feedback while the assembly you have drawn would work as a linear actuator i would not recommend it the torsional stiffness and strength of an axle are proportional to the polar moment of inertia a section property most of the stiffness comes from the outside of the cross shaped axle but in the threaded axle you lose all the stiffness of the outer area because it is not continuous this means you only get stiffness and strength from the small core i think the threaded axle would bend and break very easily if subjected to much torque eric	neutral

some time ago i sort of complained about the fact that there was not much technic represented in the eurobricks community this was the topic if someone is interested i am glad to see someone took that complaint serious and started reviewing technic sets on large scale to show us how fascinating the theme really is this review is once again an excellent one i really enjoyed reading it i must buy this set sometime soon because i always liked the threeway pneumatic system it came with and the overall look of the machine for many years it seemed out of reach much to expensive and hard to come by as a kid now as an adult there are many ways to acquire this wonderful set keep on reviewing y	positive
this is a review of speed racer set 8159 raxer x vs taejo this is my second review and the first review of this paticular set and the only one on eurobricks at the moment xd so without further ado i present to you my review i like that saying so much i decided to use it again in this review its originally from my review of 8158 which can be seen here note sorry that this review got delayed but there was a hostile takeover of the computer xo dont worry everythings fine now xd set 8159 racer x vs taejo theme speed racer price 1999us pieces 237 minifigs 2 note 2 i did not take photos of just the new pieces this time because theyre the same new pieces as in 8158 just in diff colors if you want to see a picture of them click here first off pictures of the box instructions dss and minifigs not quite as many stickers as set 8158 but there still are quite a few can you guess which ones which d yes taejos hair really is red and black for racer xs head tlg just reused the baddies head from 7620  now onto the build first racer xs x racer d thats not its official name i think  back end of the car the cockpit and yeah there are no seats for racer xs hiny just a flat 2x2 dark bley plate the cockpit and rearend of the car connect using an sshaped connector piece the front part of the car the fornt and the cockpit are also connected using an sshaped connector piece adding some details including yellow fenders the underside of the car so far adding some more detail newly added motor vents and smooth details adding a front bumper amongst other things side view of the car so far no backseat driving wait a minute theres no backseat the underside with newly added axles demonstrating how hubcap piece is put on the car now onto taejos grr glorious red racer p front part of the car cockpit regular seats check cocpit and rearend of the car connected using sshaped connector piece adding some detail the front part of the car front and cockpit connected also using the sshaped connector piece adding some fenders to the car underside of the car so far adding some smooth details taejos is the only car with an actual hood side view of the car so far underside of the car with axels now some finished shots of both cars first racer xs fine black and yellow racer reminds me of an older ferrari from this angle up close and personal im guessing the 3 holes are exhaust outlets racer x rollin now its time for taejos red racer i couldve sworn i ordered some hubcaps guess who taejo racer x admiring taejos fine red automobile up close with big red rearend shot of the car i challenge you racer x taejo racer x bein a complete badass and smokin taejo  now for some comparison shots the silver pocket knife is just to hold up taejos car now a shot of the extra pieces now if you combine 8158 with 8159 you get this go go go now its time for the summary this set is an excellent buy at 20 dollars its well designed and has lots of details it also has very unique minifigs which are always good in a set its only downfalls are the lack of acessories for the minifigs and that there are no cool contraptions on the cars and by cool i mean lethal to the other racers now to the scoring of the set price1010 pieces 810 too many stickers for such a small set minifigs 1010 unique and creative playability 910 would have been perfect except for the lack of acessories and cool contraptions on the cars but both are easily modifiedfixed hence the nine overall 3740 a great set bonus try and count how many times my silver pocket knife appears and win the knowledge of knowing how many times the silver pocket knife appears p d this concludes the review more pictures of either set 8158 or 8159 or both available through request via pming me  see ya next time folks of course i dont mean that literally xd  general tarful edited by imperialshadows 01 june 2008  1205 pm	positive

as promised and with only a single day of delay is my review of the 2008 set 4994 creator fierce creatures this small set is the same size and price range as last years 4939 cool cars reviewed by prateek and dillthepill the box general info you get 193 pieces vs 206 for cool cars which is quite a lot but most of them are small there are a lot of hinges and some good slopes and wings the building instructions contains three models but no further ideas for inspiration primary model spider the first model is a big spider which shares some similarities to the secondary model of 4895 power in the design the legs each have 3 joints where the ones in the middle have stud joints to be moved sideways while the rest use hinges for all joints there are 8 of them and it does get a little tedious with all the repetitive building in this relatively small model i like the design of the face with a lot of eyes and a big and ugly mouth but the real gem is the xpattern on the opisthosoma made using doubleinverted slopes it is poseable and i think it looks more fierce when inverted secondary model snake the face of the snake is nicely detailed with a splitting tongue and a mouth than can move a little there is a problem with the construction it uses stacked hinges for some of the joints which are hard to pull apart without stressing the pieces tertiary model fly im not completely sure what this insect is i will say its a fly although the tail and head are too pointy this is a neat little thing conclusion primary model 8 it is a good design but lacks some sturdiness in the legs they fall off a little too easily secondary models 6 they are pretty good when you look at the bricks that are available but they dont wow you in any way and they suffer from the same issues as the primary model regarding sturdiness alternate models 3 it is hard to come up with alternate models with so many small pieces and plates that are only 1 stud wide the colors might make you want to build a spyrius space ship playability 8 the models have many movable joints and you can put quite a scare into your minifigs when their town gets attacked by these creatures unless some en forces are there to protect them price 6 creator sets are known for their great price to bricks ratio but this set doesnt quite measure up to sets like cool cars pieces 7 the pieces arent great by themselves but who doesnt need a fist full of hinges slopes and basic plates in standard colors i dont think this is a musthave set like the big rig was last year the pieces are great and it has a nice primary model but the set lacks a bit when it comes to the usual strong creator qualities like alternate models and price brickshelf gallery edited by whitefang 23 may 2009  0630 pm indexed	positive
thanks for this review its a nice set with some cool pieces and nice techniques i like the way the roof pieces are used to make the spiders back for instance lasse d on mar 26 2008 0948 pm said alternate models 3 it is hard to come up with alternate models with so many small pieces and plates that are only 1 stud wide the colors might make you want to build a spyrius space ship ouch thats not a good thing lets refrain from that 	positive
thanks for a lovely review i only recently bought this set off ebay pretty good deal misb for 30 euros and i enjoyed putting it together and mixing it with the other piratesets when you put two sets of two baseplates together youll get a large pond with an island in the center just to achieve that i bought two more baseplates off ebay the result is this moc i always loved the islanders and have most of the sets not all of them but that is going to change in the future y	positive
a mighty fine review youve created slyowl y after some sleep i shall immerse myself more fully within it	positive
nice review  although im pretty sure eldorado fortress has 8 minifigs making this set no 4 in the minifig count i gave it a 5 the number of islanders and vegetation pieces comes in very handy for land based scenarios ive got 3 copies of this set 1 of them costing me less than 2euros from an ebay auction in scotland along with forbidden island its easily one of the most common and affordable pirate sets to be found on he second hand market	positive

eldiano thank you for posting about your desire to have this set i do own the set and i do recommend it to others if they somehow find a used one the bricks are kind of sparse but the the bricks it does come with are really nice i love the figs and the base plates are by far my favorite made by tlg captain braunsfeld i suggest that you read through the link that covers topic bumping more clearly i apologize for the confusion eldiano i do believe that i have found a way to remove the confusion of posting in old topics soon among the pirate staff and to the other members of eb please stay tuned sinner on 18 july 2010  0316 am said 3 lego reviews dont date thus if you have something relevant to say then feel free to post in a topic but if its more than a few months old please make sure its good and if its been a few years it better be really good for example if you liked the review or set and want to say so you probably shouldnt if youve got an answer to a question such as does anyone have pictures of the alternate model then by all means post what you shouldnt do is ask questions to the original poster heshe may not even visit eb any more	positive
judging from your pictures there seems to be many interesting torsos and new fleshy heads but i dont think this set is for me fueling my dismissal of this set is that i saw the trailer for this film at the cinema today and it looked pretty terrible x thanks for taking your time to review this set though ricecracker  edited by casewindu 29 march 2008  1018 pm	negative

hi ive promised a lot lately ill review 8868 8880 space police ii blacktron ii and i will its just the time that is blocking me and my university and the fact that i just picked up 8460 in original box for only eur 3650 sweet the other reviews will follow  please bear with me and this set review is also a gift to this nice fellow who gave me the title thats what im talking about 1 useless information with high numbers this set contains 841 parts and was released in 1995 in the technic  tech build  advanced sub theme the bricklink price guide displays for “used” a qty avg price of 12585 and for “new” a qty avg price of 21282 i got it for 5698 still can’t believe it  this set was rereleased two times 8431 in 2002 and 8438 in 2003 2 the box front back open the box is higher than other technic boxes why i don’t know 8460 doesn’t have any real large parts whatever inlay i wonder why tlg doesn’t make inlays anymore… they’re noisy and brake easily but are great for pre sorting 3 building instructions i will quote myself from the 8862 review quote wow these instructions are used im not used to this after all this sets with unread instruction booklets triplewow ‘nuff said this is the “first” page fortunately peeron offers scans the last step for the alternate model and a few nice photos showing how the pneumatic pump will be erm pumped yeah random page i forgot the overall thoughts to the instructions these are technic instructions as we’re used to them part count easy to understand okay the string part at the end was too much for me and the color distinction is okay too 100 pages long and if i can trust my eyes the pneumatics page can be fold out i don’t have this page but i assume it 4 the parts 5 building an easy and fun build okay this could take some time my longest building review up to date the front steering the rear steering the axle pin between the rear steering is for the axle which rotates the crane the two worm screws in the front are for the outriggers they’re not linked one for each side the small wheel in the back is for the rotation adjusting front and rear steering outriggers are finished you can notice a 8 tooth gear that will rotate the technic turntable a steering wheel has been added could be the same stickers like the alternate 8880 used to have the steering can be operated with both actinic lights  no we’re far from finished i’ve got a lot of parts left at this point wow a 4x4 corner plate pneumatics and a winch if you can’t recognize it on the photo the technic beams are the erm wrongother side up the 1x6 technic beams on the left side are normal the axle that will extend the crane 7 gear racks 1x4 the 1x6 technic plate will keep the two pneumatic cylinders straight sad 8 huh did you blink you missed a special part the whole rotatable thing will be attached to the technic turntable using two long technic pins the pin on the right side should be in the middle of the three “turntable holes” on the right side it’s the first hole asymmetric why because we’ll add a cute cab 6 functionality you can find the features in comparison to other technic cranes here technopedia of course i made one sentence out of it please don’t find any mistakes p “two axle rack and pinion steering pneumatic luffing and gear driven telescoping via crank for the boom which can slew 360° on turntable driven via gear crank driven hoist and gear driven outriggers at four corners which snap over center” 7 random shots comparison to 8854 uuuh… once again a depth of field i tried to make it look authoritarian like 8858 but i failed somehow 8460 looks cute 8 comparison to 8421 mobile crane  crane truck i feel that a question concerning this will be asked so i deal with it right now first of all i don’t own 8421 yet i know a technic freak really should own it anyway 8421 has more than twice as much parts as 8460 is motorized features a v6engine and a very neat mechanism to extend the craneboom twice using a braided string with end studs try to find out how of course 8421 features far more than 8460 imho 8421 should have been a copy of 8460 a set so successful that it has been rereleased two times but the designers overshoot the mark 8421 is a breathtaking monster compared to it 8460 looks cute  not pale 9 final thoughts i got it on ebay in kind of good condition for about 50 dollars i know that it has been worth the money in any point of view wub i didn’t use the word “oldschool” for now i’ll change that 8460 belongs to the favored few of oldschool technic sets thanks for reading and viewing the pictures i hope you enjoyed it please comment if you want to	positive
ah thanks sommuch again for that great review y sweet man i am so happy they made this set the new one seems too boring 	positive
thanks for the review sweet for its size and parts count this is a remarkably featured set i dont think ive never seen the alternate model before personally i prefer 8421 because i think it looks much better and i love the six wheel steering i also love the three segment boom and the transmission they fit it all in so neatly i realise that it has trouble even holding up itself but ultimately it doesnt matter as its not like you are really going to construction work with it what bothers me more about 8421 is the design change in the boom from chainlinks to strings i would try to mod mine but all i have is the prototype picture to base it on and i dont have enough links anyway p bernddasbrot on apr 7 2008 0729 am said yeah somehow i wonderd why only vbbn thanks responded indeed i have been very busy the last few months and i kept meaning to reply at last i managed to find the time to reply today bernddasbrot on apr 7 2008 0729 am said another reason for the 8460 as favorite set its got a real alternate model not just a different erm crane yes that really sucks somebody i havent got the time to look  on brickshelf has made a quite good alternate lego have been a bit inconsistant with alternate models lately the recent tow truck had a good one i even made both	positive
great review while i admit i wasnt into technic at the time this came out i was a mere child give me a break d i can see now why it was featured so much from the booklets to display stands at toy stores and at my local lego center when it was still around this thing was everywhere with your review i can now truly appreciate all the details of the set i got to admit i can see the appeal now that comparison shot you took is amazing i love not only just how it included the little details such as the stabilizers but also looks incredibly fun to play around with great set and an even greater review	positive

set ref 7624 name jungle duel number of minifigs 3 number of pieces 78 price 1190€ it’s the smaller set from the last indy movie “the kingdom of the crystal skull” here we go a general view of the set we have a tent some food  a chicken leg is always welcome a fireplace the things with all the swords a bench with a broken table 3 ants a map printed tile and other accessories don’t make that girl hungry or yyyyaaaaaaaahhhhhhh ho no our diner a giant ant has gone away those giant ants are made in a smooth plastic in dark red and trans black colour and here a closer view on the two new hairpieces the new girl hairpiece is really cute and i’m a bit disappointed by the new man hairpiece…those hair lake some volume… but i’m really happy to see that tlc has made some new moulds for hairpieces it’s the good part of the theatre lines so it’s a really interesting set because you’ve got a lot of useful pieces for a city mocers with the two new hairpieces without spending a lot of money edited by imperialshadows 01 june 2008  1159 am updated statstitle	neutral

another great review alex is that the same tentconstruction as the tent in 5978 sphinx secret surprise	positive
ok i think its a nobrainer that this is a musthave for pretty much anyone who likes lego its cheap and a great minifigs  parts pack ill be getting at least 1 of these here is what i like about it 1 great minifigs with nice torsos sweet faces and awesome hair gotta ask em where they get it done  2 golden katana 3 chicken leg yum 4 nice campfire and this is what i dont like about it 1 dark bley knife seriously they could have at least made it silver like the sword if not chrome 2 rehashed tent 3 spiders with 6 legs i actually dont really care about the tent and the multilegged creatures those go straight into the sorting boxes perhaps i might use the tent someday for a steampunk moc of some kind or a stopmotion film or maybe some kind of contest anyway whats up with that thing that holds the katana the sword and the saber its in the airplane set too is it perhaps one of the treasures of the new movie or is it something indy takes with him everywhere in this film 44however nice pics nice review thanks dude edited by oky wan kenobi 16 april 2008  0938 am	positive

great review alex after seeing these pics im really looking forward to getting this set i really like how lego has designed the gas tank thats just so good finally a different shade of green for the croc its about time and more than welcome the vehicle looks good and a fun build though im not that fond of that commie tree	positive
merci beaucoup for the great review alex  where did you get the sets  that set is called river chase this is a great set  i love the amphibious vehicle with all the darj green part  i agree with you that the the dark green croc is fantastic  im also happy to have a dark bley zodiac and a new marion torso that tree hut is a fun feature where the playability doesnt screw the design  i really love the commies  its fun how lego reuses those fleshie heads and i really dont mind at all so its evil for evil since one of the commie has the zazi face i also love the ptrol cans  ingenious  i still have rants on that set  why oh why another similar indy  arghhh i cant stand it   why oh why the same marion head  cant wait to have those sets 	positive
a very fine review of a really great set thanks alex this set has everything a croc very nice mfs a neat tree trap a cool zodiac and a marvelous and very detailed amphibious car in a beautiful color scheme the only thing i´m not colpletely sure is the design of that jerrycan thanks for the right word and the interesting link kingboy  although the use of the revolver´s pretty clever indeed and fits well too it´s still clearly well a revolver very unusual and interesting for an official tlc design	positive
just like 7626 this is a must buy in my opinion i just the amphibious vehiclevery nice for army building	positive
i like the creatures in this very much and it is good to see the vehicle from different angles thank you i think i shall buy this	positive

wow in the protype pics i kept thinking this thing looked lame a boat on treads with saw blades but this is definetly something i want now lots of great plant and animal parts and looks like plenty of wheels with those treads its just begging to be made into a propor tank	positive

a great detailed review for an excellent set i love the jungle cutter vehicle itself and all the dark green its great to have the trees and cave entrance you can never have enough extras the figs are nice too two russian soldiers the coollooking general i think his name is dovchenko or something and the repeatedbutstillnice indy with rpg thanks again looks like ill be picking this up along with jungle duel by the way i think this set is called jungle cutter	positive
here some closeup pics of the russian soldiers and the general  and i know that you have seen that i dont have put the stickers on	neutral
ahhhhh now this swamp vehicle looks great to me when i first heard lego were making it i was worried that it would be a poor version however im pleased to see that its not even though im not a great fan of those treads the trees dont really add anything to the set which is a shame still the parts are welcome at least the entrance is good though it could do with being bigger but i guess we can moc that i really like the commie general he looks like a real bad megablocks	positive

the thing and the set is called jungle cutter and the reason the front pops off is because indy blows it up with a bazooka incase you wanted to know thanks for the nice review	neutral
this is the 3rd review that i had read its very tempting to fly over and get those sets from there because i may need to wait for some months before it arrived it seemed we will have a new small little creature to add into the ranks these red ants is cute and of course looks nasty too haha i love those trees foilage and plants very very much it can be used for my moc and is good for any green project related expansion i love it about the vehicle i find it abit wierd it seemed too big in the setup hehe but still i love this set mainly i will get it for the green parts	positive
heres a review of the second largest set in the dragon masters subtheme for castle month dark dragons den figs the set comes with 3 dragon knights two of which have the dragon wings on their helmetssad thing is one of my knights was missing the left wing on the helmet there are also the definitive dragon wiz the wizard or majisto if you prefertwo horses and a hawk try to find him in each picture the set theres a large spot under the mountain for the dragon to guard the treasure chest the chest has 2 red and green 1x1 circles in it another gate in the back along with a door for knights the right side of the mountain has a ladder and a removable rock face the left side has some stairs leading up to the top i love this tree design simple yet effective a shot of the top hey what are you doing no throw him in the dungeon overall this set when first released in 1993 was priced at 43usd although that might just be because of the juniorised pieces 6 burps its a fun set that provides excellent playability if you can find it at a 2030 price point pick it up overall grade 810 edited by kimt 10 august 2008  0133 pm	positive
thanks every much for the review i remember having this set and making really terrible stopmotion movies with it very playable this brings back lots of fond memories thanks majisto on	positive
yay go dragon masters i have to agree with iamded i do like the black knights sets better for their design  betrayal  however the dragon knights are just awesome cause they have dragons this is a nice set with some awesome minifigs and a nice overall design i wish i had it go masters	positive
great classic dragon den i love the old green dragons very much there were my fave i love these theme very much after the black knights era this is a very very good set i wished i can have this too	positive
a very neat set with charming mfs and a great classic dragon a good use of burps and a really nice tree indeed thanks for the review agentrick57	positive
the wizard somehow controls the dragons i think like for example the wizard of the new castle line does with the undead skeletons but i think it isnt sure that the dragon masters wizard is evil as it is still unclear which factions of the older castle series are good or bad	neutral
phoinix on 16 april 2008  0906 pm said this was the last castle set i got before my dark age really liked it although the big rock parts looked really bad  i am kind of used to them now unfortunately i lost the little wand and i never understood who is good and who is bad does the wizard own the dragon well they dont seem to be enemies but isnt the dragon supposed to be evil i always liked the burps i dont know why maybe because they were dark grey and dark grey pieces seemed a bit hard to come by at the time i always assumed that the dragon was sort of the mascot of the dragon masters the wizard was there to keep him under control so he wouldnt turn on them i always figured that the wizard was working with the dragon master king and they were fighting against the royal knights the dudes with the lion faces on their torsos or whatever they were called i like this set a lot i think the castle theme declined after the dragon masters and royal knights themes were discontinued the new knights never really took the cake its funny but it seems to me anyways that when the lego minifigs lost their regular smilesmirk faces whether they were masked by a beard or not thats when lego began to declinea bit the dragon masters had their vicious faces and all but they still had that smilesmirk underneath their rough exteriors the new knights look a littleless confident	positive
the 8291 dirt bike comes from a long line of technic bikes and i think its the best ever it looks great and its fun to ride around in the house i hoped to find a figure the right size for it but none of mine would fit unlike a lot of technic models it looks good from all angles considering the size of the model it has a complicated way of connecting the engine to the wheel the rear shocks are just the right stiffness and they have a good amount of travel i thought these shocks were new i need to get out more functions shocks two front one stiffer one in the rear drivetrain 2 piston engine linked to the rear wheel via gears and a chainlink steering yes it does stand retractable for the price size and subject what else could be added 1010 parts considering that it has three shocks and a 40 chainlinks its a great set for parts some hard to use large parts are included but they are not overused the usage of the green does limit part usage somewhat though and ill be struggling to find a use for those wheels for anything other than a motorbike 810 price at 3999 aud for 248 parts it isnt the best value set the us price is 2500 which is somewhat better it does have some more complicated parts however 710 looks lego seems to be moving away from the seethough look for technic sets and this is a good example of it im not a big fan of fairings but i think they work great in this set as a fuel tank 810 fudge this set was great for me as i have never had a technic bike however for those that want this for just parts or have other bikes it could be a hard sell the alternate model a chopper is a complete rebuild which i didnt make and its great that lego have been including these most of the time lately 710 overall recommended 810	positive
i think the green motocross bike looks great i like the use of fairings on this bike the only thing i really dont like about the technics bikes in general is the clumsy design of the chaindrive it sticks way to much out to the side if they made a really big bike model it would be more in place with this chain drive im not sure if it wouldnt be possible to design a shaft drive to the rear wheel ala bmw style but the green kawasaki look great with the front and rear suspension i have the street bike 8420 a somewhat larger and more complicated set and will probably add the motocross bike to my collection soon it would be great if lego could make a line of bikes like they do the ferrari line front	positive
best review of a lime green technic dirt bike ever really it is i just dont understand the allure of the bike very much where does the fabuland fig go anyway very insightful review thanks for taking the time and effort to review it for us im not really interested in the set but wanted to support my buddy since i know how much work you put into these now i shall go read the cherry picker one i look forward to it because theres a walrus in it lasse d on apr 22 2008 0455 pm said it must be cold in that room nice shirt but the vertical hold is broken	neutral
hinckley on apr 23 2008 0110 am said it must be cold in that room nice shirt but the vertical hold is broken its a meeting room in billund  the temperature is usually fine there according to my memory i must say thats a nice collection of motocross bikes the employe is displaying building technic is such a specialist dicipline i think it takes a lot of patience to finalize the design of a model even such a relative simpel one as this cute bike front	neutral
sinner on apr 23 2008 1037 am said ill try to take a photo this weekend well i took the photo but didnt get around to posting it here it is with a smaller gear i think it looks better the problem is that its too tight and it doesnt rotate as freely anymore adding another link makes it too loose thus the set is probably the way it is as its the gear that fit best	neutral

thank you for your detailed review sinner i´m not that much into technic building because i´m lacking the inspiration to build something different with all those technic elements so i´ll pass on this one and stay to classic bricks	neutral
looks like an interesting set i didnt realize the motor controlled two functions through a transmission switch thats always good to see ill probably pass it up though until the price falls a bit the overall design is a bit too studless for my liking i think the 8275 bulldozer has a much better balance of studded and studless pieces and the wheels somehow look too small to me i also have something of a backlog at the moment i still need to pick up that bulldozer along with the 8421 mobile crane on ebay	neutral
wow its a smarty set with drive shafts we are everybody and technical junk the specs and stuff kind of lose me but the walrus looks really cute in the cherry picker i imagine hes saving a kitten but really this is a great review and has a wealth of detail and knowlege for techniphiles thanks for providing such a cool resource for eb i really did enjoy delving in to the world of technic for a few moments the walrus rides it  oh hes so smart	neutral

looks great i cantt wait until i can get my hands on this and the other new ij sets this is turning out to be a really good theme im really liking the crystal skulls and i also think the baseplate looks very nice those natives look fantastic in my opinion thanks for the great review edited by erdbeereis1 01 may 2008  0253 am	positive
thanks for the great review sveltecorps ive been wanting to see this set in detail since it debuted at the conventions i have to say that on the one hand i agree that the minifigures the crystal skulls and the colors are great i even like the waterfall but on the other i kind of think that the set itself is a disappointment it looks like they tried to accommodate design and playability needs but really didnt come through on either so as you pointed out the mid section doesnt really fit in with the other parts and the trap sequence doesnt really flow either but perhaps your right and all will be answered in the film i was surprised at just how empty the temple looked in the photo taken from above they really should have gone the extra mile and made the temple look more like a temple and not worry so much about the action features eh but so it goes but i too am a sucker for tombs and temples so i wont be able to pass it up archaeology on	negative

i know that alex54 had already reviewed this set beforehand but i wanted to give my 2 cents it is really more like 150 on this set i bought from toys r us on friday guess what the price had not been increased by a dollar like all other sets  this is my first review of a set ever dont be too mean 1 box it captures the potential i dont know how the scene plays out for now  action of the scene nicely and is very pleasing good job tlc  on the back it shows some of the play features of the set and a net little comic indiana jones seems to be surprisingly calm considering that he is about to be captured under a net and attacked by a snake the thing he fears most 1a comic not much to say on this 1b screw up at the top of the box both russian guards have the same grining face in the set one has the generic bad guy face from 7620 2 contents the box opens up to reveal a quartet of bags an uncrumpled manual yay and a sticker sheet boo 2a dss yoda said every for of rambling imaginable about this accursed item i have nothing to say meh 3 minifigs the only thing that has not really been discussed about the figs that you get in this set is that marion has a slightly new torso 4 parts of interest when i opened up the baggies these were the components that grabbed my attention a dark green alligator a net piece that i know has appeared in sets before hand  i needed it for a moc i am working on some raft part that is probably very old a ladder with two pairs of hindges and a dark brown version of this part 4 build amphibious vehicle this i one of the more enjoyable builds of the new line but that is just my opinion you start of with some thing very simple by the end of the next page it starts to bulk up more detail beginning to look like a car 4a build rear attachment bulk it up and add taillights done slap it on to the main vehicle 4b build front attachment i am running out of things to say bulk it up add some detail add a gun and headlights and attach to the rest to get the completed vehicle add stickers i honestly think that the amphibious vehicle looks much better with the stickers than without 5 build boat this build goes by rather quickly and adds to the playability of the final set base apply clamps add more to engine build more detail and a gun base finished boat plus stickers i love how lego slips in the product number into their stickers 6 build tree fort this is the weakest part of the whole set but i find my self liking it more and more for some odd and inexplicable reason that tan 6x6 will most likely see use in a pirate themed vinigete soon not mine  install netlauncher you spend the next two pages building this and putting it on a tree branch that is an ugly mix of brown dark brown and frown our commie friend seems to like coffee a lot second branch 3rd a wee bit to much on the coffee there dont you think final step the only redeeming value of this section is how well the net launcher works fantastically the rest is just utter fail 7 spare parts very little in terms of what is left over finished set all in all this set is a fine build and an excellent parts pack for dark green components i recommend this set strongly despite its few weaknesses	positive
nice review although you need to use the macro settingaka the flower setting for better pics are you using a digital camera you really need macro the idea is turn it on and hold down on the take picture button halfway until the pic focuses then press it down all the way to take the pic im glad this one also comes with the new uzi i wanted an extra	neutral

very good for a first review i bought this set and jungle duel at target the other day i was going to wait and buy them when i go to downtown disney this summer but how could i pass up saving four bucks that i can spend on storeexclusives  and i have to say i absolutely love them the amphibious vehicle dont they call it a duck in the movie is definitely my favorite lego vehicle ive ever built everything about it is wonderful the size the colour scheme and its accurate to the one in the movie and irina spalkos hair is to die for on a side note i dont get why they made marions arms white in the set the shirt underneath her vest in the movie is obviously blue i switched the arms out for light blue ones and it looks a lot better and it makes marions eyes look great ryan	positive

ahhhh back in the days when shell was the racing fuel of choice before that octan company came to town bought off the old shell execs and ran them out of town on a rail but i digress i always liked the look of the set but at the time could not work out where i would be able to fit it into my town	neutral
i can remember when i saw this set in lego catalogues looking at it dreamin to have it like so many other sets and this one is still a dream i really like the design of this set it looks really complete with some nice details there are no lost place the strairs withe the foot bridge add a lot to it imo looking at the pics ive got a question  is the rescue rig trailer one piece or is it brick build	positive
thank you very much for that fine review of a really classic and wonderful racing set and i really wish that tlc would continue with showing some great alternative models on the back of the boxes just imagine on	neutral
awesome review batbrick i dont see any appeal at all really in this set but thats okay as i want to stick to castle anyway the car is the best part imo which you can get in a different set with another cool car and for a cheaper price but the main downfall to this set is the fact that the trucks trailer is half blown up and the survivors are magically staying inside and not being sucked right out of there as you have mentioned i would have thought tlc would at least included some sort of cover that you could take on and off easily kind of like the modular buildings having said all that though the front of the truck does look incredibly cool and those minifigs are sweet too bad they all have flesh tone printed on them so while this may not be my set of choice i can see the appeal well really i cant but its just my opinion im sure there are plenty others who would love to scoop this set up peace	negative
warning this reply may contain several minor movie spoilers if you havent yet seen the movie and want it to be a complete surprise do not read batbrick on may 10 2008 0605 am said but it is cruncher block his lady driver taejo that really shine look at those awesome suits the cool faces taejo has a ripped shirt i was originally skepitcal about the driver figure—i like the head but i was trying to figure out why they put in a female minifig with no hairpiece after having seen the movie i now understand why crunchers driver is a fairly manly looking woman and most of the lego hairpeices would make the minifig look too girly for the character  now that i know why taejos shirt is ripped up i dont mind the bits of fleshie color that are printed on it but i do wish they would make some of the new torsos a little more headcolour agnostictheres no real reason why cruncher and his driver couldnt have had ties that came all the way up to their necks instead of having those little wedges of flesh showing through loose collars yeah they are lowlevel mafioso type scum but they arent complete slobs batbrick on may 10 2008 0605 am said front view the new windshields are fantastic they are indeed very nice its the main reason i started looking at the speed racer sets in the first place batbrick on may 10 2008 0605 am said while a very cool car it is rather silly of tlc to give us the exact same one we got in the smaller set i didnt get the smaller set with this car so im still happy but it is a bad marketing move i think the error they made was in the smaller set though in the movie the only time we see crunchers semi is when hes being chased by racer x racer x and taejo do end up on the same team for a cross country rally race along with speed of course so i guess thats where they were going by putting those two together in the smaller set but it would have been much more interesting for them to have made up a set with taejo and one of the cars from the very goofy comic bookgimmicky teams they are racing against especially since one of the teams that is chasing taejo specifically is a bunch of armywannabee loonies—im sure more people would have loved some sort of darksand green racer with one of the ij soviets at the wheel than another racer x to summarize two racer xs is bad but it is the smaller set that should have been changed imho batbrick on may 10 2008 0605 am said annoyingly enough this part opens up to shoot a pointless rubber projectile thus blowing the front part open and launching itwell not far really as much as i normally dont like the stupid techic launcher thing and would rather not see it in a set ever again although one of these days i will make a giant multilauncer rig out of them just for fun at least there is a reason for it to be in this set as crunchers semi has a missile launcher in the front end of it in the movie i think youre supposed to lift the panel that hides the missile before launching it similar to the way that panels slide out of the way on the semi cab to allow for firing in the movie batbrick on may 10 2008 0605 am said and now for the most disappointing part  step three the trailer thats right almost the entire thing is open even the filled in side has holes id certainly be cared to be back there one bumpy hill and back you go im gonna chock this up to the standard lego philosophy of playset rather than model design for a lot of things the semi rig and raver xs car are the models the trailer is the playset seeing as how the trailer is crunchers mobile office rather finely appointed with lots of paintings and his pirahna babies in their tank behind his desk and the intent seems more or less to have a playest bit in order for kids to reenact the scene from the movie im not going to give them too much grief over this they tried to capture the basic bits of the movie set which we see mostly from the inside during the movie and translate it into a playset type environment that being said i do wish the back walls were more solid as i see no reason for there to be gaps in the back wall when the front wall or the fourth wall as the case may be here is already conspicously absent batbrick on may 10 2008 0605 am said there are some pluses too though like the ridiculously awesome minifig paintings ill be using for wayne manor also note the control on crunchers desk that when turned turns the gun at the bottom its an alright feature could have been a little better but its such a minor bit of this scene in the movie that i can see why they didnt spend too much time and effort on it it would have been nice to have more paintings though had the back wall been more complete and i like your idea of how to use them   batbrick on may 10 2008 0605 am said and though im not a massive fan of stickers this is just too cool the little aquarium is very simple but very clever using a printed piece between two clear windows to create the illusion of a tank definately a feature which is not showcased nearly well enough on the box art since it is one of the major features of this set in the movie its nice to see it translate rather well into brick batbrick on may 10 2008 0605 am said design 25  pretty poor considering the best part is available in a cheaper set and only the front part of the truck looks cool but still not truly awful that may be a bit harsh but not much given what ive said further up this post but it probably only deserves a 3 at best so im not realy going to quibble the point  i still think that racer x should be exclusive to this set and a different car should be in the smaller set with taejo which would have improved the cachet for this set overall batbrick on may 10 2008 0605 am said price 25  overpriced easily but rogue shadow is worse truethis should have ideally been about a 30 set especially given the general awesomeness of the ij race for the stolen treasure set unless they made the trailer a bit more detailed better back wall perhaps some drop down gun ports like in the movie or at put least one or more of crunchers goons in the set then maybe i could agree more with the msrp on that note if i remember correctly from my visit to my local tru yesterday in search of the new ij sets since local targets seem determined not to get them in stock yet they had this set on sale for around 35 along with an offer for a coupon good for 750 towards the purchase of a ticket to the movie with any speed racer toy purchase over 25 i may be wrong on the sale price but i know the ticket offer was there so if you havent seen the movie yet and are interested in this set tru may be the place to go right now to get both at a slightly cheaper price batbrick on may 10 2008 0605 am said fun 45  the mere concept of such an open truck kept me playing with this baby for hours so you did enjoy the playest aspect of the trailer even though you didnt care for the designlooks like they didnt do too badly then on what they wanted out of that bit  batbrick on may 10 2008 0605 am said overall im really glad i bought it as the minifigs are fantastic and the paintings and fish tank are cool its fun stupid and downright ridiculous but while not a great set by any means certainly isnt as bad in the brick as it looks in photos i was actually thinking about going and getting this set now that ive seen the movie and i understand what the heck is going on here more your review has definately added an additional impetus to that notion my pocketbook does not thank you	neutral
thanks for that fine review batbrick the most interesting part of the set for me are the neat mfs the trailer looks really pretty skeletal however it´s a nice little play set and´ll fit its purpose i guess	neutral
thank you for the nice review	neutral
hi all newly arrived today dont you just love shop at home thought id give it a quick review see more details over at my site the tumbler jokers ice cream suprise	neutral
the batman minifig have a detailed and cool torso thanks for the review brickbitz edited by darkrebellion 16 may 2008  0731 pm	positive
nice review brickbitz i actually think this kit is really very nice for the size true you only get three figures but it seems thats a norm in most batman sets besides everything else is great the tumbler looks like an amazing build  they really nailed this tank of a ride and the ice cream truck plus this set does seem to have some neat pieces in it trans green popsicles and lime hubcaps anyone i think this far beats the rest of the batman lineup this year which seems quite disapointing overall edited by grevious 16 may 2008  0812 pm	positive
its on the way and also the buggy	positive
ronan nissen on may 16 2008 1005 pm said oh wait is that torso dark grey or light grey its definitely dark grey	neutral
hey brickbitz i love how your review is not biased 10 ups in the end you said overall slightly disappointing most people post reviews only with praise but im glad you take both sides  enjoyed the review just like others have thanks so much	neutral
deinonychus on may 16 2008 0921 pm said hey dunamis think you can get a straighton shot of the face the red pieces inside the eye sockets are topped with transgreenishyellow studs which make his face look eerily alive and very close to his screen appearance its a nice little detail that seems to not show through on pictures ive seen of the set the legs are a little wobbly im scared that hell be leaning too far forward in about 5 years sure ill get a few photos tonight and post them the eyes are a nice effect you are right about the legs as the model does wobble a little i forgot to mention that the base does turn which is another nice feature	positive
nice review dunamis  i built it two weeks ago on the legoworld speedbuild in oslo and didn´t have time to get the feel during that crazy race i agree with you that the base is nice  sturdy makes it stand real still  i´m looking forward on your next score four eyes arms on copmike	positive
cool i like the idea of using the hood as an organ dunamis reviews on	positive
ok here are a couple of shots of the head and eyes a very nice effect any silly me in my first set of photos above i never folded in his ribcage you guys gotta call me out on these things here is what it is supposed to look like anyway carry on	neutral
awesome review dunamis thats such a sweet set i loved it as soon as i thoroughly examined the online instructions it looks way awesome in the brick my favourite part has to be the eyes very cool and creepy thanks again for the info and of course the pics peace	positive

nice review but id rather save my money for the indy and clone wars sets	neutral
hi all again another one of todays special deliveries i think personally this set is great mars mission is really finding its feet 7646 etx alien infiltrator	positive
thanks very much for the review brickbitz i love this years mars mission line and though this is the weakest set it is still a major improvement the mech is very cool and well made and the commander is one of my favourite alien figs ever the alien ship is pretty good better than last years ones but not extremely good either but i still like the set batbrick away	positive
thanks for the sweet review brickbitz that really is a neat little set that walker is fantastic most likely the best part of the set though the alien craft does also look neat and its cool how it can fold down into aa walker or rather a sentry turret seeing as it cant really move while in that mode still its nice my favourite part is the mini mining robot though so cute peace	positive
thanks for the review brickbitz i dont normally come into the space forum but this set it tempting me on the basis of you review i think i might aquire one at some point	neutral
the rancor on may 18 2008 0138 pm said damn i was just about to post a review on this why not multiple reviews´re doing no harm and it´s always interesting to see reviews with a perhaps different point of view too	neutral
thanks for the review nice little set and its around 2000	positive
thanks for the excellent review oky judging by this set the line is going to be promising i really like the figs and im glad to see that robot arm is actually a new arm mold awesome can a minifig hand fit in the end or just the chainsaw attachment could it fit an exoforce robot claw theres a lot of detail in the torsos and i like that the agents suit is like a motocross uniform i love that the snowmobile has a working tread copmike ras and i tried to build a snowmobile with working treads but we ended up using chainsaw blades in the end great work oky	positive
this is much much much more promising than the 2008 batman set for 1000 the vehicle looks like someone took time to design it but the batman one looks like  lego dear lego where is the quality for batman i really like the new cyborg arm and the propellers on that thing   it is a really promising line although i would get rid of all those bionicle pieces	positive
thanks for the great review oky wan the two vehicles look quite nice for a small set and the minifigs look great the two sided head is nice although it wouldve been nice if it was a new head rather than the standard frowning face the cyborg looks good nice and cartoony i like the printing on his back the belt on the hips should be useful not to mention the robotic hand i assume that anything that fits into a 1x1x1 cylinder can fit in it i hope so thanks again oky any chance you can get any more sets	positive
this set looks wicked thanks very much for the sweet review oky wan the pics are perfect great quality and the perfect size well done this sets got everything a new hairpiece tank treads a gem well i could go on but you can all see everything from the great pics thanks again oky this is one set ill definately be getting peace	neutral
thanks guys i really tried to make it a good first review now to answer your questions the robot arm can fit ef robot claws and anything that a minifig can hold in his hand or that would fit into a 1x1x1 cylinder so normal minifig hands are too small to fit tlg is using the robot claw idea for the main villain of the agents line do you still want me to try it out and take pics the price was 1099 usd at the tru i bought it at i bet itss be a dollar less on sh and im sorry but i probably wont get any more sets any time soon i have to save my money for all the other good set that are to come but if i would get another set it would just be the one with the helicopter and the allsilver car if anyone gets this set can heshe please review it thanks any other questions i can answer for you guys edited by oky wan kenobi 18 may 2008  0859 am	neutral
oky wan thanks for this wonderful review i really have mixed feelings towards agents set haha but i love the agent minifigure the doublesided face is great and i love the sunglass look its nice that they made use of mutts hairpiece which is personally my fave hairpiece at the moment the jetpack is neat making use of the additional secure backing onto the minifig is really very smart	positive
omg omg omg im coming to the us in just under two weeks really hope i see them somewhere does anyone know what ny times square toys r us is like for new sets	neutral
is there any chance u could post pics of the comic and the box i love legos box art and instruction art	neutral
i love the way the bad guy has a special attachment on the jewel case just to allow the agent to grab it with his hook its like the two of them sat down beforehand and drew up the plans for the vehicle together cyborg ok and then ill make my getaway in the special snowmobile and you can follow me agent and ill scoop up the jewel and return it to foil your plan cyborg perfect see you tuesday dr s	positive
thank you	neutral
that would be great i still wonder why the instructions arent up yet though	neutral
thanks for the review this set is wonderful u love the two dark green crocodiles and awesome minifigs especially break jaw that bike is awesome and the base like all agents sets comes with great pieces like the barbed wire orange anything leafy pieces and brown log pieces thanks for the review ill definitely get this one batbrick away	positive
a really cool playset thanks for these great pics sirnadroj a silver jaw helm cycrocs some cool faces and a very swooshable bike see you later alligator the only thing i don´t get entirely´re these neat barbwire circles what´s the purpose with these life rings for masochists well that makes me look at that tower in a completely new way too baddie´s baywatch on but where´re the girls	positive
have you made any other reviews i want more please im not planning to get this set but its pretty cute the set itself is okay but the figs are amazing agent charge i want that head unibrow man great villain crocs	positive
great little set nice to have a small building instead of all vehicles plant pieces and dark green crocs always welcome good parts selection for the price thanks for the review cant wait till we can get our hands on these	positive
cantresistthe unibrowmust obey	neutral
wow thanks for the great review sirnadroj the overall set is what attracted me in the first place that elevated hut and swampy setting just sucked me right in it all looks really nice to me a definite buy that agents head would make a great indy for those opposed to fleshies and that monobrow i mean villain guy looks very er well the monobrow is unique thought i noticed the suit looks a bit skin tight in the crotchal area dont look at me like that you saw it too anyway the helmets the best part about the villain great for warhammer 40000 orks peace	positive
i always joked that our house would have a moat around it with mechanical alligators now i can build the house in lego thanks sirnadroj for the review and pictures this is definitely my favorite agents set	positive
as others have said this really is a set for those that didnt buy the batcave thus i want it the cars are pretty horrid though thanks for the review theriddler	neutral
thats a great set itd be even better if it were sold as two separate little cars they remind me of the dozens of little lego cart vehicles i got as a kid those were always fun quick builds that resulted in lots of cool play i think this set is aimed more at kids and in that respect its a pure winner it doesnt hurt that you can get freeze and the newly designed batman both in this set for a reasonable price	positive
thanks the penguin and more pics on monday	neutral
thanks for the extra pics i dont think you could have gone into much more detail than that nice pics of the joker van too will you do a review of that one batbrick away	positive
in actuality i think that this may be my favorite batman set of all time i know i know  its a small set with crappy tiny vehicles so it probably sucks for the fan who likes to display sets but look at the mocing side and you see this set has a ton of potential new batman fig well mainly the torso but it looks nice sleek and armored a definite plus whether youre a mocist or batfan mr freeze because nobody bought the batcave when they should haveand by nobody i mean me plus i love that head cheapest way to amass the lightning piece the other sets that have it are lolhueg well not really but i dont have 50 to toss around on a little skeleton tower and its a great piece two little blue gems i may be alone on this but those are my favorite parts the gems and thats my favorite color for them 3 3 3 several other useful parts including a o piece in black some lightmedium blue bits from mr freezes kart the oddly placed grappling hook and some cheap wheels now i dont know about you guys but this is as close to a batman battlepack as were going to get lol  im buying at least three maybe more once i get my summer job  oh and the fact that the us price is only 10 helps a little but this year you guys cant complain  you got practically every set first especially the new castle tt trexxen	positive
great review deino man that car is just so beautiful and the helicopter is nice too unfortunately this seems pretty pricy and i hardly think ill be getting it any time soon what with my limited budget and all still its great to see how well agents is shaping up	positive
thanks for the review deino i love going back through the old agents thread just to see how wrong we were about these awesome sets i actually really like the gate those portcullis pieces people may know i always find nice uses for and i really really really want that awesome sound brick the figs are a bit disappointing in numbers but agent chase is very cool generic henchman are great and spy clops is one of my favourite minifigs ever the helicopter is wonderful too i love that it is customised for spy clops to winch him down the colours as usual for these sets are fantastic the dark blue orange and chrome silver the car is the best though i love all the functions how does the ejector seat work though batbrick away	positive
thanks for the awesome review deinonychus this really is a sweet set a bit expensive a set for me as i only get the cheaper noncastle sets which is a shame because i love that head it would be great for some more cyborg troops the car is awesome i didnt expect it to have that many silver parts thats fantastic heaps of play features too that ejector seat mechanism sounds interesting thanks again for the sweet review peace	positive
esjpg 4794k 110 downloads the ejector seat a long technic axle runs the length of the front of the car it comes in to the seat area here and nests into the gray joint which is attached to the small gray technic beam the beam is attached to the ejector seat bottom white 3x2 plate with a technic pin the seat in turn is attached to the side of the car with a technic pin the result is when the axle is pushed forward the gray joint and beam tilt the seat and eject a minifig after about 20 shots the minifig only went outside of the car 3 timesthe rest of the time he just bounced around the inside of the car so they get an a for effort but an f for execution	neutral
looking closely at the red cones on the missles and grey cones on the cars rear these appear to be a new piece note how there is a slight stopper ridge at the base of their top stud interestingly the trans green cones on the helicopter seem to be of the older mould style	neutral

sdpirate on may 26 2008 1040 am said no offence make this 799 can too expensive to be coming with only a few figures 20 earns you the same amount of figs plus a catapult barricade two horses and a jousting divider are you refering to these following sets both these sets adds up to 1800 cad and the skeleton pack have the same price of 1800 cad prices quoted from sh i understand that 7009 and 7090 offers more pieces horses and same amount of minifigs compared to a typical battlepack imo i feel that all 3 sets are all army building sets 7009 offer small catapult 3 minifigs a skeleton white horse 7090 offer a joust divider weapon rack good accessories 2 minifigs a horse with barding and a skeleton black horse these sets have different purpose for me buying multiples of 7009 is to build its catapult white skeleton calvaries while 7090 is to build on crown calvaries and black skeleton calvaries however battlepacks have a different agenda it offered some castle accessories that is not available commonly for a castle army builder like myself castle accessories are always in demand the black robe silver armor silver shortaxe are not very common castle accessories it can be used as a good stock up too i am not saying this battlepack is an one way solution to solve everything thats why different sets are released to target on different purposes	neutral
thanks for the review whitefang your additions look great i like your mace much better than the use of a small technic cog your looks much sturdier and that helmet looks really great on skellie soldiers i never thought to use that before very cool indeed peace	positive
mack on may 26 2008 0130 pm said you cannot say that the battle pack contains the same amount of stuff that the other two sets have and therefore should be priced the same it just seems that lego is ripping off canadian army builders to me if the battle pack contained a small catapult or wall so that it contained about the same amount of stuff that the other sets had it would be fair it seems stupid that you will only get minifigs from one set while you can get about the same amount of minifigs plus a bunch of other stuff from two other equally priced sets that’s why to me these battle packs are a rip off because of what they contain imho the battle packs seem to be only worth about 10 dollars mack i can understand your concern when pricing is concerned pricing is always a big issue for us to determine whether to buy or not to buy a certain set in a particular country pricing varies differently across different countries such as us europe canada australia and etc this is something very hard for us to decide on we cant be sure why tlc placed their pricing strategies this way well i think we should appericate what tlc is trying to do for us by not using price as the only factor to judge whether to buy this set or not at least i am sure there are many of us trying to request for battlepacks to muster armies for their mocs armies collection and etc different people have different judgements towards different sets and different themes i respect your opnion imo lets dont let price be the only determined factor to decide whether to purchase a particular set or not instead consider an array of factors that is offered however i do know that consumers like me and you are always affected by price iamded on may 26 2008 0140 pm said thanks for the review whitefang your additions look great i like your mace much better than the use of a small technic cog your looks much sturdier and that helmet looks really great on skellie soldiers i never thought to use that before very cool indeed iamded i am glad you enjoyed the review and my slight modifications that mace was a much looking weapon it looks much firm than the orignal look the design was inspired from dwarf mine and dwarf mine defender i would not want to have so many troll flags hanging around the nose cone helmet was to give the soliders a whole new look to me it retains the classic look yet it belongs to present theme suitable for my skeleton elite guards	negative

thanks for reviewing this rare set since it came out in 1999 i have only seen this set in a toystore one single time one single copy as well it was in the summer of 1999 in belgium arlon in a store called maxi toys belgiums tru i think they had the three biggest junglesets for sale there these ancient ruins the set with the beautiful black boat and the zeppelin being into adventurers at that time i had never seen the entire jungle theme not even in a leaflet or catalog and surprised as i was i bought all three sets that was one happy dutch boy in belgium surprisingly the two smallest sets made it in very small quantities to my local stores in holland except for the pontoon plane and small raft which was my very first shop at home order the spiders secret i bought off bl which makes me the proud owner of the entire jungle serie back to the set this was the first time in a long history of collecting lego that i had a deformed piece an 2x8 red plate was twisted i twisted it back and it still serves its purpose i loved the whole steamidea in this jungle serie the two boats both including the one in this set had nice steamengines and a very cool mechanic yours has the wrong hathair btw to come along with them the skeleton falling down on the end of a chain was the most intriguing part of this set for me it worked really well and when you were done scaring minifigures you could winch it up again ready for the next go the only thing i did not really like about this set was the difference in wheelsize on the car front small back large and the way the palmtree consisted out of just three parts all in all a great set that is becoming more rare and expensive as we speakpost get it edited by simonwillems 26 may 2008  0759 pm	positive
athos on may 28 2008 0747 pm said the printed pieces are the real gems of this set beyond them there isnt much to this set though the boat hull is nice the model itself isnt all that great the new akator temple is definately a superior model at least in piece count but those printed pieces are hard to resist steve i have to agree too few pieces for such a high price but amazing figs too and a nice baseplate despite a 4 palm tree you get more palm tree leaves for mocs plus i think a monkey and that sweet achu figure	negative

i just rebuilt this entire set today and the nostalgia was totally worth taking bits and pieces from a few of my own mocs only now did i realize how rare some of those pieces are and im rather thankful that i have all of the printed pieces and achu the only pieces i am missing is a transparent orange headlight 3 out of 4 black minifigure hammer light gray chainreplaced it with a dark gray chain and one whole minifigure which is the mechanic guy i still have both the instructions and the box and both are in appalling conditions kudos to the pre2000s lego sets like this one love em	positive
wow good review i used to love this old sets as i was greatly fascinated by inca and aztec cultures and the mayans technological marvels astounded me i was thrilled to death when lego released little aztec figures so of course i jsut had to buy some your narration with the sig fig was hilarious and the review was all around wonderful keep up the good work mate	positive
i had one of these it was awesome it went well with the zeppelin i cant remember if the box was one of those fold up the lid ones though cant tell from the picture anyone want to jog my memory i always thought the sets with the flap lids were the best i kept those edited by giantdinosaur 26 september 2011  0838 pm	positive
haha i love seeing reviews where sigfigs and minifigures from the set present the set im looking foward your next reviews d	positive
welcome to cardinal bricks review of 7736 its a small set but as i bought it the other day i felt that it probably did merit a short review the box is ofcourse far larger than necessary theres plenty of air inside the contence is one bag and the instruction booklet you could proably build it inside the bag if the desire took you we have one new coastguard with the slightly stubly head found in the castle range and a transclear visor the build was challanging and arduious the final product is quite nice at one 300 its a good set only 50p more than an impulse set and with enough extra parts to justify the increase in the price a good set for a little gift or so on the buggy moves well theres not that much to say really for i cant really think of additional models to build with the parts but then what do you expect for the price edited by cardinal brick 26 may 2008  0647 pm	positive
donneyboy on nov 27 2008 0840 pm said i might buy a second one of that set and build it in the bag i just wanna prove that it is possible i bought 4 myself its like having a little beach fleet	positive
so i just piced up a new digital camera and i thought what better way to try it than doing a review of my newest set the new 7738 coast guard helicopter itsmy first review so go easy on me lets start off with the small stuff first the mini figs you get 4 figs total two helicopter pilots a diver and a civilan to rescue the torsos are nothing new on the pilot and diver same ones as in the last coast guard line but i like the colors alot better in this coast guard line than the previous generation the yellow and blue really work well together and the coloring on the badge looks great the civilian looks to be just a dock worker with an overall torso and a beenie the diver has nice vented helmet and a pair of flippers that suits his duty perfect next we have an absolute work of lego art the rescue raft the orange flaps can be moved back for easy entry to the raft as well as the white support beams with the caution tape i put support in perenthaces cause they really dont support anything just there to fill in the gaps at the top of the raft is a red locator beacon ccommunications antenna and a cargo loop for lifting the raft lets move on to the interior of the raft not much here but you can see the techinc beam that attaches to the top loopand to the floor of the raft so far this has proven to be very sturdy and has supported the full weight of the raft quite well you can also see the white box that holds the equipment of the raft here you can see the life saver tube heres a shot with our dock worker peaking out the side the raft says max ocupants 4 but with the storage box that might be a tight fit now lets move on to the helicopter in my opinion this is one of the best helicopters tlc has come out with to date i really felt they captured the look and proportions of a real coast guard helicopter it uses a lower hull and tail section of the new airliner and cargo airplane it really seems to work well with this application the engines have good detail using new cheese graders as vents as well as the new engine stacks that come in the new speed racer sets the rotors also appear to be new as well lets move on to the cockpit we have two seats for our pilots with a sticker sheet for intruments on a flat 4 wide plate theres also an antena being used as a flight stick another shot with our pilots at the helm now lets moveon to the high lihgt of this heavy lifting machine the med bay and lifting winch httpwwwbrickshelicopter020jpg here you can see the winch arm at rest along with the medical strechter the bad part is that the med strechter doesnt include the ussually included fold away wheels heres a shot with the winch arm extened ready for rescue in the second shot you can see the drum that the wire coils up in it coils up via a recently new power functions pull back motor to operate just pull out the winch cable hook on your load and presse this orange button on the side the bad part of the new power functions winch is that although its very smooth in its operation its not very strong it will only lift the raft a couple inches before it runs out of torque it also has a tendency to want to pull the crane arm backin while its lifting it doesnt matter if its a light load or heavy load the bay doors open on both sides for easy postioning of the figures and accses to the strechter here we have our diver looking over his rescuee nice and roomy if you dont mind a crane arm being in your way at 3999 and a peice count of 445 i felt this set was a great good considering what your getting the raft construction is very creative and is probbly the highlight of the set by itself the helicopter is probbly one of the best if not the best helicopter tlc has ever came out with if you can get over its size in a scale of one to five price peice count playability design overall 5 i would have given it a full 5 out of five but since the winch cant pull the raft all the way it didnt fell it right even with this minor flaw i still highly recomend this set	neutral
wow i was skeptical of this coast guard line though getting to see some detailed pictures of this set i really want to get get it alas i have not the money to get it and it isnt available in my town oh well maybe i can catch it on a sale at some point good review	positive
this has gotta be the coolest chopper ever i love it its so accurate plus your review is great because it shows all the inner details	positive
thank you very much for the nice review 5150 lego the helicopter is  apart from that it is very very big and that it does not include any interior  a very nice set  the most i like the life raft becuase it is simply  nevertheless i dont know if i buy it probably not  but its very nice two questions  where can you fasten the stretcher on to haul it up and down is the motor working with batteries klausdieter edited by klausdieter 28 may 2008  0919 pm	neutral
thank you for that fine review of a really excellent set 5150 lego i never saw a little juniorization done that good before	positive

i could tell from the pictures that a lot maybe all the designs on the raft were stickers in the whole set are there any printed parts besides the torsos or is it all stickers	negative
all stickers im afraid though imnot a fan of stickers myself some sets like ferrari for example take longer to put on than building the actual set this one is not as sticker heavy as it seams though and the ones that areon there really give the set that extra touch printed would have been preffered of course but in this case i didnt mind it	negative

thats a very nice set im having my doubts about getting it though still the overall shape and size of the helicopter remind me of the reallife ch53 military cargo helicopter a very nice review youve got the photography down very well i feel perhaps a bit of nitpicking but at the end where you assign a rating if you do a rating with faces which is fine by me you may want to seperate the faces by a line otherwise it may become too crowded to the eye	neutral
this is a very good review thank you but i have some questions about the grey new parts in the life raft are they 1x1 like their counterparts with the clips or 1x2 and can they be held by a minifig by the handle if so these could be very useful for brickbuild weapons  tools also im looking forward to some orange eta 2 jedi interceptor mocs now who wants to be the first to make one btw which jedi has an orange eta 2	positive
thanks for the review this set looks great and i really wish i had the money to buy the entire line but unfortunately i dont i love the way tlc used the wing parts to the jedi interceptor for the life raft  very well thought of anyhow great review	positive
what an outstanding copter i love it the orange looks fantastic this is probably legos best copter to date thanks for sharing the review i would definately recommend that you downsize your pictures a bit though	positive

thanks for the review riddler your pics are a bit blurry though if you want them a bit better you should sit your camera on a hard surface so you dont wobble it as much i love the tumbler though it is quite massive but either way ill be glad to get it the figs in my opinion are really bad joker should atleast have a different suit oh well its worth it for that awesome van and instance where the stickers are totally worth it thanks again batbrick away	neutral
thanks all but so little replies  but my hq is sent now ill hope and think the set wil be arived tomorow who wants the second riddle	neutral
theriddler on may 29 2008 0254 pm said who wants the second riddle bring it on oh mysterious puzzler perhaps it could help a little if you would resize the pics for your next one with all that automatic resizing going on it needs quite some time for the site to load in this context to see two pics of your clock was perhaps a little odd too	negative

thank you for clearing that up i felt that it was ok to review an old topic as stated rather than just go ahead and start a new one a shame that this set as all other batman sets have gone up so highly in value but still all things considering general after market lego price hikes it is still a wonderfull set even with its market value today that is if you can ignore the mrsp	positive
i bought this off ebay while not having been collecting space as a child it was mainly wild west and city i have decided upon reading kdogs mtron bar brawl mania strip in his space comic to buy as many mtron sets and figures i could find except i got distracted and bought some different sets as well to start off with heres a picture of the box heres a general shot showing the entire set a front view the buggy another shot of the buggy without the minifig the flyer the flyer without the minifig mtron crate with some equipment and hoses i dont know the use of the hoses though  the cockpit open the cockpit closed with the crew the magnetic crane another shot of the crane rear view with hatch open one of the side slots that can carry either the buggy or the flyer top view of this excellent vehicle excellent for getting spyrius or blacktron out of your way  final shot excellent set one of the biggest space ground vehicles and one of the best sets made by lego undoubtably better than its newer counterpart the mt101 armored drilling unit a great addition to any collection and has a lot of cool neat features that make it have a lot of playability simply excellent five out of five	positive
great review of a great set i always figured the hoses were welding torches attached to jetpacks yeah as the whole thing had the vibe of a mobile repair center much like many of my favorite sets this one has a base of simple bricks and plates and then from that solid foundation the rest is built out to be decorative or have the action features this gives sets a very solid feel as demonstrated in this set the first snowspeeder and galaxy explorer the mm armored drilling unit has a more technic base giving it a less solid appearance and though i like the set that jet that luanches from the back is horrible partially because of the useless orange containment things the mega core has a nifty crane instead of a big useless jet tohst	positive
thanks for those wonderful pictures and congrats i think buying this on ebay was a good decision i have no mtron sets at all but i like the mcm very much its just a wonderfully big set with many nice detials lots of playing possibilities i wish i had it too	positive
fun review thanks kinda sad to think that with tlcs recent ban on magnets in their products well never see an mtron revival 	neutral
fluyt on may 28 2008 0156 pm said since when is that the new train couplings have magnets only with a special casing youre right i should have clarified  its the old loose magnets that apparently are being discontinued not all magnets altogether as you noted the new train couplings still have magnets but they appear to be permanently attached to a fairly large housing which i guess will prevent kids from eating them but the old mtron round magnet pieces are presumably discontinued	neutral
sinner on may 28 2008 1135 pm said care to explain why personally i think that aside from the colour scheme the new one is far better why suspension more enclosed cockpits buglike appearence i suppose its a matter of personal opinion though i just thought that the mt101 was very skeletal and couldnt really steer that well although i do like it also the mcm has a better design in my view as the wheels are closer together making it look a lot more tankish than the mt101 also space in the rear isnt wasted on having a shuttle cp5670 on may 29 2008 0252 am said as for the hosejetpack things i always assumed that they were either welding torches or flamethrowers take your pick hmm well they dont have much else to defend themselves with and i think in the uk the mcm was marketed as a mobile recovery center fluyt on may 29 2008 0356 am said anyways mtron is one of the greatest space factions with mega core magnetiser as my favourite set of these guys even though i do not own it  the only thing that bothers me is the lack of reachable controls for the minifigs to drive their vehicles but iirc it is the same with a lot of other spacesets as well yeah they could have used the normal levers instead of the pronged two piece things at the front of the cockpit but there is certainly a lot to mod joebot on may 29 2008 0425 am said but the old mtron round magnet pieces are presumably discontinued shoot guess that bl and ebay are the only sources now thanks for your input	neutral
this does look alot better than the new mm drilling tank great work	positive
zero1312 on may 29 2008 0822 am said thanks for the review maybe i can pick one off ebay yeah i got this for only like 19 pounds pretty cheap its a great set cp5670 on may 29 2008 0855 am said it looks like youre right about the old magnets i got a few off pab two months ago but they no longer have them i guess i should grab some while theyre still widely available on bricklink as they can be useful in a number of situations on a side note one interesting thing about this set is that it seemingly had two uscanada names mega core magnetizer and multi core magnetizer brickset lugnet and all the other sites ive seen call it mega but i have some north american catalogs from that time period that call it multi and the box also says multi on it i actually didnt know the mega name at all until many years after the mtron line hmm ive never seen it listed as multi but now i guess it has three names strange that mtron is basically the only space theme that had different names depending on region clonecommando007 on may 29 2008 1011 am said this does look alot better than the new mm drilling tank great work yeah i should take a comparison yet the boxart on the mt101 was pretty cool sinner on may 29 2008 1229 pm said thanks for an answer ill shut up now so we can focus on your review its okay i have a question kind of not related to the review is there still a space reviewmoc index now that docking bay has closed thanks again	neutral
i really enjoyed the nostalgia review of the mtron mega core magnetizer this was the first wave of space lego i didnt get when i was a kid though i remember looking at this set in the shops i stopped with blacktron1 and space police i look forward to more reviews once your ebay stuff arrives cheers isc	positive
asuka on may 30 2008 0217 am said of course i don´t want to offend some technic lovers and although i always was more the system kind of guy why can´t they just use some technic beams with studs at least thats because of cost the older beams needed a four sided mold and the newer ones need only a two lego do seem to be using both types more as of late though asuka on may 30 2008 0217 am said i grew up with just imagine with pictures of alternative models on the box and i don´t think it´s that easy especially for younger kids to mod some of these terrific blownup sets like it once was with sets like this one here implosion off ive never heard an official word perhaps i should raise a topic but i think that they dont show them any more because it became a support nightmare what do i mean i bet tlg was tired of letters and calls saying timmy cant make this model shown on the box can you send instructions and the extra parts i know that for some recent models they were designed but not published how do i know this the creator said so	neutral

you know i like many had doubts about these sets when they were first mentioned but ive decided i want the whole line now this set is the créme de la créme just beautifully stunning that is a great review sveltecorps you have gone into fantastic detail and description of all the elements really it is this review that has persuaded me to buy this set i blame you the minifigs are great the vehicles are better and the truck and interior is awesome the few minor draw backs are far outweighed by the attention to detail and the many unique and cool elements used in this set and printed pieces that is even better great job you have obviously put a tremendous effort in making this review and i for one definitely appreciate it i am looking forward to these sets being available in new zealand	positive

you really are an awesome set reviewer sveltecorps thanks very much for this sweet review so indepth and detailed that is one sweet vehicle its got three of my favourite things treads orange and big slicey blades thanks again peace	positive
these new sets are just totally offthewall radical d its the little details like the scoops on the blades and the alternate alien energy source lego didnt even have to include those but they did that show lego are really getting back into their groove this year the ability to add power functions is just so cool as well im going to pickup the creator monster dino set for the electronics when the sales hit as svelte has suggested a very entertaining review just like the agents mobile command center one d	positive
nice review the power functions is a nice idea and i ownder if it will appear in any other new sets regarless if i get this i decided to just to get what ever looks good in the shops from now on  im defianltey picking up some of the white visors off bricklink	neutral
this should be reported to the news 	neutral
well i guess its nice that theyre making the story background a little more clear with that jelly plugged into the power cable hmmh both jellies and crystals can be used as power sources think theres a connection both of them are transparent and greenish maybe jellies hatch from crystals like eggs or need them as food or something important like that yay for evil humans	positive
excellent review loving this set i mean come on its a flipping tank awesomeness is written all over this  from all those blades and scoops at the front to the mini rover and yes you can even turn it into a motorized battle tank reminds me of the old technic days when they advertised in the manuals how to hook up the kits with separately sold motors another day another review of an awesome set yes this is sure tlcs year	positive
algernon on jun 5 2008 0203 pm said why is it that agents and star wars get their own news articles but this fantastic set is totally ignored i think maybe theres a bit of star wars excitement on the front page which has probably got a few members frothing with excitement not every review needs to be frontpaged anyway 	neutral
no but this is one of the most anticipated sets of 08	neutral
well title says it the description youll understand later i ordered this off of sh last tuesday and oddly enough its listed on sh as mx81 hypersonic airplane id like to apologize for the random horrible faded pics i took the review outside and the clouds kept shifting changing the lighting and then i had to go inside because it started raining its been raining for a week its raining now as i type this so i foolishly went outside to take pics the front of the box not bad as far as boxes go it features a liftup tab which shows the various functions back of the box still not much to say two manuals i think this is just right not too thick but not too many manuals either oddly enough the box came with a little folded up piece of paper telling us not to mix the bags it comes sorted into 4 bags by the way minifigures the set features 3 normal mm figs 1 normal jellie and one of the new commanders i really like this guy he has a few issues like his hands being stuck sideways and still being hollow but still a great improvement hell make a lovely addition to any halloween moc stickers the set comes with a fairly big dss for the spacecraft pretty normal but i do like the dragon sticker then suprises of suprises a technicolor sticker sheet for the aliens how cool is this huh the tops of the actual stickers are shiny which is hard to see in the pic even the bottom is shiny who said stickers cant be cool the mining craft the little guy is pretty cute and well built my only gripe is that theres nowhere to spin the drill it seems so lifeless without a feature the alien craft youd think a commander would be important enough to have a seatbelt rather than be stabbed with a clip and stuck on the ship like those other grunt aliens i think this thing has some potential shiny stickers different body shape and when you look at those engines this thing could be an alien corvette but then you look at the back pretty bare no flares or anything its a cool little craft but it justlacks the modules these things have some potential as well with some modding they could be pretty cool unfortunetly its pretty boxy there are no engines and the wings are too small the top is pretty nice though the greebles are all right the controls as usual are a sticker pretty spacious mind you the cockpit doesnt stay flush with the body though the front plate underneath it can be easily replaced with a brick to fix that im not gonna comment on this the main body too bad the labratory isnt much of a lab a transred panel and some tray thing are all that compose the lab i was expecting more but true to form this mars mission set has no impressive interior to speak of there is a lot of space though so it shouldnt be hard to mod phew the lab folds up like so pretty simple and would allow access to the lab if there was one and then we have this thing what is it defense laser communications array satellite tv the modules connect like so sorry out of place too bad the pins stick out various pics as you can see this thing has more of those bars than an att commercial there you understand the topic description now  the rear it uses a white city plane wing for thewings when i first saw the prototype pics i thought they slanted downwards that wouldve been really cool ah now to the platform from the position of the drill i think this could be a really cool turret location when i mod it to more military space back to the bars if we had space monkeys theyd love this this set has more bars than a jungle gym  here we see the button that drops the platform pretty clever and its not in the way best of all it really works really well actually good job tlc 2 more bars and a shooter mechanism jeeze this is really setting itself up for a joke a shooter mechanism walks into a bar never mind here we have the handle that allows you to pick it up safely a good idea but its placed waaaay to far back way off the center of balance you have to hold on to it pretty well to keep it angled up though it does stop your hands from getting in the way of the platform ah the platform in action this is really a neat little feature not only can the ship land in a reduced footprint but it also prevents the nice white paint job from getting red dust all over it its centered pretty well too and you dont have to worry about knocking it over just dont shove it back at all here we have the latch when the button on top is pushed this gets pulled inward which pulls out of this hole and allows it to swing neatly down good luck and happy mining again sorry for the lack of inprogress review i wouldve liked to take pics of the mechanism and so on but typical of the mm sets you cant really take it apart well this is really a nice set which can hopefully be upgraded with a better lab with little difficulty some of my military mod plans include strip the lab and install a command center get rid of lots of bars the thing has more bars than alcatraz install some turrets this is a big command ship so why all the forwardfacing weapons itll need some aa defense mod the landing platform to be a troop dropper with installable aa turret mod the cockpit pods to be more aerodymic so thats all folks shall i include one last bar joke	neutral
iron moose on jun 4 2008 0234 am said that certainly feels like an homage to the deep freeze defender which itself feels like an homage to the galaxy commander thats the observation i had when i saw the first pictures of this set online a few months ago i am a proud owner of the 6973 deep freeze defender and 6980 galaxy commander so im looking forward to see how the 7644 stacks up next to them there is a definite lineage here and these sets clearly demonstrate the evolution of lego set design over the years the mx81 may not have the most playability out of all the new mm sets although it has alot from what i can tell but its hard to beat the look of a large sleek space cruiser sitting on your shelf or dresser at least for myself anyhow this is my first post to the forum and hope my welcome wont wear out here anytime soon edited by spacefan 04 june 2008  0643 pm	positive

i dont understand why theres so much negativity this is actually my favorite of the new mm sets the finished look is very sleek and not very gappy at all the deployable landing pad is great and itll make it easy to put on a shelf without taking too much room lots of greebles although i will concede that its just begging to be modded still though im definitely buying this one  it has a really great look to it	positive
thanks for the review i actually quite like this i cant afford it so im not getting too attached to it but in its own way its great its certainly reminiscent of space sets of the past as others have said and the dropdown ramp section is just really cool as an idea you understand sure the lab is a little crap but at least the effort was made sort of  the sheer fact that its so big though really makes me like this theres just something appealing about large spaceships not capital ships just big space ships with lots of guns spacefan on jun 4 2008 1034 pm said anyway i hope were not breaking forum protocol by not discussing the 7644 review of the original poster or that particular set in general hey its no worse than batbrick and i no really it isnt even in the same league	positive
thank you for that nice review mr mandalorian wow somehow it´s almost like classic space´s back indeed it´s a great star ship it looks stream lined original and impressive and even the huge plane wing part looks rather cool and smooth on it it´s equipped at least with some kind of engines on top of the wings and although they´re made with only two a little juniorized parts it´s better than nothing there´s a lab or some sort of engine room with enough space inside to allow one or two mfs to play scotty yeah the two cockpits´re nicely detailed with a cool use of these orange 1x1 round plates and to detach one or all two of them reminds a lot of the playability of the good old space sets it seems even like it´s easy to attach them to some kind of cloud city twinpod car thanks these hinged wings looks like some solid fun to me of course the cockpits aren´t airtight and even this reminds unfortunately of the post blue grey and trans yellow era of cs anyway there´s no real fun without some moding i guess another great advantage of the set´s that it´s not overpacked with shooting things one technic shooter cool in grey and only one trans orange prison pod too well i can surely live with that especially since it´s nicely asymmetrical the drill rover´s very charming a little like a rebuilt oldsmobile convertibe stranded on mars sweet and that platform feature´s plain nifty and well done too very playable and useable for a lot of things hmm recently i complained a lot about the dense use of studless technic beams for the inner structure of vehicles like these exoforce tanks par exemple which makes moding in an economical way pretty frustrating but the beams here´re used in a very proper way it should be fairly easy to mod let´s say the back of that lab section up to perhaps even the cockpits to create a larger airtight area that could be boarded from the platform just to fit this certain spacers need for um realism there´re many more nice details too like that satelite tv thingy and that cylinder with trans blue 2x2 dish for the knob or these cylinders with cones on that handle and that alien craft´s pretty nice and detailed as well like i said before i really feel like classic space´s back	positive

hello all eurobricks members i will be presenting my first review on one of the harry potters set firstly i must emphasize that i am not a very big harry potter fan or owned many harry potter sets for this review i will be highlighting what is the beauty of this small little set and the reasons to own multiple sets of it comments and critics are strongly welcomed this set is featured in the harry potter movie prisoner of azkaban this set is orignally released in 2004 align with the harry potters movie this was actually one of the movie scene where buckbeak the griffin is appeared in the movie the group of students are supposed to be having up close and personal with him however draco decided to disturb our lovely buckbeak enough of this movie synopsis i am sure fans of harry potter will know this better box art featured minifigcreature background scene the scene is a simple garden which had a very good mixture of spare parts for your mocs building on its own there is nothing outstanding about this set except for the griffin you can buy multiple sets for the griffin alone and for draco minifig well you dont need lots of draco but for castle lovers black cap are exceptionally useful at least from my view now i will point out the following why this sets is so great for other reasons hidden cover note that this is the only mechanism which you can find in this set it looks rather simple but quite useful there are some little things hide in it too greens foilage and brown parts needless to say much it offer 3 foilage a green plant 3 brown slopes 2 ideal bricks and 1x1 brown brick for building a tree great for jungle building forest building and etc i am sure there are many builders will look out for these interesting parts it comes with a wizard book owl 2 printed tiles with a spider and stone prints on it the far right seriously i dont find any good use for it can any eb members enlighten me on that gray thing on the right grey parts it comes with a good 10 x 4 green plate useful for adding as a platform some more grey slopes for your mocs there you have it draco encounter with buckbeak comparing with deep forest ambush as you may remembered recently there was an impulse set competition one of my entries which is under the history theme the deep forest ambush was firstly inspired by this set and made an improvement out of it look at the improved tree compared with the orignal summary review playability 410 not much to play with except swooshing around the griffin design 510 too simple and its defintely not related with the movie scene parts 1010 great for parts explained by the review a great deal of green and brown parts price 910 an inexpensive set based on the 2004 pricing overall 710 a must have for all harry potter fans and collectors whom needs a great use of green and brown parts hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine more pictures can be found in my brickshelf when moderated let the potter magic begans edited by whitefang 09 june 2008  0245 pm	neutral
guys thanks for your kind comments i am glad that you have enjoyed this review for this set i think i bought about 7 to 8 sets all for the griffins its used for my griffin riders in my castle collection now the green and brown parts come in very handy for castle mocs too imperialshadows on jun 9 2008 1113 pm said a very nice little review of a pretty nice little set that i wish id bought between 1 and 10 of just for the griffin oh well your review has shown me that its useful for more than just that so maybe ill try to pick one up someday cant have too many black capes books or printed things speaking of which the gray thing is technically a plume like any castle plume except in this case its a feather presumably from the griffin and made from the mold to the old indian feathers in the wild west sets its a case of an old part coming back for a slightly new use in a new colour beyond that the stone print tile is a bundle or rolled up blanket or package depending on where its used i dont think its ever meant to be a stone it was used as a rolled up pack on the back of the star wars speederbikes for example nice pics plenty of useful information id give this review an a thanks for doing it i am very happy that you enjoyed and find my review useful thanks for enlighten me now i know where is the origin of that gray plume i wonder if i can use it to match with my castle knights as its plume in addition i mistook the rolled up pack as the stone print tile why didnt i think of it i must have overlook it and used it as a stone tile instead nevertheless i am glad you have give me some good insights on the parts that i am not familar with sveltecorps on jun 10 2008 1049 am said thanks for the nice review  it was one of the first ones i got when emerging from my dark ages  i bought two of these just for buckbeack  i thought he would make a good statue in a persian temple type moc i also liked the minifig head pumpkin and plant part in bright green  both new pieces to me at the time all in all it was a good castle or forest building set with a nice selection of pieces for rocks grass plants and trees the dark bley plume piece also now appears in the 10185 green grocer set as detailing on the roof of the turret i never thought of using buckbeak as a statue for worship i find this concept very interesting yes i agreed that this set offers new parts at that time personally i pretty like the green plant good for any kind of terrain settings i did not realise that the dark bley plume piece appear in the green grocer thanks for pointing out edited by whitefang 10 june 2008  0339 am	positive
i bought about 5 or 6 of these sets when they were on sale in mid 2006 i still have a few of them laying around unopened i think i payed like under 5 for each and thats a great deal for all the variety of neat parts you get with this set	positive
nice review i like the treemaking pieces the most of this not very expensive set the buckbeak fig is very nice and can bow his head like the horses i was annoyed to get another draco without some other not made figs pansy parkinson for example about the dark bley feathers in the second version of hogwarts there were several of these feathers put in little 1x1 cones like it was a feather to write with it i bought 2 sets of these and when they were for sale i just bought  6 more of it only annoying that i had then even a bigger army of dracos	neutral

heres the 3rd of the whole batch of complete reviews done back in 2006 hope you guys enjoy them so far product 6206 tie interceptor theme star wars no of pieces 212 release date february 2006 rrp sgd3990usd1990 availability lego shophome target toys r us us  europe bricksworld sg legocom said challenge the rebels blasting out of star wars episode vi return of the jedi the tie interceptor is the fastest fighter in the imperial fleet open the cockpit canopy and fold down the instrument panel to put the tie pilot inside and recreate your favorite classic star wars battles includes tie fighter pilot cockpit opens and instrument panel folds down it does seem to have more pieces than the average tie fighter but this is actually cheaper than the 7263 tie fighter of course theres no lightup feature in this set sweat yesh finally a tie interceptor this is probably the most anticipated for all set for all lego tie collectors worldwide since the fighter bomber advanced and even the expanded universe droid fighter had been released by the lego group this set is near movieaccurate since the bottom part of it aint p the cockpit and pylons uses the same design as that of the tie advanced piloted by darth vader except for one minor change that is the aft interior of the cockpit is strengthen this time and this is indeed good news since the older models had a problem of hard hinge and loose brick connection theres no landing gear for this set but it doesnt require it anyway this tie interceptor balances perfectly on its wings standard instruments panel and of course standard imperial pilot the swooshable or play factor of this set is definitely very high just take a look d camera view from own craft camera view from tieadvanced combat simulation of endors battle from the archives no bomber since i started late in recollecting p to conclude for a typical lego fan this set is a 6040 60 due to its good design and for a typical star wars fan this is a mustget the only flaw for this set is the same flaw for any lego set in sg the price doh commentcurrent in 2008 being a starwars fan no being a typical toy collector space is definitely a premium so much so that i turned to lego starwars to sate my appetite for more starwars products when i already have no more display space for the next few nonlego pictures they are the crown of my starfighter collection in 118 scale so just view them for fun eh and no i havent had the chance nor the time to do up a scene of my lego starfighters blowing up spectacularly since the pieces would be very hard to put back hmm then again isnt that what lego is about doh	positive

seeming as there were no reviews of this set in the index i have uploaded mine from jabbas hutt  here is my review for lego set 10178 motorized walking atat because i live in the uk i got this set with 6 free duracell batteries which was great its just twice as expensive as the us heres the basic set that is from the instructions this is the cockpit but please note after i took this photo i realised it was slightly built wrong heres one of the feet in proportion to a minifig to give you a general size this is luke skywalker swinging on a wire trying to destroy the atat i really wish lego didnt make so many lukes because i want differnt minifigs it would also be nice for a thermal detonator piece underneath the atat you can see the shaft that moves the back legs the motor and squeezed in on the righ t the massive battery box a load of cogs that move the legs these are the included figures snowtrooper general maximilian veers atat driverpilot or whatever you want to call him and luke all whithout there wepons please note veers should have a dark stone snowtroooper torso with 4 red and blue badge things not 3 these are the figures with weapons i gave them and the included ones snowtrooper has new style blaster veers has standard light grey pistol like the ones from the old adventure sets atat driver has old style blaster which i call heavy blaster and luke has shiny handle blue light sabre  the shiny blue light sabre was included with the set which is a bonus because i really dont like the grey ones httpwwwbrickshelsc00521jpgjpg this is the switch which is attached to the battery box on either side of the atat underneath the lift up side panels you push the forward to walk forward and backward to walk backwards simple eh  a front veiw with the the panels open here are the drivers controls which are simply a cotrol panel and 2 exoforce robot hands which are joystick things seen in the film if you look closley the almost useless carry handle this is the weird back piece looking down the atat from the back where you can see the the battery box and switch troops decending from ropes and cables and vader leading the assult for this i hadnt got any more imps so i used clones pilots i now have a whole load more snowtroopers solo and chewie sabotaging more troops to squash rebel scum huzahh a very bad picture of everyone packed up inside the size incomparison to its predecessor overall i would give this set 910 because it should come with more snowtroopers or it could be and endor version with loads of strormies and scout troopers aswell as this you can really sit any one down because of the battery box but i stilll find space to put all the shown figures on this review in the interior as you can see on the above image the chains and ropes are hanging down a bit tjis set is now limited to 5 per customer in the uk and now no longer comes with free batteries the walking on this is a bit wonky and dosent really walk like they do in the film as it moves two legs at a time i am currently attaching a motor to the head to make it move independently	negative
kimt on jun 19 2008 0342 pm said great review indexing it as i write this how come you think the ctt is the atats predecessor do you mean the motorized atat or atats in general i think this is a great set and i am very fond of mine its one of the few sw sets of mine that is on parade at all times most are packed away in the attic kimt btw its not alone the older version of the atat is keeping it company the body looks exactly like it	neutral
i mean by the clone turbo tank turned into the atat i think in the films when they changed all there technology and vehicles when they became the empire	neutral
smithboy on jun 20 2008 0601 pm said i doubt that the atat was used in the clone wars well you never know maby veers was around then just because it was used in the clone wars dosent mean that veers didnt design it to wookiepedia	neutral

thanks for the review kimt  it comes at a confusing time you can take off the top disk and lift it like the millennium falcon from the top now i actually dont like this set that much it takes about 5 hours and 15 minutes to build if you do it in one go but the repeating sections makes this built the most tedious i have experienced it has way too many holes from which you can see the colorful skeleton and is overpriced compared to the older 10030 isd i remember thinking it was too expensive when it was 50 off at sh even the snowspeeder was kewler to less than half the price	negative
hmmm ive still got this set and i must say i think you did a good job of reviewing it but overall i hate the set probably the worst ucs set so far apart from the naboo fighter but that hardly even counts as ucs from my experience unless you really really want it and have nothing better to spent your  on in that case go for it but in my case it was a very repetitive build and final model was quite well bland not must variety to it if you know what i meanfor the price i would really reccomend the ucs star destroyer because thats a much better story	negative
thanks for the review eh honestly i though this was awful ever since i first saw the pictures to me an incomplete grey ball doesnt really work as a special ucs kit for the sole reason that its boring extremely so now the new death star playset is a whole different story they should have done that in the first place edited by grevious 24 june 2008  0912 pm	negative

thanks for the review bearing in mind that the whole point of this set is to get a cheap troll warrior i actually quite like it the cart isnt brilliant but for 13 pieces its not that bad the troll fig is great as always and i guess the rats are always nice to get not so much in real life though the sets that contain the trolls have a fairly solid number each i mean tower raid has three but nevertheless i think i may have to pick up a few of these whitefang on jul 2 2008 0249 pm said in addition the flick missile really works use a little bit of force from your finger and flick it the missile will fly well it certainly does not impress me at all with such playing feature the trolls hands are going to get quite sore then arent they	positive

its a good review but you forgot another thing the troll needs a shiled like they used to in the 2007 castle line the sets always had shields for the minifigs and it could be better if it was 300 instead of 350 but yes it is a good impulse great army builder	positive
very good nice to see how its all played out nice review	positive
hey your review is great as usual as for the set itself  well its an impulse set after all  small and cheap nothing special well the rat is special hehe for me the rat is the most interesting in the set cause i dont have a rat i dont have a troll warrior either but im not very interested	neutral
guys thanks for your kind comments it seemed most of us here love this impulse set mainly to build army guess i am a little bit too critic in my review i was expecting a little bit more nevertheless i intend to buy multiple sets of this and build on my orc armies and split them into different battalions this is indeed one of the better ways to acquire orcs wilhelm screamer on jul 3 2008 1130 am said i got two of these in the mail today and was so eager to do a review of it thanks for saving me the work opps i was eager to do a review as well when i bought these sets i hope you enjoyed reading this comprehensive review nikola bathory on jul 3 2008 0408 pm said hey your review is great as usual as for the set itself  well its an impulse set after all  small and cheap nothing special well the rat is special hehe for me the rat is the most interesting in the set cause i dont have a rat i dont have a troll warrior either but im not very interested give the new theme a chance i feel tlg have made an effort to revive certain elements that are present in past castle themes although it is not as good as the past but it is certainly better than the recent castle themes shoc on jul 4 2008 0100 am said why is mouse friendlier than rat well mouse sounded more friendly because it can associate with tom and jerry but calling it a rat equal calling it a pest its just a matter of putting it in different terms thats all edit instead of posting another post to explain why i used mouse i will write it here tom and jerry is reflected as a cartoon children associate jerry as a mouse since its supposed to be heartwarming and make us laugh in real life there are many different pets we raised one of the possible pets we considered is a mouse mouse are supposed to be shy and friendly creatures that live in harmony while rats lived in packs hunt food in the dark and is widely regarded as a pest in this review i am trying to illustrate rat and associate it with mouse by presenting it in a much friendly approach there is no right or wrong answer its just making use of different words to represent how i feel towards a particular thing edited by whitefang 04 july 2008  0808 am	positive
this is a nice way of building up orc armies but i do wish it was designed like the knight impulse set there you have a minifig enough weapons and armor for two figs and a weapons rack made out of basic pieces add a generic fig from your collection and you have two knights and the pieces from the rack can be easily used in mocs the pieces that make up the siege weapon in the orc impulse are not as easy to use in other creations id rather have seen a orcish weapons rack different from the knights rack but like it using basic elements with a second helmet another weapon the orc armor and a shield to put on it still although not as good as the knight impulse its a nice little set whitefang on jul 4 2008 0343 am said tom and jerry is reflected as a cartoon children associate jerry as a mouse since its supposed to be heartwarming and make us laugh in real life there are many different pets we raised one of the possible pets we considered is a mouse mouse are supposed to be shy and friendly creatures that live in harmony while rats lived in packs hunt food in the dark and is widely regarded as a pest where i come from people keep both as pets however if either are found in the house uninvited they are considered pests and if you look at the chinese zodiac rats are very well thought of and are symbols of prosperity the brick mouse rat	positive

hello all eurobricks members i will be doing a continuation of my impulse set reviews this will be the third review at a go hope everyone of you will find this review useful in a way name coast guard kayak theme lego system  town  city year 2008 pieces 21 minifigs 1 an image of a 5621 coast guard kayak roll roll roll your boat it seemed the coast guard has a kayak of his own roaming in the sea making sure that swimmers will be safe in the beach now i am illustrating him as a life guard instead this set is simply wonderful among the 4 new impulse sets coast guard kayak is the best looking set in my opnion the kayak design is very simple but looks realistic  furthermore if you dont need it to be a coast guard kind of stuff use it as a leisure water spot instead down in the marina i will think any lego citizen will love to have some water spot in their busy life so come down here and wind down with this new sport bits and pieces kayak and the bouy the bouy is very useful to position it at the coast of your water to highlight the boundaries in the sea and warning incoming ships or vessels oh i did not make it tilted purposely there is a white round base which allow it to tilt on both ends useful parts these parts are useful to add on in your city somehow when i see that red cone i can use it as a police stop to inspect vehicles on the road or form a barricade with it the bouy base shape is unique too i like it very much it is great to attached it by the side of the boat as a life bouy the coast guards life vest and helmet are very useful for water activites the life vest was produced in past sets and now it resurfaced again i am glad these vests made their way back a look of him without the life vest summary review playability 7510 fun to play with especially the bouy when you see it moving up and down design 8510 design is simple but straight to the point especially the kayak design price 810 an inexpensive set to get more coast guards and more kayaks overall 8510 a very good set to have in your lego town the kayak is simply so lovely to me hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine comments and critics are strongly welcomed pictures can be found in my brickshelf when moderated	positive

glad you enjoyed viewing the review xenologer on jul 3 2008 0112 pm said the hawk it seems to me lacks a cockpit theres not even a seat to keep the pilot from falling off perhaps it theyd redesigned it to be a backpack jetpack sort of unit using similar pieces itd at least make some sense these are some of the improvements which we can do it ourselves to mod it better i think these are great suggestions otherwise we can add in a white air tank to be included onto the minifig xenologer on jul 3 2008 0112 pm said based on the other mm impluses can we assume this goes for 35usd at that price it seems to me that the astro fighter at 5usd was already a superior impluse set guess id buy one on clearance for the minifig in sh crystal hawk is priced at usd 350 i bought mine at a much expensive price when you compared it with usd i never bought the astro fighter i am supposed that it comes with a little bit more parts and an additional alien fig with it	neutral
thanks for your comments guys i really appericate it brainbox on jul 3 2008 0611 pm said this is quite a nice set actually it evokes some of the design elements of the mx11 while looking different enough to justify me buying it the head on the astronaut is one i like so even better i hadnt realised it was that one actually does 26 pieces make it one of the bigger impulses sets i think i may have to get one if not two imo impulse set total piece count should be 30 or less it will be ideal and more ways to construct a much better impulse sets such as past impulse sets that we came across i may be wrong on the 30 piece count thing but this is how i view impulse sets brainbox on jul 3 2008 0611 pm said plus its called crystal hawk how can that not be considered cool do you know i bought this set mainly because it have such a cool name attached with it crystal hawk i simply fell in love with that name	positive

awsome review dude im proably getting this though the main downfall is there is hardly an inside	neutral
ah great review i have always wanted this set since it came out but with the price i think i will get the mobile command center first this will need serious interior mods like i did with my dino attack chopperpics soon	neutral
thanks for the review sveltecorps i have yet to purchase an agent set but i think that will change shortly i am not a big fan of the stickers but the huge laser gun the unique minifig design and beaucoup transorange pieces have me sold	positive
i know the word secret base but whats this the base is hardly secret with a massive laser gun and wide screen sticking out it looks good lots and lots of orange woo	positive
cool set i got that firearm thing straight away lol i might get a few of these sets and combine into mustafar great review	positive
i didnt exactly know where this belongs the best but i think it fits the best in here cause its somewhat space related i got this nifty little set yesterday from an auction ebay new and sealed i think the rock raiders theme was a great theme and i wish they would have continues id back then but anyway lets see what we got here set nr 4910 name hover scout number of minifigs 1 number of pieces 39 release year 1999 first a picture of the little box  instructions a general overview of the set and here we have the lovely  miss jet yes the minifigures had odfficial names in this theme  the little vehicle and finally the crystal analysis station i like that very much even if its simple but it does a good job and the amount of equipment also is cool thats it little set little review but big fun i can recommend that to everybody its great for the parts and the minifig is lovely gets a 1010 from me	positive
omg iamdeds torso  spoiler oh my god spoiler	positive
excuse me butwhat	neutral
woo rock raiders only the best theme ever thats right possibly even better than castle 07 cheers for the review metalandi hopefully you can inspire others to see the greatness of rock raiders too i love how everything was so simple yet so effective it was loads of fun to play with and build the alternate models when i was younger as well and probably still is  do you plan of doing any other reviews or do you have any other sets rapid rider is another great small one adding a bit of diversity with a waterbased vehicle and you get the bandit minifig or you could get the rock raiders set and get all of our spelunking friends dont make me name them all  or if you want a slightly bigger set loader dozer could be the way to go axles a pretty cool minifig too and you get a rock monster sorry if the last comments were detracting from your review dont think i didnt like it becuase it was great i really hope you can do more oh and yes my torso does come from a female fig peace	positive
great review  man this brings me back i still have like 5 of those rock monsters in response to your statement rock raiders does belong in this forum being everything space related 1 its on an alien planet 2 in the computer games start and in the story yes there was a computer gamemy cousin has it they are in a space ship 3 there are huge alien rock monsters trying to kill them	positive
7663 sith infiltrator year 2007 number of pieces 310 number of minifigs 1 price 2999 usd brickset hello everyone and welcome to my second review on eurobricks the sith infiltrator lets start with a pic of the box shall we as you can see its a limited edition set meaning the fig and set could be worth a lot in the future this set takes about 20 minuets for the seasoned builder an overview of the infiltrator also know as the scimitar as seen in the picture this ship is very sleek with very few studs on top snot studs not on top basically its the cockpit with two wings with two fins on each wing attached to the hull heres a side view of the scimitar very cool looking it lands on two feet in the front while the cockpit rests on the ground rear view the back the outer cockpit is beautiful a printed piece on the back no dreaded sticker sheet dss and a large printed disc on top heres a look at the middle there is a flickfire missile transred cone attach to technic pin on the inner wing a transred lightsaber blade in the back of the hull and a transred lightsaber blade in between the fins on either side all of those lightsaber blades may come in handy hey look the fins open from the wings the fins open due to double hinges on each fin unfortunately you have to hold the ship up in order for the bottom fins to open now lets have a look inside the cockpit to open you lift the back printed part which is attached to the printed disc on top which is attached to a hinge it opens pretty smoothly but is somewhat loose so sometimes it closes on its own also the disc isnt secured well enough to the door and often breaks off even with the smallest movement to it inside there is an elevated control panel and two sliding pieces near the floor this ship also comes with a small speeder bike its very cleverly built and is a really neat addition see that clear disc on the bottom it fits perfectly into the sliding pieces in the cockpit hmm whats this a hidden compartment now this was a very cool idea by tlg a secret compartment found by taking off the top slope of the hull contains darth mauls weapons and tools which include a chrome lightsaber hilt a pair of electrobinouculars and three probe droids a closeup of a probe droid just a plain black minifig head with a black lever on top finally the fig darth maul in the flesh plastic a good fig altogether with a black hood and lightsaber blades taken from the ship he did come with a crisp new black cape packaged in a small white cardboard box but i am currently using it for another fig note that this is a limited edition fig so stock up a comparison pic of the two mauls the 2007 version is on the left and the 1999 version on the right note a few key differences between the two the new one has smaller red tattoos and a smoother torso also the new one has bigger eyes and a more cartoony look maul on the speeder bike of course he fits perfectly in the cockpit wile sitting on the bike and he can reach the controls well thats about it here is the final verdict build 810 easy and fun breaks every once in a while playability 710 this set has many features but is very fragile between the cockpit and hull and between the two cockpit pieces swooshability 110 too fragile to fly around plus the flick fire missiles fall out minifigs 910 a great fig with a chrome hilt and a double sided blade a little cartoony design 710 very clever techniques very sleek but very fragile price 810 fair enough could be a few dollars cheaper overall score 6510 a very sleek ship with clever building and play techniques but very very fragile and shouldnt be picked up off of the shelf too often and with that my review is over but all of yours are not comments and thoughts very welcome edited by jimbutcher 15 september 2008  0259 am indexed	neutral
jimbutcher on jul 10 2008 0944 pm said a hidden compartment now this was a very cool idea by tlg a secret compartment found by taking off the top slope of the hull youre supposed to slide the front of the hull off rather than lift the top piece off	neutral
ill be honest  i dont like this ship at all its one of my least favourite ships in the pt and i have to yet buy either one of those sets i also found it funny that this set was meant to be a walmart exclusive yet never appeared on the shelves at my walmart anyhow thanks for the review	negative
led zeppelin on jul 10 2008 0446 pm said youre supposed to slide the front of the hull off rather than lift the top piece off yeah i was looking at the construction booklet and it reminded me of that i forgot about it but that makes it more fragile	neutral
hey all so i purchased the remaining three agents sets i needed and saw that there was no review up yet for this set heres the first batch of parts and the first instruction bits the mini figures the first small vehicles heres a mistake that i found in the instruction booklet there is no difference between steps 2 and 3 the team inferno boat this is a nice chunky boat that looks fairly heavy duty and evily its nice to see the smooth disks on the bottom that lego seemingly havnt done in recent boatplane sets and the agents submarine this is a nice build aswell nice and long with a few hidden compartments one for missiles a place to put the treasure some final shots of the completed set the spare bits another special mention has to go out to slime face i think he is my favourite ever lego character the detail on his unique torso is brilliant his head is fantastic and his costume just looks great with the black and green plus green is my favourite colour check out the back of his torso with the slime pouring down deep sea quest was £3499 price  910  this is a pretty reasonable price for a fairly substantial set parts  810  a lot of nice bits few nice boats bits and a lot of smooth disk things minifigures  1010 as i said slime face is my favourite lego character and the details brilliant vehicles  810 both very good with some interesting features build  810 a pretty fun build overall  910 its gotta be if just for slime face alone but this really is a great set	positive
im not real fond of slimeface he looks too much like the jokerbombs i was hoping for something newer the slime printing is a nice touch though steve	negative
nice review rezourceman i wanted to see one of this set it seems there isnt much to it other than what it looks like in the official pictures but i may well get it i like slime face	neutral
darthlegois on jul 11 2008 1028 am said color0000ff coughalphateamcough id forgotten about ogels mutant vehicles i guess i meant a bigger cross between the 8636 sub and the big squid from 7775 aquabase invasion  that is such a great design sort of keep the retro feel but make it bigger with the 8636 sub theres really only room for one agent to sit and despite its size theres just a few not amazingly great functions such as the hidden chest and missiles	positive
i cant see the pics over the glare from my awesomeness thanks for the review rez im jealous you got to snag this right away	neutral
nice review thanks tlc is really going allout with the agents theme i wonder if it will last longer than one year unlike other recent oneanddone themes my only real criticism of the theme is those freaking stickers my god look at the size of that dss in this set	positive
great review really thanks i slime face even slimey as my slime sense nice that break jaw is also in it undersigned mowo	neutral
aside from the price i love this set when i saw the prelim pics of agetns i did not like the theme but all the sets are starting to look more attractive now i can see the cool features and details as for this set i really like the badguy boat for some reason and the submarine looks good  i love the dark blue colour	positive
batbrick on jul 19 2008 0953 am said is it impossible or just very hard to mod nothing is impossible to mod probably the easiest part to change would be the front where the missiles are and the treasure chest slides out  you could make a sizeable compartment there however the middle section is so narrow and the end fins are just that  fins  that it might be harder to expand without changing the shape of the sub youll find out soon when yours arrives batbrick on jul 19 2008 0953 am said the octopus sounds great thanks for that is he meant to be on any side im guessing hes a mutant inferno creature about slime face is his head much different to the joker bombs i know he has slime marks on his head are they very apparent its not really clear but since all the other mutants are evil or at least controlled by dr inferno its probably a safe bet the squid is too slime faces head is different to the joker bombs  different eyes and teeth although the smile is similar i guess and the slime marks are much more apparent in the flesh or abs although they dont photograph that way joker bomb face below for contrast	neutral
inertia on jul 21 2008 1229 pm said wow thanks for the review that is one awesome set i think we need some new agents theres so many inferno minifigures now maybe next year theres only 2 infernos out of 8 sets which is pretty good theres way more agent chases and break jaws i agree though next year hopefully well have some new figs	positive
great review i just thought id comment saying thanks because if i hadnt found this review id of never made an account on eurobricks	neutral
thebrickster on jul 11 2008 1016 pm said yes the extra space was probably for the oxygen tanks on the figs it makes taking them off a lot easier as for the labcontrol center i never had an issue with it being open i think this was just for playability one could always pretend that some sort of invisible force ray closed the side when activated invisible force fieldray that is a very neat idea i dont have much problem with it either was just curious about the design as i am not very familar with classic space i supposed the oxygen tanks is quite big to carry around especially when the vehicle is so cramped these allowance of space makes them much mobile to move about in the vehicle cp5670 on jul 12 2008 0239 am said i just modified mine to make everything fully enclosed great job thanks for sharing and answering the question i posted above i love the way you modify the front and back now i need to find where is the entrance to the mobile command center	neutral
ive always associated this set with 6929 the voyager theyre of the same timeframe and more or less the same style 6927 is without any doubt my favourite ground vehicle of space it was pretty simple but it was such a creative set the stories you could tell with this model g most defenitely in my top 5 of space sets	positive

yay its good to see your kids get to build some stuff too sinner  all through the review i was thinking this was a present  but who actually put it together so im glad the last pic cleared things up as for the set  it looks much bigger than i expected  i think it does make a good sized dollhouse there are a stack of nice pieces in there  cupboards oven transblue 2x5 bricks all the accessories plants flowers food the lightup brick the pink roof slopes  but not enough to justify the aud129 retail price maybe on sale id pick it up and resell the belville figs but david jones hasnt even had a regular 20 off lego sale for the whole of this year that ive seen i think the playful puppy set is a horrendous ripoff for aud20 though i agree with the baby catapult  the range is terrible lego just isnt trying any more is it at least theyve moved on from throwing cats off three storey buildings 2 questions though 1 was it a fun build 2 are those large figs anatomically correct under their froufrou finery if not what the hell are they doing in the second pic whilst baby sylvia explores the oven	neutral

7655 clone battle pack year 2007 number of pieces 58 number of minifigs 4 price 999 usd brickset welcome to my third review on eurobricks i hope you enjoy while at any store that sells lego target walmart tru etc you will notice that the clone battle packs on the shelf are way fewer in number than the droids battle pack as you might guess the clones are way more popular and finding them gets harder and harder as the release date of this set goes farther into the past so stock up alright heres a pic of the box a small box as expected for inexpensive sets like these note the build your army button on the front tlg obviously is encouraging customers to buy multiples and with good reason which will be explained later in this review well lets get straight to it the contents of this set you will notice a speeder bike a gun turret and some clones looking good so far lets have a look at the turret an excellent star wars element to have around especially for mocing it is very cleverly built using a tire guard from city sets for the general shape of the turret mount all you have to do is attach the new mold explained later gun to the 2x1 plate with the center stud and presto i wonder how the clones build these turrets to fast in the middle of battle a rear view with a clone mounted my only gripe about the turret is that you have to take off the gun in order for every clone to have a gun now we move on to the vehicle of the set the speeder bike a rather sleek and good looking bike with some useful pieces on it as well such as the blue cones the megaphones and the engines some say it looks bare without the figs mounted on it but i think it looks just fine the commander drives while a trooper shoots on the back a side view and a rear view my only gripe is the same as the turret you have to remove the back gun for all the clones to have weapons while on foot the back pistol attaches to a 2x2 round studded plate with a technic hole in the middle finnaly here are the new guns this set comes with 1 new blaster rifle and three new pistols it could have included one more rifle for the turret and of course the figs includes 1 yellow commander lovely fig 1 shocktrooper comes with a pair of elctrobinouculars and two regular troopers so clean and white the figs are excellent all that any sw or lego fan should want it could have maybe included one more regular trooper but that might be pushing it thats all for now folks here is the final verdict build 810 extremely easy should take the seasoned builder about 5 minutes to complete a fun build though playability 510 i guess you can get this with the droid battle pack and make them battle but this set has no real play features of its own but it is good for collecting troops and using them for mocs swooshability 910 i guess you can zoom the speeder bike around minifigs 1010 four great figs that should be bought in multiples a great army builder design 1010 a clever turret an awesome speeder and four great clones what more do you need in a 10 dollar set price 810 not bad i suppose but if you calculate a dime for each piece this set should come out to 56 dollars but still billions of these are being sold worldwide and tlg is making a ton of money off of them overall score 9510 a truly memorable set one that will be a favorite for ages to come and very popular a great army builder for a small price plus vehicle and turret with only a few very minor flaws this set is one of the best of star wars and this concludes my review and as always comments are most welcome	positive

7654 droids battle pack year 2007 number of pieces 102 number of minifigs 7 price 999 usd brickset hi everybody and welcome to my fourth review on eurobricks today i will review the droid bttle pack set note this set originally came with four megaphone blasters for each battle droid but i replaced them along with the crooked arms with the new blaster pistols and new twisted arms a picture of the box as it is on the shelves of majorretail stores a small box as expected for inexpensive sets like these note the build your army button on the front tlg obviously is encouraging customers to buy multiples and with good reason which will be explained later in this review an overview of the sets content you can see a droid carrying vehicle a stap and some battle super battle droids a look at the carrier a light tank note the guns on the front the guns and cockpit can turn a little bit left and right from the main body also the guns can move up and down free from the cockpit and check out the cockpit two 2x1 center studded plates side by side for the pilot to stand on now moving on to the stap a small very useful vehicle in the sw universe these are seen frequently in both the movies and games as well as other multimedia the design is very clever using vertical building and a clear stand rear view the guns handlebars can go this far back and finally the figs the figs are very good but very common we havent seen sbds in a while and now instead of metallic blue they are metallic dark grey the worst part of this set is that the battle droids have the old arms and guns while the droids in the mtt and clone pack both of the same year as this have the new ones i wonder why tlg decided to do that again this set originally came with four megaphone blasters for each battle droid but i replaced them along with the crooked arms with the new blaster pistols and new twisted arms so thats about it heres the final verdict build 810 very easy should take the seasoned builder about 510 minutes playability 610 has a few play feature but nothing exciting is good for mocs and army building swooshability 810 i suppose you could fly around the stap minifigs 710 the battle droids are good but very common and the dont come with new arms or guns the sbds are very nice and in a new color all figs are great for army building design 810 the stap was clever but the carrier was a little bulky price 1010 as fair as it gets overall 7510 the figs are great to have and make mocs and armies and the vehicles are pretty cool the carrier is a little lame the main problem with this set is that the bds dont get the new guns or arms so they dont fit in with all the new sets also droids arent as cool as clones but the price is very fair and now my review has ended unfortunately i believe this will be my last review for a long time for two reasons one the remaining sets that arent done according to kimts index i either dont have or are broken or have missing pieces and two my budget is low right now and i wont be able to get the clone wars sets right when they are released so someone will probably beat me to reviewing them too bad because i would love to do an rgs review well as always comments very welcome	positive

hello all eurobricks members and town lovers this is my first classic town review for today i will be featuring the 6641 4wheelin truck which is produced in 1987 for some younger members in eb you might not have encounter such a baby roaming down the streets horning at others with its big massive truck considering this is a 1987 set such a vehicle size is considered big in those days name 4wheelin truck theme lego system  town year 1987 pieces 80 minifigs 1 price usd650 an image of a 6641 4wheelin truck hello everyone why the name 4wheelin truck it is because this truck is equipped with 4 heavy duty wheels which is considered big among other small vehicles in classic town please take note most of the vehicles that are produced in classic town era are 4studs wide this truck is no exception meet the driver and his truck this truck has a very good combinations of different colors that are common for most town vehicles it made used of blue white and red as its primary combinations i find that this combinations is quite soothing to its eyes especially the blue bricks in addition the minifig torso is superb the driver must be a great fan of this vehicle i realised most truck drivers in the classic town era wear this most of the time i wonder if its some kind of an organization front view there is 2 red doors coupled with the truck to enable the driver to get in properly this vehicle is considered big in the 1980s however if you compared it with the current city vehicles this truck certainly will not outsize the current designs please take note of the wheels the wheels are pretty different i dont remember seeing these wheels in many other vehicles maybe some members can help me on this most of the classic town vehicles have a window frame on top which is known as a sunroof in this set this feature is also included furthermore the vehicle frame has a simple mechanism which all town lovers love it is to lift it up and place their driver in and out the seat most importantly you do not have to take off the entire window frame just to put in the driver different angles of the 4wheelin truck snot technique back 20 years ago lego had been experimenting with snot technique you can see that the back looks very neat without the studs in addition it can be quite useful to place a minifig on top of it or throw some baggage for some quick getaway summary review playability 810 great addition to your town collection design 8510 very good design i love 4studs truck at least it is able to occupy one side of the lane price 910 an inexpensive set based on the 1987 pricing overall 8510 a must have for all classic town lovers we have been complaining for more wider range of vehicle i gave it a 4 based on my review score card what about yours hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine pictures can be found in my brickshelf when moderated edited by whitefang 13 july 2008  1208 pm	positive

whitefang on jul 13 2008 1125 am said the wheels are pretty different i dont remember seeing these wheels in many other vehicles maybe some members can help me on this first of all another great review thanks for doing these as for the wheels these were primarily technic wheels but did find their way into some other models in white i can only find a handful of minifig sets that they are included with theres half a dozen space sets but apart from the 4wheelin truck the only other town set appears to be the 6524 blizzard blazer tractor with snow plough the wheels were also in a train set called 4549 road  rail hauler where they were the wheels on a big forklift cheers rog	neutral
love this set nice review also i had the set in my hands a few times but never bought it though i drooled at it i remember i guess i didnt get pocket money at that time it was not that common around europe in the 80s i guess so better to say that no one bought it for me a few years later i got the safari truck which is also really sweet i like the colors of this model and the detail of it the minifig is really classic made only for this set appears in some later train sets as well and shows the exact image of the truck on the shirt including the motor piece one of the most detailed and loveliest little sets from a sweet era of legoland city ps voted o for outstanding edited by zzz 14 july 2008  0950 am	positive
thanks everyone glad that you guys enjoyed this review rriggs on jul 13 2008 0806 pm said as for the wheels these were primarily technic wheels but did find their way into some other models in white i can only find a handful of minifig sets that they are included with theres half a dozen space sets but apart from the 4wheelin truck the only other town set appears to be the 6524 blizzard blazer tractor with snow plough the wheels were also in a train set called 4549 road  rail hauler where they were the wheels on a big forklift i never realised that i supposed these wheels is one of the earliest technic parts appeared in system sets zzz on jul 14 2008 0549 pm said minifig is really classic made only for this set appears in some later train sets as well and shows the exact image of the truck on the shirt including the motor piece one of the most detailed and loveliest little sets from a sweet era of legoland city i will show it to you in a few days time that this minifig torso does not only appear in this set in fact i am quite fond of this lovely torso with its symbolic truck printed on it snefroe on jul 14 2008 0737 pm said hmmm i probably would not have bought this as a kid in 1987 unless i had money to spare or the shop had no other set from space or castle the two other big lines in 1987 and no better set in the town section i think its a great parts pack but the model itself does not look very attractive i never really liked those wheels honestly theyre from the basic sets mostly and they work pretty well in those but im just not a fan the roof on the other hand was very popular and the blue modified bricks at the front were quite rare in those days but generally speaking this was not the star of 1987 i wouldnt agreed less this set is a good to have and is defintely not the main highlights in 1987 this is actually a great addon to your classic town vehicle collections after seeing so many typical police cars ambulance fire engine and etc i need more variety of civillan vehicles roaming down the streets	neutral

i had saw the earlier image just now it looks very nice just to share some information with you guys vestas an global company which is an expert in wind energy this is a tieup with lego i feel its an illustration on how our world will benefit by applying and believing its technology to make use of reuseable natural resources hinckley is it ok for me to share a picture or two on the vestas exhibition that happened few months ago in singapore dont worry its not anything related directly to the vestas promo wind power plant	positive

filefolders on jul 14 2008 0729 pm said whats so great about the cottage i do agree that the generator and van are teh pwnzorz i think the great thing about the cottage is its very reminiscent of classic holiday home type houses that lego used to make like this one from the late 80s which a lot of people me included believe lego need to make more of	positive
i now found pics too thats absolutely  after 10188 town plan this is the best city set ever i really like the neat landscape with the little hill there are a bench and some flowers on it too  and this brilliant cottage  great idea with that power function that the wind mill turns and then enable the lights of the cottage  concerning the city theme i must say in the last time tlg comes up with one great surprise after the other does anyone know where and when itll be available this year i think  otherwise there wouldnt be already pics would they and how much itll cost i think about 70 euros what do you think i only hope that itll be available in germany too otherwise i would be really if i am not able to get it since it is a must for every city and environment fan klausdieter edited by klausdieter 14 july 2008  0649 pm	neutral

update i will be merging reviews as they go idle this is now the dino attack review thread what jays not doing viking reviews nope i think christopher110 took care of those just fine instead i have brought you what is most possibly the highestanticipated set of the year  d  the t1 typhoon and i gotta say  dinos apart its actually really cool the dinos lets get the worst over with yes those are all the parts in that dino	negative
the base of the propeller it wobbles a bit but doesnt fall off very sturdy right side of the rear propeller and the left and better side the tail it uses construction similar to the xwings nose but on a larger scale definitely cool a very neat part of the copter the guns are constructed so that  they turn without turning the cockpit the interior is rather blase though	positive
another of my favorite parts  landing gear this is the front section  and it retracts unlike most ships with landing gear this does not retract without effort coughxwingcough very sleek the back landing gear  and again smooth retraction gotta love it final score 8410 parts 810 figs 1010 dinos 210 copter 910 value 710 dont buy if  you can wait for vikings  you dont like any set with stickers  youre not a space fan buy if  youre a space fan  you dont mind stickersdont apply them  youre like to create cool figures overall i think it was worth the price even at 605 pieces however id suggest buying vikings even considering this well hope this review unexpected as it was  helped someone out there until next time bloody jay	positive
mr legobildur on jul 24 2005 0935 pm said as unexpected as it was this was very helpful  two questions though 1 is the front green rubber missle a traditional launchable missle or does it have another firing mechanism 2 concerning the guns on the side are they fixed in one postition or does it have any functions 3 why did you decide to buy this set just curious 1 oh i overlooked that didnt i in response its an upsidedown launcher so the switch is on the underside so no no special mechanism 2 the gatling guns can be raised but not turned 3 i found it in toys r us and was after a few of the figs but after seeing the box up close and personal decided what the heck its a good break from vikings d	neutral
great review jay  tks a lot  i am not that of the big fan of the copter due to its proportions  but i admit its really asome looking better as i expected od the best are those mfs  they are truly awsome  i wiil but some of the smaller sets just for the figs hehe too bad that my favorite  your second best  dont come in the smallers sets   are you going to review the other sets as well  that could be cool 	positive
thanks bloodyjay another brilliant review i really like the helicopter though i hate the stickers it seem like there are a lot of it it wont stop me from buying it too bad that when will the dino line arrive in singapore    guess ive have to wait for the meanwhile	positive
that looks like a really great set although i dont think id have anywhere to put it i dont think ill ever be able to get the set anyway since it doesnt come out over here	positive
does anyone have photos of the ones being released in europe id like to compare the ones here in the us to the ones in europe	neutral
no there arent any pictures yet	neutral
photos are not available but basically it is guns chains ropes crates	neutral
i guess well have to wait for the photos officially announced by lego the dino attack line is going to be made available in europe in october 2005 edit check out the official dino attack site here	neutral
yeah i picked up another one i really liked the chopper lets cut straight to the chase dinos first the worst of course these things are so horrible they dont deserve more than one photo theyre rubbery one piece and the only things that remotely indicate that theyre made by lego are the holes on the bottom of their feet theyre unrealistic to an extreme unmatched by even the previously reviewed dinos in that they are waaaaaaaay too thin one is pink and theyre all grinning fig one interesting thing to note is that this one has the same torso as the ironmasked dude in the chopper not his own barearms torso pic for the sake of comparison now i dont consider this fig as good as the others because the other heads are useful for vikings and assorted castletype people but this has sunglasses all in all youll probably find it useful but i dont still great torso for special ops stuff hummer those headlights  while stickers yes all prints are again stickers although there are much less than the chopper  are great pieces i can see using them as furnace covers or stove burners the windshieldhood area not much to say about this one drivers side my question when this is brought to europe will the steering wheel switch sides  seriously though i love that little steering wheel piece more than i love taffy and im a man who enjoys his taffy left side in its entirety  and the right side view through the right side  no seat here couldve done with another fig to fill the nonexistant seat as well	positive
mr legobildur on jul 25 2005 1053 pm said sorry for the double post but i just had another question in mind how longhighwide is this badass copter including rotors have have heard of as long as 25 inches for the length but is this true or is it just an exaggeration 25 long and the rotors are 10 long each making it 20 wide hope that helps	neutral
i love this set and i wish i thought of the bridge piece idea the only part i dont like is the lift thanks for the great review metalandi on jul 18 2008 0653 pm said edit oh damn i forgot to write review in the topic title can a mod please add this thanks done	positive
thebrickster on jul 18 2008 0235 pm said excellent review metalandi its always great to see early pictures of new sets this set really reminds me of an oil rig and could probably be easily modified as one if one wanted an alternate model the two components that i like most are the boat crane and the control room but other sections are pretty slick as well are those printed pieces in the control room or stickers im really starting to gain an appreciation for these new coast guard sets theyve come a long way over the years httpwwwmajhostcguard09setjpg 575 coast guard station released 1978 i picked up the control boat  tower 7739 a few weeks ago but havent opened it yet in any case thanks for taking the time to review this set and share it over eb first thanks to all your great response for my review im glad you like this set aswell as it comes to stickers the tiles ant slopes in the control room are printed pieces the rest as coast guard logo patterns and so on are stickers i forgot to make a photo of the sticker sheet unfortunately	neutral
thanks for the great review im loving this set a lot  it looks well designed and the helicopter is awesome plus i love the new worker figure with the beard quote i agree this is a great set  one of the best of the cg line for sure way better than the boat set with the tower on the bionicle baseplate i wouldnt say that at all  true this base is bigger but the other set was well designed as well  plus the included boat is wonderful	positive

brickster strikes again with another awesome review ah one of the few hospital related kits lego made wasnt this the first hospital with modern minifigs because i seem to remember seeing an even older hospital online that had the armless faceless figs regardless this would be great as a little doctors office in someones town layout  although the vehicle is a little silly and that eye chart sticker has to be the coolest decal ever quote maybe a tfol well it sure isnt me i personally love older kits even though im only a teen i like a lot of the newer sets a bit more than some of the classic stuff but i have always agreed that the 70s and 80s were an extremely high point in legos time even though i dont really own any kits from the period edited by grevious 19 july 2008  0505 pm	positive
rriggs on jul 20 2008 1058 pm said the definition of a paramedic is someone who assists physicians in providing medical care i think in more modern times a paramedic is generally thought of as a more qualified and experienced ambulance technician but the dictionary definition would seem to fit with the lego model quite well rriggs thanks for clearing it up actually i did not check it with the dictionary thanks for giving a clear definition for paramedic	neutral

thanks for all of your encouraging comments i am glad most of you love to view our classic reviews do stay out for more upcoming exciting classic town reviews i appericiate greatly by all of your words there are many outstanding reviews from brickster as well especially those classic vintage lego sets that i had never seen before except browsing it in brickset therefore i will encourage eb members to take some time off to view these truly wonderful classic reviews trust me it shall be an eye opening experience for each and everyone of you whom had never seen classic town in such an up close personal experience before lasse d on jul 19 2008 1222 am said this is one of my favorite town vehicles from the old time and for one specific reason the truck is on the guys shirt it didnt matter that the color was wrong or the hook was missing i thought it was awesome beyond imagination for some reason the torso is just lovely i felt the 6641 4 wheelin truck is almost identical with the torso except for the front color combination click onto the picture for an instant review bernddasbrot on jul 19 2008 0247 am said btw the 6350 pizza to go van looks soooo cute yes that cute pizza van appeared for a reason	neutral
45 ive had this set since i was young never understood why a tow truck needed to be an offroader maybe it was used to tow the other offroad vehicles the suspension made the truck too tall to tow some cars so i often took the hook out and use the truck as just an great offroad truck like 6672 which also had the suspension wheels other tow truck sets better filled their roles better but that doesnt diminish this set at all whitefang on jul 18 2008 0919 am said i think it looks really out of proportion no for 25odd years this vehicle was perfectly proportioned with all others in the towncity line its all these new 6 and 8 and 20 wide vehicles that are ignoring convention and making it look out of proportion granted speed racer sets are more of their own line but 6660 is smaller than most of the cars produced in the last few years	positive
cheers for taking the time to put together this review whitefang considering the year of release of this set i love it would still fit in nicely in any city	positive
i think we only got shell stations in europe in the 80s never got this one but it looks like a typical lego gas station  once again i just dont know how you were able to keep stickers and prints in such a great condition i am sooooo jealous the tires of the cars are a problem though it was difficult and painful to put them off the wheel and back on later the black hat g i would have looooooved to have that when i was a boy	negative
i much prefer the shell version of that station which had the full awning over the roadway and the special road plate with the extra lane to pull into to fill er up	neutral
great review of a classic set man this is sure a wondeful kit even today the level of detail is astounding for the time and the whole kit is really cute you know i honestly dont get why some people have complained about the city gas stations figure count  the majority of lego gas stations had no more than three figures  including this one and the wonderful gas and wash express which i actually own i also dont get why people complain about the stickers so much  because even older kits often had a lot personally i think stickers are okay because printed pieces cant be used in as many places if the stickers are really specialized	positive
excellent review its nice to see review of old sets that i dont own i hope to see many more was this released under the esso name int the uk	positive
brickster you need your own sticky review section i love looking at all of these old sets as i have said before you take me back to a much simpler time thank you and on to the set i love this gas station lego really needs to look to its past on some of these sets for the time the level of detail is great i wish i still had this one in one piece as well	positive

ok minus ten for the placeholder but plus about ten million for the review this set is just amazing its really earned its colors and im sure no classic space fan can complain even snefroe  i didnt know it had the tilting function for the drill sh is so pathetic with its pictures and they really missed this amazing function the detachable ship is so cute its almost classic space in its design major thumbs up to tlc hell make it a hug even	positive

i dont like mars mission sets but this one is just spectacular it is beautiful i must have this set even if it means selling my kidney i only have one mars mission set the etx alien mothership assault which is okay but this set blows my mind two thumbs up	positive
sweet review metalandi this set always looked a bit too busy for my liking i guess i just didnt expect to see a set so tall after seeing your review though it is growing on me i like all the play features and at the very least its a great parts pack two things im confused about though in this pic is that dragon being used as a swing set and i dont get why the area where the witch casts her spells on the second floor is green green in castle means grass or forestmen  and having grass on the second floor of a building is just weird i understand that its modular and thus it would make sense if it were placed on the ground but dark grey would make just as much sense and would look much better than the green there imo anyway im just fussy thanks again for the cool review will we be seeing any more peace	negative
i love the reviews of older sets that i never had also tiny thing but you said it has 7 minifigs but the group shots only include 6 the last guy isnt shown until the very end	neutral
i thoroughly enjoyed your review metalandi thank you especially for taking photos of all the contraptions and detailing exactly how they work as a member of classiccastle the census always seemed to be that fright knights were a class 410 or 610 but as sandy stated above it is one of the closest you can get to an evil faction by todays standards the contraptions seen here are much much more sophisticated and well thought out and are definitely missing in 2007s kings castle siege i enjoy the design of this castle much more even if the towers are taller simply because the design in the kings castle siege left builders with an empty space right in the courtyard without even a base plate and its nearly impossible to get your hands in and play in the enclosed space why would anyone unless youre simply posing figs and even that was difficult this castle instead had a variety of trap doors and surprises so despite the varied colors used here its not that hard to realize that the designers for this castle really took time to think things out and tried to make the castle enjoyable for the children that will play with it whereas our 2007 castle was strictly built to give kids the impression of an enormous magnificant castle with little to nothing inside its like comparing beauty 2007 to brains this castle edited by legobear 20 july 2008  0132 am	positive
wow what a cool castle and set in general i had no idea that this set existed long dark ages thanks to you metalandi for such a great review the figures look really nice and the set is full of lots of little trinkets  details traps etc i have already had a look on ebay for this set looks like a great set for parts too i give the review 455 evil witches cheers isc	positive
well that the bricks look new comes from that they are new i got this set new and unopened	neutral
good review  the photo from above shows off the scale of the castle much better than the box photo i was one of those who always thought this set looked lame ever since first seeing it in the catalogue a couple of my siblings had smaller bat lordfright knight sets and enjoyed the accessories and style of the minifigs etc so last year having not only ended my dark ages but done so for some of the rest of my family i got this set off ebay for my sister for christmas i of course had to build it to make sure all parts were there before leaving ebay feedback and ending the transaction first impressions were of how much brick there was to the set as well as really useful large structural elements and to be honest while perhaps a bit childish theres no doubt the style of the minifigs is kinda cute and useful for customs it was really enjoyable building this set and the scale is impressive when built empty spaces notwithstanding but hey lego has always had buildings with no back etc  just use your imagination and enjoy the access to playspace offered the traps etc are neat and more like the kind of action features modern sets come with i for one am in favour of these for kids they are fun and i think for builders they give ideas cause they are often done with minimal parts or impact on the set design anyways needless to say my sister loved the set indeed shes currently rebuilding it for the second time if i see it as cheap again i will pick up one for myself i got the first one at €30 incl postage i believe	positive
ahh i remember how badly i wanted that set when it was new oh well definitely one of the most original castles if not the most i actually liked how the 1st floor was made into a throne room the tower looks pretty impressive too of course the castle has a flagrant flaw  the walls on the sides are open i also think it lacks in the minifig count though that is understandable for a castle with a dragon quote the fright knights are probably the closest you can get for an evil human castle faction totally agreed	positive
quite the topic bump but dang what a cool set and so tall this is the kind of sets i had as a kid but i dont remember this one im jealouss	positive
this is a great set and a great review  thanks for doing these i remember my brother getting this set i got the police station 6384 on the same day truly classic sets  its a shame that i dont have them anymore although i do have the two immediate descendants of the sets cheers rog	positive
i have a slightly different version of this set and i must say it is great boy to these reviews bring back memories thanks	positive

i´m glad you are reviewing 4digit sets now brickster thebrickster on jul 20 2008 0714 pm said this set is one of my favorite fire stations that offers a great amount of playability this pretty sums it up the firestation was one of the few sets in my childhood i owned and was not classic space i especially liked the roller doors this was one of the first sets they came with in the late 80´s i sold it to my nephew darn i really regret it when i asked him a couple of years ago if he still owned it and i could buy it back he also had made cash out of it i gave it a 4 there is always room for improvement like the helipad mentioned so it can´t be a 5 in my opinion take off you rose coloured glasses	positive

guys thanks for all of your wonderful and encouraging comments towards this set this was one of my most favourite set in the late 1980s and i am glad to restore it somehow with a small little part missing which could not be that hard to replace bernddasbrot on jul 22 2008 1206 am said but this review induced me to get over this humiliation from my childhood   and check ebay for the 6358 bernd i am glad reviews like these mananged to change your perception towards this set honestly this is a very good set to pass by and i hope i had highlight the key features in this set hope you will have an easy time getting it from ebay or bricklink rriggs on jul 22 2008 1231 am said great classic firemen and  in your version  a suspiciously blue fire extinguisher good job by spotting the replacement part which is hiding among them thats why i show the orignal image lord of pies on jul 22 2008 1234 am said i cant help but feel thought that these reviews are being churned out to quickly you should leave a gap i am being flooded with all these great reviews you should really take some time off and sit in front of the town and trains forum looking through at your childhood memories where classic reviews like this are released in this forum i am leaving some gaps in between my reviews now i supposed brickster will slow down soon captain green hair on jul 22 2008 0207 am said this definitly is a nice set i think this was also the first set to use that white basket cgh you are absolutely right this is the first set that made use of the white basket component in fact there is only 2 sets in the entire lego theme which have make used of the white basket it is the 6477 which is released in 2000 i am quite surprised after 13 years they are able to produced it again thebrickster on jul 22 2008 1010 am said what an awesome little set i really like this engine but dont remember seeing it during the late 80s it must have been out during my dark ages i love the basketsection for the firemen equally nice is the fire hose which extends a good length the color combination of red with white and the trans blue windshield looks goos as well this is a great engine and one that would look perfect in a classic tabletown  and its 4studs wide very nice review whitefang i look forward to seeing more of your classic town reviews you shared the same sentiments as i do its a pity that set was released during the dark age of yours on the other hand these sets are my childhood sets which i grew up with more classic town reviews all the way edit this is my 1000th eurobricks post since i joined it has been another great milestone for me in eurobricks edited by whitefang 22 july 2008  0646 am	neutral

guys thanks for all your great comments nikola bathory on jul 22 2008 0657 pm said it offers very good playability and this ladder is so long you can have so much fun with it yes the extended length of the ladder provides great playability klausdieter on jul 25 2008 0301 am said i like it much more than the new one from 2007 since its not that big and juniorized thanks kd i owned the 2007 fire engine as well as this set was not restored back then and i needed a fire engine very badly i managed to restored it somehow and i compared it with the 2007 the older design is still the best osakana on jul 25 2008 0403 am said great set i found only one major fail  this  the hands of robot arms gets easly broken yes this is an interesting finding i remembered when i was a child that robot arms always come out of its own when i fiddle with it i was so annoyed by it and i just kept it there whenever i deployed it for rescue missions grevious on jul 26 2008 0200 am said however i honestly wouldnt consider it the best firetruck ever i actually like the one from 2005 even better  becasue like most of the city vehicles it adds the needed bulk big engines like fire trucks need many of the older kits while awesome were honestly a little too skinny imo grevious i appericate your honest comments and given me your insight towards this set and state a comparison as well i agreed with you that fire engines need to be big and sturdy on the other hand it can be nice to have the fire engine to look slim as well to cut through the traffic easily i am not against with the newer sets it just that part of the reasons which reflected in the review had fufill the basic key factors of a typical fire engine in addition it was my alltime favourite under the firefighting theme	positive

it looks like a really good set and like it is a lot larger than the old one thanks for the review	positive
i just got this set sunday and its so huge that i cant put it anywhere it is pretty sturdy and heavy thats where the handle comes in im pissed that you only get 2 clones rex has to fight on the ground while you need more clones to man the gunscockpit the legs were the most annoying and time consuming part of the build and yea i agree that if tlg had made numbered bags it would have taken only 2 hours rather than 4 edited by ih master 13uilder17 14 october 2008  1138 pm	negative

7676 republic attack gunship number of pieces 1034 number of minifigs 5 price 11999 usd brickset hey everyone i just got the rgs yesterday at tru after i came home from camp i saw all of the topics that i missed and noticed a minireview and a review with one pic so i thought id make a huge shiny new review that has lots of pictures and all of the requirements of kimts index note i did not apply any stickers to it as a personal liking so lets start by looking at the box a shiny clean and futuristic box quite different from the other star wars box designs before this there was so much clone wars merchandise with this font and design in the huge display at the front of my local toys r us store and not just lego it so beautiful with the white and sky blue anyways for some reason the boxes of the new clone wars sets seemed more shiny than usual maybe its because they were just shipped but once you pick up the boxes they will feel really good in your hands despite the fact that only about half of the space in the boxes are used the back of the box the back shows all of the main features of the set plus pictures of the three other clone wars sets meant to be released alongside this one although i did spot the twilight and homing spider droid which were supposed to be released in september or october so on to the gunship built straight from the bags it took me about 4 12 hours with breaks it has an overall great design but somewhat fragile especially when building it the cockpits always fall apart when opened as well as the bubbles on the wings which i will get into more later the color scheme is very well done you can always find the piece youre looking for thanks to the color diversity red dark red lime green ooh blue black tan light bley dark grey yellow and white also split down the middle vertically the ship is almost all symmetrical front side now lets start with the many features that this set is hiding the front has lots of lime green a rare color but more importantly a rotating gun is found on each side they rotate in a pretty wide range although fragile cockpits there are two main cockpits right next to each other not very detailed and are the same and for some reason the whole cockpit element flips up to reveal nothing just the skeleton of the ship probe droid storage above the cockpit lies a plate that can be flipped up to reveal a storage area that holds two of these probe droids at least thats what i think they are hull in this pic two features are hidden mobile command center the first of the two is a mobile command center but essentially just a hover chair it is found by flipping up the two panels on either side of the hull bacta tank the second is the bacta tank found by just sliding it out of the storage area behind the mcc one half of the tank opens so a minifigure can go inside and heal hisher wounds obtained in battle cargo hold now this is probably the main feature for this set the two sliding doors two on each side slide open thanks to a clever technic mechanism not much in here just a gun holder and a place where the passengers wait to be dropped off in battle speeder bike i guess you guys saw it the speeder bike it is found by opening the rear flap the bike is very cleverly designed by using a brown trike body its only a few centimeters shorter than the bike found in the clone battle pack rear gun just a gun similar to the front ones engines huge engines or are they cannons that are really fun to build they really give that cartoon feel to this set missiles in between the engines are two sets of four flickfire missiles bubble cockpits there is one bubble cockpit on each wing that supposedly control the turrets at the front very fragile storage containers two storage containers on each side hold the clone accessories but i wouldnt recommend putting them in there because the antennae can fall out or you might forget about them sticker sheet the dreaded sticker sheet dss has all of the stickers you need for this set unfortunately mine was crunched up i dont like stickers much anyways but i might still apply some note the republic symbol stickers why couldnt tlg just use that printed piece from a few years back also you get to choose between a birdrat thing or a sleeping twielk as your hull decal what theyre for i dont know looks like the movie or show will explain it though minifigs finally the five minifigs of this set they are all great figs including commander cody amazing especially with the gear the orange is nice but i thought he was yellow clone trooper again amazing the gear is great and the new helmet and torso are great all of the clones in the clone wars line have the same heads also you can see the flesh beneath the helmet asaaj ventress not so happy about this one the torso and dark blue legs are cool but the dress is pretty ugly the head is alright but could do without the cartoony face yeah i know its from a cartoon also has purple markings on back of head obiwan kenobi pretty cool besides the face cool hair and torso though plo koon beautiful the true gem of this set in my opinion the head is the same material as kit fistos and the tosro is awesome good for making a custom kiadi mundi well thats about it here is the final verdict build 810 very fun and easy should take the seasoned builder about 4 hours somewhat fragile playability 9510 lots of fun features although some can break easily swooshability 310 i wouldnt recommend flying it around much as you can barely pick it up safely but with two hands gripping the bottom firmly it can be moved around but not spun or swooshed etc minifigs 810 all very great figs especially plo koon but could have included more clone troopers design 7510 some excellent ideas included in here although some spots are very fragile price 710 should have been only 100 usd if not for the new molds plus at tru it was 130 usd overall score 8510 a great set to have for your star wars clone wars collection with some flaws save up for this one so how did you like my review your feedback is much appreciated jimbutcher out edited by jimbutcher 15 september 2008  0306 am

dovchenko on jul 29 2008 0104 am said good but you said that you thought that cody was orange but he turned out to be orange heh i caught that too on topic nice review jimbutcher cant wait to get my hands on one dsr	neutral
swman on jul 29 2008 1033 pm said i really like the new gunship different enough from the old one to be better but similar enough that they dont look totally weird together really like the new minifigs didnt think i would like the new clone troopers at all the accessories are fine i would never use them on the regular clones but to each their own everything is perfect except the rear of troop cabin  seems so flimsy with only 2 2x1 white brick holding everything together 	positive
courleciel on jul 29 2008 1116 pm said whats this thing on the clone at right  thats the flashlight  watch the clone wars trailer and ull know  theres a scene where the clones enter a dark cave with a metal door like jabbas palace in the movies	neutral
jimbutcher finally i had seen something that is worth reading and viewing imho this is your best star wars review i had ever read most importantly it is a complete review which has substance you have my thanks keep up the good job back to the rgs this is the next star wars set i will be getting i cant wait to lay my hands on this set and start building basically how bad this set can be it cant be worse republic gunship is one of the alltime favourites in star wars prequel and ot i cant find any faults except being too expensive due to the licence cost in addition the minifigs are the next big thing seriously i am quite impressed with it on the down side my rating will go up if there is an additional clone trooper instead of one nevertheless this is a must get set no matter what	positive

hey everyone my wife took me to legoland for my birthday just last week we had a fantastic time and it gave me the chance to pick up some of the new castle sets and battlepacks i was really impressed by the sets i bought and decided to do my first review let battle commence set name tower raid set number 7037 price gbp £1999 pieces 364 the models heres a shot of the complete set the set is made up of two models the crown knights tower and the orcs siege tower lets start with the crown knights tower a knight readies himself for battle my favourite model from the set the wicked orcs siege tower please note that for the purposes of display i mounted the orcs banner onto a small cone set on the top platform of the siege tower this doesnt come with the set but saves any orcs having to hold onto it all he time there are other areas it can be placed without using extra parts features both models look great and have excellent features the set as a whole has great playability and seems to have been concieved with a storyline the crown knights have a captured orc within the walls of their tower so the orc army has been sent out to recover him or are they merely after the gold the knights keep horded away the orcs siege tower has a powerful ram  springloaded by the simple arrangement of an elastic band  so pulling it back sends it flying out the front knocking down the wall on the side of the knights tower and releasing the captive orc the floor panels inside the prison are laid over a lip on the inside of the collapsible wall so fall in when theyre not supported theres a string at the rear for extending the boarding ramp and letting a fearsome orc warrior charge across flickfire action the battle heats up as the orcs close in the minifigures the crown knights i really like the crown knights theyre metallic helmets look great and they come with nice accessories the archer has a double printed head with a frightened look on the other side too im not surprised id be frightened when staring over the ramparts at these the orcs these guys really do look the part worthy advesaries to the crown knights the details are superb the printed elements weapons and helmets all set the orcs aside on the battlefield the set comes with a great new molded armour neckpiece too the mighty orc leader looks wicked in his full battlegear overview theres so much to this set its hard not to be impressed the orcs siege engine is a thing of beauty or terror and would look great on any battlefield the crown knights tower although basic looks good and has great playability im a big fan of the new castle knights and fantasy minifigures and the inclusion of five of them is just enough for this set and as a booster to any army at £1999 in the uk this set is well worth the money for content and quality id highly recommmend this set as a musthave purchase for anyone a final shot of the siege tower with a host of orcs ready for battle i hope you enjoyed my review ill be posting my next one for 7040 dwarves mine defender soon	positive
very nice review pedro you beat me to it there was a review done about january but i wanted to have a go just havent opened the box yet great pics and well demonstrated action elements too i rate this as one of the coolest castle sets just for its playability and 5 figures this will def add to my orc army and i may purchase more of this set if they dont release a orc bp keep up the good work	positive

pedro for your first review you have amaze me with your photo session and the strucutre of your review i am very impressed by your high quality pictures you have done an excellent job i love the tower raid very much as it offers high playability with the wall and flooring falling down when the ram hits the wall its quite interesting to play with the mechanism of the ram is very fun to play with as well i will try and pull back and released it to knock a row of soldiers this is one of my favourite sets in castle 2008 well done	positive

thanks for posting the review i’ve been wondering about this set to me it does feel a bit fig light for £50 i’d expect maybe one or two more clones i’m not to sure about the oversized issue it seems to me it’s better to have something a bit to large and have a better level or features than something smaller will less	negative

nice review sadly my dark ages came right before this set was released	neutral
thanks for the review i love these affordable little sets not so affordable now because of the cool figs but im going to have a look on ebay and bricklink right now just in case an army of tan red droids would look great maybe well see some if geonosia appears in the new seires somehow unlikely since the confederacy was defeated at the battle of geonosis i wish i could have bought this set when it came out but id just left university so i was super skint and had to miss all the epii sets now they all cost loads even in used condition at least now there has been a redesign of the gunship and atte from the clone wars series that i can buy	neutral
i always thought this looked liek a cool set with lots of nice and sadly unique pieces unfortunately the only attack of the clones sets i got were the jedi starfighter and yoda vs dooku amazing sets but i would love to have owned them all id never really looked into this set very much so thanks for the review	positive
this is actually one of my favorite star wars sets awesome rare pieces and excellent construction geo figs are a plus too best of all its nice and cheap	positive

this set was on my wanted list for a long time and the sales at sh came just in time i also loved the set and like you only put the stickers on the toll both it looks great on a town layout with almost no modifications the racers are great the trucks and the limo are the best in my oppinion the sticker sheet is huge but ive seen bigger stickers over multiple pieces are the worst the slammers are ok but not great i played with my 4 years old son and we tryed to do what shows in the box the cars passing the toll jumping the ramps and crashing the trucks but it is very difficult to get it right but the crashes are very fun	positive

thanks for the review kim kimt on aug 3 2008 0101 pm said i crossed the german border and bought me this one mainly for the parts what parts were you looking for or just for all of the parts i like the story with your wife the spider is really cool nice photo shots on the grass kim too bad the other alternative builds are kinda odd always creators on	positive

i once bought a entire lego collection including this set however i never have build it seeing this fine review has given me new motivation to do so nice work again skipper	positive
my review gave you motivation to build a set my review was better than i thought	positive
skipper thanks for doing up all these sw reviews it certainly had given me some valuable insights on these sets especially on the snowspeeder it kind of making me regret to pass off this set however i had bought the hoth base instead but had never built it i am just wondering if the snowspeeder had any difference keep up the good work and always strive your best to make each upcoming review a better one	positive
podracer not sure where you got that from i didnt have them out the set with treads is a dino 2010 thing which fits in well after a bit of modding also there are some of the old exoforce sets out there like the fire vulture because i always saw them fitting well with star wars	neutral
nope there is a guy sitting there hes there because on dine 2010 there were no guns like on dino attack so so i made a big gun like on the dino attack set i can see where you got the pod racer idea from now	neutral

i find myself so stupid i didnt bought this set it was 30 euro and i thought that it would be for sale after a half year it was with earlier sw sets also nice review	positive
you have to love the originals well i didnt like the very first snowspeeder so this is the original to me i like it more then the new one that comes with the echo base beter color scheme and more realistic i think i got this set in stores and still love it to this day 	positive

7261 clone turbo tank parts 801 figs 8 price £7000 ouch  edit new box pics added my version of the set comes with a normal mace windu figure and an extra clone trooper also the mace windu barc trooper and jet trooper minifigs were exclusive to the set well you could make the jet trooper yourself  also my set came with 4 extra blasters youll see them later and baby blue vent things instead of trans blue 1manual  box the front of the box the box compared to the motorized atat and the hailfire droid and dwarf spider droid minifgs the back which has pics of the sets functions and alternate models inside the box it has a white cardboard divider probably for strength seeming as the box it so flimsy pretty hefty manual the tt manual compared to the one of the atat ones random shot another random shot poster at the back of the manual 2 general set and minifigs the whole set i accidentally left one of the plates up when i took the pic close up of the figs two battle droids come with blasters and a mini turret the republic from lr jet trooper mace windu not lul barc trooper normal clone the commander look out jet pack maces torso barc trooper legs barc trooper torso he has got to be my favorite clone trooper by tlc the mysterious commander on lsw he was called cody right but he has star corps armour making him commander bly left  normal clone and the look out clone with electro binoculars 3 speeder bike side view of the barc speeder menacingish front view is menasingish a word printed back engine piece one of my shield things came with a crumpled handle it is worse than it looks in the pic 4 the turret the turret it can rotate and point upwards but what if you want to blast all those battle droids that are shorter than the height of the turret blasters add another hinge in that extra hinge in action 5 the tank its to big to get a decent side view pic johnny the cabin boy on the crows nest front 2 seater cockpit the 2 seats better be careful you dont fall off your seat there are some pretty big gaps down the sides back cockpit with dual missile launchers the back seat the engine the large central storage the turret controls fold down to lock into place so it doesnt fall out when driving you can put 2 minifigs up top mace and a clone driving you can see those 4 extra blasters 2 orange at the front of the pic and 2 between the chairs the turret and jet trooper barc trooper on the barc speeder the commander on the lift chair in the back cockpit another shot of that chair 6 overall build 810 quite enjoyable because it incorporates technic and system parts minifigs 910 on a set this size it has quite a lot including some exclusives such as the barc trooper but it could of had a droid or 2 more design 710 way out of scale but generally pretty strong due to the technic frame parts 710 lots of plates and nice minifig parts price 610 justifiable because of the amount of figs in the set playability 710 includes some cis units to fight the clones overall810 needs more droids and it could be bigger i will also probably have a break form reviewing for now seeming as i have just put out a whole load of reviews edited by kimt 09 august 2008  0851 pm indexed as 7261 review 2	positive

an ancient set revived from kimts collection just take a look at the box art this is one classic space minifig pack which deserve high rating and i gave it above average i never had any of these classic space figs before if tlg could ever released this again i am pretty sure i will grab multiple packs without a glimpse you need to build your space agentsastronauts with a little bit of accessories added to explore the unknown space i love this pack very much thanks for sharing	positive

thanks for the review simonjedi this just reaffirms that the v19 is my highest priority this fall behind the rgs of course is that new printed piece a 2 x 2 tile it looks like an excellent detail part for mocing those black pieces used on the landing gear look very bioniclelike if they havent been used before id suspect they will be not that im a bionicle expert or anything it is a shame that this set only includes one clone that seems to be the only drawback to the set everything else looks spot on	positive
nice review simon jedi the v19 has been one of my favourite ships since the release of cwa and this is one of the sets ive been considering most about buying its great to see tlgs treatment of it it looks like no expense was spared making it as aesthetically and functionally accurate as possible  though i think the cockpit windshield could maybe have been slightly bigger but thats just me im sure it looks pretty big compared to other starfighters too did it take a long time to build	positive
great review simonjedi  i really like that you included lots of photos of your build i put together my v19 torrent last night and i was surprised by how heavy the completed ship is it has some real heft once its finished wow it is a really cool ship i was disappointed that the central wing doesnt really lock into place once it flips down it just kind of droops there so i attached a technic pin to the locking arm so it could plug into the 2x4 brick thats on the underside of the starfighter this brick can be seen in your photo of the bottom of the ship overall the build is one of the more confusing that ive seen i had to dismantle and rebuild the first engine after i realized id left out a piece and i kept thinking of the poor 7yearold that gets this set as hisher very first lego set ever	negative
thanks for this excellent review simonjedi  this looks like an awesome set and this is the set i am most looking foward just as well as the separatist spider droid 7681 	positive
rayman on nov 29 2008 1016 pm said yes i believe that the yellow technic is only used for the building however i didnt find it neccessary what a strange step its to hold the wing connectors in the the same place while the wing is being attached	neutral
actually we should care that theres only one fig in it since its kind of expensive though thats my opinion  but the ship is really awesome  its too bad theres not a battlepack that includes clone pilots edited by bricklanta 30 november 2008  0615 am	neutral
daxflame680 on nov 30 2008 0103 am said i built mine today as soon as i tried to put it in attack position the thingy rotates the wrong way and it falls apart what a waste of 55 i suggest you to check again if you put the technic gear in the correct way cause if not than maybe that the problem  also i dont think it is a waste in my opinion the ship is very well designed and is actually pretty strong or at least mine  and the pilot minifig is fantastic even if there is just one of them edited by darkrebellion 30 november 2008  0317 am	positive

having just bought myself a copy of the wonderful metroliner 4558 i felt like doing a review before we start id like to thank greenhair for selling me one of his metroliners for a mere 80 euros granted the motor trainstation and tracks werent included but i did get an extra railcar instead   please note that i have included the fourth wagon in the final pic but that the official set includes just three wagons the metroliner was released in 1992 and was extremely popular amongst lego fans the set a picture of the box showing the set completely pic taken from peeron and one of the minifigs and the accessories as you may notice tlc was extremely generous supplying us with a grand total of 11 minifgs amongst which no less than 4 female minifigs ah the population crisis is finally over we also have three suitcases three cups and a small freight parcel and freight handling thingy normally this would include two bicycles a red and a black one a general side view of the three carriages thanks to greenhair and the brickster and heres one of the extra carriage thanks to greenhair and the brickster moving onto the front and back carriage which are externally identical please note that greenhair changed my back carriages headlights these would be yellow in the normal set all the doors in the entire set are printed pieces sorry for the bad picture quality in this one the interior of the two however is laid out a bit differently the space in the front carriage is occupied by a cockpit or whatever it is called in trains and some space to store your cable connecting the front lights with the engine i can imagine it must get quite cramped and dangerous for the minifig driver with all the cabling further back we have a quite random weird looking engine one part reminded me rather of a jet engine on a commercial airplane the engine is accessible by means of the two side cargo doors at the end of our first carriage we hit what looks like the trains restaurant two tables and no chairs the two middle carriages are identical both have a small sink nicely hidden from the intervening and impolite looks of fellow passengers the carriage further contains two tables and four seats two cargo spaces are nicely tucked away from view below the tables our final carriage has a back cockpit as well but differs from the front carriage in the central cargo area  where our train employee is hard at work earning his lego nickels  and the rear sleeping area the bed is a double one the upper one able to be flipped up for somewhat difficult access to the lower one the train station i could not take photos off since it was not included in the purchase judging from the building plans however i feel it was thrown in at the end just to add something to the set its construction is very simple consisting of a few grey plates on top of a few pillars access is provided by a plate which is connected to the platform with a few hinges there are however two lamp posts a timetable and a few chairs so if you dont like the platform you can still use these parts in a variety of other constructios to end off i took a pic of the complete set with extra wagon and a friendly surprised train driver opening the door and greeting the camera man conclusion being a 90s set the train basically builds itself the entire build cost me two hours and a half i lost quite some time simply admiring the set and was extremely straightforward with no suprises at all but i need to admit it has its charm the exterior is simply amazing the sleekness of the design the colours it matches perfectly i believe however that a width of 8 studs would be more to scale but 6 wide still looks amazing the interior is somewhat simplistic but is easily moddeable with a few extra pieces i basically bought the train as a parts pack the standard set three wagons includes no less than 8 train doors with windows 14 train windows 4 smaller longer ones and 4 freight doors the front and back of course count as unique pieces as well one feature i am displeased with are the printed doors i like printed pieces and while the bluewhitered stripe looks beautiful on the side the printed doors kind of limit mocing capabilities to carriages with a stripe on the side i considered simply removing the stripe but i found out i could just get normal grey ones from bricklink for a fair price i am very pleased with the train but since you already know my opinion feel free to tell us yours of this fabulous set edited by thebrickster 09 july 2009  0151 pm poll question was not multiple choice switched to radio group	positive

oh ruben you lucky so and so this set is one of the most beautful i have ever seen splendid looking build and 11 figures all the same faces like but still you get that old woman pigtail head piece which is just great i thought you meant the monorail set when you told me about this but guess i was wrong dont laugh ive been away from lego for quite some time and for 80 euros it was a real bargain from a great friend really nice review hope this sets brings you years of joy	positive
its great to see someone reviewing a train this set is definately a five lego hasnt made a complete train set like this in a long time the metroliner is really a legend among classic trains the great level of playability and detailing makes it a terrific model specifically i was just noticing the details of the passenger car it has a sink  how cool is that and 11 minifigs  when was the last time lego included 11 figs in a single set a truly outstanding train set thanks for sharing images as ive always wanted to see it upclose it would be awesome if you could share some single side shots of the cars	positive
nice review i collect all metroliner i can i have 3 metroliner and when i can i buy a other  my aim  have the more big metroliner collect in france  in first time  its my favorite set	positive
this is a great review of a great set hairy ruben i voted for outstanding since the only thing you can say about this train set is that it is outstanding it has been the best passenger train in all the time from legos beginning on until now i bought the rereleased version of it in 2003  and i really really do not regret it klausdieter	positive
i also voted outstanding for the simple reason that ive owned this set for a long time but for most of the time its been an anonymous heap of bricks mixed with all the other bricks i have so about a year ago i started rebuilding it and it now sits proudly next to also rebuilt 2150 on my shelf imo its an excellent set best of the 9v passenger trains no doubt and it combines the best of the 80s trains with that of the 90s  its not some futuristic panoramaglassed lowslung train but an honest realisticlooking train that captures many of the features that passenger trains used to and in some cases still have	positive

ok this is the big one the controversial one the one everyone either hates or defends what do i think read on the figs bandana man masked dude dude with shades good figures i miss scarface comes with his torso though which is my favorite the one with the ammo strap across the chest one figure short of the figuretoprice value but we can deal with that the dino the dino its the one that comes with the chopper in green any questions the tank and so it begins i think it looks a lot better in person than on the box the left side good time to mention that the treads run pretty easily and this is a very playable set right side keep an eye on that flap in the center  and we have a folding ladder the back probably the weakest point of the set apart from the dino the turret turned and tilted the mechanism works extremely well and the gun seems to work better than others for some reason or maybe it just seems that way the front of the cockpit im at a loss trying to figure out how those tiny windshields defend them against 40foot mutant tyrannosaurus rexes with radioactive breath laser eyes and what have you anyway another one of those neat steering wheels some viking horns and some stickered control panels oh yeah this set has a good amount of stickers probably around 20ish the back of the cockpit i love the little gun it turns 360 degrees and tilts up oh yeah and those green barrels theyve been using are awesome i can think of tons of uses for them the verdict 7610 playability 9410 pieces 7510 figures 8810 dino 310 value 410 the main downfall of this set is the price i would easily pay 30 for this no questions asked but 40 was a hard sell for me  i gave in merely to see what i would think of it and also to help you guys find out the same this is a great display set and a great play set the pieces are good  lots of nice blay beams used in the construction but the price people thats the killer pick this up only if you have everything else or you find it on clearance and thus ends my dino attack review series hope you enjoyed them until next time bloody jay	neutral
sam89 on aug 5 2005 0133 pm said thanks for the reviews once again it looks like qite a nice set to me although the european version will lose the big gun i like some of the stickers although i wish they were printed and i actually quite like the dinosaur i probably wont get it though the set im most likely to get is the fire hammer yay some one that agrees with me 	positive
dinobot wrote quote youre luckythey sell those for 60 heream i getting ripped off only if you think you are this set isnt too bad in the playability factor its not that great though a better cockpit and some more armour to this treaded monster is needed thanks for another great review bloody jay and i agree that this set isnt worth the price though the ark 170 is still my least favorite badly priced set graynar	negative

emergency evac set  6445 theme town resq year released 1998 piece count 97 minifigs 1 list price 8 usd in 1998 lego introduced a new theme called resq the theme was really a quasicoast guard subtheme of classic town the theme included boats helicopters emergency vehicles and even a water hovercraft most notable was the black and yellow color combination that predominated the sets i only picked up a couple of sets from the theme including this emergency evacuation vehicle that i consider a van i never got into the theme but looking back at these sets i have gained a better appreciation for their value in classic town lets take a look at 6445 in greater detail starting with the box the back of the box providing a few alternate models and similar imagery on the instructions the set includes one small sheet of decals for the van 6445 has one resq minifig that i find pretty nice i like the neon orange reflectors he has a nice printed backside with the word resq prominently displayed this little set includes an abundance of tools a black walkietalkie is not pictured heres the emergency van i like the back section that has a nice winch with turning wheel and a few hooks for tools heres the minifig pulling the grappling hook for some resq action this is my favorite part of this set the van isnt too fancy but has some neat features while i like the blue windshield piece for maybe space sets im not really fond of its use for the van the van has no steering wheel but rather two levers for steering on the top of the vehicle are two emergency alarms and some extra lights the back of the van has a large opening piece that allows wide access to the back section it comfortably fits a long gurneystretcher heres the driver resting on the gurney he should never have tried to pick up the gurney without a 2nd resq minifig and a shot of the back section without the gurney lastly a picture of the complete set final thoughts resq is really a neat theme that has great play value for kids while its not one of my more favorite town subthemes it does offer some nice pieces and an abundance of black and yellow pieces i think a few of the resq sets go nicely with the divers theme released one year earlier in 1997 i had a chance to purchase the largest set of the theme 6479 emergency response center at half the price but passed back in the late 90s id be interested in finding out what other eb members think of this set and the resq theme	positive

i read the visual guide recently and learned a bit more about the twilight i wont get into spoilers but it seems that the ship becomes a sort of endearing family van for the characters which is neat big bulky uncool but it gets you from one place to another if it factors into more than just the 90 minute film i may pick this up it seems that theres room for a lot of personality in this ship once you see the film it is a corellian freighter smuggling spice for the hutts thats cool right	neutral
this is probably the best review ive ever seen why it put the set in context with peoples changing thoughts about it it commented on the box why do such expensive sets have such ordinary boxes the photography was outstanding every issue that a builder could have with it was discussed in a calm and rational manner i have the same issues with technic structured sets and sveltecorps summed up my feelings on this beautifully this was an even handed review so thoughtful finally you gotta love a bit of humour in a review that gardenis brilliant i was probably never going to get this set anyway but it sets a new worlds best standard for reviews i strongly encourage anyone thats going to review a set to have a good look at this to see how well it can be done thanks for the magnificent review	positive
thanks a lot for a very nice and entertaining review your photos were really nice and there have been some reviews lately that have such blurry pics cough cough it was a pleasure to see you can 1 put lego bricks together 2 write a review 3 handle your camera i think this ship is underrated it is really nice i love the playing features like landing gear and back door perhaps just cause i had to get along with so called landing gears in the past that did not work at all 7140 for example and i simply love that there is space inside you said there is not really some cause of the landing gear mechanism but it seems it should be easily fixed do you think there is enough space to put some plates over the landing gear and add some beds kitchen und tv i think this set is so perfect to mod it into a clone wars mobile home your back garden ist just perfect for this i prefer this over the atte and over a 2nd gunship thanks a lot for the review	positive

thanks for the review i for one will get this set i collect and therefore i need it i vision something like this a i buy the set b i built the set c pics for my bs account d set taken apart sad but true its not much but super for parts i agree from what your review showed me that this set is a little too much technic a thing thats been invading our beloved brick built sets in the past years i really have no need for a retractable front or functioning landing gear what i need is a kickass ship with neat design and cool interior the twilight does not offer that look at the size of that thing	negative
having plenty of time on my hands this summer i did some reviews yes im aware this has already been done but ill just do it once more no harm there set 5615 set title the knight price 299 euro  349 usd pieces 21 yes a whole 21 bricks release 2007 the box a neat little box that has a great size for dropping into your shopping cart for once tlg didnt shove the bricks into an oversized cardboard box  the knight this is a great minifig though he looks a little unsatisfiedmight be because his head isnt put on all the way a great army builder fig the only thing that i find a little annoying is that the collar isnt completely rounded it looks too much like an animation and lefthand work the weapon rack yes thumbs up for this plate mail sword shield and jousting helmet plus the spear and open helmet on the fig so many great additions to put into use bring it on pesky skeleton army the all in all verdict a great set a little too expensive compared to the crossbow attack in which one gets 2 knights and a skeleton plus bricks for 549 euro  599 usd but still a great army builder set and the 7090 set does not have the same knight fig kimt	positive
very good set indeed the possibility to alter the knights appearance hugely boosts the value very smart thinking of tlc got one of these so far but if i ever do a castlerelated comic or animation this will be the set i buy tons of	positive
this little bugger brought me back from my dark ages as a movie fan i just couldnt resist the thought of making an animation with living lego skeletons im referring to ray harryhausens work on the classic jason and the argonauts here buying the indy sets stopped me from getting a lot more castle sets though in time i added the final joust the wizard and the impulse knight to my collection as well as buying more unique figs king princess from expensive castle sets off bricklink so yeah great little set two crownies a skeleton and a skeletal horse you just cannot resist that even if you hadnt been buying lego for 5 years as far as im concerned this set is one for the ages i love it	positive
this is an awesome set in my opinion i scraped my crossbows for mocing recently but the set is still an amazing army builder for the price for the sw battlepacks which have 4 minifigs and a cheap vehicle you get 4 knights  this is 2 sets to equal the price of a bp  2 skellys and 2 skelly horses plus 4 crossbows 4 good wheels and some other good dark blue and brown pieces for my ever expanding castle town great buy	positive
ive been waiting to hold this set in my hands for about a year and a half thanks to a silly tlc decision 7009 was not available in italian stores i finally decided to buy it on the net 2x  plus some other sets and those morons at the custom charged me quite a lot after i bought it while waiting for it to arrive i found out it was available in a store in switzerland not far away from home thats for the storytelling as for the set i thought it was great and still think so a good army builder as quite a few sets in the 20072008 castle line and a time traveller 6021 being my first lego castle set ever rating 55 edited by the cobra 13 august 2008  0904 pm	positive

you know what i think this set has charm lots of it im not a big fan of castle having very few sets all of them spanning different nationsarmies but i couldnt resist this set and while not obvious at first it really is backwards compatible with every castle set with a horse in it nonetheless i think this set is great its simple cheap and has charm thats good enough for me plus it has that fantastic grinning knight and the black skeleton horse those just made it better	positive

good review kimt pictures are clear and show each of the pieces in great detail i agree with your comments as well im a bit curious does the knights helm have a hole for plume ive been debating whether to purchase this set or not im not a big fan of horses so ill likely barely use them but i do like the unique minifigs weapon rackweapons and the fact that the divider has a few useful pieces that can be added to other sets however i just dont feel the set is worth 8 when compared to crossbow attack and the knights catapult unless the buyer is really wanting some mounted minifigs luckily amazon just lowered their price of this set from 8 to 6 along with another 20 if using bill me later just in case anyone was also in the same situation i was in at that price its damn well worth it	positive
nice set what a great find this is one thing i think the tlg has forgotten about the creator houses are nice but they are not really geared toward a town them no mini figs cars etc these sets were and that adds so much to a town layout it cant be overlooked i really like this i may have to start my ebay searching thanks hinckley	positive
shoc on aug 13 2008 0319 pm said and to think that this is the same place that got dino sets with guns when we europeans got them without well that is a couple of decades later yes yes in the states horrifying and deplorable violence is fine but drinking and swearing sends kids directly to hell	neutral
great review id give this set an 8 at the least its just a tad too simple for my liking but other than that it looks great while im a 4 wide car man i actually think this car looks rather horrendous the main body seems way too low in comparison with the windows the rare parts however do make up for it hinckley on aug 13 2008 1123 pm said yes yes in the states horrifying and deplorable violence is fine but drinking and swearing sends kids directly to hell somehow i feel like watching south park now  that was such a good episode	neutral
lots of rare parts and a good baseplate sounds great how much did this cost you and where did you get it from	positive
hinckley on aug 13 2008 1110 pm said do you like 2wide cars seriously though anyone i love them just see my brickshelf	neutral
this is my favourite house which i owned during my childhood although its in the crypt but i hope to build it back one day looking at your review makes me so envy of you to own a complete set the baseplate is very unique especially for its stoned pattern classic lego telephone is just so lovely especially when its printed the entire house layout is simple and very nicely constructed in fact the simplicity just showed how much lego could do with such parts there are many nice furnitures included in this set such as the little ovenstove dining table bed and car porch the little black car is a classic example of a true 4studs car i love this house very much and my verdict is a full 5 no doubt about it thanks hinckley for this lovely review	positive
shoc on aug 13 2008 0628 pm said they didnt want to encourage the drinking of alcohol in america but were fine encouraging it in other places maybe thats why my country has such a big problem with binge drinking or maybe not of course who said it had to be wine in the first place i often drink sprite from wine glasses so i feel fancy	neutral
thanks for the wonderful review this is really a beautiful set  i love the old lego houses from the 80s and 90s  they were always very quaint and well designed actually i like the old car designs too but only for their nostalgic value in reality they are very unrealistic and look more like go carts that said not all four wide cars are silly looking  the 4wide cars in these city sets are awesome and fit in with the modern city style great	positive
this is an awesome set man and a great review just too bad it is so rare i voted 5 by the way does anyone know if there is a review for this or other sets that come with a camper perhaps also i was wondering if the creator houses are in scale and could be used with minifigs and such	positive
this would be great for any pirate fan the extraback pack for the soldiers some spare owes for the row boats a female face for a wench and a rather simple raft for that unlucky pirate lost at sea over all a nice set i am a little confused by the dynamite though perhaps an easy way to go fishing or perhaps to clear a rock in the forseen future or is it that she is just a suicide bomber attacking the white house water joke not ment to be tasteless or offensive to those lost in the act of terrosim greatest respect to those who have lost loved ones great review regards cpt pb	positive
good set i laughed at the dynamite but not as much as that axe not many trees on the rapids looks like shes got more than dynamite to cause havoc in the harbour	positive
again a great review whitefang i voted for average the minifig and the accessoríes are excellent  but the raft itself is very poor klausdieter	neutral
glad some of you like this set for the wide variety of good accessories it seemed some are unfavour of the rafts design well i think for an impulse set the rafts design is quite good at least it took care of the color scheme well its just a simple raft for the adventurer to move onto the river stream and throw some dynamitte to blow some obstacles away cpt pegleg blockbeard on aug 14 2008 0329 pm said this would be great for any pirate fan the extraback pack for the soldiers some spare owes for the row boats a female face for a wench and a rather simple raft for that unlucky pirate lost at sea your comments make me feel like i has just done a pirate review instead of an extreme team review	positive
aerial recovery set  6462 theme town resq year released 1998 piece count 201 minifigs 3 list price 25 usd my personal favorite of the resq theme released in 1998 was this helicopter 6462 aerial recovery the set offered a pretty modern helicopter raft threewheeler rescue gurney and net and three figs including a diver the set is actionpacked and offers a high degree of play value starting with the box front side and back front back i always liked the rough oceansea water pictured in the boxart the same image from the front of the box appears on the cover of the instructions but the back of the instructions picture a plain view of the copter one sticker sheet with a few resq stickers is included mainly for the tail section of the helicopter interestingly the set includes three figures one being a diver what i always found strange is the inclusion of an xtreme team diver who has the logo on his torso although its a very nice fig back shot i think this was my first set with a lego threewheeler i always liked it a lot the set includes a yellow raft also found in the divers sets and some scuba gear note the raft has a black piece in its center for lifting up by the helicopter for sea and emergent rescue a gurney can also be lifted by the helicopter the set also includes a net with hook to lift the threewheeler and other items an extra string pulls the net closed heres a shot of the helicopter the front section has a large trans blue piece enclosing the cockpit inside is a printed radar slope a smaller trans blue piece appears a bit higher for access to the middle section of the helicopter andor a small storage area in the middle section is an place for the gurney and a box for storing some of the adventure gear heres a picture showing the gurney on the side is a pulley mechanism that swings to the right when not in use on the opposite side is the winch to raise and lower the grappling hook heres a picture of an open storage box i like the tail section with propeller decal is not shown heres another shot of the copter from a different angle and the final image the entire set final thoughts personally i think this is pretty nice set i like the thought of using the helicopter to rescue people at sea using the working winch extras like the trikethreewheeler and the rescue net make the set even more fun hope you enjoy this resq review	positive
thanks for this review thebrickster i also have this set and think its one of the best helicopters tlg made in the 90s its quite big and has got place for 2 minifigs in the cockpit i also like the fact that theres a victim included in form of the xtreme diver which also is a theme i always loved as a kid do you have any other resq sets left to review it would be an honour for me to also do a review of one or more sets which are left but unfortunately i got not much time at the moment	positive
metalandi on aug 15 2008 0716 am said do you have any other resq sets left to review it would be an honour for me to also do a review of one or more sets which are left thanks metalandi this and the emergency evac set are the only req sets i have i would encourage you to share a review as you have done some very nice reviews	neutral
looks like a nice helicoptor i love the 2 cockpits i love the divers head i really need one of those	positive
thanks for the review brickster i do own this set in its original form the only drawback that i have noted previously is the lack of rotors and the cobraesq of the copter body i wish it had a larger fuselage but i still have it and i still like it despite my criticismwhich i am sure is in my eyes only thanks again brickster i wish i had bought some of the other res q sets but of course i only bought three	neutral
a neat set with lots of accessories but i never liked any of the lego helicopters with long streamlined canopies as they are obviously more influenced by military helicopters and space ships than by real civilian transport helicopters id give it a 3 at best very good and thourough pictorial review though	positive
ive always wanted this set and the hovercraft too bad i never did great set	positive
what exactly makes you feel this set isnt realistic it has got nothing what wouldnt be on a real helicopter imo and for the futuristic design yes it looks modern but it works and actually most of todays real helicopters also dont look like in the 70s anymore	positive
it took quite some time but now im finally continuing with city reviews this one beeing about a really good set of the resq theme and also one of my favourites of this theme it brings a lot of playability and an incredible amount of useful pieces even with only 145 bricks in complete set nr 6451 name river response number of minifigs 3 number of pieces 145 release year 1998 price 20 usd back then when it was new unfortunately i havent got the box of this set anymore but the instructions are still there in good condition we get 3 resq minifigs in this set from which i really love the detailed torsos a shot of the complete set with both the boat and the little car off board the before mentioned car is really really little but it still got enough space to transport 2 minifigs a closeup of the rubber dinghy the speed boat as standalone as already said before this set brings a big count of equipment and accesoires with it which is really good for a set this size in the middle section of the boat there is enough space for a minifig to sit in and put on his diving equipment and last but not least a shot from the whole set wirh everything attached at the front section you can see a wench which also adds a lot to the set when i got this set back in the day i was really happy about it and for sure spent a lot of tie playing with it because of its great features as the wench in the front of the boat or the car the boat can transport i hope you like my little review stay tuned for more in the next days edit i forgot the poll can sombody add it please i dont know how to do or if it is possible to do that myself edited by metalandi 15 august 2008  0359 pm	positive
wow i loved this set i still have it actually in pieces though i took it apart quite soon after i got it then managed to lose the instruction manual	positive
if you still have all the parts try to rebuild it youll see that its a great feeling	positive
nice review i collect castle too and the ghost isnt really rare i have one too but its not really found anymore so it would be a good thing to keep it anyway great review edited by mammymarf 15 august 2008  0848 pm	neutral
about the rarest one up there is that black ninja i only have one ninja and he is dark grey i also have five samurai the witch may be fairly rare but i am not sure i didnt really collect much in the fright knight era	neutral
looks great and the figures up there are old and kinda rare i dont really like fright knights though so i probably wont get this set	neutral
this was a cool set i thoght of it as i was building the post plane	positive
the building is great and detailed with a few mods it could be added to my castle town i dont really like the plane though seems kind of abstract not really good in my opinion but i bet it would be easy to mod to look better	positive
one of the best in my humble opinion as far as i know it was never released in the uk so the only reason i managed to get my hands on it was on a family holiday to the us i think they’d only recently opened the lego store in disney arguable the best feature is that it seems to fit into a wide selection of themes is it a airstrip in the middle of nowhere is it next to a only mining town that’s not deserted the possibilities are rather open and that’s truly great	positive
no yoda was released in no less than 34 sets ok so i remembered wrong i just have plenty yodas and one is more than enough for the set list click here thanks for pointing that out	neutral
oky wan kenobi on aug 18 2008 0241 pm said wasnt this the only yoda that was ever released except for the one in the dagobahxwing set sure he is not the best fig with the unmovable legs and all but still its yoda edit im pretty sure we got a yoda in the wookiee catamaran set from revenge of the sith runs to check brickset yep theres a yoda in that set as well but the jedi duel is the only reasonably priced set with the green forceguru nevermind looks like a couple of other members already covered yodas availability in other sets back on topic great review and a real blast from the past i never did get this set just didnt care for the speederbike or the weird piece of equipment thanks for explaining that its supposed to be used to forcejump  spin yoda all over the place i never knew thats what it was for anyway wish i had known yoda and dooku were going to be impossible to get later i mayve picked this set up just for the minifigs edited by bamaker 18 august 2008  1039 pm	neutral
i missed out on this set but it looks pretty good imo thanks for clearing up what that thing was i thought it was something they flung at eachother in the movie i like the lightsaber also but why did they stop making chrome ones	neutral
great review kimt at that time it was still in my dark age and i hated myself not to get this set earlier this is quite inexpensive and you are able to get two greatest characters especially count dooku the minifigs are excellent especially the unique design of count dookus lightsaber i have no problem with the speedbike as it looks quite alright to me as for the elevation of yodas jump adds some playabilty but that does not work well for me nevertheless the main attractive factor is count dooku and i have to rate it a 5 i never own a yoda except for the magnet version	positive

it took a long time but now here it is the review of the xtreme team set 6584 extreme team challenge thebrickster asked me a few weeks ago to do this since he unfortunately never owned this great set so here we go first i have to say that i really love this late 90s town theme and i wish there would have been produced more sets this is the only one i own well beside that i also still have 6572 wind runners but the car is missing anyway lets face the facts and let the pictures speak for themselves subtheme xtreme team set nr 6584 name extreme team challenge number of minifigs 4 number of pieces 354 release year 1998 lets start off with a few quick shots of the box  instructions inside of the box we got some ideas for alternative models on the backside the same ones are also on the backside of the instructions instructions heres an overall view of this huge set we get 4 minifigs each with different heads and color patterns which i really like and also a good amount of equipment for them lets move on with the cool vehicles there are 3  completely different ones in this set first is the neat little trike next the not less neat 4wheeled offroadthing dont know whats it called really  and finally the huge monster truck i love the chrome sidepipes and the wench with the hook in the back which adds a lot of playability oh i almost forgot our brave adventurers also have got a raft to ride the wild mountain waters now lets focus on the many details of the mountain base we got a bridge over troubled waters but be aware its very unstable love the wood patterns on the yellow 1x6 tiles on a corner a camera is mounted to document the wild life for the evenings we also got a little campfire down by the river sits a grey falcon and watches the guys on their challenges whats that seems not very safe to be honestbe aware when you pass by these rocks cause it will collapse lets move up again where the tent is placed inside is plenty of space to take a rest for the figs and to store their equipment but i think they should have built the tent on another place cause the ground isnt very good there when you pull the mechanism a trap door opens will the guys all come back home safe and not injured you decide all in all this is a really great set ome may say it is a bit juniorized because of the baseplate but it really isnt its got a lot of playability and some rare parts the biggest beeing the baseplate which is only available in this set i hope you liked my review let me know your opinions edited by metalandi 23 august 2008  1256 pm	positive
excellent review metalandi i really think this looks like a fun set i esp love the mountain bridge and baseplate it has adventure fun written all over it thanks for taking the time to review this set ive always seen it in pictures but never closeup	positive
cool set i like the tent and monster truck the most	positive
hello all eurobricks members and classic town lovers  editors note to mark the celebration of classic town this set which is released in 1994 and rereleased as a legend in 2002 pizza to go review is dedicated to classic towns opening cermony and members such as hinckley brickster imperialshadows sinner and many others whom have contributed to the final success of classic town thank you so much for inviting me to be part of this wonderful project and i wish all the best to the success of classic town i urge everyone of you to check out classic town and take alook at the cool stuff we have done  today i will be doing up a review on pizza to go set this outlet is one of the most favourite eatery for any lego citizens living in their town when they are driving on the road they are sure to look out pizzeria signage they offer the best pizza in town no one in town can resist the delicious aroma of pizza coming out from the red chimney let us find out why is this shop so popular among so many lego citizens and was one of the famous sets that is rereleased under the legend theme pizza to go is my favourite set of all time i believed there is no other pizza outlet lying around in any lego city apart pizzeria it seemed there are the sole outlet that is selling pizza for many years this set was rereleased in 2002 and it is part of the legend theme this is one of the few sets that are highly demanded to be brought back by many fans of lego around the world i owned the 6350 any members whom had owned both sets before is there any difference between these two because when i searched through peeron it shown 144 pieces instead of 194 pieces for the 1994 set name pizza to go theme lego system  town year 1994 rerelease 2002 pieces 194 minifigs 3 an image of a 6350 pizza to go let the delivery begins pizza to go is the regular pizza outlet that sells nothing but pizza they deliever pizza to every household in town with their trusty delivery van walkin are welcomed too there is a stand for customers to dine in their pizza quickly before making their way to their next destination in my opnon no town can ever survive without the pizza tradition devoted pizzeria staff every outlet comes with 3 dedicated staff making sure that operations will run smoothly on the left we will have the pizza boy whom is wearing the regular blue dungarees and its white cap i wonder who is that boy on the middle we will have the pizza girl she looks like any typical sweet girl in town that the boys will look at she is wearing a suntop strapless on her she reminded me of one person though i think her name is called alice taking a careful look i wonder if imperialshadows is the pizza boy back then without that black patch on its left eye on another note this minifigure was my favourite female minifigures are very uncommon back then i am glad i have this figure adding to my town population on the right we will have the hardworking chef preparing the pizzas in the oven he wears the regular white chef outfit but he wear a grey pants instead of the usual fullwhite outfit in most resturants such as breezeway cafe 6376 lets take a closer look at the pizza boys van this van is very very small looking and very fuel efficient it is able to cut lanes very fast due to its small size the pizza van is made up of 4studs wide design no doors by the side however in this vehicle i think the doors is not a must to be included in this design our pizza boy will need to leave vehicle pretty fast and ensuring that the pizza delivery is on time common mechanism this van has the regular rooftop that can be lifted up to place the pizza boy into the driver seat there is a sun roof on its top which enable him to let him have some sunlight from above the logo on the side of it is actually a transparent sticker which have the pizzeria itallian logo and a tasty looking pizza on both sides of its van i like that sticker very much mine looks quite worn out over time if its a printed piece it will be a terrific bonus nevertheless i can still accept the sticker our pizza van can deliever up to 2 pizza at a go at every trip 2 piping hot pizza will be stored at the back of the van the pizza is fitted in perfectly in each compartment furthermore the white window shutter is terrific in this design you dont see this kind of design anymore i think i have not seen much delivery vans on the street anymore too base of the van from the base you can see that it is using of the regular red car base that is common in most 4studs vehicle design in fact this car base served as a foundation for its vehicle design back of pizzeria alice and the chef will be showing you around at the back of the kitchen there is an oven on the left a water tap and a holder for the oar stick looks pretty empty right look below for a surprise my favourite feature this oven can be used to heat up 2 pizzas at a go now i understand why this set is named pizza to go i have been using their slogan unknowingly this feature is superb nice now we know that the pizza is prepared from the outlet instead of using delivery van to collect it from a factory alice what are you waiting for help the chef quickly pizzeria the signage sure looks big from far and catches their attention easily too with its pleasnt looking design as you have already noticed this is made up of sticker i dont mind for this set it contains sticker sometimes i do hope they can give us spare sticker for us to change after a long period of time distinct red chimney this is the front of the oven and that is where the smoke comes out using only bricks to construct this is simply wonderful i like the use of their white bricks to construct the wall layout and a combination of red parts especially on the top i like the look of this very much another picture on its side printed parts in this set you will get a total of 5 pizzas and i believed no other sets offer so many pizza you can placed up to 4 pizzas in the van and oven alice will be carrying the last pizza around the green and red round dish is a printed part most exclusive part in 635010036 the most unique and important printed parts that is only exclusive in this set its at the front of the pizza van it is none other but the pizzeria logo standing at the front of the delivery van forgotten to take a picture of this piece took it from peeron different views of pizza to go outlet another bright sunday day in pizza to go summary review playability 1010 a lot of playing by doing up the pizza process from preparing to delivery design 9510 outstanding design with great use of bricks i like the structure of it very much price 9510 an inexpensive set based on the 1994 pricing it comes with 3 minifigs shop a van and a exclusive printed piece overall 9710 i am not trying to be bias in fact this set is absoultely filled with minimum flaws look at my review again if you are not satisfied with it or tell me what you dont like i gave it a 5 based on my review score card what about yours hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine comments and critics are strongly welcomed pictures can be found in my brickshelfwhen moderated	positive
easily one of the best town sets ever and pretty expensive for its size too iswas it that rare i hope i still have all the pieces from mine unfortunately my stickers are in pretty bad shape took them off because i needed the bricks stupid stickers covering multiple parts  only downside to this set the design is simple yet so detailed and the pizza van looks great 55	positive
i rate it a full 5 too and i wish lego would make a set like this in 2010 a town needs pizza edit dont always trust peeron sometimes they miss some pieces and sometimes they just cant count them edited by the cobra 24 august 2008  1141 am	positive

indexed allright hi everybody again today im gonna review the biggest set of the resq subtheme 6479 emergency response center with this one i think the reviews of all the resq sets are complete now and while im in a reviewing mode right now i thought id bring that up this set hast got many nice aspects and also some very rare pieces and comes with a wonderful amount of vehicles including a speedboat a tow truck a helicopter and a trike which can pull a little boat so sit down get your popcorn and beer were off to stormy weather at the coast subtheme resq set nr 6479 name emergency response center number of minifigs 5 number of pieces 420 release year 1998 unfortunately i dont have many of the boxes of my resq sets anymore so ill start right off with the instructions this time on the backside there is no alternate model as usual this time but only a different shot of the whole set next a general overview sorry about the slightly bad picture quality on some pics this time originally this set has 5 minfigs which all are really nice but the guy who drives the tow truck has been lost in the flood heres a picture of the missing fig lets move on to the vehicles we have something for the water the ground and the air in this set first the great tow truck i love the mechanism with the hooks in the back next on da speedboat at the rear its got a stretcher and a wench which adds a lot of playability if theres a a little accident near the coast the trike comes to appearance for more complicated stuff we have a little helicopter i broke the rotating piece at the top yesterday ouch   no space for a victim you say well not really but the helicopter also got a wench with a hook in the back now it comes to the station itself at the docks a neat life belt sign is mounted remember at this time there werent real ones as today a little more right an equipment holder is placed with various tools on the front and fire fighter equip at the back at the very front a little lighttower secures the shelter i havent quite found out what this thing is supposed to be maybe somebody knows another equipment holder this time with all the stuff you need for diving more equipment and even more we come to the hear piece of the station the control room with lots of buttons and scrrens last but not least a quick shot of all the accesoires and tools that you get which really is an amazing amount this set might have a few junioriced pieces as the big window in the front or the briedge on the roof but that doesnt matter because there is nearly one other set in which you get so much rare pieces and such an overwhelming amount of accesoires so i can recommend that for everybody who is a piecesfanatic not to forget the playability the great figs and the in my opinion very good color scheme once again thanks for taking the time reading and looking at my review i hope you liked it edited by thebrickster 31 december 2009  0919 pm	positive
do you mean this one httpwwwbricksetaspxset29621  i would also like to get that alone for the fact that its the only resq set with a female fig	neutral
i have this set and its pretty nice i love the resq theme in general i think that tow truck is easily the highlight of this set and is probably the best such vehicle ive seen in any city set the other vehicles are also great the base itself is lacking though as it basically consists of one room that doesnt even have side walls it does include a cool 3x6 computer sticker and a vast array of minifig tools and equipment though i have some plans to modify the building and make it larger but have never gotten around to doing it	positive
there are very few late 90s or early 00s sets worth ever having and i wish i had this one with its futuristic look and yes that tow truck too oh yeah heaps of equipment  its not over junorised there is still plenty of building in it thanks and have a happy new year metalandi 	positive

baby i will like to take a moment to said outstanding piece of review for your first attempt you have done well with the pictures and its flow i have to admit that i love this fighter tank very much the downside of it which is overpriced and two clone troopers do not really justify the purchase well if i have the spare cash i will defintely get one of this keep it up	positive

i received this set with a 25 gift card so it was a great buy it follow with a similar build to the 2007 trucks but has a few improvements of course the name of the set could have been a bit more creative and yes this was an academy review set name truck and forklift number 7733 pieces 343 theme city year released 2008 price 2500 usd 1999 gbp 2400 euro 1box now the box follows a design similar to most other city sets it has the set information and photo of the set on the front sorry for it getting cut off i will remake it now the back of the box shows what each bag builds bag 1 is for the forklift bag 2 is for the cab and bags 3 and 4 are for the containers it also has the sets features 2contents the instructions there are 2 books included with the set one for the forklift and one for the truck minifigure1 the first minifig you build is a simple cargo worker interestingnew parts here we have some interesting and new parts they include a yellow seat a 1x2 plate with clips and a 1x4 slope 3the build cargo1 the first cargo palette has a few crates on it i really like the sticker on the small box forklift the forklift is a very fun extra to build and it is probably the best forklift that we have had so far it is very realistic and is very strong cargo2 the next piece of cargo is some octan barrels on a meter i am not sure what it is supposed to be but it is still a nice addition to the set minifgure2 the second minifigure is a classic driver with sunglasses and a coffee mug very nice new piece this is a very nice new piece that is included in the set a hollow canopy i believe it is also in white with the police mobile command station truck now anyone who has had one of the lego city harbor sets from last year then you will probably find this build to be very similar mostly in the cab part of the truck the trucks build is very solid and very realistic i sense ths will bring the ratings up quite a bit mystery cargo for some time specualtion has been going around what exactly is this it seems like nuero poison i am very happy with those 2x2 cylinders in transyellow in fact you can join in and guess what it may be in this topic containers the first container is built to hold one palette it fits onto the truck it produces a very pleasing result and has a better look to it than the containers from last year had the second container has the ability to hold two palettes and has a design similar to the first then you build on the wheels the back ones have beautiful mudflaps finshed set  parts 1010 lots of useful pieces great colors and some very cool new pieces minifigs 810 i would have liked another but it was 25 so i guess its okay price per part 1010 almost 350 pieces for 25  playability 810 forklifts are always fun and there are lots of things to do with this set overall 3640 90 a this is truley an outstanding set and it will make a great addition to anyones collection mocers would aslo like this due to the fact that it has some really nice parts it has a great build and utilizes some awesome new techniques it also has details something you might look for in a set highly recommended hope everyone enjoyed the review if you have any pic requests questions etc please ask i look forward to hearing your comments and the judges comments as well 7733 peeroncom 7733 bricklink catalog 7733 shop at home	positive
metalandi on aug 27 2008 0326 pm said thanksfor this review i also got this set recently and im very happy about it i live the design of these new trucks and the forklift is also great not to forget the good amount of cargo btw i think the mysterious cargo only are normal fuel barrels thanks normail fuel would be in those octan barrels	positive
kimt on aug 27 2008 0500 pm said hmmgood question lets hope our reviewer can help us out here and i can the set is exclusive to lego brand retail stores lego sh and toys r us only	neutral
nice review vbbn i stumbled upon your yellow seat as well didn´t you have one already or what made you think it´s new the big letdown on this set is the big canopy i would have preferred single bricks for that and for this truck there is no real need for a hollow canopy  it could as well have been made of solid bricks maybe we get another set with different use of the canopy this is one of the reasons i didn´t buy it so far and i´m especially not interested in another forklift i have plenty of those i agree it´s the best one we have seen so far though	positive
what that looks like a walker an imperial walker no€ theme space blacktron i set name alienator set number 6876 number of pieces 82 figures1 released 1988 list price £99 it seem no source online has the price peeroncom bricklinkcom as always lets have a look at the box first as i€™m luck to own a boxed version of this set walking across a planet with a grid pattern sky the back shows a great selection of alternative models after opening the box we find a single instruction booklet inside the instruction booklet now we come to the man in the black visor the mark i blacktron and black and industrial he look in my opinion i think he probably has the second best lego space torso before the focus group decided they needed to be brighter now turning to the walker itself it€™s a simple build which i don€™t think even i with my great skills for messing up could get wrong the final unit is built in three key parts the command pod which is attached to the body by two pins at the back the walker legs this is pure design genius simply built easy to replicate and no fancy parts the top section which open to reveal the blacktrons hightech tools time to put the entire set together i think you€™ll agree it looks great for such a simple build looking like you could take on the universe a side view of the finished product a frontal view of the alienator what the hell how did that take down an atat this is one of my all time favourite lego space sets actually i didn€™t have it predark age and only recently bought one what attracted me to it was an old boxed set but since then i€™ve discovered a set that i wished i€™d owned long ago the rating system figures 810 i love the dark industrial space look parts 710 yes it may be nearly all black with some yellow highlights but is have a good range and they fit to make several great models fun fun fun 810 it walks well and it€™s a great set it has a large number of possible mods design 1010 it€™s ingenious the walking mechanism is so simple and yet so good i can€™t fault it price 10 while i could tell you how much i paid i was luck on ebay so this remains a question mark grand total 3340 reduced top level due to lack of price knowledge conclusion a set which in my opinion showcases what lego was about in the 1980€™s the set has an excellent design ethic and looks great with very limited parts it retains great action and functionality twinned with the great main model you€™re shown that there are a number of other great models you can make with the same parts this set is what it€™s all about for me i€™m very glad i bought outside my normal theme when i saw this actually on the strength of this set i recently order 6894 blacktron invader and can€™t wait to get it and see if it lives up to the alienator	neutral
i loved all of these walker sets it was such a smart technique i made one myself with what i had ahhh good times thanks for the great review	positive
the ywing is the work horse of the rebel alliance it’s well armed and heavily armoured but you’ll need it because you’ll be moving like a sleepy hut – general rieekan set name ywing starfighter set number 7658 number of pieces 454 figures2 released 2007 list price £3999 lets us begin with the box the front shows it in all it’s swooshing glory httptdyorgukimages765802jpg the back shows some of the many features of the set and also others you might like to buy in the star wars range after opening the box we find a single instruction booklet now we come to an important aspect of any star wars set the figure here we’re provided with an anomalous rebel pilot and his faithful r5 droid the pilot comes with the fairly standard lego star wars nonhero helmet printing what’s he going to do with the blaster taken on the entire empire one of the more interesting parts is the assembly of the engine which if like me you don’t pay enough attention to the instructions when building you can end up getting wrong the key detail i got wrong just before fitting the last engine if we look carefully on the side we can see a missile launcher i didn’t think torpedoes or concussion missiles were fired from there but i may be wrong after fitting the engine the models looks like this in all it’s glory manning one of the alliance’s fighters not so ready to take on the empire was he so overall we have a well designed model which is in my opinion far superior to the original we were offered with darth vader way back when lego star wars was new this ywing is sleek and looks great in my opinion the firing missiles are also a great touch the rating system figures 510 for the same price the last xwing had far more figures parts 610 swooshability 9510 design 910 price 310 grand total 32550 not to shabby conclusion so finally the answers to the questions you’ve no doubt want to know is the set worth the price i’ll be frank £3999 is too much for this set despite this i currently have a squadron of three ywings the reasons is this set has been on sale a number of times at £30 it’s certainly worth the money lego recently placed them online with a price of £20 this i think was a great price for the set and well work picking one or more up if you wanted to start your own rebellion	neutral
a wonderful set and a really charming design well detailed and pretty smooth at the same time perhaps that small gap at the cockpit´s an a little weak point but we can always mod a little thanks for that very neat review cardinal brick	positive
kimt on aug 27 2008 1049 pm said haha i was making a joke and here comes stauder with his clearly insane lies for the truth go here now can we get back on topic or a you just dying to become sarlac food oh hush not like many people know the story the true story can indeed be found in the interview so i shall leave you be for now edit  also you should note that you said you would swoosh the ucs ywing staudie ps  sarlacc edited by stauder 27 august 2008  0855 pm	neutral
kimt on aug 28 2008 0908 pm said youve got to be kidding the ilc is bulky and doesnt even come close to the design superiority of the ywing its smooth its beautiful and its awesomely designed by the designers at lego its got greebles man i was not talking about the looks of course the rebels have got to have nicer looking ships	neutral
i like the model it is one of the best rebel sets out there but i dont like it that there is no landing gear when you set this one on the floor your rebel base it looks like it crashed or something and looses its look of superiority actually quite fast it needs to be at least 2 studs high if not more from the ground tlc is in these days afraid of flimsy landing gear as they gave to us in the early sw time now they want something sturdy for playability but i think there should have been some details on the bottom especially a landing gear that unfolds i also dont like the mistake of tlc that they changed this year with the release of indy hopefully to give the pilot a usual smile face the old yellow version of gold leader even had a headgear i hope tlc realised this year that we want more detailed faces well the licenced sets we got proved that but who knows the upsides of this set are the amount of pieces and detail especially the engines were fun to build and perhaps the most interesting construction i have seen in years also it is big bulky and looks sleek at the same time just wonderful and next to the 4502 xwing it looks in the perfect size i gave this the highest rating even if the underside disappoints but whatever it is lego you can add some landing gear on your own thanks for the review your pics were really really good next time make more of them please	positive
stauder on aug 29 2008 1237 pm said dont aregue with him when it comes to ywings he offerd to swoosh one in the nude stauder indeed	positive
the ywing is a truly beautifull ship and lego has done a great job on this one lacking landing gear is a minus point though and nice review by the way	positive
etav8r on 19 september 2011  0155 am said i think it is a fair to ask questions here with the expectation of a new ywing in the coming year i came here to look at the review even though it is a few years old no images to go with the review bummer id like to see a more friendly tolerance on dated threads being bumped again we know next to nothing about the new ywing it wouldnt be possible to say whether 7658 is worth the money relative to the new one until we know what the new one looks like what its minifigures look like how much it will cost etc also note that yodalikespie has been banned	negative
nice review and i especially enjoyed the ending i personally think it is quite a good set for the price considering it comes with a fully armed minifig along with enough stuff to suit up another i just wish amazon carried this set	positive
another fine review i love the last action picture thanks for sharing btw i am so looking forward to that 384 london bus review	positive
nice to see a well done review this set is one of the few exoforce sets i havent built myself yet but i will get it on sale guess soon im do not like the use of slizerstyle balljoints in exoforce even though they are modified to 2x2 bricks in this particular set i think the arms look weak and they lack elbow joint like the green 2008 mech set forgot name of this years green mech quite a shame i find it really hurts the functionality of that green set and could imagine the same with the tiger i guess with the new pyramide brick as cockpit the cockpit is still open from the sides and the back i modified my green 2008 mech which use the same cockpit design with a few green bricks and it is now completely closed from all sides i rate the tiger at average but i may change my mind when i get to build it myself front	positive
thanks for the review one of the best sets in the entire line	positive
the assult tiger is pretty cool	positive
i voted average i think this is the least attractive among the 2008 exoforce sets i saved my money to buy some of the 2006 mechas	negative
i think this is almost the best set in the exo force line i really like the orange cockpit peice	positive
wow i like this set but have no money to get it guess i need to be fast and get it before it was sold out	positive
im not really impressed by this set as much as other impulse sets the knight impulse set 5615 offers more in my opinion since it gives two helmets two weapons a shield and an armor piece along with the weapon rack im not a fan in the slightest of flickfire missles and projectiles like on the cart and the previously mentioned one piece axle limits the wheel usage in other mocs i wouldve liked to see an added chest armor piece at the very least and a shield wouldve made this great those things are so rare and it wouldve bumped the piece count up to 21 to match the knight set since both are showing the same price on shin us dollars at least it wouldve made sense	negative
thank you for the nice review the set is not that bad but a shield would be a nice addition i also dont like the flickfire missile a camp site with a fire and a chickenleg would also be nice about the rat isnt it just foodsupply for the troll the only problem would than be that the food is running away	negative
brick built robot surely we€™re getting near classic space now theme space mission mars set name minirobot set number 5616 number of pieces 24 figures1 released 2008 list price £250 gbp 350 usd 299 euro 5616 peeroncom 5616 bricklink catalog 5616 shop at home let look at the box first space man approaching the robot from behind i€™m not sure you can still buy the base easily anymore the contents of the box the contents of the box it€™s rather white fairly standard mission mars spaceman he€™s got printing front and back but sadly no air tank how does he breath as has been pointed out he does have a printed tank but id rather a physical one note the megaphone is in flashlight mode not weapon mode that€™s important the robot itself feels a bit clumsy the metal detector is never going to touch the ground and it feel a bit wide i don€™t like the look of him something in the eyes the reason why so we can have a box to put crystals in both together and ready to explore new worlds etc sadly the robot was homicidal remember in space no one can hear you scream it€™s not a bad impulse set and if it marks the return of brick built robots to space then it€™s a good thing i just feel the robot could have been better built the rating system figures 610 not to bad but nothing wonderful parts 610 lots of white and not much orange but where€™s the air tank fun fun fun 610 probably the best impulse set as a stand alon toy lots to do with a robot and his human boss design 510 the robot feels clumsily put together i think it needs work price 810 can€™t fault the impulse price grand total 3150 not well designed but does have more play value than other impulse sets conclusion i was surprised that mission mars got impulse sets as it didn€™t seem to sell as well as other lines last year however i think this is a fairly good set it has more playability than other sets and does come with a metal detector been a while since i€™ve seen one though i could be wrong sadly the robot isn€™t as good as it could be edited by sinner 01 september 2008  0130 am	positive
i wasnt all that impressed with what you get in this set for the price but you have an interesting point that the robot can be considered a reference to the classic space bots makes me think i ought to try modding the robot later	negative
kimt on aug 28 2008 0952 pm said id rather get another impulse set than this except the other life on mars mars mission impulse sets actually i kinda like the crystal hawk impulse the default model isnt that great but you get a few nice wing plates to work with after rearranging it looks pretty good i guess this one though is good for some nice parts tho its pretty limited in what you can rebuild it into and it seems less value because the astronaut has no vehicle best impulse set has to be the troll warrior feels very complete and space orcs are always nice to have	positive
i saw two stickers next to the window one said whack him but i cant make out the other one can you post a picture of it good review by the way	neutral

good review thanks for the mail van while it certainly adds interaction and fun to a lego town it alone lacks details and playability and thus not a good set especailly taking its price into consideration its value is pretty much just like if not less than some impulse sets in my opinion	negative

i am not a fan of citytowntrainstuff but this is a very good review that almost makes me wish i had the time read money to purchase some of the coastguard sets	positive
thanks for this review i was thinking of getting this set and having read your review went out today and got it what a great little set what i particularly like very sturdy build feels very solid as you build the pickup compared to the fire pickup  trailer i also have the orange pieces my first pieces in this colour the tyres which give the smoothest ride of any lego towncity vehicle ive ever built the raised suspension and side runners the coast guard dude again a first for me and his megacool flippers and aqualung the jetski controls  the handlebars actually move left to right which is a great detail little details that lego didnt have to do the grey handle by the ball joint moving handlebars the new tyres as you can probably guess i have voted outstanding for this set erdbeereis1 on aug 29 2008 0602 am said color separation is not a problem here and since it is a small set the piece call out is not a necessity you do get a piece call out with this set i did anyway its on the back of the small poster that is included in the set thanks again cheers rog edited by rriggs 02 september 2008  0253 pm	positive
rriggs on sep 2 2008 0850 am said you do get a piece call out with this set i did anyway its on the back of the small poster that is included in the set i meant the piece call outs during the build that show which pieces you need for that step and cardinal brick im not quite sure what you mean but i cetainly think that this jetski is wonderful	positive

thanks for the great review this set is pretty standard as islanders go but it is such a cool subtheme that i dont care a bit i totally agree with your comment about old and new sets i dont think i would enjoy lego as much if i didnt have a decent amount of kits from pre 1999	negative

an outstanding set because who doesnt love islanders outstanding review as well	positive
very solid set 5 minifigs and plenty of weapons to go around adding up to great playability what more could you want aspecially from a set this size only i would have liked another cutlass a musket instead of 1 of the pistols and for 1 of the pirates to have another head but those things are no big deal it is still a lot better than sets nowadays edited by fluyt 23 december 2008  0950 pm	positive

7670 hailfire tank and spider droid number of pieces 249 number of minifigs 4 price 1999 usd 2599 eur 1999 gbp brickset hello everyone today i will review the extremely underrated hailfire tank and spider droid set i hope this review does it justice so lets start with the box note this picture is not mine standard box for star wars in that time the background on the box looks like its from geonosis indicating that this set is from episode ii and not iii or the clone wars the back of the box not shown shows the playability functions and some other sets that were released at the same time as this overview here is an overview of the whole set it comes with one construction manual and no sticker sheets   this is a very simple set but with not much to it it is still a very important part of the cis army especially if you are interested in army building i like to call this set a super battle pack and youll find out why soon lets get right to it and look at the feature of the set the hailfire tank front a front view of the very cool tank here you can see two triangular shields on the hull the main body is very simple but altogether very effective and clever and making it really look like a hailfire tank although a little bit sized down from its movie version the transred stud used as the eye makes the tank look more menacing side the side view the wheels are very easy to make but its a real pain to connect all of those chain links together i dont see what you could use the links for except for another tank but maybe someone creative will find something for these the dark tan is nice though the wheels are held on by technic poles and the tank rolls on the wheels fairly well on carpet or a hard surface back this is the back of the tank here you can see eight flickfire missiles four on each side of the new type so they dont easily fall out also note the modified 2x2 with extended hole piece sticking out of the back this may be used to easily push around the tank i just wish you could fit a droid in the body for the cockpit now we move on to the spider droid or what i like to call the dwarf spider the front this one is also simple but very cleverly built the main body is two semispheres connected together for rotation and an antenna a cannon four legs and eyes made out of a useful telephone piece the picture speaks for itself as far as how the gun and eyes are built side a side view you can now see the legs better which are more sturdy then you would think each one is made out of two pearl bronze exoforce robot arms a useful bley handgun piece and a dark bley battle droid body all connected to the under body a big knoblike piece back the back not much to say here i like this spider droid because it is very sturdy and the legs are easy to adjust finally we look at the minifigs there are four minifigs in this set which is quite generous for a set of this size it comes with a yellow battle droid commander i really like this one two battle droids and a super battle droid all three battle droids have the new blaster pistols and one twisted arm thats about it for the review so here is the final verdict build 810 very fun and easy besides the chain links should take the seasoned builder less than 20 minutes playability 710 the flickfire missiles are fun as well as just zooming around the tank could use some clones for a battle swooshability 810 you can roll around the hailfire fairly well minifigs 910 a generous amount of figs and all are pretty good design 9510 a really simple and clever set although a little too small for the movie version price 1010 a very fair price considering the priceperparts ratio and the coolness of the set overall score 8510 a very neat set to have a great army builder and great for display next to all of the other cis sets the price is fair the figs are good and the build is very clever thats all for now folks please feel free to give some feedback edited by jimbutcher 15 september 2008  0308 am	positive
thanks for sharing this review with us i think this one of the sets in europe this thing is waaaay overpriced and thus makes it a crappy set we pay nearly double the us price so i rated it poor also because the figs included does not make it great the hailfire is well designed and looks great but thats just about all there is worthy of a positive mentioning sorry on a side note as a bronzeawarded student wheres the price in eur and gbp and wheres the poll nevermind the poll ive added that one for you 	negative

great review i agree that this set is underrated the hailfire is supposed to be a little taller than two battle droids so scalewise its nice the dwarf spider droid is amazing in my opinion i just wish it wasnt brown it makes me feel like its on geonosis we never saw a grey varient of the hailfire so its fine with me that its brown	positive
thanks for the cool review jimbutcher  actually i really like this set it is small but very clever and even if the hailfire droid is undersized what in the whole line is not under or oversized  the new spider droid is the best small build i have ever done in a set and the droid commander is pretty cool  i am happy with the set and i will get another with my comiccon exclusive 	positive
i just bought this set the other day and i must admit that it gets a below average from me the price is not corresponding with what you get which would be implied had jim added the eur or gbp price in the infohint hint  the spider droid is flimsy at best making it stand or even move without tumbling over is hard also why the brown cylinders on the legs keep the colourscheme clean please the figs are fine except that i dislike the clone headgear and the fact that the helmets now have holes in the sides allowing the flesh head to show within  goofy looking i am soo replacing the clone heads with black ones great review of an acceptable set	negative
i love the look of this set its the closest to getting a walking eye from the venture bros as well as the droids and troopers 	positive
thanks for the review this is one of the few first wave sets that i didnt get im not really sure why as it wasnt too expensive	neutral
this is polar1 over its day 5 at arctic research base 76 we are experiencing radio difficulties since discovering a number of strange radioactive arctic life forms which seem to be effecting our signal over we have encountered a large polar bear which by all account appears to be friendly and playful our food supply however has diminished quickly and we have to venture north from the base to a frozen lake in search of fish our cordinates are currently 46Â°45â²4â³n 741Â°21â²7â³w we do plan to take the snowmobile to the lake after we get our provisions in order this is polar1 out polar explorer bonus pack set  6569 theme arctic year released 2000 piece count 76 minifigs 2 list price 10 usd in 2000 lego introduced a new theme called arctic it was something completely new and different for lego as no minifig scale sets andor adventurers had ever ventured to the arctic the set offered new orange pieces and combined elements of blue and white pieces to provide a number of sleds vehicles a mobile outpost 6520 and even a large polar base 6575 the theme was unfortunately short lived and did not see 2001 this particular set is a value pack that combines sets 6578 polar explorer and 6586 polar scout at a reasonable price of 10 usd i may have even paid a few dollars less at a discount toy store back in the early 2000s a picture of the bonus pack with the two sets combined within the box the backside features an advertisement for the lego club and pictures of other arctic sets starting with the smaller set the polar explorer just a tip of the iceberg  instructions front of box back of box both sets include the same minifig an arctic fig with glasses and a thick arctic coat heres a shot of the fig with his hood on i always thought the hood is a nice piece that would work well for hoth rebel snow scenes the set includes a few nice accessories the set actually creates a small icesnow formation that can even be placed on water to represent an iceberg heres a closeup with the blue ice spider the complete set next the polar scout front of box back of box the polar scout instructions picture the same image as the box but i really like the real arctic imagery on the backside the set includes a small sheet of decals included are some great arctic accessories and some interesting arctic creatures like this neon orange scorpion in a ball of ice i love the polar bear a great addition to snow scenes but the best part of this set is the orange and black sled the back sled attachment uhaul has some tools and a removable storage cover the top comes off easy to store tools and equipment heres the arctic fig with a great metal detector or other snow research device and the sled itself lastly a picture of the complete polar scout final thoughts im a little disappointed that arctic was a shortlived theme at the time i wasnt too interested in the arctic but i still regret not buying the large polar research base after seeing it at a discounted price i was able to pick up this set and the mobile outpost that i never opened id be interesting in reading your thoughts in regard to this set and the arctic theme	neutral
i like the theme very much but sadly i dont own any sets of it it brings such a great feeling its fresh and has great parts and sets and it brought the polar bear your review is very good and informative thanks i voted wrong i meant above average but i clicked below average 	positive
thank you for that fine review thebrickster i really like how this two small sets create an intense and adventurous atmosphere against the backdrop of a pretty exotic region the sets´re well designed and very nice with a fine amount of rather unique and well fitting gear the whole theme offers a lot of playability in a setup that´s a little different to tlc´s standard sceneries for sure and it always reminded me of who goes there too	positive
a nice set review as for the theme itself i though it was a very interesting theme sadly i don’t think lego put enough effort into it i was personally upset not to se a second year even if i didn’t buy any of the sets it reminds me of the artic theme playmobil did at one point in the distant past to be honest i think a number of good artic scenes were missed when it came out a really wanted to get a ski plane but it never came i built it myself in the end but i don’t know how lego missed that one on a slightly random note i do know that at least one lego minifig did make it all the way to the real artic with a research team sadly i don’t have any pictures to offer you	negative

its amazing its stupendous its almost like whitefang is a reviewer with previous experience its almost like i wrote all of shadows lines its almost like staudie is being as annoying as ever oh wait thats all true great review of a neat little set i used mine as the air conditioning unit on the roof of my chinese restaurant then some dork told me it didnt look believable or something i liked it um so great review thanks for presenting it i give you a and lets just take a moment to get sentimental a year ago today staudie had a lame idea interview the members of eb he flailed around with it for a few interviews including the infamous one where hinck attention whored sinner into a corner and sinner were featured reprising their roles from the whacker and the walrus it was quite memorable but then a short time later someone new joined the team bringing it to a new level of polish and bad jokes still this tribute isnt dedicated to that genius of the written word nay its dedicated to the whole staff including the new guy who is still a secret so dont bother asking im not telling ha i salute you eb news its been a damn fine year i hope i can survive another	positive

2872 witch and fireplace review theme fright knights parts 18 figs 1 price unknown bricklink 500 year 1997 brickset peeron brickshelf bricklink ever wanted to turn into a animal wanted to curse your enemy or just wanted to be rich beyond your wildest dreams you should go visit the witch and her fireplace she can brew you up a potion for any occasion or purpose so head down to see the witch right now although this set is from the fright knights theme it can easily fit in with any other castle theme due to the lack of specialised fright knight parts and printings the set comes with no astounding parts but looks like the source for our good magician impulse set from the current castle theme i think i got this as a promo set official pic the box art for the set has the standard fright knight background and lego system logo followed by the set number down the left hand side of the box a cat is attempting a head stand also i think this box display the contents of the set in an attractive set up as usual 1 the whole set minifigs and all here is the witch on the torso there is a spider amulet which is a little hard to make out due to the low res of the image the witches wand is the same as the bellville fairy wands except in trans red like a lightsaber blade although it is completely useful as a lightsaber as you have probably noticed the witch has no legs instead she has a slope brick with the dress pattern printed on witch get it witchwhich looks better than asajj ventress from the new clone wars sets in my opinon for this anyway the fairysaber new word duel this is the old run down fireplace of the witch at the base there are two smouldering coals instead of fire witch its not funny any more is it doesnt make that much sense seeming as it is a fireplace the little triangular brick on top doesnt really do anything i also accidentally put the wrong one on while building it should be a sloping brick here are the coals the old trans orange studs are less translucent than the new ones i like how they have places them above the main baseplate on a 1x2 plate so they are in line with the rest of the fire place other wise it would look wrong here is everything else i havent covered yet the crystal ball the pets and the magical potion vial the crystal ball is identical to the one included with the good wizard impulse form the current castle theme i like the molds for the cat and the bat although if the cat had some yellow printing for the eyes like the white cat had black for the eyes it would be much better i think the trans green tube things are a little uncommon but im not worried about that 2 overall build 610 extremely puzzling and difficult do not attempt alone  its pretty simple but seeming as it has a load of stuff you can move around it is good minifigs 910 i really like the witch and it couldnt have really come with anyone else also it came with the wand which is really good too design 810 it should have come with some fire and maybe some more orange bricks to put at the base parts 810 the minifigure isnt bad nor are the animals or the trans green part price 1010 i am guessing this was pretty good seeming as i think i got this as a promo i gave it 10 because it was free playability 710 as wth all impulse sets there isnt much here but at least it comes with some animals to have a fight with or give the witch rabies overall 810 if it came with some more stuff for the fire place and the cat was more detailed it would have scored higher but because this set can easily be intergrated with other castle sets it got a mighty 8 3 mini comic  hocus pocus magic shocus turn my pets into dinosaurs not to catchy is it poof oh know i think i might drink my magical potion glug glug glug oh my	positive

review of 7670 hailfire droid and spider droid updated theme sw episode ii  clone wars parts 249  figs figs 4 price £2000 2000 ‚2599 year 2008 i think many people were deterred from this set because of the low piece count and a high price for it although it does come with 4 minfigures 1 overall set and figs official box pic this indicates it is a geonosis set from the background but it is no different from any other set same old brown separatist ships the whole set some red tan droids would have been nice like in the geonosian fighter set all the minifigs the super battle droid body is slightly different to the one in the bp it looks more grainy and silver i doubt this has any relevance for it being a geonosis set but i like them better how they were in the bps the super battle droid body dwarfing the commander droids body i think that the new commander droids body is better than the old one with just the yellow strip even though it is less accurate new twisted battle droid arm each droid has one of these i dont really like having droids with these new guns i think the older guns suited them much better 2 hailfire droid hailfire droid by itself it is certainly smaller than the original seeming as this is the main part of the set i was hoping it would be bigger but i dont mind it being this small too much wheels and rockets can fold outwards and inwards the wheels which spin round two large clear discs and made from loads of these tiny links this is probably the best way to make the wheels on this small scale the only other alternatives i can think of are using the tracks from the wookiee attack set or catterpilla tracks both of which wouldnt look right one of the missile pods these use the new flickfire missiles which dont fall out are an excellent idea they should have come with the purple cones like on the magna guards staffs instead of red though because in the film the missiles are purple one of the new flickfire missiles that dont drop out when the model is tilted forward i dont know what the holes in them are for though the 3 eyes are made up of 2 trans red cheese bricks for the sides and 1 trans red stud for the centeryou can also see how the missile pods are attached to the side of the body this is the back of the hailfire droid there is a plate with a hole in i have found only one purpose for this the hailfire droid is the commander droids war chariot what do you use the plate for 3 spider droid the spider droid the design has been greatly improved from the wookiee attack set not only is it more accurate but also more poseable which is useful when setting up battle scenes the ball joint provides the place to put the antenna which isnt long enough but the dome form the old set looks more like the droid form star wars episode ii the eyes are made of a telephone piece with 2 trans red studs on in the original it had orange studs the eyes can be seen in action 2 pics down i told you it was a telephone 1 of 4 identical legs these are very easy to adjust into what ever position you want and are much better than the originals but a word of warning never pull them apart as i did they become very loose when put back together so i put some blue tack in the holes 4overall build 710 a little to repetitive for my liking minifigs 810 4 figs for £20 isnt too bad plus they come with new guns design 910 both vehicles are very well designed but the hailfires small size let the set down parts 810 comes with lots of useful maybe not  brown track links price710 not too bad with 4 figs and loads of little brown links playability 610 not to much on its own overall 710 if it came with some clones and tan red droids it would be better afetr jar jar wiped out a small droid patrold he realized he was being watched mesa in big dodo this time	neutral

i like this set mostly because it has some very usable pieces but also because of the amount of minifigures in the set which is a whopping three and one large animal skeleton horse the one thing however that i dont like about it is that one of the catapult operators isnt armed in my opinion this would have been a good time for tlg to release a suitable dagger piece not the kitchen knife for its castle line great review by the way it captured the key elements of this fantastic small set	neutral
nice review to start off you got all the details someone could possibly need in my opinion at least i do enjoy this set as well and ive bought only one to keep my minifigs as unique as possible despite my personal preference i still find this a nice army builder good amount of minifigs for the price as mentioned earlier with each being different from the other though i would like the catapult manager to be armed with at least something i still feel that he can just flee if hes ever in trouble hes a good guy to use for the castle gimmics if you have it one more small comment i also love those domed helmets even if they arent actually new my favorite of them all being followed up by the racer helmet	neutral
youre really rolling these reviews out huh i am not sure how i feel about this set while it does include five figs three are skeletons and are generally worth much less than say three trollsorcs i know they didnt exist at this point in time so this is understandable the amount of horses is nice but im not a big lego horse fan what this set does have is a great appearance and brings atmosphere to the table 20 is an affordable amount for those of us who do not wish to splurge too much on a toy while being enough to actually get a large enough set to create something out of personally id rate it in between average and above average like another castle set i cant remember which i just feel this one also lacks something	neutral
thanks for the great review i was going to buy this set this saturday and after reading this review i am twice as likely to buy it	positive
thats a super review erdbeereis1 as usual and as we can expect from one of the academy teachers i gave the set a 4 above average because i think there are quite some minifigs included for its price which is i think not that expensive at all i also like the parts that are included like the sceleton horses and weapons wheels imho this set is a great armybuilder  btw in belgium i have seen this set being sold for 1599 euros	positive
other than the minis accessories and animals this set is meh at best	negative
im a little late in the coming okay a lot  but regardless id applaud you for another fantastic and insightful review erdbeereis out of all the castle sets this one remains one of my favorites i got it for christmas in 2007 before i intended to spend much money on the new castle theme that changed once i managed to get the kings castle siege for a very good price its really a wonderful set all around  the design accomplishes the spooky undead feel very well and it contains a good piece selection and a phenomenal amount of minifigs seriously this set is almost unrivaled in modern lego in the final area  im still amazed at how many minifigures tlc put in the kit i also appreciate that the carriage has a far more realistic horse arangement  after all the sillyness of the onehorse pulled siege engines in kk its good to finally see a carriage pulled by multiple horses again all in all an excellent set and well worth 20 imo	positive
tacitus on sep 4 2008 0957 am said lovely review really but the sad fact is weve seen it before twice httpwwweurobrickshowtopic20293 jeez your comments are getting on my nerves more than one review per set is allowed here thanks for sharing your thoughts on this set with us a great set now has another  great review ill add it to the index as soon as the poll on how the index is to look is over phewlong sentence oh yeah and ill rate this as above average i think it needs at least one minifig more than there is	positive
i got this set last month and i can definitely say that even if you think it is one of the best sets ever you wont fully appreciate it until you build it yourself the elevated city station is much more complex than it looks and the whole set is extremely detailed the good  as stated in the review theres a lot of track roughly twice as much as the last monorail made 6991 5 long straights too  the designers didnt need to put in the hamburger stand or the ticket readers but they did and made it even better  great figure selection airport workers as well as civilians the bad if you can call it that in such a great set  hard to incorporate into an existing town if using the default track layout the center loop would be inaccessible to vehicles and the layout is very large  the monorail needs nearly a full straight section on either side of the city station or it will impact the corner of the station and stall if a curve is too close  as far as i know the only town set with road plates that doesnt have a wheeled vehicle a car would have been nice a bus would have been incredible but these small things in no way diminish from the fact that this is one of the best sets ever edited by section8 05 september 2008  0117 pm	positive
an excellent review of one of the jewels in the crown of the lego town range to answer one of your question i think the lack of people owning this set is one of the reasons that its yet to have a review personally i’ve only seen this set in the flesh once in my life when i was a child just before it was withdrawn from sale it is a lovely set well made and well produced though i think there is a flaw and that’s when the passages get of the other end of their train ride what picks them up a bus set for the airport would have been a good addition apart from that i can’t really fault it and that fact it comes with three female minifigs is just stellar as for incorporation keeping it elevated seems the most sensible suggestion i’ve always thought it i have it and wanted to integrate the set to a town to use it in the style of the dlr in london but that’s just a thought	positive
thanks for that splendid review simonwillems i clicked on outstanding of course i also like those little details especially the ticket validating machines youre very fortunate to own this wonderful set i hope you have an airport to go with it edit and bricklink is wrong giving 1991 as the release date youre right it was 1990 edited by legotrainfan 05 september 2008  0657 pm	positive

thanks for the review like many such town sets i would characterise it as cute contrasting it to the new bin lorry its nice that this set has two minfigs more realistic and two bins those bins are a great addition to lego although wheelie bins would be nice now need some kind of 2x2 container you can clip a plate onto as a hinging lid and clip miniwheels under the back two studs having two minifigs is a superior point for this earlier lego rendition of a bin lorry in fact even though our bins are now emptied by a private company rather than the local council as was the case up till the mid 90s and of course for the last two decades there have been wheeliebins bin lorries have three guys  the driver and two collectors however our bin collectors for sure dont use a broom or shovel indeed on occasion theyve befouled the street themselves if something goes wrong with hoisting the bin on the mechanism the shape of the lorry in the set is still quite accurate pretty good for a fourwide vehicle i must admit to preferring the newer vehicles	positive
thanks so much for the great review i love that truck i hadnt realized there was a real 4wide recycle truck out there i must get it one day to replace this abomination currently doing garbage duty in my town i think that truck has seven pieces total in it i do like the blue color though 	positive

great to find this review of a classic set and its far better than any yuk set from 1997 omg what were they thinking  i prefer the six wide for trucks but for the 80s it was perfect and even today still holds its own 	positive
great review and i love the soft yellow effect to the pics imo the most recent garbage truck shouldve used the same piece for lifting the cans into the big bin instead of the droid arms	positive

name jetport fire squad set no 6440 theme lego system  town year 1991 pieces 84 minifigs 2 price usd 2750 which equals about eur 1926€ and gbp 1557£ introduction one of the sets that especially my cousin likes is this one one time at the dutch legoworld event we had three of those there with flashing lights and loud sirens trying to put out the fire that was caused by the crash of again some lego aircraft we never had this set before our drak ages and the sets probably came from ebay or so in my opinion the newest airport rescue is nice too but in the conclusion i will make some additional remarks about that just imagine what it would be like for your lego town if the pilot of one of your smaller planes just couldnt stop before the end of the runway here you see the disaster that happened some day in our town fortunately all passengers got out safely thanks to our brave fire fighters this magnificent truck was used to help putting out the fierce fire caused by the aviation gas from the small plane the set includes two firefighters in distinguishable airport uniforms in order to be able to safe the passengers and go for a quick intervention our brave firemen have an axe for each of them airtanks and a portable fire extinguisher here you see the truck on the right side the large spout on the roof really makes it a remarkable truck as you can see behind the red door there is space for the airtank of our brave firemen at the right there is also place for the small hand held extinguisher the left side of the truck has a water hose instead for a truck from 1991 there is quite some room inside actually both firemen fit inside unfortunately there is only one seat at the back there are two clips for the axes there you can also find the main switch for the light and sound system as you can see the red flashing lights do their job quite well the sirene is just behind the bar with the flashing lights the main spout just seems to begin emitting water the front of the truck for some reason there are two hidden spouts there as well what their purpose is seems unclear but they look nice kimt suggests that it is for foaming the runway and that is a real option of course this set can be found on peeron lugnet brickset bricklink entries playability 810 very nice set details that are movable and of course the light and sound design 810 nice sets with nice details but could have even been better seat for 2nd fireman missing no oxigen masks and only one airtank price 710 for a light and sound set and two firefighters the price is reasonable i would say overall 810 nice sets some details could even be better too bad that there is only a five to choose from a sticker when you have more than one truck last but not least an overview of the complete set including instructions fire mastered as the dutch firefighters will say when they have completed their job we have also bought the newer airport rescue truck 7891 however we think this 6440 one is much better the light and sound all the nice features and the nice details are much better than the new truck edited by jopiek 11 september 2008  1025 am	positive

perfect perhaps the front sprouses are for foaming the runway youve certainly kept that set in near mint condition havent you now all we can wish for is a new firetruck combining this ls version and the new	neutral
jopiek on sep 8 2008 1224 am said thanks of course for the flattery but do you then from your profession understand what the purpose is of the front spouts that even can be hide since that puzzles me it can be that the lego designers thought it was a nice touch and didnt bothered about the realistic value of such a feature but i dont suppose that that is the case here somehow i had just noticed your reply to be honest with you the aes in my country does not have front spouts in their fire engine i do not remember seeing this feature before it is a possibility that this feature is included in some models or an imaginative addition from our lego designers i will need to check this out kimt on sep 9 2008 0316 pm said perhaps the front sprouses are for foaming the runway that is a logical answer	neutral
name cargomaster crane set no 6352  peeroncom theme lego system  town year 1991 pieces 133 minifigs 1 price usd 2600  gbp unknown  eur €1995 aargh stupid tree for more than fourty years this megabrick has tormented our town we need some help long before my dark ages lego released this relatively small set since they didnt have a construction site like nowadays they released these small roadworks i was only six years old and really into small sets since my adhd didnt allow me to sit and build for long periods of time so these smaller sets were ideal for me the instruction booklet the complete set the set itself is not really a surprise to set up and play with first youll build the smaller parts of the set like the container and the small verhicle no real surprises there except for the smaller car that fits perfectly in the cargo container just pull off the seat and steering wheel and the car just fits the crane itself is just as easy to build as the smaller parts just place bricks on top of eachother although youll still have the wire to connect and pull through a diversity of bricks and plates the carco container and small car being out of my dark ages really tunnelled my vision toward bigger sets and completing my town this set really comes in handy if i need construction or traffic workers in my town i can just moc a few containers for tearing down trees fixing traffic lights and so on behold the mighty cargomaster crane its pretty easy to say that a set as simplistic as this one is not much fun to play with however if you see the bigger potential in your town this one could be of great value to any city playability 710 with only one container it gets a bit boring design 910 its small and fits perfectly price 710 average but not really cheap overall 7710 a nice overall set if youre building on minifig scale gimme my pizza every town should have a pizzaria more information bricklink search results brickset lugnet edited by crazydance 07 september 2008  0352 pm	neutral

big supie on sep 7 2008 0946 pm said i think the 6382 fire station is the better one from the 80ies i agree have that 6382 set for about 27 years now but i have always like that one futuristic truck when i was a child so i also still have some feelings for this set as well crazydance nice review after all	positive
from memory argos sold it originally for about £21 gbp i seem to remember this as i could not afford the airport released the same year as this was about £2999 seems such a small amount of money now now have 2 copies of this set only 1 boxed 	positive
cp5670 on sep 7 2008 0525 pm said nice classic set are those hoses around the engine pneumatic tubes that technic catalog looks interesting too i have the catalogs for the next several years but not that one the most extreme example of this was the engine step in the 8865 set which uses over 120 pieces by itself the pneumatic tubes are listed seperately under x188 the classic hose is x467 i think theyre just the same with just a single difference the x467 seemed to be already cut in lenght instead of x188 which must be cut in lenght mfg widdi	positive
name electric passenger train set no 7725 theme lego  system  trains  12v  train set year 1981 pieces 485 minifigs 1 price usd 7000 which equals about eur 50€ and gbp 40£ introduction our most favorite theme is 12v trains actually i got my first 77series back in 1981 5th of december i was 25 years old just a week before my brother was born some years later i got the 7740 after our dark ages we my brother cousin and myself got all 12v trains at least once this 7725 was gathering dust in my brothers room the train in all its splendor as you can see it doesnt occur at the back of the 12v era train instructions although its larger brother the 7740 does some investigation learned that all the sets at the back of the instructions date from 1980 so the 7725 wasnt released yet here you can see the front of the 7725 with the driver in the cockpit the driver is in fact the only minifig that was included in the set as you can see our version of the train has a different front than the one in the instructions apparently the former owner used 7861 lighting set 12 v to upgrade the train with working back and frontlights i like the original lights but didnt notice that the train had those double lights until i did the review maybe we will give the train again its original signs and put custom leds in it or so so that the train can drive into two directions with accurately working lights another thing about the lights that puzzle me are the backlights while typing this i realise that the former owner might have added those so lets have a look at the instructions then as it turns out the lights are there also in the instructions i recently learned that only the last car or coach of a train has its red lights on so unless the train drives with only the front car it will never use those red backlights here you can see the cockpit with the engineer the cables dont look very pretty but well the train at least has working light here you can take a look at the inside of the engine car while the 7745 has a nice fake engine there just the weight bricks and the ugly cables apart from the engineer and his cockpit no other nice features here btw lego always used tiles in such a trains to make it easier for kids to take off the roof and have access to the minifig passengers etc here the proof that it is an electric train the pantograph of the front car it has the same kind of panthographs that the 7745 has the middle car has 4 chairs as you can see some vandal must have nocked over this one hope they leave the cables alone this early morning train seems to have one passenger a workman i like the small 2x3 windows from this car very much they give this care a nice look also the door in the middle adds something special to the train as far as i know no other passenger train has the doors in the middle here you see the side of the train just after the train has left brickingham station where the worker probably from set 6647 highway repair that was also released in 1980 a closeup of the last car with steering stand to allow the train to travel back and forth without having to make head in other words putting the engine in front again the train shunted to an end track so it can be cleaned i think it is apparent that it definitely needs cleaning very badly this set can be found on peeron lugnet brickset bricklink entries playability 510 the train is fine but with only one minifig not very playable without other sets also no accessories at all design 710 nice train the inside could have been a lot better but i really like to original front lights price 710 the train came with motor so not a bad price goes now for quite some money at ebay overall 6510 nice set but the 7745 is a better train im sure well that was it for today i hope you have enjoyed this review and got tears in your eyes seeing how nice the 12v era was it never comes back but maybe lego rereleases some of this sets in the 2009 train era very likely that this is just wishful thinking edited by jopiek 12 september 2008  0456 pm	neutral
freddie on sep 7 2008 1152 pm said a very nice review jopiek you know i was wondering how lego could justify having two 12vpowered passenger trains at the same time but after reading the review and seeing the lack of figures and accessories i guess i understand why plus the train is rather compact oh and i cant help but think that the chairs in the middle carriage are somewhat oddly placed because those placed next to the door are unusable because the door takes up room needed for figs arms also it appears that your set also has the newer couplers ie theres no hooks for the decoupling rail to grab hold of with the light assembly it really wont matter playwise or if you dont have any decouplers but its still a bit of a bummer the chair was just loose so it should be placed on the 2x2 plate that is also visible in the picture of the middle car btw the front magnet is the old type i have some decouplers but we dont use them because they are not really that reliable lego just release a whole line of trains at the same time i just discussed with my parents and they told be lego had those sets longer in store back then i must have gotten the 7745 somewhere in 1983 or even 1984 although it was released in 1981 i started of with the 7710 push along train and then upgraded the tracks with current rails when i got the 7745	positive
jopiek on sep 8 2008 1220 am said the chair was just loose so it should be placed on the 2x2 plate that is also visible in the picture of the middle car btw the front magnet is the old type i have some decouplers but we dont use them because they are not really that reliable lego just release a whole line of trains at the same time i just discussed with my parents and they told be lego had those sets longer in store back then i must have gotten the 7745 somewhere in 1983 or even 1984 although it was released in 1981 i started of with the 7710 push along train and then upgraded the tracks with current rails when i got the 7745 the 7745 was realsed in 1985  lego had 2 12v passengers trains between 1981 and 1984 the 7740  7725 during the 80s the avergae life of a train was about 5 years	neutral
the best 12v legotrain is for me the 7740 the 7725 is still a goodlooking train and the only one with short wagons in a electric version before i started to with bricklink i started to build this train in blue ive build 4 trains of it and sold 2 of them still one for sale  you can also build this in other colors like a yellow one or you can build a black version which i made a death train of it driven by a skeleton  edited by panda9001100 17 may 2009  0801 am	positive

like whitefang i too only remember this line in computer game form i used to love that game i actually have never seen a review for an xtreme stunts set so this was nice to see as for the set i think it looks pretty good i really like the hippie guy the windboard thing is nice as well but looks a bit strange somehow i give this set a solid 3 out of 5 thanks for the nice review edited by erdbeereis1 08 september 2008  0405 am	positive
air chase woosh the bricksters seaplane flies over the beach quickly hippie dude is in close pursuit on his hang glider fuel is running out for the bricksters plane can hippie dude catch him before he either gets away or crash lands in the water you decide with island xtreme stunts air chase set  6735 theme island xtreme stunts year released 2002 piece count 83 minifigs 2 list price 10 usd a nice addition to the island xtreme stunts theme air chase includes two air vehicles a seaplane and hang glider the set has nice island colors inclusing white light blue and orange also includes in the set are some great chrome pieces for the bricksters airplane wings starting with the box you can see hippie dude in close pursuit the back of the box depicts some nice alternate jet skis same front box picture on the instructions and on the backside pictures of the video game air chase includes two nicely detailed figs hippie dude for lack of his official name and the brickster heres a picture of the orange hangglider and the underside unfortunately the hangglider is too heavy to be held up by a minigig while i like the brickbuilt glider for the extra pieces the plastic wing pieces from the ninja theme would have worked effectively and be a lot lighter i think the seaplane is the best part of the set heres a shot of the front end i like the skeletal sharkfish design whats great is none of the pieces use stickers they are all printed including the tail end although the cockpit has no steering wheel or lever piece it does have a very nice printed 1x2 tile the wings of the airplane have hinges to allow them to fold inward slightly also notice the nice chromesilver pieces heres a shot of the underside of the seaplane and lastly the complete set final thoughts air chase is another one of those fun island sets two figs with two vehicles make a perfect combination for creating some dogfights in the air at the same time the bricksters plane can land in the water to explore other adventure play opportunities this set is also a nice addition to the island xtreme stunts truck  stunt trikes 6739 the seaplane can be hauled by the large semitruck included within 6739 hope you enjoy this review	neutral

what would we do without the trucks of legoland to clean up our town well i didnt want to find out so i bought this set straight away 7991 recycle truck set info set name 7991 recycle truck released 2007 theme city price usd 1499gbp 1299eur 1495 pieces 206 minifigs 1 review time leading off the box the front shows the recycle man loading up the trash can one thing here is really bizarre on lego sh and everywhere else it says that this set is called recycle truck which makes sense as it has a recycle logo on the truck however on my box it says the set is called garbage truck has this happened to anyone else or is it just me here is the back of the box which shows some of the things you can do with this set the bags with this set you get 3 bags which are numbered and do you see what i see yes thats right the dss is in a bag so it doesnt get bent why tlg doesnt do this more often is beyond me bag 1 the set comes with a very nice selection of pieces a large number of these are orange manual silly me i forgot to take a picture of the front of the manual the picture is the same as on the front of the box the back shows some of the 2007 city sets in a nice little scene and inside minifig here is the friendly garbagerecycle man he looks nice but with the same head as so many other city figs before him come on tlg give us some new heads the sticker sheet the stickers actually are pretty decent as far as stickers go i like the recycle sign after bag 1 this is where we stand after the first bag is built bag  2 the parts contained in the second bag more nice orange pieces here extra parts some nice 1x1 slopes and 1x1 round plates everything built now that everything is built lets check it out the design of the set is very nice and the color scheme looks great when you see it you immediately know what it is the back has a droid arm that acts as a handle to dump the trashrecycling in the truck its simple but works well here you can see the dumping mechanism it works by a sliding technic beam with a stopper on top of the truck you can store the workers cart this works really well i think though that the top of the truck overall looks a bit jumbled up with a few too many different colors the bottom trash dumping time this is a good feature of the set a very well built snot front section this looks fantastic with the grills and number plate sticker someone has left a big mess on the street brickshelf folder ratings price 1010 for 15 this is a very good deal at 206 pieces parts 910 lots of orange design 910 a very well designed set especially the front playability 910 the trash dumper is fun and the added broom and cart make for good play value build 810 simple but stayed interesting overall4550 brickset lego sh bricklink peeron taking out the trash summary this is a great small set for the price with fun features nice colors and good design i would certainly recommend this set no matter what its really called thanks and happy building	positive
i own this set and i think its a really nice truck but there is two little details that i didnt like  1 a recycle truck really needs 2 minifig one to drive one to put the garbage on the back 2 the big hole behind the driver seat it was easy to fill it like this  with hole pouf  no more little hole but this is really a great set anyway 45 for me  above average 	positive
jopiek on sep 10 2008 0145 am said also it will not empty completely because of that panel actually it does the back part of the truck with the panel hinges up so that when you want the truck to dump it doesnt get in the way	positive
thebrickster on sep 11 2008 0921 am said what a great set and a very nice review erdbeereis i think the only improvement to this set would have been the use of chrome exhaust pipes and front grill i bought this set with a lot of excitement but unfortunately have not put it together yet what are your thoughts on these larger 6stud wide detailed vehicles as opposed to 4stud wide classics heres an image of 6668 recycle truck released in 1992 ps i like the use of taking out sponge bob in your review its hard to say i think if the older 4 wide cars and trucks were as welldesigned as the new 6 wide ones i might prefer those	negative
thanks for this review i really love this set its perfect for my town and brings a sense of classic when i see it	positive
that looks like one of those big strange recycle trucks from new york city i like it	positive
