1 these are pretty good, but i think they look too much like the standard town roads from that period. i like the black space plates from the early 90s better (6710).

3 whitefang, on jul 7 2008, 11:42 pm, said: actually, with only 2 plates, i could not do much serious expansion with it. instead, i merged it with my old city baseplates, and used it as a docking station for scientific purposes or restricted facilities that is guarded by the police. you make a very good point there. i've used these plates to represent restricted areas, and even as simple airport runways, beyond their space uses. i never liked the black plates (they were during my dark ages anyway, so i've never really seen one up close), but i have seen them used in a death star display as suggested and it turned out fairly well.

1 why pay $350 dollars, just download the instructions on buy the pieces off bricklink. this is was i did when i wanted to create the blacktron ii in the futuron colour scheme. also i tend to like both sets of base plates, i bought the black ones myself and they were of great use but there more for creating the idea of a city or space station, something more completely man made. the gray ones give a better look of the roads being laid over bare rock especially when you introduce the plates with the craters. i would love to see a 48*48 baseplate with roads through them which would allow more building space on the side and maybe some craters. also 48*48 baseplates with craters but a few different kinds to create more or a realistic look and less of a repeating pattern. and with all those rocks you have to put everything up on supports, much better looking bases then.

3 thebrickster, on jun 22 2008, 01:41 am, said: it looks like your boat is in really good shape considering it's >30 years old. excellent review! i know; i got it for a song on ebay. most 1970s sets don't seem to be in much demand...

1 nice review sinner! the old sets... i donÂ´t know - every old set, especially equipped with the old non-moveable arms minifigs look very odd nowadays. i agree with you with the hull shape and its possibility to be extended, but every other aspect, the lack of detail, the keel itself (you canÂ´t float it in shallow water) keeps me from rating it higher than 3/10. in my opninion the best police boat so far is 4021 *click to enlarge*

4 this set showed what potential variations on the standard brick had back then. i think that tlg was still finding its legs back then and learning new things so this is a solid set for the year it was released. nice review sinner.

1 lol! i can't help but smile everytime i see the quote on this thread..... don't worry these police are armless! lol

4 well what to say? i got this boat late 70s, when we were on our way to italy to spend the holidays there. my parents always needed to keep my quiet during the 3-day trip, and the best way to do that was to buy me a lego set... i got this one in a gas station in germany. as far as i remember italy didn't have lego sets, so a gas station close to the italian border but still in germany or austria was very often their last chance. i often saw large quantities of lego sets in those gas stations though... i remember seeing yellow castle and... the galaxy explorer, standing on a shelf. it would be my birthday 1-3 week(s) later so i always made sure they knew what to buy for me...

4 nice review! i haven't built yellow castle for many years, but i do remember the fun i had building it when i was young... yellow castle just opened up an entire new world for me... also, i liked all the alternate models on the box :od wish i still had that...

4 kimt, on dec 28 2005, 02:52 pm, said: toothbrush and mild soap - and lots of time gently scrubbing a cleaning. and great review - i love that set *wub* *wub* i'm sorry that you seem to miss the stickers - if you find somewhere to download printable copies of them please let me know *satis* kimt thanks for the tip. i tried it on a few pieces and they look much better. unfortunately, it does take a lot of time. i need a lego cleaning machine with this many pieces.

3 i've tried this once. remember? normal white sticker sheet in an ink jet and the transparent plastic on top !! p.s. the one on the right is the homemade one!!

3 here's a shot of a custom forestman. these really work well: i'm using just regular sticker paper. how do you stick transparent plastic on top?

3 wasn't this the first castle lego released?

4 great job on this review of a unique and rare set luxorv! considering the year it was released, this must have been a cool set back then. even up to now with all the specialized pieces and advanced building techniques, i could still appreciate the beauty of this brickbuilt harley-davidson police motorbike. the various elements are instantly recognizable and it even has the unusual 'partly-stacked' plates technique for the motor. overall, i'd say this is an above average set that is a must-have for any hardcore lego collector.

4 great review! the set is really nice, i love that the front of the motercycle can turn and the engine is just beautiful, with its half stacked bricks like kieldaman said. the price used or new is quite a bit, but there is a good variety of bricks here like the bricks inside the wheels. did you get this set from your father? great review luxorv!

4 wow, talk about illegal connections, eh? great review. i really like this set, even for its age

4 thanks for the feedback guys! indeed this is a great set, and i'm very attached to it. as far as i remember, i got it for say my 2nd birthday, i think but it is not my first lego set. you'll learn more on this in my next planned review

4 rare classic sets are always a priceless part of any lego collection, and it's a good thing you still have this first set of yours luxor (or did you purchase a new one?). excellent review btw, it's always a pleasure getting a closer look at these classic sets which i wouldn't have known to exist had i not seen this review. overall i think it's a really good set at that time, of course judging this one by modern standards won't be fair but at the time i'm pretty sure it was a 'cool' set to have (though less cooler than having the harley davidson set).

4 thanks, luxor, for bringing us this excellent tour round an old classic! for its time, this is truly a remarkably detailed and beautiful set, and i think it's amazing how it's still in such good condition after all this time. do you have any more from this era (excepting the harley, of course )? i've created a whole new index to put them in

4 thanks for the great nostalgic review! great pictures, i love the shiny glow of 37 year old bricks! sets were simpler back then, but not less exciting in their own way. i wasn't even born in 1973, but one of my first sets was the 1982 update of this, 6630 bucket loader. almost 10 years later, but the very same bucket assembly, only the colours have changed.

4 ah, the good old days........thanks for the review 'yoshi648' - cute and cool at the same time. it's interesting to see that the same front end parts had been used from the early 70's up in to the late 90's ! nice again to step back in time and keep on bricking everyone !

4 i voted 'outstanding.' regarding this set, i found mine at a consignment store. it was inside of a larger set from the same time period.

3 well, it's not exactly a large shuttle, but still a nice set: 442 space shuttle year released: 1979 piece count: 79 minifigs: 1 vehicles: 0 list price: unknown this little classic was my smallest classic space set. believe it or not, i still have the box: here's the back: the instructions are pretty tattered and missing a section. i had to download some from the web: but the ship is again intact, missing only one grey 1x3 plate: i've always liked this computer piece: here's the under side. this set included the small classic jet engines: a close-up of the sloped printed space brick: and the complete set with minifig: this set was a great little space ship that made a nice addition to the blue space theme. as small as it was, it could hold two-three figs (one standing up). i don't even think the mars mission recon drop ship holds three figs. in any case, it was a must-have for blue space fans, and probably only a few bucks back in the day. swoosh!

4 and again those tears in my eyes. with original box...! i really love those classic space stuff. looks like i need to clean my stuff this summer.

4 this was my first space set ever!! 1979, 1980... don't know anymore, but i do remember i got this together with 897 for my birthday when we where camping... with a little luck i may even have an old film from my dad, opening the boxes... well what to say... it looked soooooo aggressive with those two engines! but i never knew why you needed two steering wheels on it... they probably just thought a symmetrical model was better .... i can't blame them... what a nice set.... it would even sell today, no doubt... looooots of swooshability...

4 outstanding review of a very special set! i actually remember seeing this set on the store shelves of local department stores. can you believe it? fantastic review walter. i really enjoy looking at these vintage sets. this one deserves a blog!

4 wooow! what a set!! not all that large, most defenitely not as sophisticated as the message intercept base from 10 years later, but in those, this was all a kid need to have hours of fun. soooo many great parts on this one.... technic hoses, computers, rocket parts, trans yellow parts... the perfect outpst really... it was actually my sister who got this one, but it only took an hour before i claimed it... edited by snefroe, 14 july 2008 - 12:36 pm.

4 nice rewiew the set is good too)

4 hey eb'ers, i got my market street on monday and finished building it last night. i know it?s not such a nice review like *yoda* did the last times, but i hope you enjoy some of the pics. first a pic of the complete building: the 3 minifigs: and i pic of the stairs (one of my highlights at this set): more pics you can find here my opinion about the set: i like this set very much, it was really fun to build it. i?m happy that that i got some more cherries and a croissant now *sweet* , a funny idea is the salad in the one box at the front. i think normally it?s a hairpiece of an exoforce fig. i also like the colours of the house, the dark blue is sooooo nice. i think i have to take more of this soon. the lighter blue is also nice. this set has really nice details like the stairs, or the owl at the entry of the market, or the balcony. i paid 89,99 eur, a fair price for a really nice set!! greetings sandra

1 thanks for the great review! *sweet* now that i've seen the set, i'm afraid i'm a bit disappointed 8-| 1) the color combination doesn't really do it for me. blue, dark blue, grey, black, tan, white, they're all mixed together without any over all design... 2) is there any interior? it doesn't look like it, and in any case, you can only reach it if you remove the modules... hm... |-/ now it looks too much of a box... 3) there are most certainly some nice ideas in this model and some great parts. the best part of the model is the staircase 4) i don't think he spent much time in thinking about the design. as apo said, the chimneys on top of a garage is kinda weird, there's also a gate, next to another gate which is weird as well... also, if this is supposed to ba a grocery, then the owner has done a lot to hide it. the croissant is nice, but next to the brown box with vegies, there's nothing that suggests this is a shop... 5) the white lamp and the the yellow cylinder are at the same level of the tiles. imo it should be above the level of the tiles... 6), imo not worth the 90 euro edited by snefroe1, 20 june 2007 - 09:03 am.

1 thanks for the pics legocastlegirl! one thing that i find strange is that tlc doesn't use a female mf head for those two females mf in this set, but a female mf head is available in ldd and pab *wacko*

4 i still haven't bought the cc or ms. but reviews like this make me wanna buy them instantly. thanks for this legocastlegirl !!

3 it was the same thing in france in the middle-age... happy that today this taxe is gone! :-d

3 woooooooooooow! that's some maquette! say, i wonder if the blackhole stormie will be playable in lswtcs? maquette on!

4 very nice *wub* how'd you get a hold of it?

4 wow, that's awesome! and look, a giant 3x3 lego piece! 8-? :-d edited by iamded, 27 june 2007 - 08:03 am.

3 so, were you serious about any of the boba fett, luke skywalker, stormtrooper & darth vader ones? because i'd love to see a boba fett and vader one. :-d

4 wow, if the tru 6212 is to be believed, the luke marque costs $50. but that looks so cool. definitely a keeper.

4 hi, you are right, this is such a fantastic maquette. i really hope that i will get the chance to own the other 4, too. it is carefully packed in styropor. the painting is nice, looks really evil. i think it is a wonderful addition (with the 4 other) to any collector shelf..(-; mine is number 276. greetings hendrik

4 well it has taken me over 2 years but i have finally bought this maquette! it's a real beauty! just don't ask what it cost! my set of maquettes is finally complete.

4 great reason to review a great thread. your collection is truely something to behold.

4 wow thats so cool mutley. my favourites are darth vader and luke skywalker because the others seem to have funny looking heads. not so much boba fett but the storm trooper and the blackhole stormtrooper do. it must be their helmets. edited by roncanator, 02 december 2009 - 08:29 am.

4 i always wanted one of these (*sighs*) i don't think that i'll ever get it though.

1 thanks for this review, and that great little comic! about the skellies though (x-d), you have to admit that besides their long arms making the skellie legs look out of proportion, that they're just made poorly. they're sticking straight out, as opposed to every other fig, which have a slight bend to make them look more natural. also, as i'm sure you've noticed, the pegs are on angles! that makes it impossible for them to hold their weapons straight, and they can't even put their arms over their heads without stressing the plastic some... i mean they're dead. well, at least undead, they're not supposed to be stiff, and personally i like the ragdoll look more, it makes them seem more dead :-p

4 wow! that was both an entertaining time, and a learning experience! it was entertaining because the comic made me laugh! it was a learning experience because, well, i dunno. just wanted to say it. anyways, great review, grievous! edited by trooperdavinfelth, 01 july 2007 - 09:46 pm.

4 nice review, and great little story. :-d *y* look at the normal horses, their legs are positioned like that too. only the skellie horse's legs are touching, so as to strengthen the middle, otherwise it could easily snap in half. also, i think the new skeletons are nice, their head is awesome, i just don't see why tlc couldn't make the bent droid arms with the hand facing vertically, instead of making a new arm design completely straight.

4 tks a lot grevious for this !! regarding the set i just love it !! i really oved your comic, it was really well done and hilarious x-d eb spirit on !! vader, on jul 2 2007, 08:28 am, said: still i shall be buying alot of these sets just to increase my army. you don't say mate, i bought like 10 or so so far x-d medieval *yoda*

4 amazing little set. it seems this year that there are no crappy castle sets. good review.

3 ugly. as. hell. but an awesome parts pack, worthy of purchase.

4 thanks for the nice review. it's butt ugly to me but the motors + ir control seem pretty neat ! even at that high price, it looks like a good parts pack ! *sweet*

4 i didn't spot this great review earlier. thanks for the effort of posting all those pics and videos, they helped me decide that this set is worth getting.

4 got this baby via shop@home a little early and i though it was time to post my view of this set : (snefroe you need to get this one ;-) ) sorry for the lack of pics but there are already many pics online of this baby so here it is : best space set since... a way too long time this is my first new space themed set since more than 20 years and i must say that i’m not disappointed at all. i have much to say about this little gem. first, let’s cut it straight about the martians minifigures: they are absolutely rubbish. i can’t imagine how lego could produce such atrocity. this said; let’s move on to the dropship. a real piece of art. reminiscent of the aliens movie dropship. the cockpit is spacious and provides a great field of view, too bad there is no hinges to open it, you must remove the canopy completely to switch pilot. the drilling unit can be attached under the ship with the clever use of a rubber piece. it stays well in place once attached, good point. some people don’t like the inclusion of the 2 containment area for the martians and crystal on both side of the ship but i kind like it, it makes the ship less empty. the 2 wings are complete with air intake, some armaments and 1 standard launcher on the right wing. normally i don’t like launchers but this one is very discrete and well integrated. on the tail section are 2 thrusters that can be rotated and provide thus some “realistic” movements to the ship. one of the last highlight of this ship is the landing gears, or i must say landing dishes. 6 medium sized radar dishes provide and incredible stability to the set. they are quite sturdy and can take a beating. i’m not going to review the alien spaceship in detail since it’s quite uninteresting. i consider it more like a bonus addition to the set than anything else. the look is passable and there are some interesting building techniques in it. that’s all. to end the review, a little pros/cons table. (we all love pros/cons table :-) ) pros: - incredible design - at last a decent space set - modular functions - quite sturdy - beautiful - great value for money cons: - martians are rubbish - no hinges for the canopy - the drilling unit could use some more details. score: 9/10 by the way , i added a nice cool feature on my site , you can download the stickers for some sets that i own. before building i always scan the stickers, we never know it could come handy. check this out on my site (you need to go in the lego lists on the left): [vtx] classic games

4 great review, i must admit i didn't like mm at first site, but seeing this review and looking at the mm boxes at stores appeal to me rather greatly, i may get a couple of these sets, great job! *y* :-)

4 great review *sweet* maybe i will buy this one... but not this month... buying lego in billund has left me totally broke :-x :-$

4 nice review!

1 i already made my 5 cents to this horrible colour bastard :-x :-x :-x in ickelpetes thread, but i wanted to clarify about this: dunamis, on jul 13 2007, 10:41 pm, said: finally, i?ve never seen one of these before (although someone will no doubt rattle off a dozen sets where you can find this part in about 5 seconds): here?s one of the sets it?s included in: it didn?t even take me 5 seconds. ;-) :-p

4 thanks for the bonus review. i am still on the fence with this one so every opinion is good! dunamis, on jul 14 2007, 07:41 am, said: but what about the at-at??? in case you don't know, the at-at in the dark side development kit had a single motor and a moving head. it worked by the head simply swinging from side to side due to balence shifts. i suspect the at-at will be same. i also think that there will be no remote for it either. edited by sinner, 14 july 2007 - 11:31 am.

4 thats a nice looking dino set there! great review, dunamis! also, on this side of the border (see that big thing above the us? thats canada, where i'm from) byob still means bring your own beer. my uncle is already on his third molsons. edited by lieutenant colonel thok, 14 july 2007 - 02:21 pm.

1 oh, is he ugly or what? i've never seen a dino that needed to go on a diet more then him. :-d but i'd get him for the pieces; all those lime-green pieces. *drools* but, meh, i'm not really in to mindstorms, so i don't think i'd get this. but anyway, nice review, i now know exactly what he's like. kml

4 awesome reveiw, thanks! i gotta get this one!!! *y* *wub*

4 i kind of like the design of this, but more importantly i really want to get my hands on the power functions motors and ir control system. i'd prefer the 8275 technic bulldozer, but there's no way i can stretch to the ?100 price tag, so i was thinking i would have to see if i could get a 4958 monster dino cheap in the january sales. then two things happened today. firstly i saw the dino in tescos reduced from ?70 to ?55. then my wife said she'd buy it for me for christmas. wow! that's never happened to me before. i love my wife! *wub* can't wait till christmas now!

4 great review! thanks for doing it. i'm a big fan of this set, the minifigures are good, as is the parts selection. i like the piece used in the cockpit to secure the minifigure in place. i would've liked to see some panels in the cockpit though rather than translucent red pieces, that said however they are useful pieces.

4 pretty good first review! this looks pretty great, i probably won't be getting it due to budget constraints. (bionicle) but still, very nice set. to me it kinda looks like the missing link between when the at-st evolved into the at-at. also, i know the rebels stormtroopers get a lot of hate, but i really like them. thanks for the review!

3 whats behind the printed 4x4 dome? is that 2x4 yellow plate? im planning to replace that.

3 great set, really impressed. odd that lego didn't include stickers for the controls - can't think of a reason they wouldn't have. and why do only 3 of the 4 figures have leg printing? i just can't understand lego at times

3 i built this set and i think the two rubber pieces holding the both sides of the face is a bit stretched out therefore making the set somewhat tight for entire top hatch to open and close. does anyone have the same situation? is this right? -------------- never mind i got it! i built the back a stud too long! edited by namioik, 29 december 2014 - 03:04 am.

3 the legs are about 2" shorter than the at-at; its cockpit is a little larger than the at-at's "head;" it doesn't look out of place as an escort-type walker or heavy walker, especially as both are built in the same style, although if scale differences really bother you the most recent at-st is probably a better bet for you. edited by hjmediastudios, 29 december 2014 - 04:32 pm.

4 knightsword, on 01 january 2015 - 02:27 am, said: i meant the mold opposed to the paint job. the mold wouldn't really work. the way they did it is actually very accurate.

4 i want more of the story you made! also, ace review.

4 brilliant review and thanks for plenty of detailed shots of the interior, i may invest in this set but ill have to wait until 2015 star wars is sorted and budget for the arrival of pirates in april!

4 firstly, great review ++++++ i was really on the fence on this one. this review has greatly changed my view on this modular. a definite buy for me. love the interiors and the whole concept. the more i see it the more i see the little features which put this set apart or at least slightly different from the others. of course great playability for the younger lot and i think a nice building to give any lego city more character and colour...

4 great review oky! i really love your introduction text. you put a lot of effort in this review, with lots of nice touches. well done for me the set gets 4 out of 5. it's a great set, but there's something preventing me of giving it 5 stars.

1 great review! the intro was great, but i'm still not convinced on this one. the height seems too small for comparison with the rest of the modulars. the play features are ok but i wish it would have been taller.

4 this modular building will be my next set! thanks for the review!

4 thanks dude. this is a great set. can you please take more pictures? thanks

3 natelite, on jul 15 2007, 12:20 pm, said: seems like they infuse system sets with more technic bars. must be that technic isn't selling too well and they want to educate ppl how cool technic can be. :-p it's quite apparent when even the small bike needed technic frame. my guess it's less expensive and complicated to produce. they're also using these parts in other themes, so in the end, they're producing a smaller catalog of bricks but every part gets produced in larger quantities.

3 thanks for that very interesting review, snefroe1. *y* that vehicle looks really nice, with a lot of playability, but too much technic brick construction for my liking. it seems like there?s pretty much space wasted inside of it, some kind of small laboratory or a room for the crew and at least a mining toolshed would?ve been cool.

4 awesome review, if i pick up any mm sets, it will definately be this one!

3 i echo the consensus of this thread - too much technic, looks great, too expensive, looks great.

3 please build the alien craft, i'm sure that we would all like a review of that! ^_^'

4 snefroe1, on jul 16 2007, 07:19 am, said: ok then... i'll do that later on... but i will not touch that plastic residu! x-d you touched them to put them in their holders in the ship. so in theory, you will not review them. anyways, nice review. i don't think i'll get this though. i'm trying to decide between this, moble devastator, or anothe 90$ set. i need to get something large before my b-day... regards, ~vbbn~

4 great review, wonderfully detailed. don't care for the ship at all. it's that 'technic under a hollow shell' thing like the ctt. if it wasn't for the figures, i would have hated it, and nothing about these figures excites me. i'll end up finding the least number of sets possible to provide at least one of each figure for the general population collection and skip the rest (unless they do as i expect and flop here, thus leading to huge discounts). i like this set ... at half off. ;-)

1 i agree iamded, life on mars, while not even that truly great, was far better than this line! >:-( i am hoping the next space line lego does takes place in just that! space! |-/ by the way iamded, i continue to stalk you....... batbrick away! >:-)

3 the review is very well done. thanks! i don't know the movie. my key question is whether the bricks in the set will allow to build my own snow/ice creations. now, with "trans-glitter" being part of the design approach i am not so sure. can those who have already bought it tell me: can trans-glitter be used as "transparent with snow particles" or is it just terrible? i cannot really tell from the review pic above.

3 i see the cookie smugglers from the detective's office have already infiltrated other lego themes.......

1 good and helpful review again, whitefang. i probably have no use for a lionish creature with goofy looks...

3 what's up pups? i have written a review for 7786 batcopter: the chase for scarecrow on my website: brickzone.net as usual it involves fabuland figures involved in a crazy story. enjoy and feel free to let me know what you think. thanks! x-d click on the picture to read the review...

4 that was a great review with loads of excellent pictures. the set is better than i thought. i want to buy one of the new sets as i would love a blue batman, but they are so expensive for australians. i love the new pumpkin heads. the story involved more mini-fig cruelty; excellent! i also liked the scarecrow/crow joke. :-d (one request; please don't say lines like "to the batcopter" next time. that is the old tv series and i hated that. >:-) feel free to tell me to stick my request up my m#g@bl*cks.)

3 hinckley39, on jul 18 2007, 04:51 pm, said: sinner, thanks brother! and yes please take your request and stick it...back in your heart where it came from! :-x i know you mean well, but i love the camp!! i purposely put "to the batcopter" and my favorite "the jig is up!" in there because it's so ridiculous. and don't you know requesting me not to do it will only encourage me to do it more? i annoy because i love... *wub* i thought you would like it! i am pleased to say that i didn't know that "the jig is up!" was also a common line. most of what i remember about the old batman tv show actually comes from the movie as i own that. (mum bought it for me.) i tend to put in on if i have friends over and i am drunk enough. i like the darker side of batman only, and thus anything that is against the idea that batman is as big a loon as the guys that he hauls in i don't like. joel schumaker's movies fall well within that category. hinckley39, on jul 18 2007, 04:51 pm, said: the crow is my favorite part. :-$ i'm happy to be swaying you over to the side of mini-fig suffering >:-) it sucks that your pricing is so different over there. perhaps if you're a good sinner (?) santa will bring you some evil pumpkin heads for christmas. or whoever brings you presents over there...a magical wallabee flying a didjeridoo, i presume... :-p santa brings presents here. in the middle of summer, in full winter rig. he is a hero. at least he can come down chimneys here without being burnt :-p ! but i am not too badly done by. i should be buying some more (non-licensed) lego goodness tomorrow...

1 great review! funny as allways! the comic was just a hell lot of fun. it really had me laughing. i would love to have this set but the price is just to high here, far worse than i had expected. i'll be better off buying the battank, which is much better priced. actually there is almost no price difference between the batcopter and the battank here *wacko*

(they are 60 aud and 120 aud.) i am still not sure if i will buy either... :'-( edited by sinner, 18 july 2007 - 11:47 am.

3 hinckley39, on jul 19 2007, 12:59 pm, said: i really like batman, batman returns and batman begins. i like the first one (although i have seen it too much now), love the second one and am undecided about batman begins. i didn't like how he insisted on wasting time with the backstory, and i especially didn't like the certain over repeated lines like "mr wayne, why do we fall down" and "you should learn to mind your surroundings." brainbox, on jul 19 2007, 08:30 pm, said: i love the 60s show, even though i've only seen the movie. sure it was camp, not batman, and often ridiculous, but so what? that was the charm. i think that is the truth. the old batman tv show had its good points (not many if you ask me), but it isn't really batman. joebot, on jul 19 2007, 11:40 pm, said: what about the cartoon??? batman: the animated series will always be the definitive batman to me. i agree 100%. i think the best batman movie is mask of the phantasm. incidentally, i love your new avatar copmike. fabuland has a certain charm... edited by sinner, 19 july 2007 - 03:11 pm.

4 out of nowhere this set appeared at my local tru. hadn't been expecting this one for a while, so a nice surprise. *sweet* firstly the box. nice pic on the front. good selection of minifigs. the officer and pilot look cool with their dark blue trousers. a new r2 unit as well. don't remeber this in the film, but great to have one in a new colour. *wub* back of the box shows some of the ship's nifty features. first thing you notice when you open the box, is the awesome selection of bricks. this makes a for a great parts pack. loads of unusual red and dark red pieces. it's so refreshing to see a star wars set that isn't predominantly grey. there are also two instruction booklets. as soon as you open the first booklet you hit an error. why would i want two obi-wans? :-| it's also at this point that you come across a big disappointment. on the box you get a flesh qui-gon. what is actually in the box is an epiii obi-wan. come on lego - why change it? |-/ all the figures look impressive in the flesh despite the big mistake. once i started the build it progressed rapidly. red pieces seem to be a lot easier to find. lots of clever techniques. quite a few technic elements get used at the start. it reminded me of building a technic set from the 80s at times. here is the main body half way through the build. the landing mechanism is a nice touch. its not fully retractable, but still folds away nicely. you find the ship keeps tipping over as you build it despite the feet, as it's only at the end thay it all becomes evenly balanced at both ends. here the feet are extended. you can also see the yellow knob that rotates the radar on top of the ship. landing gear up viewed from the front. here are the radar. a great collection of dishes. they spin easily with little friction. here is the ship at the half way point. the front works well with the top flipping up to squeeze in the pilot. more to come... :-)

4 kernow, on jul 22 2007, 11:36 pm, said: 7665 review part 2 there's one more useful feature. the whole ship can be safely and comfortably picked up by two ball ended technic pins towards the back end. it balances well at this point and does allow you to swoosh the ship around much more easily. yeah, nude swoosh on x-d! excellent review! this looks like a very nice piece of lego-enginereing *y*! like you i think it looks like the original. i did think though that it was supposed to be a un-armed ship but i can defenitly live with that x-d! the escape shuttle looks roamy enough, a bit dull though but it could have a ps iii stached away somewhere, but the other shuttle :-| - come on! is it for mini-me when he needs to go and get some burgers & fries? getting at least two on copmike

4 thanks for the review! i'm glad to see lego including details of everyday life, like the food (though a plate would have been nice). steve

4 yes, that was definately an optic illusion. looking at it again, the gap looks a lot shorter. thanks. :-) shakar

4 thanks for the review! mutley777, on aug 2 2007, 02:37 pm, said: i have no idea what this is meant to be! :-d that's to put the snowspeeder on (there should be a 2x4 plate underneath the snowspeeder that fits in that gap).

4 wow you are so lucky to have that sett ! , men ! tlc dont let me wait! , ?hh i mean tru

4 *y* awesome reveiw on an awesome set!!! i gotta get me one of these!! *y*

4 don't worry guys, the snowspeeder fits through the door easily :-)

1 i thought after the king's royal castle uproar about stickers, lego would have gone back to printed bricks. obviously, it is all about costs these days and not about keeping people happy.

4 the snowspeeder is love.

4 great looking set ... how much was it ?

4 mutley777, on aug 2 2007, 05:00 pm, said: yep! very reasonable *y* not too bad ... might have to pick that up soon then, i will be in tru in southampton over the weekend ;) i think i'll buy the bigger sets here and get the smaller ones in the usa later in the year. the smaller the boxes, the more chance i will have getting them in my suitcase ;) i have to say, i am very glad we are now not getting a 1:1 ratio between the numbers used prices in usa vs uk (e.g. it is not longer ?49.99 = $49.99) :)

4 nice review mutley *y*! i agree with all your observations, especially stickers versus printed parts |-/! i get some of this and replace the snowspeeders with my v.2?s. hoth on copmike

1 man the stickers on everything are really starting to irritate me a lot. i'm not sure i like the white 3p0, in a set that is primarily made up of whites. doesn't stand out enough. the snowspeeder looks a lot shorter than previous versions. steve

3 review - 42039 - 24 hours race car introduction when the preliminary images of the "le mans racer" surfaced somewhere last year (2014) it got a lot of praise. this changed dramatically when the final images of the 24 hours race car showed up. the front side of the car, especially the head lights, and the curvature of the side of car had changed a lot. the car obviously still resembled the prototype, but the new design raised a lot of eyebrows. the new design was considered a step back instead of forward. eventhough i still liked the design, i must admit i liked the earlier design better too. with the emphasis on past tense liked. i am not sure anymore and this review will show you why. like the arctic truck this set has a b-model which is well worth checking out. that's why this review includes both the a-model and b-model. for people who are on the fence, the b-model might actually convince them to buy the set after all. let's see what this set is all about! note: all images can be clicked for hi-res versions. set information number: 42039 title: 24 hours race car theme: technic released: 2015 part count: 1219 box weight: 2110 gr box dimensions: 47,8 cm x 37,3 cm x 8,7 cm model dimensions: 40 cm x 18 cm set price (msrp): €99.99 / $? / £99.99 price per part: €0.082 / $? / £0.082 links: brickset, bricklink the box the box measures 47,8 cm x 37,3 cm x 8,7 cm and weighs well over 2kg (2110 gr to be precise). the width of the box is the same as the box of the arctic truck. this box also feels like it's filled to the brim. the front the front shows a picture of the main model in action, with radial blurred wheels to emphasize the motion of the car. the lower right section shows the dimensions of the model. upon completion, it will measure a length of 40cm and a width of 18 cm. the back like the front, the back side has exactly the same setup as the box of the arctic truck. the top shows the functions of the model, while the lower left side shows the b-model and the lower right side shows the motorization options. the picture of the b-model looks so cool, it could be a model of it's own. at this point i was very eager to build both models and compare them. the side one of the sides usually shows a part in 1:1 scale. this time it's one of the wheels indicating the size of the model. content of the box the box contains: 1 book(let) 1 sticker sheet 13 bags 4 tires instruction booklet since i own two copies of the set, i also received two instruction booklets. what's catching my eye is that my second copy is supplied in different packaging than the first one. it's for the first time (that i am aware of) that the instruction booklet and stickers come in a sealed bag, without cardboard back. hopefully this will be a new standard for all sets with sticker sheets. instead of multiple booklets, this set contains a single square bound book. in earlier reviews i have epxressed my preference for a single book. i don't see any advantage in having 2, 3 or even up to 6 booklets. sticker sheet like the actual model, the sticker sheet looks very vibrant. the bright green, white and black color combination has found it's way to the stickers as well. either you love 'em or hate 'em. since i started writing reviews i have been applying stickers and i am happy i started doing it. stickers do give the model it's finishing touch. bags with parts thirteen bags with a total of 1219 parts (give or take a few) are supplied in the densily packed box. the rims and flex are sealed in a bag as well. sometimes looking at the bags makes you wonder what the logic is, behind the distribution of the various parts across the different bags. well this time it really got me confused. take a look at two of the bags below. there's a bag containing all the 3l blue pins. then there's a bag with various parts....and a single 3l blue pin. i figured this might be an error, but both of the sets have the same anomaly. tires the tires have been supplied unbagged, as usual. highlighted parts this chapter describes new and interesting parts. this set actually contains a lot of them. this set also contains an abundance of panels. if you aren't into panels, this isn't the set for you. changeover catch this year (2015) the new changeover catch parts were released. it's a combination of three parts. the advantage of the new parts is that the red gear is the same on both sides, which avoids mounting it the wrong way around. it also avoids the changeover catch slipping out of the driving ring, like it used to do. you can apply lots of pressure, but the catch doesn't slip out. pins some of last year's new pins are also included in this set. 12 x pin with pin hole and 21 x 3l pin with 1l axle. securing technic beams can be quite simple with the new pin with pin holes. the new 3l pin with 1l axle gives you more possibilities when connecting beams and other parts. below are two example situations where the new pins have been used. granted, the examples below can be accomplished by using other techniques. however, some predicaments from the past can be easily solved by using these new parts. like me, you will most likely appreciate the ease of use. engine and suspension also included are two steering portal hubs and steering portal hubs with ball joint arms and four steering portal axles for driving and steering the vehicle. these parts are commonly used nowadays. the picture below also shows some other parts, like gear rack, steering arms and suspension. frames this set comes with a single 5x7 frame and three 5x11 frames. panels this set contains a whopping 47 panels in three different colors. i personally like panels a lot and i do appreciate the variety we have at our disposal lately. this set even contains a new 13x3x2 curved "mudguard" panel. new 13x3x2 curved panel this is the first set to contain the new 13x3x2 curved panel. looking at the pictures doesn't do these panels justice. in real life they are actually quite big. i figured they would be smaller, but they are even longer than the 11 x 5 frame, with a length of 13 (including the attachment points). hopefully this part will be available in other colors as well, preferably white, for adding variety to your ev3 robot. 19l white flex-axles the white 19l flex axles have only been released in a single set, the 8461 williams f1 racer in 2002. current prices on bricklink are as high as 15 euros! needless to say we are very happy with the return of these white axles. now we can build jeroen ottens' awesome alfa romeo 4c spider for a decent price as well. i am really happy that useful rare parts are being used more often by tlg designers part list here's the complete list for all 1219 parts. as you can see in the highlighted parts section, this set contains a lot of interesting and useful parts. if you don't own sets like the 8070 - supercar, this might be the set to pick up if you want to start building your own supercar. the build enough with all the set and part information, let's build the model. rear suspension the build starts with the rear suspension and drivetrain. as you can see in the picture below, the length of the axle between the steering cv joint is 4l, where it usally is 3l. this is an indication that the finished model will be a bit bigger than usual (8070 for example). the finished suspension is one of the cleanest suspension setups i have seen in an official model. it's pretty basic, but it works like a charm. this setup is defintely worth using in your moc. here's a video: after attaching the suspension to the frame you rotate the module and secure it. at this stage the rear section of the chassis with suspension is almost finished. v8 mid-engine extending the chassis forward results in the picture below, where the front spoiler is already visible. what's also visible is the v8 engine placed right in front of the rear axle, resulting in a mid-engine setup, perfectly suited for sports and race cars. two exhaust pipes have been fitted on either side of the engine, together with two hoses attaching them to the engine. the instructions are easy to follow, although you sometimes you need to bend the beams a bit. minor improvements are possible here and there, but nothing shocking. front suspension the front suspension is a bit more complicated than the rear suspension, which makes sense considering the fact it contains the steering rack. the shock absorbers are placed in a different angle than the rear ones, resulting in a somewhat stiffer front suspension. all in all the front suspension is well designed and the steering rack can be easily powered with a servo motor. the picture belows shows the front suspension attached to the chassis. if you follow the official instructions to motorize the model, the area in front of the suspension is used to mount the battery box. when you are modding this model to make it full rc this area can be used to mount the servo motor. gearbox like the gearbox in the 8070, it's not used to switch gears powering the drivetrain. it's used to switch between two functions, opening the doors and the hood/bonnet. the gearbox is located at the left of the vehicle, near the cockpit. the mechanism to open the doors is located on the left side, while opening the hood/bonnet is taking place at the right side. to accomplish this, some axles traverse under the cockpit to the other side of the vehicle. following the axles to other side of the vehicle and adding some gears, results in the situation below. the video below shows the gearbox in action. door opening mechanism the mechanism to open the door is comprised of some knob wheels, links without stoppers and pins with towballs. take a look at the doors opening and closing. the front using the new mudguards and various other panels you finish the front of the car. the front is probably the most controversial part of the car. this is caused by the preliminary pictures shown before the release of this car. in the early pictures the front of the car had smooth curves and beautiful lines, while the final car lost these smooth lines and got a more blocky look in return. i must admit that at a first glance, the new design lost some of it's appeal. however, this model grew on me pretty rapidly. the headlight design can be found, in more or less the same way, on several real le mans type race cars. the rear the rear of the car looks great, with the stickers continuing from the mudguards to the panels underneath the spoiler. the two exhausts sticking out give some details to the back. i absolutely disagree with all the negativity surrounding this car. maybe it's one of those models which needs to grow on you. finished model here it is, the finished model. i know some of you don't like the looks of the car, but i think it looks great. the color scheme is outstanding. the new (for technic) bright green parts, combined with white and black make this car look very vibrant and colorful. i am not a big fan of the green used in the 42008 - service truck, but i do like this bright green a lot. it fits perfectly well with the mindstorms ev3 set. the curves on the side of the car are not as smooth as some of us hoped, but i still think the car looks more than acceptable from the side. the stickers add some nice details to the car, giving it that characteristic race car look. the model looks great in pictures, but it does even look better in real life. i love this picture of the front of the car. however, i do wonder if a dedicated 24 hour le mans racer has the seat and steering positioned off-center?! using the good ol' google machine i come to the conclusion that they do have centered seating and steering, at least the majority of them. there's ample space in the cabin, which makes me wonder why tlg decided to place the seat off-centered. the rear view looks cool too, with some of the suspension showing and the two exhaust pipes clearly visible. the bottom view is very useful to determine the size of the car in studs. it measures approx 59 x 27 studs. the chassis looks organized and well designed. the engine has been placed close to the ground, which is perfect for the weight distribution. a low center of gravity improves the handling of the car. i really enjoyed building this baby. the build is very clean and organized, although there are some steps where you need to bend the beams a bit to get things into place. seeing the model come to life and seeing it grow to pretty impressive proportions is very satisfying. for me it was fun, but i reckon kids will go nuts over this set and the build. size comparison what became obvious during the build, but what's emphasized when you have finished the model, is that it's quite big! the size of the car is pretty impressive. the pictures below show the car next to the 42030 - volvo l350f. the side view emphasizes the size of the car. it's even longer than the volvo, if you dismiss the bucket. parts left some parts left. nothing out of the ordinary. features and functions unlike the b-model, this model doesn't implement any unexpected features. the functions it does implement are exactly what you would expect from any car. steering (hog) working fake engine suspension opening doors (gullwing style) opening bonnet/hood opening trunk gearbox for switching between functions unfortunately the steering wheel hasn't been linked to the hog (hand of god) steering mechanism. placing the seat in the center would have provided an easy way to link the steering wheel to the steering mechanism. it's a shame we hardly see actual steering anymore. opening the hood actually opens up the entire rear section of the car, providing you with easy access to the motor compartment. the mechanism to open the hood works properly, which results in smooth opening and closing of it. the same goes for the gullwing style doors. both functions are operated manually and you need to switch with the lever to the left of the cockpit. these two functions are also the ones which can be motorized by placing an m-motor near the cockpit and a battery box in the trunk. all things considered i think this car offers lots of playability. the model is solidly built and the functions are easy to operate. i'd say it's pretty safe to let your kids play with it. b-model unlike the a-model, the b-model for this set received (almost) universal acclaim, and i can see why. often the b-model is a pale shadow of it's part donor. in this case the model looks so good, it could be a model of it's own. it even incorporates a neat feature, which actually deserves to be in the a-model. there's a lot a variation in the quality of digital building instructions tlg is providing, but these ones are of very high quality. the picture below shows most of the chassis with suspension, fake engine and gearbox in place. finished model some concessions have been made, but overall the car looks fantastic. the black of the roof has been extrapolated from the hood, which definitely works for me. the rear section of the car feels a bit empty, but the panels do cover up most of it, so it's hardly noticeable. the v8 stickers will be upside down if you use the parts from the a-model. since i could apply new stickers, i have placed them using the proper orientation. the bottom of the car shows the chassis. it's obviously a bit smaller than the a-model's chassis. features and functions taking the functions into account, this model isn't playing second fiddle to the a-model. besides the obvious functions like steering, opening doors and hood, this car features folding fog lights, which deserve a better podium than a b-model. steering (hog) working fake engine suspension opening doors (manually) opening hood/bonnet (manually) opening trunk (operated by gear) folding fog lights (operated by gear) gearbox (used to switch functions) fog lights one of the most interesting features of the b-model are the folding fog lights. it almost feels a bit weird that a feature like this is implemented in the b-model, instead of the a-model. below are 4 steps showing how the mechanism works. i have also included a video. the mechanism is somewhat reminiscent of fork mechanism used in the 8109 - flatbed truck, which has been described in efferman's review. take a look at the video to the fog lights in action. parts left a fair number of parts left, which isn't uncommon for a b-model. summary to summarize how i feel about this set, you need to take a look at the picture below. the combined image reflects the quality of this set....or better yet....sets! you actually get two great models, for the price of one. you don't like the a-model? no problem, you can have lots of fun with the b-model. i can't stop playing with the fog lights, it's mesmarizing. the color scheme on both models is outstanding. i simply can't emphasize enough how well this color scheme pleases the eye. the regular green is dull and boring, but this bright green really pops out, especially when combined with black and white, and possibly some red details. black, white and a little red?! sounds familiar? yes, bright green can easily be combined with your ev3 robots. so while you are combining the bright green with your robot, why not use the great new curved "mudguard" panels. these new panels are introduced in this set and they look great. they open up a lot of possibilities in the design department. the build of the a-model is outstanding. it is fairly simple, but since it's so clean, i really enjoyed it a lot. i think the build should be entertaining, which doesn't mean it needs to be a real challenge. and let's be honest; when is a build really challenging?! the rear suspension is a good example of why i liked the build. it's very simple, yet very effective. works like a charm. the same goes for the other functions in both models. and the star of the entire show can be found in the b-model. how's that for a surprise?! being aware of the fact that i like this model a lot better than most of you seem to do, i really encourage you to give this model a chance. the sheer size is impressive, the color scheme is awesome and you get a bonus model, which is actually worth building. score okay, so how do i grade this set? 8 design open to debate, but i like it a lot. 8 building experience fun and clean build. 9 features superb function in b-model steels the show. 9 playability both models offer lots of playability 8 parts lots of new parts and cool existing parts. 10 value for money two models for the price of one. 8,7 twice the fun i hope you enjoyed this review! more pictures can be found on my flickr page.

4 fantastic review jim, from the quality of the review alone it is easy to see how much hard work you have put into it. i'm with you on the instruction manual, i much prefer one quality bound book over umpteen stapled booklets. already have 2 of these sitting in the build queue, one for display model as i'm a fan of this one and one to build the b model then dissemble for parts, so i'm already sold on his set but still very much enjoyed taking the time it deserves to read through the review and ogle at your pro photography.

4 i was very skeptical of this set because i really thought the redesign degraded the looks of the a-model a lot, but after building it i must say this is an excellent set. good job tlg!

4 ted, have you described your photography setup somewhere? i love the crisp quality of your pictures.

4 great review. i think it look like a great set, both a and b. however the panels are the only thing i would need, but still a great looking set.

4 great review jim.. i have been sitting on the fence about if i will get this set for a while but i saw one built for the first time at a local brick show on the weekend. it definitely looks better in real life than any pics. i have decided to buy one

3 awesome review jim! i love the pictures. i don't like how lego did this model though. too many compromises edited by omikron, 13 march 2015 - 07:24 am.

4 i have been waiting for this set since the pictures for the toy fairs eirlier in the year and i am glad to say i am not disapointed. first the price it is not cheap at ?99.99 but i guess that is typical for a set with this amount of electronics in it.there is no parts count and i have not had time to add up the 2 pages of contents to get a figure. first the box standard flip top with large internal picture and rip to open lid. inside there are no numbered bags in this set which i prefer i like to open all the bags and put all the parts in the box before building. next is a picture on the electronics 2 xlmotors as lego describe them and 2 standard motors. 2 ir receivers and 1 ir transmitter i know these have been discussed before but i really like the thought that has gone into the transmitters/receivers each receiver has 2 outputs to corespond with the 2 controls on transmitter they also have a choice of 4 channels so one transmitter can control up to 8 independant motors by changing the channel switch. the transmitter also has a neat motor direction switch so you can configure the transmitter operation. the set comes with three manuals 1 is the main drive mechanism 2 is the cab and engine and 3 is the attachments front and back. there is also the now standard parts list in the back of the third manual. there is no alternative model instructions despite the pictures of one on the box however there is a reference to the technic website on the back of the box but at the moment the page only has an advert saying the set is to be released on 1st september so i guess i will have to wait untill then to see if the instructions will be online. the build is fairly straight forward the main chassis is studless, the next picture shows the motors mounted into the chassis and the drive for the shovel and claw. it also shows the v6 technic engine. this next picture shows the ir receivers mounted on the back. the battery box slots into the back and can be easily slid out with the removal of two pins which is useful because i can imagine i will need to change the batteries on a regular basis. the next 2 picture are of the completed model overall i was very happy with the finished dozer the functions work really well and as i have the monster dino i have used a second transmitter so i dont have to touch the channel switch, i have included some video on my brickshelf page. unfortunately this set does suffer from some quality issues for example moulding marks on the plates, colour diferences, some of the pins not finished properly, some pins were very stiff and quite hard to push into the holes but the worst issue was an axle that would not turn freely in a hole which just adds extra friction into the system. i am glad to see some studded technic in this set i much prefer sets that use both varieties of technic beam. there are only 2 fairings which is a great improvment over recent sets if tlc had tried to make the bulldozer shovel with fairings this would have been a complete disaster. marks for the set 8/10 for price with the number of motors i expected it to be greater. 9/10 for fun my kids love this type of set that does something when finished. 6/10 for quality tlc really need to work on this one. 8/10 overall i would definately get a second one if i see it in the sales. feel free to post questions but i will be on holiday next week. more pics and videos available here

4 thank you vey much for this review. i do have some questions; 1. what are the white clutches geared into? 2. is the engine geared to one or both drive motors? 3. how well does it go on carpet? 4. can it doze without breaking the blade?

4 excellent review, thanks! what is the cost in us? not released in my area. the shovel is obviously my favorite area, it looks detailed and strong. i love the treads, because i need them to move the 4 x 4 barrels on my super-scaled turbolaser turret. very good pics too. what color are the treads? i never had them. they are plastic or rubber? edited by grand moff viceroy, 03 august 2007 - 12:34 am.

4 lordgalewind, on aug 3 2007, 03:17 am, said: ah man...i wanted to review it with mine. oh well. here in the u.s. it cost $150 and has 1355 pieces total. the pins and axles did seem a bit difficult in putting them into place. a problem i have been having is the batterys are done after about 4 hours of play, which i really wish they would last longer :-( . overall it is a stupendous set and it is really nice to see our old friend the studs make a return! you found it in the u.s.???? where?? i'm really liking this set! its looking better now that i'm seeing more of it at differnt angles. i'mvery curious how wellit pulls, and and can push/doze before the clutches start slipping.

3 thanks for the review, it really looks cool. too bad it's soo expensive. :-/ i must admit that i prefer the 8421 mobile crane for more or less the same price, the design is more "sexy". *wub*

4 thank you very much for that neat review, ickelpete! *y* your pictures?re very interesting and your video?s really good. that set looks very beautiful to me, a formidable new technic set that quickly?ll turn into an everlasting classic for sure. :'-) i?m just a little sorry for those quality problems.... well, i hope that tlc?ll work on that matter and fix it soon. 8-|

4 nice review, ickelpete. thank you.

4 thank you ickelpete for that great review. i give you two *y* up. i am not a technic fan, but this set definitly looks *sweet* . i see great potential using this set as a model for a smaller dozer for my town/train layout. i really *wub* the crawler tracks they used. i have been thinking about buying the snowmobile for the tracks. but if possible, i just might buy this set instead. i could definitly use the other parts for moc's. model on!!

3 lham, on aug 9 2007, 12:00 pm, said: could you please please post the instruction boolets' number codes (located on the back in tiny print)? so that we can download them from lego.com and have a look for ourselves. when i read this i first though you meant set number but this model can't be found there yet and now i realize that you mean something completly different. what is this code you're after?

4 the new small technic sets have incredible functionality for their size, and this one is no exception. with only 106 parts this crane can roll, extend, rotate, lift (and hold in any position) and has working stabilisers! the boom extends the same as the other sets with this boom; simply pull it. it works surprisingly well and due to circular ridges inside the boom the extension (which is just a standard beam) will hold in place. the gear at the back controls the height of the boom. as you can see the boom is only half extended. boom fully extended, half down. the cable is kept in place via two gears and a blue pin, same as the 7905 crane. even under decent weights this works well. the stabilisers however cannot handle much weight once the load is moved off axis. the stablilsers are a very simple but effective design. another shot of the stablilsers. this also shows how far the boom will decend. the boom height mechanism works well also. i love the cab design. overall this is a remarkable achievement for the low price. i bought it for the boom piece as i want to improve the crane that came with 7998 7898 ( :-$ ). i highly recommend it.

4 thanks for the review. i can't help but think the minifigures are the weak part of the set. snake and apu are great but the rest.... i don't know. they kinda redundant now. they could at least give us new torso printing, like homer wearing his jacket or bart wearing his blue t-shirt or marge wearing her coat. or, as i said in the discussion thread, i'd have included jasper in cmf series 2 and a frozen version here. overall, the set looks kinda smaller than what i thought. (snake's bag needed a $ symbol printed, because it looks like he is stealing gargabe ) pretty good review overall

4 incredible set, thanks for the pics! so many details and unique prints and colors. i'm not that into the simpsons but definitely a top tier set.

4 looks great. how does it compare to the house

4 nice review, i'm building it (need to finish it, but i'm at work right now) with the printed piece, you forgot to show the chocolat milk 1x1 brick, which is exclusive to this set yet (it isn't referenced on bricklink yet, only the blue one) the set is really fun to build, with a lot of little pieces for the fridges. i haven't put the stickers yet, will see the final product to put the essentials ones

4 did anyone else have a problem with the piano against the wall of the simpsons house? it just kept coming off way too easily and i was getting really frustrated with it sticking out and not fully going on so i had to put the two tiles that hold them one place over away from the wall for it to sit properly without falling out, i think i might put snowball ii behind it since cats love to hide underneath or behind things lol but just curious to know if anyone else was encountering this problem with the previous set.

4 great review of a classic set. *y*

4 nice review of a surprisingly interesting set. *y* those windows are great, and no doubt difficult to get. classic coffee maker, simple yet exactly right. that baseplate was in a few other sets, but never with that pattern. would have made a great base for some of the classic 80s houses lego used to treat us to. in tan was part of the adventurers egypt sets. as recently as 2001 it was a base for ogel. versatile plate that hopefully hasn't disappeared completely. parapink is apparently "light pink" on brickshelf, so i guess it's just lighter than normal pink (and stopped appearing in 1995. just so you know, that monkey is drinking too much and likely to fall in the pool ... ;-)

4 awesome set! i really like the robots, and that tiny tank could be quite useful! all the fancy machinery in there really make it more like a lab than a restaurant! :-d the thing i found most funny was the positioning of the middle finger on the hand. :-d :-d definitely gave me quite a laugh. x-d

4 due to a larger bl order in the u.s. i couldn?t resist to add two hopper waggons to my train layout. here?s a review of this fantastic set. the box. well, there?s nothing really special about it. the open box with three polybags. note, that there are only three different colors used in that set (actually there are 4, but you can?t see the dark grey ones). great color composition by the way. *wub* and - no stickers !!! - :-d oooops - i opened the bags too fast. help me, i?m drowning! *sing* not following the instructions, i built the wheels first to get the larger pieces out of the way. keep on rolling. this is the load of the hopper waggon. 11 round bricks altogether. when i opened the set, i was curious if it was a new colored set or an old one. luckily enough it was an old one, with old dark grey. i don?t know if tlc ever produced this set with bley. from the following pic you can clearly see, that the set is an old one. look at these slope bricks. see what i mean? all bricks are looking exactly the same! buy a set today means get at least three different textures on the slopes and maybe even more shades of tan. :-x >:-( i have said that in many other threads here and i?m saying it again: back to the roots, lego! you were able to produce good quality. show us you can still do it! *sad* but now to the building. it?s a 6 x 24 train base plate you?re building on. did i say i liked the colors? :-d this is the mechanism to unload the waggon. built in the waggon with open gates... ... and with closed ones. almost done. this is the first time, i realized that minifigs actually can step on those ladders. :-$ a short lift and the wheels are fixed. this darn mechanism! wait, i?m coming with my monkey wrench! >:-) who opened that door again? do i have to do it all on my own? :'-( finally the work is done. now have a brake. one shot from the front/back. you can see the car is really huge! 8-? i put it behind the red car of the 4512. that sure looked very strange. *wacko* the set fits a lot better to the other cars of the "my own train" theme than to the older ones. the score: brick selection: 10/10 excellent color and brick selection (these were the days...) playability: 9/10 great unloading mechanism price/piece count ratio: 8/10 at peeron it says 20$, i got it for 39,95$ -> 30?/228 bricks. not really cheap, but worth every cent! :-) overall rating: 9/10 and a definity "must buy" for rolling stock lovers. sad enough it?s not available on s@h any more. but there are still sets on bl and ebay. that?s for now folks, thank you for reading. i have some job to do...

4 nice review about a nice set (i like this wagon, but don't buy it, because of the size, compared to my other wagons...). poor minifig who had to build an entire set! :-d

4 *wub* *wub* *wub* *wub* *wub* holodoc, i seriously have some love for your review!! you're in it and using a fabuland wrench!!! such a clever review with a great sense of humor! i really liked this train set and it adds so much to a train layout, especially when you buy multiples. tlc is throwing away a potential gold mine by discontinuing this line. :'-( it is also nice to see those beautiful consistent slopes in that picture. it really is sad that tlc is letting quality slip. they don't seem to be responding to the issue they way they did the bley/frown fiasco. perhaps we afol need to make more of a stink! to the embassy!!! >:-( again great job holodoc and thanks for sharing *sweet* *y* what an excellent and fun review!!

3 holodoc, on aug 17 2007, 05:27 pm, said: i have to add two pics of my freight train showing a bit more clearly what the size matter is about: this is what it looks like when you put the hopper waggon right behind the red car of 4512. i see your point. it looks slightly out of place.. :-p

4 yes my spongebob fans, its time for another review !! lets look at our bikini bottom map and head strait to meet miss puff at her boating school. she is waiting for us to give us a guided tour of her establishment ;-) another bit of sb history: this set comes from the following episode: boating school: spongebob fails his boating test for the 38th time (what a freaking retard lool). he's so determined to get his license that patrick decides to help him. he implants a walkie-talkie inside sb?s head in order to cheat and tell him what to do. you will say that i am biais but i really enjoy building this set and i really like the sb theme !! lets hope 2008 brings more of that cool spongieness !! but i digress... here are general pics of the instruction booklet and the dss (g there are loads of crappy stickers in that one also !!). as you can see the set is divided in 3 polybags. shamelessly (but nonetheless wilfully hehe), i will disregard the third one which is that playability crap course !! i would have reviewed it but since it involves stickers, i didn?t want to ruin the parts and without stickers it would look dull, plain and ugly (it does look crappy with so imagine without), so that review will not be 100% complete and i do apologise in advance. but how many of you would have build that and keep it hehe off :-p 1/ mfs and extras i will start with the really cool miss puff *wub* (the fig mind you !!). she looks a bit stressed !! no wonder, that sponge menace will bring her to the hospital once again hehe. as you can see, that mf comprises 3 parts: the small blue 1x1 round and the 2 major parts. yeay another great stupid looking sb. i love those idiotic faces !! 3 different sb figs and 3 idiotic faces hehe. you never can get enough of them !! here is just a regular patrick. too bad patrick doesn?t have different expressions ! the pull back boat car: nothing really to report (except the fact that i left it sticker free !!) the only thing i built from the third polybag is that pretty cool ancker holding tower thingie !! looks great in a lighthouse set hehe. yes the roud tile bouey is printed !! its the same as in sb's bed in the bikini bottom set ;-) ok, its time for those two great buildings: the lighthouse and the school + pontoon !! before reviewing them individually, here is a general pic. 2/ the lighthouse one of the main reason to own that great set !! sure it suffers from accute stickeretite (sad but :-d ). t worst is that door), but nonetheless a great and simple building !! great white/red colour scheme, and a really fantastic 2 turning lights !! i really like the yellow top of the lighthouse, it adds to the comic atmosphere of that theme instead of having a more plain red/white only. the rear has nothing really fancy, except tools to fix it in case of problems hehe. the only thing i modified since i didn?t build the third polybag is that i got rid of the trechnic parts on the right of the lighthoue to replace them with regular ?logs? all hail the tower king !! :-d 3/ the school and pontoon i really like that little building and its great to see that once again tlc uses the amazing dark blue color !! its really a simple design but looks fantastic and can be used for many things in a town hehe i also really like the combination with those dark bluish grey slopes !! the rear reveals the desk, stickers on the wall (d?oh !!) and two clams serving as chairs (really like on the show). its really great to see that tlc stays really as close to the show as possible. the pontoon again is simple yet really cool and effective. and its really nice to have 2 lifesaving boueys. the only thing i modified since i didn?t build the third polybag is that i got rid of the trechnic parts in front of the pontoon to replace them with regular ?logs? on the overall, i think its really a great set !! apart from the crap stickers, i think tlc should have ditched (or simplified) the third playability polybag to lower the cost !! oh well, parts are always usefull (except those one part shitty palm trees !!). so until my next review, i bid you farewell my spongebob fans !! and i really hope to see next year hehe will sb get his driver?s license one day ? for the sake of bikini bottom, lets hope not !! no license ever on !! *yoda*

4 *yoda* comes through again! i love this set... but it just costs too much for australians so i will be giving it a miss. :'-( it is a shame as it has clams in it... 8-|

4 nice review !! i'm not a big fan of those spongebob figs. however this set has some very useful pieces. this is actually the first time i took a decent look at a spongebob set.

4 a very fine review of a very fine set, thanks sinner. *y* the variety of cool colors in that set?s just formidable. one more beautiful creator set indeed! roaarrrr on! :'-)

3 thank you for the nice review, sinner! i also bought this set but in combination with 4883 when it was on sale (50% - hurray!) at s@h. i made a short review of 4883 but wasn?t really sure what to tell about 4884. so i?m glad you did that for me. :-d i have different feelings about this set. on the one hand i love the lion. he is really impressive (even my wife -not known for being lego enthusiastic- asked me, if there were more animals of this kind). the lion is - restricted - poseable and the colors used are fantastic. *wub* 3 models can be built simultaneously - that?s great! on the other hand i still don?t know what to do with these rotation joints. *wacko* and the other models are somehow disappointing compared to the lion. i seem to have missed the little lizard. :-$ i put it on my "to do-list". like all the creator sets: great parts pack - but wait until they get on sale! x-d for me - i had a lot more fun with 4883. indeed: roarrrr on! ;-)

4 lego 75915 pteranodon capture i'm glad to review this nice set; 75915 pteranodon capture name: pteranodon capture set number: 75915 pieces: 174 price: $19.99 minifigs: 2 theme: jurassic world year of release: 2015 links: box the front of the box has the jurassic world logo along with the set number, piece count, etc. its a decent box size for a $20 set. here it is compared to a minifigure. here's the back of the box. it shows all of the features from the set an ad for the video game. the back also shows a small picture with a silhouette of the dinosaurs from the line, along with their set numbers. instruction booklet the booklet shows the same thing as the front of the box, nothing more, nothing less. near the back of the booklet, there is a picture with all of the characters from the sets. the other page shows all the dinosaurs with a mini box that shows the size comparisons. the minifigures the minifigures in this set are simon masrani and an acu. both of them have excellent printing on the front and the back. the gun is the same one from tlm that the ssp used. simon masrani is the only one with a double sided face. his second face shows a scared/worried exp<b></b>ression. he has a zipped up jacket or jumpsuit with a shirt underneath. the acu trooper only has one face which is a scared/worried exp<b></b>ression. i would have a scared exp<b></b>ression too if i was about to get eaten by a dinosaur. he has great detail on his torso and legs. let's take a look at the vest. the vest is the same mold from the ssp in tlm i think. it has the letters acu on the front too. the back is nothing interesting. pteranodon the pteranodon has great printing too. the colors match the ones that the pteranodons from the movie have. the wings, mouth, and head are a rubbery type of plastic and are easily bendable. it uses the same mold from the pteranodon in the 2012 dino line. here's a comparison between the two. spare parts the spare parts aren't many, just a few extras. the helicopter at first the helicopter was 'meh' when i first saw it on the box. now that i've built it, i've got to say that i really like it. its my favorite helicopter of all of the ones i've built. its sturdy and sleek. it's not too bulky either. the first play feature in this set is the net launcher. it works pretty well, not one of my favorite features but it does what it's meant to do. the other play feature is on the other side. its a stud shooter which can be used by a minifigure. you can put it on their hand or you can leave it there and let someone operate it. the shooter can fold up inside the helicopter as well. there are stickers on both sides of the helicopter and they also have the jurassic world logo with dino marks. final verdict value: 9/10 - for $20 this set isn't that bad. the parts count is a little low for a $20 set but the price is probably because of licensing. other than that, it's a great deal, i would've hoped for maybe some bait for the pteranodon but that can easily be fixed. design: 9/10 - i really love the way this helicopter looks, it's sleekness and design is great. the only flaw this has is the huge net launcher, it's too big in my opinion. minifigs: 10/10[/b] - the minifigures are extremely detailed and it even includes an exclusive minifigure. playability: 9/10 - there are many things you can do with this set. the swoosh factor is great and so are the play features. parts: 10/10[/b] - they're useful parts and there isn't many huge specialized pieces in here either. overall: 9/10 - this set is great for fans of jurassic world, it's also a nice parts pack. there's one exclusive minifigure in here too which makes it even better. having a little fun with the set hope you liked my first review here on eurobricks! please leave any suggestions on what to improve, thanks! edited by thelazychicken, 02 may 2015 - 10:19 pm.

(especially the box front one) but really good for your first review! thanks a lot! thanks! brickg, on 03 may 2015 - 07:49 am, said: this set is imo average. love the dinosaur... i love the dinosaur too

3 great review man, really well written and structured. hoping to go on a hunt and see if this is available in uk stores soon.

4 lego 31036 creator toy and grocery shop thanks to eurobricks for making this review possible! for years, lego has offered a house of some sort in the creator line each year - with the standard creator 3-in-1 instructions, that's given us a very wide variety of housing. in 2014, they added a business option with their 31026 bike shop and cafe set. this continues into this year's toy and grocery shop set. these shops are smaller than the very detailed modular buildings, but that should help them fit in better with the other city sets, and this also lets them get into more kids' cities with their lower pricetag. name: toy and grocery shop set number: 31036 pieces: 466 price: $39.99 minifigs: 2 theme: creator year of release: 2015 links: bricklink peeron brickset the box the front of the box shows the "a" version model out of the three, plus insets of the b and c versions. i like the sorta-european looking backdrop; it goes well with the styling of the buildings. interestingly, the main model is shown opened up for play, while the two insets show those versions folded. the box top on the top of the box, lego helpfully shows that with 3 of these sets, you can make a whole street. the box back on the back, you get to again see all three versions together, but this time, folded. it's a little creepy though with those clones running around :) the manuals yep, three actual, printed manuals. there's nothing indicating them as being a, b, and c models, but it's pretty obvious looking at the designs which is the "main" model and which are the alternates. the contents bags of parts and two plates. nothing terribly exciting to see here.... the minifigs nothing new here, but two nice figs none-the-less. well, bricklink does say that both figs are unique to this set, but there's not any new parts to them. the closest thing to rare is the female head - it's only in this set, 2013's dragon mountain castle set, a uk store grand opening set, and one of the 2014 holiday freebie sets. the faces aren't that unique, but i guess this exact combo of two faces on the head is. i love the kid torso with the spaceman on it. the minifig backs no back printing on anything here except for an alternate female face. sorry. i do like that her two faces are so different though. that's much better than when a head has a "scared" and a "more scared" face. the "c" build enough with the basics; let's build. i'm going to review them in the same order i built them, backwards. since you can tell immediately looking at the 3 designs that they're going to use different numbers of pieces and so forth, i figured i'd build the smallest first lest it seem like a letdown. all three have some basic similarities - the two plates are hinged to give a building that opens for play. they also do have interiors, which you can see starting to form here. the "c" build, front it's a pretty quick build, so it's done already. here's the front of the building with it opened up. like this, it appears to be two separate stores, a newsstand and some sort of shop you can enter. all the printed tiles help give the newsstand a detailed appearance, but i'm not sure why they've got a $100 bill lying on the ledge... the "c" build, rear from the back side, the interiors are pretty plain. the shop half has a plant in a jar and a weird chair, and the newsstand just has a register. the "c" build, sides here's the two sides of the folded building. on the hinge side, there's a bunch of windows in a disjointed wall with random colors. on the other, why did they put in a huge window when the set does include a trans-clear door that could have gone there? and you get a small patch of plants, like so many sets seem to have these days. the "c" build, extras that's a lot of leftovers there. and not just little stuff - multiple doors, stairs, etc. and unused sand green is always a little sad.... the "b" build, 1 a pretty similar start, with the hinge and little garden and some tiles along the ground. the "b" build, 2 now we see a big windowed wall, some details like lights, and how it has the usual alternate model "weird part usage" - like a 1x4 brick with side studs being used over the doorway, even though those side studs will not get used. the "b" build, front the finished building gives us a nice little post office, with a letter-carrying bird on the roof. hope that's not their normal method of delivery! something about the colors just doesn't work for me though. the combo of white / light grey / dark grey / black / sand green plus tan is just too much. the tan window and door frames i don't like. the "b" build, inside on the inside, things are weird. the counter on the left is ok, but the light above the door (with a yellow clip? ugly!) is too big, and everything else over there by the door doesn't make much sense either. the "b" build, sides i like the front side here, except the colors are still too much. the bench, greenery, mailbox on the corner, and streetlight are all nice. the boy is a little creepy though - binoculars in hand plus a telescope on the roof of the post office? why? the hinge side shows more of the weird colors you get in the wall, but that's going to be hidden when the set is open. plus we even see that on big modulars at times, so it's not so terrible. the "b" build, leftovers again, a lot of leftover parts. it's obvious this was another alternate, but it'd be nice to see more of them used to make a bigger building. but let's move on to the model that does use them all... the "a" build, 1 the first half starts like this. maybe it's just my bias, but it already feels like a more detailed build. bottles on the wall, the yellow and red awning over the window, etc. the "a" build, 2 the other half starts off with detailed work too. i think that's a red vending machine. the stairs are also very solidly built. i also appreciate the effort to get that diagonal base where a door will be - it's such a nice touch to have sections of a building that aren't right angles. the "a" build, 3 not too much has been added, but i wanted to showcase the tiny toys before they get hidden by a wall. that robot and train are just fantastic little micro builds. the "a" build, 4 things are coming together quickly. the walls, windows, and doors get the first floor nearly done. i'm still not big on the sand green and tan combo, but i do really like the red and yellow awnings. the "a" build, 5 it appears the shop owner lives upstairs, since we've got a bedroom forming here. the bed is a little plain, but the table and lamp on the other half are great. and my big fingers did not like putting all those railings on the balcony, with the telescope posts and tile tops. knocked quite a few off before i got them all done. the "a" build, front and it's done. all the details make this set really feel like a mini-modular. the roofline has great greebling, and the shop contents, and on and on. it's not perfect though. the tiny car above the toy store door isn't nearly as good as the toys inside. and the kid's yellow scooter? the wheels aren't even on the ground, much less able to roll. the scooter looks decent though, so that counts for something. well, at least as long as you are at this angle, since the boy's only got 1 foot on the 1 stud wide scooter. the "a" build, inside most of the interior has been seen already. the roof though does a nice job of being interesting for a roof. a skylight, the edge rails, etc. and you can see there's not much "wrong color" in the walls. the "a" model, sides an interesting building when folded up. very tall and skinny. you can tell it's not really meant to be displayed this way - it's meant to be open. the good - lots! i like the awning, the diagonal door, the flowerbox under the upper window, the folding gate on the balcony that lets it be used in open or closed mode, and the green / white / blue colors. the bad - well, the stairs end short of the upper door, i still don't really like the tan doorframes (i think black would have been better), and why don't the upper floors match up in size? the "a" model, leftovers ah, that's more like it. just a few small pieces left as spares. the errors you might have to click through to the full-size versions, but i did catch a few weird errors in the manuals. first, in the photo of the newsstand, the map in the front corner is on there sideways. the map does have a clear north arrow printed on it. on the second image, the boy's feet are hanging off the edge. just unusual to see an alignment error in the manual like that. the comparison here are this set and the modular detective office side by side. there's a huge difference - as you'd expect. but is the difference more than you'd expect? this set is 466 parts, $40. the do is 2262 pieces and $160. 5 times the parts, 4 times the price. looking at them side by side, i'd expect a bigger difference in both. the conclusion so, what's my conclusion on this model? i love the main model, but the alternates are meh. it's a nice set for someone looking for a town building other than police and fire stations, but who isn't ready to move to the modular line. compared to the modulars though, it seems overpriced. part of that is because the huge modulars are actually a great deal compared to other lego sets. i'm also a little surprised that it's so small, when you compare it to the city sets like a police station. those are generally designed with much more open space, letting them be more of a playset. this one is small and cramped, so it'd be tougher to play in. it's not really a city set though. the ratings value: 7/10 - it's under the 10 cents a part mark, but that's largely due to having a ton of tiny parts. all those flowers and decorative 1x1 round studs add up quickly! design: 7/10 - good and bad on the colors, and there's a big difference between the quality of the main vs alternate models. having so many leftover pieces is one thing when the creator set makes 3 very different models (ie a boat, plane, and truck). when it's 3 buildings, it seems wasteful to have so many parts leftover. minifigs: 6/10 - i'm not sure they both fit the set. i suppose the boy is going to the toy store and the woman is going to the grocery? but there's no storekeeper in either. the woman doesn't look like a storekeeper to me, so that's why i assume she's another shopper. i love the boy, but the woman is just so-so - except that i do appreciate the head having two very different expressions. but again, that doesn't fit the set. i can't see her scared face being used. playability: 6/10 - the shops are detailed with registers and so forth, but it's all so tiny it'd be hard to play with the figs in it. parts: 9/10 - tons of windows and doors, plus nice sand green bricks. but some things (the large blue curves used on the roof for example) are weirdly specialized and would be hard to use in another building design. overall: 7/10 - i'd recommend doing what i did - build the alternates first, then the main since that's how you'll want to leave it. i'd really like to see the price a little lower compared to other sets (again, the part count is inflated due to so many tiny parts) and the finished building is tiny, but it's loaded with neat details.

1 cheers for putting in the time to create a wonderful review. i am not a huge fan of this set; i like the colour combinations, but it all seems a bit all-too-simple. it can (and will) be nicely modularised, though!

3 thanks 'mostlytechnic' for this review, i only brought this set to continue the shop series from creator. in my opinion it's only half as good as the bike shop/cafe one. plus it doesn't fit the same as that pair of shops, oh well maybe next year lego creator will have a better one. brick on review on 'mostlytechnic' !

4 as a fan of creator houses, i really want to like this set. however, i think that creator houses have long filled a niche that's neglected elsewhere: residential houses. we haven't had a larger residential house since 2013; i'm not sure if these sets have anything to do with that, but it seems like they may be the replacement for larger houses. and i'd much rather have a larger house set than a set like this. i also agree with many others here; something about it just feels incomplete. i think that the various city business buildings we've gotten in recent years (including those in this year's city square--which is much more expensive than this, but also contains much more) make for better buildings at this scale.

3 asuka, on sep 13 2007, 01:15 pm, said: but although i loved the last year?s one, i think they could do another theme (or perhaps even two calendars), because right now castle?s pretty hot imo. really hope they do different themes next year but not sure how they'd managed 24 different minisets for castle? can envisage 7-8 minifigs but what else?

3 whoa! it's out already! *places order* i guess i should thank you andy, because i might have missed this one just like i missed last year's calendar. now all i have to do is wait two weeks and pick it up at the post office across the border.

3 i've never been fond of these sets, but still buy them every year because my daughters like them. i am, however, looking forward to the belville advent calendar, which likely will have some parts that usually are quite hard to get in it. my girls will love it, and i love all the belville parts. http://shop.lego.com/product/?p=7600 if anyone has pics of what is contained in this set i would love to see them.

4 xwingyoda, on sep 13 2007, 06:57 pm, said: ohh tks for the news 8-? it really looks interesting, belville always have great parts in cool colours !! excellent indeed !! *yoda* wow, interesting! lego is really expanding with this advent calendar thing! watch, next year they'll have ones for specific themes, boy o boy, think about it, star wars advent calendar, indy advent claendar. of course, this is only speculation, but it would be cool! x-d i'll probably buy both of these (even though i'm a boy ;-) ) so i get 2 surprises every day instead of one! :-p ;-)

4 a funny review with cool pics, thanks lasse d. a somehow mediocre mecha design, but a beautiful dark green color! upside down mecha yoga exercises on! :-d

4 i have 2 of these guys. :-d it's awesome, only cost me 13 bucks nz, for a comparison, the castle crossbow attack set costs $10 nz. for the win! did i read this wrong? you paid about the same price as the republic cruiser??! the republic cruiser costs $200 nz, and the cyclone defencer costs $13. i must have read that wrong... *wacko*

4 nice review and a nice set. thanks for taking the time. i'll want to pick this guy up.

4 great review lasse d. a definite two *y* up. i bought this set for the swing-wing concept. i was very curious what tlc's design was like. i have been working on modifying it just a little to look more like the f-14. so far i have completed the back section, but i need to finish the cockpit. overall this is a great set. i *wub* tlc's swing-wing concept. model on!!

4 this is a really great set! when i first saw it i thought "oh a silly small plane who needs that" and then i got it and i am very happy that i did! this is one of the best designed lego creator sets! and it was designed by the designer of the cafe-corner!!!!

4 a fine set, a great review and good additional pictures. thanks lasse d and sinner. teamwork on! *y*

4 thanks for this excellent review lasse d! :-) i was thinking about getting this the other day but decided not to. i regret my actions! glad to see creator making great sets, the theme has so much potential, i just wish that this set had more models... |-/ oh well can't have it all, anyway, thanks! *sweet* batbrick away! >:-)

3 sinner, on sep 21 2007, 09:19 am, said: i agree. errr... sorry if i have annoyed you by posting the pictures. looking at your brickshelf folder you had taken photos of the hovercraft as well and i seem to have stepped on your toes. (i prefer bigger pictures as i get tired of clicking, waiting, clicking, waiting. if the pictures are all there all you have to do is click then wait! :-p ) you didn't step on my toes because i took the pictures after you posted them :-p i just wanted to add them for completeness. i can see the loading issue when you click a lot of pictures (i normally hold ctrl down so that they open in their own tabs... but they still have to load). any other opinions?

4 i so need to buy this! where did you get it from? it says limited, so i guess it?s only available in certain stores, as the bridge walker was, or supernova or golden guardian.

3 iamded, on sep 22 2007, 07:42 pm, said: nice! *y* doesn't look that bad at all, but what's with the firs pic? the one of skeleton tower? *wacko* is it so we can see the corner of the intructions? :-p __________________ thats what i was thinking! *wacko* in the future when i buy all the exo-force sets off bricklink or ebay, i'll get this one for the decent yellow mecha, and cool function (carrying mecha), and just for completion sake. most people are getting to worked up over this, one bad set doesn't mean the end of exo-force, though i would like to see less two-legged mechas and more unconventional designs like the shadow crawler and bridge walker. batbrick away! >:-)

3 nightmare_zero, on oct 14 2007, 03:59 pm, said: why are the best sets limited editions? >:-( you can still get it quite easily at s@h or in lego stores. i know of one in oberhausen and in cologne, and i think there?s one in hamburg and munich as well. depending on where you live you might get it in one of those shops fpr 49.99 euros.

4 it is no secret that marvel is one of the most successful companies right now. from the avengers to the x-men and down to even the most obscure characters like ant-man, every one of their movies has been a big hit until now. the latest marvel movie, fant4stic, was released last month and while i have not seen it yet, i'm sure it's just as great as their other movies. i mean, it has the word "fantastic" in the title after all! and being the smart business that they are, the lego company decided to get in on the hype early and capitalize on this movie's undoubtful success two years in advance by making a set featuring fant4stic's main villain, dr. doom. now that's what i call forward thinking! but did they do a good job with it or were they being overhasty? let's find out! set number: 76005 name: spider-man: daily bugle showdown theme: marvel super heroes subtheme: ultimate spider-man year of release: 2013 pieces: 476 minifigs: 5 price: $49.99 usd s@h description: quote swing into the daily bugle and stop dr. doom™! dr. doom™ and his henchman beetle™ are attacking the daily bugle in their speedy jet to steal spider-man's™ secret identity. it's up to spider-man™ and nova™ to swing in and stop them! trigger the daily bugle's explosion functions to cause destruction as the jet fires missiles! stop dr. doom™ from hitching the jet's anchor hook to the safe with spider-man's secret inside! knock beetle™ off the building with the swinging web attack and drop dr. doom™ inside with the rooftop trapdoor! then fly nova™ in through the broken window with the dumpster catapult function and send those villains back to where they came from. includes spider-man™, nova™, dr. doom™, beetle™ and j. jonah jameson™ with accessories and weapons. the first thing that comes to mind after reading this description is: wow, that's a lot of tms! anyway, here are some resource links for this set: brickset bricklink rebrickable the box since this set is based on the ultimate spider-man cartoon, the box has the usual usm design with the red marvel super heroes background, an illustration of spidey in the upper right corner, and the usm logo in the lower right. as usual, there is a minifig line up in the lower left, and since this was before the terrible redesign, you can see the full body of the minifigs. i really miss this type of line up. there is quite a lot going on here: doctor doom attacking the daily bugle in his jet while simultaneously reaching for j. jonah jameson below with his jet's claw, spider-man (reluctantly) swings in to save him, while nova fights off the beetle. it's a pretty cool scene, even though it's not very accurate to the show. in "beetle mania", the episode that this set is based on, the beetle was indeed out to kill jjj, but it was in order to stop him from exposing his identity, not spider-man's (although spidey was next on jjj's list). and while he is a recurring villain on the show, doctor doom had nothing to do with this plot and didn't even appear in the episode aside from a brief cameo. it's awesome that they included him anyway, though, so i'm not gonna complain. note that the tower is so tall that it wraps around the top of the box. there, you can also see a scale reference with the spider-man minifig. on the back of the box, you can see the interior of the bugle and all of its play features which there are quite a few of since this is a playset. it's all illustrated pretty well, although lego's choice of sound effects is still a mystery to me. i don't get why they don't go for spider-man's signature "fwip!" instead of "fazzing!" and i didn't know that a breaking window made the sound "btoom!" but i digress. contents inside the box you will find three instruction booklets (one smaller than the others), a comic book, a fairly large sticker sheet, five numbered bags, and two loose pieces: a white string piece and a gray 16x8 plate. there aren't really any notable pieces and nobody cares about the comic bock (no offense to the artist), so lets get right to the instructions. they are pretty straight forward and easy to follow. some of the pages have a ghostly image of spidey, nova, and dr. doom in the top right corner which is fitting since these are all minifigs that appear in this set (which is strangely not something that can be said for many other super heroes instructions with this type of artwork). minifigures as with most super heroes sets, most people will get this set mainly for the minifigs, so without further ado, let's talk about them. spider-man is the same old bootless one you get in almost every usm set. not much to say about him. some might complain that we don't get spidey's alter ego peter parker in this set, but in the usm cartoon, mj is actually the one who works at the daily bugle, not peter. curse the creators of this cartoon for ruining our chances of getting a new peter parker minifig by trying to mix things up. next we get j. jonah jameson. he appeared in a spider-man 2 set before, but this is a complete redesign. he now has a blue suit with a red tie, a unique face print, and that combed-back hair in dark gray. this new hairpiece doesn't suit him at all and the old flat top hair was perfect for him in my opinion, so i don't know why they changed it. the good thing about this change, however, is the fact that this piece is exclusive to this set in that color. nova on the other hand is spot-on. he comes with a new helmet mold and some nice torso printing. however, he, too, is missing his boots. tlc should have started making dual-colored legs a long time ago. here are some reference images to compare them to. okay, so jjj's hair may not be completely black in the show, but i still think they should have given his minifig a black hairpiece. his suit is also not quite the right color. he rarely appears in person in the show (including the episode this set is based on) and is usually seen on screens around new york, so this is the best picture of him i could find. i guess i should be happy they included a minifig of him at all. in the episode, it was actually mary jane who was at the bugle during beetle's attack, so it would have made more sense to include her, but we got her in the spider-copter set one year later, so that's ok. all three of them have back printing. in jjj's case i'm using that term loosely since it is only comprised of two lines, but it's nice that they went through the trouble of adding them. both jjj and nova come with angry alternate faces. it almost looks like they're trying to out-angry each other. who do you think looks angrier? let me know in the comments section below. now let's talk about the bad guys. even though he would be better off in a fantastic four set, it's great to finally get victor van doom, one of the greatest marvel villains ever and in comics in general. he comes with a dark green hood which was new and exclusive in that color at the time, and he is the only minifig in this set that has leg printing. beetle is a regular minifig with wings. the metallic printing on his face and torso is pretty nice, but i wish it would have continued onto his legs as well. the beetle looks quite accurate to his on-screen counterpart. the only thing that could have improved him is a new helmet mold with pointy eyebrows/antennae. doctor doom, however, looks nothing like he does in the movie. i just don't understand how lego could have messed him up so badly. maybe they were working off of early concept art or something. here is a back view of doom and beetle. beetle would be a pretty boring minifig if it wasn't for his wings which are awesome with their holographic texture. they are so mesmerizing, i could look at those things all day. this piece also appeared in trans. light green in the galaxy squad sets which came out at the same time. here they are without their gear. as you can see, they both have back printing as well. and no, doctor doom does not come with an alternate facial expression, which is fine since you can't see much of his expressions due to his mask anyway. here's a look at dr. doom and nova without their headgear. some say that doom's face looks too cartoony, but i think it looks fine. nova is wearing stylish goggles as a way of explaining his white eyes. it's a far better explanation than the bat-sweatband. they did the same thing with the masked wolverine later. here are all the figs with their accessories. jjj comes with a camera so that he can take "more pictures of spider-man!" beetle comes with one of those overused adu guns which is a very poor representation of his wrist-mounted blasters. i hate to say it, but even those bulky new stud shooters would have been a better representation of his weapons. spidey comes with his usual string of webbing and nova comes with some iron man style translucent studs. the weird thing is that they are red while his powers have a blue glow in the show. doctor doom sadly doesn't get any accessories, but who needs weapons when you have a jet with a claw and flick-fire missiles. the build the first bag contains spider-man, a brick separator, and the parts to build the ground floor of the dbc building. after a quick and straight-forward build, you get this. the dumpster and street lamp are separate from the building and since the lamp post is not built onto any baseplate and is quite top-heavy, it gets knocked over pretty easily. maybe it's meant to be that way, but i would have preferred it if you could stick it onto the baseplate of the building on which there is unfortunately not enough space to do so. as you would expect, the second bag has the parts for the first floor of the building. this is also the bag that contains beetle. after another fairly simple build, you'll find yourself with a two story building with a spiderweb one side and a fire escape on the other. however, you have to apply three stickers during this section of the build which is never fun. can you guess what's in bag number 3? yup, the second floor of the building. you don't need superpowers to predict that one. also, this bag contains nova and jameson. the build of this section is a bit repetitive since the second floor is mostly the same as the first and it takes slightly longer to build since you have to build the rooftop as well. also, in addition to the two window stickers you have to apply ten 2x2 tile stickers! trying to do this without having any of them being crooked is a real pain in the megablocks. the next bag contains doctor doom and the cockpit of his jet. doom's cape is in the usual square white box and the string for the claw is folded up in a piece of tape. here's what you get at the end of this section. looks more like an escape pod than a jet at this point. the final bag is the smallest as it only includes the few parts needed to finish the doom jet. once you build the wings and tail, you stick them onto the cockpit via technic pins and you're done. spare parts these are the parts that are left over after the build. there is the brick separator of course, an extra antenna, and the usual little bits and bops. what's really awesome, though, is that they give you an extra pair of beetle's wings! considering what a neat piece this is and that this is the only set in which it comes in trans-black make this a very welcome spare that you can use in your customs. the finished set here is the complete set. the dbc building looks quite tall, especially when you count the antenna. comparing it to a screenshot from the episode, the general look of the building is there, although there are some inaccuracies. aside from the fact that it is obviously way down-scaled, the screens that show jjj ranting about spider-man should have been hexagonal, not square, and should have wrapped around the building. however, considering how many stickers you would have had to apply if they would have made it accurate, i'm actually glad they kept the screen mercifully small. much like doctor doom himself, the doom jet didn't actually appear in the beetle mania episode. however, it did appear in a later episode titled "not a toy" in which spider-man plays around with captain america's shield, accidentally drops it in doctor doom's latvarian embassy and has to try to retrieve it. and yes, that episode was as godawful as it sounds. here's a screenshot of the jet from that episode. like with the dbc, they managed to capture the general shape of the vehicle, although it doesn't look quite as good as in the show. the color scheme is too dark and it looks kind of blockier. let's take a closer look at the jet. there is no real way to reel the claw in unfortunately. however, there is a stud on the back of the jet that you can stick it onto. needless to say, this is not the ideal way of storing it. i would have much preferred it if they would have attached it onto winch instead. the engines on the wings can be turned, even though they don't turn in the show, and there is a flick-fire missile on each side. even if it's not much to look at, at least it's a very swooshable vehicle. on top of each wing there is a tile with the emblem of latvaria. there was no such emplems on the jet in the cartoon, but they are useful pieces that make it clear whose jet it is, so i'm glad they included them. there is nothing inside the cockpit except for a seat and unless you want to ruin dr. doom's nice dark green cape, i wouldn't put him inside of it. they could have at least printed a control panel onto that empty 2x2 tile. play features since this is a playset, let's look at all the play features it has to offer. like all playsets, the building is open in the back so you can play inside. on the ground floor, there is a potted plant and... nothing else. seriously? is this all they could come up with for this floor? they could have included a security desk, a lounge, a second plant, or anything else! as it is, it's just a boring empty lobby. the first floor is a bit more interesting. there is a safe, a swiveling chair, and a pin board with various pictures of spider-man. there is one tile that reads: "the true identity of spider-man" which is supposedly what the villains are after. i wonder how jameson got this information in the first place. speaking of jameson, the second floor is devoted to his office where he can sit and yell at his non-present employees, demanding "more pictures of spider-man!" it also has a swiveling chair as well as a desk with a lamp and a computer. there is a technic beam connecting his desk with the ceiling of the first floor which you can remove in order to take off the upper half of the building, but it's difficult to do, so i don't recommend it. as you may have noticed in the picture above, there are a few red pegs sticking out of the building. these are for triggering the play features. most of them are on the roof. there is one on what looks like an air conditioning unit. if you place spider-man holding is web-string on the jumper plate in front of it and push the peg, spidey goes bungee-jumping off the building. wee! there is also one that sticks out of the side of the building which when pulled triggers a trap door. the third red peg on the roof can be used to pop off the dbc sign. why is it called the dbc, you ask? it stands for daily bugle communications since in this version of spider-man, the daily bugle is not only a newspaper, but a news tv station as well, one that promotes its own highly biased views. so basically the fox news of the marvel universe. i guess if you're an old school spider-man fan, you could just leave off the "c" and have it just stand for daily bugle. the sign above the main entrance wont be so easily modified however. there is also a peg between the first and second floor which when pushed pops out one of the windows on the first floor. the safe is only attached to a couple of jumper plates and has some jumper plates on top of it as well, so you can easily attach the doom jet's claw to it and rip it out of the building as seen on the back of the box. there are also some snot bricks on the corners of the building that you can attach spiderwebs or spidey himself onto for some wall-crawling and webslinging action. this is not so much a play feature as it is just a feature, but as i mentioned earlier, there is a fire escape on the left side of the building. this was a neat idea as it helps it feel like a building in new york city, but it is executed very poorly. there is no hole big enough for the minifigs to climb down through, so they would have to climb down the ladders from the outside which makes no sense. no wonder spider-man always needs to rescue people from burning buildings. there is one more play feature in the form of the dumpster. you can open the lid, put a minifig inside, and make them jump by hitting a tab in the back. remember, this is before the introduction of super jumpers, but nevertheless it's a pretty strange place to launch minifigs out of. i guess even super heroes like to do some dumpster diving. you don't think this was funny? no? well, me neither, but that's the type of humor that this show loves to use. sigh. anyway, let's get on to the ratings. ratings design: 2/5 - the set looks ok. despite many inaccuracies, the dbc building and the jet somewhat resemble their on-screen counterparts and don't look too bad, but they definitely could be better. build: 1/5 - a mostly unchallenging and repetitive build with an attrocious amount of stickers. minifigs: 4/5 - definitely the strongest point of the set. some of the figs could be better, but four out of five of them are exclusive to this set. doctor doom is easily the best and probably the most desirable one - unless the fant4stic movie portraits him so badly that nobody will be interested in him, but that's impossible. playability: 4/5 - as you would expect from a playset, the playability is quite high, although i still feel like there could have been more. parts: 3/5 - not many rare parts. if you're looking for parts for building your own skyscraper with tan walls and lots of doors and windows though, this set is for you. price: 3/5 - at 476 parts for $50, this set is a bit pricey, but it is somewhat justified by all the large window and wall pieces. overall: 3/5 - this set is mediocre at best. playsets are always a good choice for spider-man sets since they give spidey something to swing from, but unfortunately they are rarely pulled off well. the jet is blocky, the building is bare-bones, and the price feels too high. the only reason to get this set are the four exclusive minifigs. this set was discontinued early this year, but if you still see it on clearance somewhere, go ahead and get one for the minifigs and parts, or buy multiples and use the parts to build a better dbc building. i hope you enjoyed this review. it is part of the reviewers academy's 7th anniversary. we're not doing a big celebration this year due to other commitments, but look out for more reviews with the 7th anniversary banner soon. now, if you'll excuse me, i am off to see fant4stic. i hope it's as fantastic as it promises to be! (2 hours later) i was wrong! i was horribly, horribly wrong!

4 this is my favourite set! should be making more spidey sets like this imo. *cough* oscorp tower *cough*

3 aegis2000, on 13 september 2015 - 02:32 am, said: this set is from 2013, doctor doom is completely based off the comic version/ tv show version, not the movie in any way. anyways, nice review. i personally own this set, and it's a nice set, but could have been better. he's just joking about doom.

3 i actually am surprised at the poor points this set has gotten, as this is one of my favorite sets that marvel has put out. i actually would like to hear what your thoughts are on the usm - lego dr. doom comparison, oky. thanks for the review. http://marvelanimate...or_doom_usm.png edited by zorglorfian, 14 september 2015 - 06:44 am.

3 i'm glad you were joking about doom. i'm not that big of a fanboy, but i had the need to correct you for some reason. with that said, i bought this set for the minifigures a few years ago. looking back, i don't really care about the figures today like i did in 2013. the building is decent for the size of the set though. thanks for the review.

4 thanks for the review.i'm not a big fan of spider man sets, but this set really impressed me. this must because of the design of this set and the minifigures that included in this set.

1 i think i'm the only person in the world who likes fant4stic... was it the best superhero movie? not even close, but i didn't think it deserved the hate it got. it was just incredibly and clumsily mishandled. anyways, great review. i might pick this one up if only for the beetle fig.

3 this set seems to appeal more to the non superhero crowd. it is one of the only marvel sets i bought. mainly because i thought that the building was a nice return to the old style of city sets. i would love to see this sort of backdrop for a more realistic agents theme... i also liked that most of the figs in this set were easier to merge into other (non-super) uses... thanks for the review! god bless, nathan

4 another great review oky. i love this set.

4 hi again! they have arrived *wub*! they come dismantled inside the package instead of one piece like the blackhole stormtrooper did. they have the head and sw-sign made with magnets to clip on to the torso. it actually works even if it feels a bit "cheapish". here?s some pictures - mr vader goes first *vader*: package pieces stormie: package pieces my collection so far >:-) : here?s the blackhole stormtrooper review. boba fett & luke maquette on copmike

4 super-cool! any text on the boxes of these ones? the stormie's left arm seems really long and slightly odd, but that's just because i'm jealous you've got one. :-d shorter than i was expecting though. dr. s.

4 ooh, i want one. i don't care which but i want one. perhaps *vader* ... thanks for the pics.

3 the arms of the stormtrooper are a litle long i think.

3 were did you get these? 8-?

4 nice review. i'll be watching and waiting for the rest.

3 xwingyoda, on sep 28 2007, 07:34 am, said: tks for that comparison pic dunamis ;-) ok the box is big !! i pictured it a tad smaller though !! *yoda* i don't have the ucs isd but from the pic i can see that it is about the same thickness, slightly shorter but much wider than the mf. so this leads me to believe that dimension-wise the ucs mf is more compact. also, notice how in the content, the parts fit in just nice without additional spare space for anything else. strange isn't it that when tlc is responsible for the shipping, we see optimum usage of box spaces. x-d imagine if all boxes were this efficient. $4.99 sets would be no bigger than a match box! x-d x-d the mtt would be reduced to 1/4 its current size! x-d x-d x-d

3 so i see they even do mistakes on these |-/ that beast looks really sturdy !! that is great !! are these yellow parts new ? i am not a technic fan and never saw these before. another question for you: is the instruction book easy to follow, especially regarding the colours. does the black rally stands out comparing to the dark bley and so on ? i sure hope so ;-) can't wait to see moer hehe *yoda*

3 thank you for the review sinner. at first i wanted this set for the 4 blue 1x1 slope tiles, but i can see there is much more into it than that. it sure is a great value compared to what you get in the building bonanzas (no cars and less detail). it was funny to see the little side story in your pictures. would it be hard to modify the cars to fit minifigs better?

4 sinner. you have convinced me. i bought this set yesterday when it was on sale at international lego weekend in sk?rb?k.

4 thank you for the nice review. i want this set too with al those tan bricks and black slopes and the cute blue car *wub* i like the old windows more, i hope they don't stop producing them

3 thanks for comments. i know about text, i'm trying to write more, but haven't succes in this yet. i thought about joining reviewers academy, but i'm not sure because i have only maimum 4(may be 5) hours each time when i can make review or something that needs some hours.

3 writing a decent review will indeed take some time. but you don't need to do it in a single session. if "each time" is 4/5 hours, you can write a review in 2 x "each time"

4 i actually bought this set last monday as it was reduced to 14.99.....it actually not a bad little set considering the size and part count, has a decent array of functions. its a nice little set....the b model looks just as good so i might buy a second set, as you get the bucket left over and i need that bucket for another set. edited by richard dower, 19 october 2015 - 04:42 pm.

4 wow thanks for the review! 8-? i already have the other two set (theyre fantastic *wub* ) and i know ill be getting this one soon! dp8

4 that's a superb review if i ever saw one, and another great story! *y* it's a good review even though i got the set 4 months ago. :-p this just reinforces my like for it. :-p

4 nice review *y* the comic is very funny :-d i don't have this set 8-| but i'm going to buy it soon.

4 ah yes, the good ol' catapult attack. nice review, and what a great comic, i loved it. *y* :-d you've inspired me, all i need now is a camera! :-p great job, keep up the good work, and i'm looking forward to more reviews! *y* ~peace edited by iamded, 12 october 2007 - 10:30 am.

4 sinner, on oct 13 2007, 02:48 am, said: great review! *sweet* i wasn't aware that the catapult rotated either... this set isn't on my buy list though as it is all more of the same for me. thanks for the cool moc! :-d i always plan to add a moc to my reviews but i always run out of time.... :'-( true, there are too many catapults already, and in my opinion some with a better design as well. but my lack of interest in this particular set doesn't reflect at all on my opinion of this review, which i enjoyed very much! please continue making great reviews like this one grevious. *y*

4 thanks for a great review first of all. i do like the upgrades and changes made from the original 2009 set, more colours and parts are offcourse available today than back in 2009. it does look like a great set and i would really realy have loved to get it myself if i had the funds. however their are so many other sets thats first priority for me this december and next year, so sadly i might have to pass on this if its not that i can get it redicioulusly cheap at some point. and yeah, we should appreciate that lego does keep sets coming, even if its just upgrades from earlier releases. town is known for a new police and fire station every year, cant see why a new toyshop is so upsetting. once again thanks for a great review. and happy holidays to you as well.

3 hobbythom, on 29 november 2015 - 04:07 pm, said: great review. you almost make me want to buy one. i don't know what it is with these sets. on the one hand they are so nicely designed and cute on the other side i never seriously consider buying one. i can't explain what it is that holds me back. a lack of money, maybe? that's the thing that usually holds me back. anyway, i have the older version, so i am not interested in this set.

3 cheers for putting up the review. some nice improvements, but not enough for me to pick it up. the original set is good enough for me. pity the poll has no option "yes, but only in addition to new sets, not in stead of new sets". edited by withacee, 01 december 2015 - 09:38 am.

3 thanks oky for this fine review. i agreed with your sentiments on the unnecessary rants. i also owned the 2009 version and even though there are minor improvements. there must be a logical reason for its release again but is not entirely the same. i felt is an excellent opportunity for others to acquire this design especially after six years ago. as for myself, i will probably buy this if my spare funds allow me to own this set.

4 i didn't own the original toy shop so i bought it this time around. i just finished building it saturday and i love it! however, i wish they had both re-released this one and came out with a new addition to the village. :)

4 review - 42044 - display team jet introduction the smallest of the 2016 sets, is the display team jet. it doesn't seem to have lots of functionality, but maybe the landing gear is retractable. this set kind of reminds me to the 9394 - jet plane, although it's obviously a lot smaller. as you can read in my review of the 42052 - heavy lift helicopter basically anything flying is +1 for me, so let's find out if this set also fits the bill. note: all images can be clicked for hi-res versions. set information number: 42044 title: display team jet theme: technic released: 2016 part count: 113 box weight: 193 gr box dimensions: 15,4 cm x 13,8 cm x 5,9 cm set price (msrp): € 9,99 price per part: € 0,088 links: brickset, bricklink the box being a small set, it obviously comes in a small box. the display team jet is an aerobatics jet, used in air shows. on the box it's flying rather high, but at least it's at a safe distance from the crowd. front side shows the main model, together with a small section indicating you can use digital building instructions to build this model. back side the back side shows the b-model, a stunt plane. and again a reference to the apps for digital building instructions. more on the stunt plane later. content of the box the box contains: 2 instructions booklets (a- and b-model) 1 sticker sheet 3 technic liftarms 2 bags instruction booklets both the instructions for the a- and b-model are included in the box. sticker sheet a lot of stickers for such a small set. apparently no panel is left untouched. liftarms three liftarms unsealed, nothing out of the ordinary for a small set. bags two bags containing the rest of the parts. highlighted parts this section describes the new and/or otherwise interesting parts. yellow 5l axles the 5l axle in yellow has never been released before, so it's one of the new parts for this year. black 7l flex axles for the layman this seems a common part, but the 7l soft axle actually has never been released in black before. combined with the re-release of the 19l soft axle in black, this will open up lots of possibilities. for those of you thinking you've read this text before; you are right, the new drag racer contains these new 7l flex axles too. white panels this small set comes with a whopping 10 panels. great for the ones who like panels. not so great if you think tlg is using too much panels lately. rudder this part, the small bionicle wing, is the same as the one used in last year's 42033 - record breaker. part list this set contains 113 parts, all listed below. the build this is the collection of parts, used to build the jet. it sure looks like we are getting a landing gear. the build is fun, but pretty straightforward. there aren't any special or cool techniques used in this set. it almost took me more time to apply all the stickers than to build the actual model. finished model the finished jet does look cool though. the white and yellow color scheme, combined with the stickers, work really well. i have seen people refer to the plane as being orange, but it's definitely yellow. technic (or lego in general) tends to have some color variation when it comes to yellow. i do concur this is the warmer variant of yellow, but it's not orange. the back of the plane looks nice too, although i am not a big fan of the rudder part. it looks too detailed, compared to the other panels. it's not a big deal though, and maybe it's just me. parts left only three common parts left. features and functions this set has a single feature and that is a retractable landing gear. it's operated by the black 12t double bevel gear near the cockpit. in the following picture you can see the landing gear retracted. this image shows the landing gear when the plane is ready for landing. hopefully the pilot will roll the plane before landing, but you probably know what i mean video here's s short video demonstrating the display team jet. b-model this set also includes the building instructions for the b-model, a stunt plane. the building experience for the stunt plane is more or less the same as for the jet. well, what do you expect when both models are planes with a limited number of parts. for an alternative model the stunt plane looks fine. there's not a lot of functionality in this plane, but it's worth mentioning that the tail wheel allows the plane to roll on a flat surface. the plane also has working propellors. both functions are demonstrated in the video. unfortunately, the landing gear of the stunt plane is not retractable. parts left a couple of extra leftover parts, but it's nice to see that most of the parts have been used in the b-model as well. actually, there's probably an extra yellow technic smooth 1/2 bush left. i just found it on my desk, but it could belong to one of the other sets. video here's a video demonstrating the stunt plane. summary two nice planes for 13 bucks, that's basically what you get. both models look good and the set has some interesting new parts. especially the 7l flex axle will be very popular. it comes with a decent collection of white panel, although they are very common nowadays. both models have limited functionality, but each of them has at least one function to give the model some playability for kids, other than the swooshability that is. okay, it might lack some proper functions, but i still think kids will love this set. i can see kids running around with one of the planes in their hands. all in all i think this set delivers what you'd expect. score let's see how this set flies! remember that the grades are based on it being a small set. obviously a set like this, cannot be compared with a mercedes flagship. 8 design for a small set, the model looks very authentic. 7 building experience no surprises. 7 features just the retractable landing gear. 8 playability it has swooshability, so i see kids running around with this model. 7 parts lots of panels, if you are into that. 8 value for money can't go wrong with these small sets. 7,5 fun for kids more image can be found on my flickr page. thank you for reading. i hope you enjoyed it.

1 while i can see kids enjoying this, i'm not sure i would buy. the flex axles are nice, and it is a decent number of white panels but i think i would get better return out of a larger parts set. fantastic review though, and your pictures show off this tiny model better than the box art does.

4 love this model, awesome swooshability, interesting parts, and a nice little model to put on my desk at work :)

4 for 10 euros very usefull parts. i like it as well as other 2016 sets. i like the gear retracting mechanism a lot. very good set for good price. thanx for good review. :) max

3 megaroi, on 01 december 2015 - 10:56 am, said: hi there, nice model, great review! i almost reverse engineered this model, but used wrong parts for landing wheels, didn't know how to fix the nose proper, and so on. so i was very interested in this model and i like playing with it. i love the reviews, but i think i have to mention, that the yellow axle must be a 5l! the picture shows a 5l, and a 5l would fit the size of the model. the cart has also a 5l in yellow. what sitze is the yellow axle in this seit. really 4l as written in the text? greetings, robert the picture of the manual says 4x 5l yellow axle, and that seems to line up with what im seeing in the pics as well so i assume the 4l is a typo

4 good review, as always jim when i first saw this set i thought that it would make a great parts pack for me, as that i have about 20 white pieces in my technic collection (all from 42043) and this set has some really useful ones, all for a cheap price. those 7l flex axles will be extremely useful in my current build i'm doing

4 nice review, even with the missing demonstration video of the a-model! looks like this is an excellent panel pack for the price, and those soft axles will go down a treat. will this set be the dark horse of 1h 2016...?

3 jay psi, on 02 december 2015 - 12:10 am, said: nice review, even with the missing demonstration video of the a-model! hmmm strange. let me fix that.

3 fixed the video and fixed the stars in the voting. thanks for paying attention guys

4 my favourite of the 2016 sets i've built so far. i'd go so far as to say this is the best "budget" set in years. i would have loved this when i was a kid ... great "swoosh ability" ??

4 i almost purchased this today because i like the wheel / disc combo so much.

3 jim, on 01 december 2015 - 09:34 am, said: you are right. i came to the same conclusion when writing the review. i tell you it doesn't look that good without stickers, but i don't have a picture to prove it. to be honest; i compared it to the model posted in the 2016 topic a few days ago. i applied the stickers before building the model, so i wasn't able to make a proper comparison. i will keep it in mind for future reviews. thanks for the suggestion. you're welcome! i'm not a huge fan of stickers, for 2 reasons: i do re-use all the parts normally...and also i believe a model should look great even without stickers, then obviously they can be a plus, but only afterwords! anyway i'm enjoying the reviews as usual, and those pics thanks for making them jim!!

1 not sure what people like about this set, i think it's the worst of all 1h2016 sets. odd shape, bland colors, no new parts, and the windscreen isn't even closed. but the reviews are great, indeed. :)

3 first thing i thought: hot wheels?? whut. the set looks like the hot wheels 'bone shaker'.

4 what a nice, tight an clean design! usually not too keen on the pull-back models, but this one is great.

3 the instructions for the extreme police interceptor combo model is now online....will someone do a review of this b model? https://wwwsecure.us...tselector=true#

3 thanks again for the review. i am not sold on this one yet, but i confess it took about 2 years for me to finally appreciate 9396. maybe i need to see this in person.

4 thanks for the review. i wonder if the design inspiration came from the russian ka-32 helicopter.

1 great review! one thing reaaaaaally bothers me about this set, both models have the engine connected to one wheel, the other wheel on the "powered" axle is just left to rotate freely, and that really bothers me, as it did in 42022 (on 42022 even more tbh, since its main feature is being a frigging car). looking at the pics it isnt even a space issue (as it was in the hot rod, where they "needed" to route the steering through), so they just cheaped out and didnt bother fitting a diff in there (or even a live axle link) im not very interested in this set (not into construction stuff), but i think this is a worrying trend :(

3 looks like its using the z60 turntable that's on the mercedes and the crawler crane 42042

1 cool mod by effe. but the original model out of the box is one of the poorest models tlg ever released. looks from front to rear as a cheaped out set with really lazy design effort. a shame for the responsible lego designer parts assortment seems to be ok but this should not be the most important criteria sry jim, i really appreciate your always very well done reviews and offen i agree with the overall judgements/verdicts and of course tastes are different but especially that review sounds like gushing praise in my ears.... just my 2 ct edit: ooops just saw the review isn't done by jim...<blush>... so sry jim... now my final comment belongs to mostlytechnic edited by kumbbl, 27 december 2015 - 07:33 am.

3 ^^efferman : would there be an instruction list for this mod ?

3 a forum member on doktor brick has said he will make an instruction

3 the instruction is done. many thanks to martinsch https://www.dropbox....loader.pdf?dl=0

3 quote and the dumbing-down continues. now they have to show people to compare axle lengths to the 1:1 prints on the page that have always been there. but how does the 1:1 work on the app? might have to look into that... (for the record... i pulled out my phone and tried to find the app in the google store. couldn't find it. so then i went to the lego website shown on the page and it had a link to it. turns out it wasn't showing up because it's tablet only, so google wasn't showing it to me on my phone. i'll try again later with a tablet...) funny thing is that they changed colour of 7l axle to yellow, and on that picture it still is in lbg.

1 thank you for the review. i have this one in my pile to build. i wish there was more of the curved blue panels though.

3 majklspajkl, on 05 december 2015 - 11:45 pm, said: my opinion on the frictionless axlepins is that the flex axle might be easier to stick in them than in regular/blue axlepins... didn't actually try it though :-) frictionless pins have accurate round hole, while blue friction pins have something squarish. flex axle will fit in both, but using tan pins doesn't require strength. conncetion with tan pins is weaker too.

4 i was supposed to publish it together with the 42039 - 24 hours racer, but it somehow got backlogged. after completing the reviews for the 2016 sets, i felt i needed to finish it (was already 90% done). that c-model looks cool!

1 the set is a looker, you've got to admit it, but what it gives in looks does not make up for what it lacks in functions. i really wanted this set, badly even, when i restarted my adventure with technic about a month ago. than i learned more and more about what a good model can do, mostly thanks to this forum and yt. right now i'm a bit disappointed with the arctic truck - smaller sets offer more functions and teach you much more. jim it was a great review nevertheless edited by pgplay, 14 december 2015 - 11:22 am.

3 i could be wrong but i am 100% sure that i've seen this review before.

3 lets not forget the c-model made by buster haus. pretty sweet c model..... http://www.eurobrick...opic=106969&hl=

4 review - 42001 - mini off-roader introduction technic mini models are sometimes regarded as models not worth buying. i don't agree with this opinion. whether it's a special part or innovative building technique, almost every mini model has something that makes the set worthwhile. this time i will be reviewing the 42001 mini off-roader. this model is not a smaller version of an existing model, so there's no real comparison with a bigger brother, or sister if you will. nor does the model resemble a real life brand or vehicle, so it is what it is, a mini off-roader. note: all images can be clicked for hi-res versions. set information number: 42001 title: mini off-roader theme: technic released: 2013 part count: 100 box weight: 165 gr box dimensions: 15,5 x 14,0 x 4,2 cm set price (msrp): 9.99 eur de / 7.99 gbp / 12.99 usd price per part: de 0.100 eur / uk 0.080 gbp / usa 0.130 usd links: brickset, bricklink the box the box measures 15,5 x 14,0 x 4,2 cm which is obviously not very big. the weight of the box is approximately 165 grams. frontside the front of the box shows a though four wheel drive off-roader challenging a fierce rocky mountain trail...now does it?! what the box actually shows is mini off-roader challenging a small foam rock formation, much like rocks used in star trek the original series, yet smaller the box also states that this model is for the age of 7 till 14. more importantly, the 2-models in-1 logo is clearly visible, which means this set can be used to build two different models. backside the backside shows a picture of the alternate model and a smaller version of the original model. the conversion arrow and the 2-in-1 are printed to clarify that the main model can be converted into a secondary model. sides one of the sides shows the 2-in-1 logo and a picture of the main model. another side shows a picture of one of the wheels in actual size and again, a picture of the main model. contents of the box the box contains: 2 booklets 2 bags 4 tires booklets this set contains two booklets which is not very common for a set this size. both models share the same chassis, which is why the build has been divided over two booklets, one for the chassis (8 pages with 10 steps) and one for the bodywork (34 pages with 23 steps for the main model and 20 steps for the alternate model). bags the box contains only 2 bags which is to be expected from a set consisting of 100 parts. one of the bags is filled with liftarms, panels, rims and two elastic bands. the other bags contains all the other parts, like pins, axles, connectors, etc. opening the bags results in the following collection of parts, with the exception of the tires. no abundant number parts that will add real value to your collection. nevertheless, there are some interesting orange parts and elastic bands. tires the tires are provided seperately (i.e. not contained in the bags). from the picture you can see that these tires have a front and a back side, so you should pay attention when fitting them to the rims, which have two different sides as well. highlighted parts this section describes the unique and/or highlighted parts. very small smooth technic panel (#21 and #22) these two small technic were new at the time of release and this set was only one of two sets containing them in orange. the other set is the 42007 - moto cross bike. at the moment of writing there's a third set containing these parts, the black champion racer. side a side b small rubber band i was under the impression that these white rubber bands weren't that common, but it seems that these bands are as common as dirt. but hey, you can't have enough rubber bands! thin liftarm 1x5 with axle holes like the panels, these liftarms were also new at the time of release. looking at the the frequent usage in other sets, this part has proven to be a most useful mammal. thin liftarm 1x3 not a very rare piece per se, but if you are not into bionicle, this liftarm part can be hard to find. your other option would be to buy the 9390 - mini tow truck, or the 8305 - dual bikes from a while ago (2000). long pin with center pin hole this relatively new kid on the block is currently used in many technic and non-technic sets and has well proven it's worth. axle pin connector hub with 2 axles like the previous part this newish part is also quite helpful in certain situations. part list here's the complete list for all 100 parts. building experience the build starts with the chassis of the off-roader. after connecting some liftarms two elastic bands, one on each side, are attached to the towball pins. this is all there is to the suspension, plain and simple. the two elastic bands contract the l-shaped liftarms, which results in the long ends swiveling downwards. the video below demonstrates the suspension. the simplicity doesn't do it justice, because it works like a charm. the suspension is very smooth with the right amount of stretch and resistance. this great working suspension adds a lot of value to this set. to quote john hurt in the movie contact: "why build one when you can have two at twice the price?". i have purchased two sets so we can simultaneously see both models and make a proper comparison. below you can see two identical chassis which will be used for both versions of the build. at this stage we have arrived at the end of the first booklet, which only took about ten minutes. not surprising, since the first booklet only has 10 building steps. progressing to the second booklet, you need to choose between building the main and alternative model. that's a choice i don't need to make for this review, so let's start with the main model. main model when building the bodywork there's a rather peculiar building technique, which you wouldn't expect in an official lego set. the axle and pin connector hub with 2 axles only protrudes halfway into the double bent liftarm. the thin 1x4 liftarm which is added in one of the following steps makes sure the hubs stay perfectly in place, but i was still surprised to see this technique. the finished bodywork for the main model looks like....uhh...well.....i don't know exactly. it doesn't bear any resemblance to a real life model, which makes it hard to judge. one thing's for sure; it's not the best looking technic mini model. the bodywork can be attached to the chassis by using a 7l axle and two bushes, one on each side of the chassis. alternate model unfortunately the alternate model doesn't look much better than the main model. it's even a stud less wide, while you would like to see slightly more body, matching the size of the tires and chassis. attached to the chassis the body is even more out of proportion. it's not really ugly and the color scheme is great (obviously this goes for the main model as well), but the body simply doesn't match the chassis. i can only imagine that this model is supposed to have a chibi look, much like the microfighter star wars models. comparison the following section shows a selection of images from different angles to compare the main and secondary model. the main model has a bit more volume, while the alternate model has a more sporty look. front view the main model has headlights which are attached at a higher point, while the alternate model has headlights which are placed more closely next to each other. rear view a slightly different setup in both models, where the main model again has higher placed rear lights. side view the side view shows that the panels are used differently in both models. the main models uses them as doors, while the alternate model uses them as engine cover (bonnet). top view the top view reveals that the main model might have room for a minifig parts left the left image shows the parts which are left after building the main model, while the second image shows the parts left after building the alternate model. as you can see, the main model uses slightly more parts than the alternate model. features besides the awesome suspension, which we already have discussed, there aren't a lot of features in this set. there's actually a single feature, which is only present in the main model....opening doors! wow, impressive! well, maybe we can't expect too much functionality in such a small model. summary the off-roader is a fun model which is fairly easy to build. the suspension is simple, yet very effective. the model could do better in the design department, but the suspension offers great playability and that is what this set is all about. the orange parts are not very common so they are an added bonus. all things considered this set is definitely worth the few bucks you need to spend on it. pros great suspension fun to play with some (semi) rare orange parts great color scheme cons no resemblence to an actual off-roader not the best looking model score below are my scores based on different categories. 6 design not the best looking technic model. 7 building experience the suspension makes it fun to build. 7 features the suspension makes up for the lack of functionality. 8 playability the model has car-swooshability. 7 parts some interesting orange parts. 8 value for money great present for the younger builders. 7,1 elastic hope you enjoyed it! thanks for reading and please rate this set at the top of this topic!

3 sad, i miss this set.

1 i don't like appearance of this off-roader at all but i've got it as gift so it's in my technic collection now. when i built it i was very surprised how cool suspension it has and how much playability it features. i've also tried to build some alternative model out of it but without success. anyway thank you jim for great review! edited by tomik, 14 december 2015 - 05:45 pm.

4 a fine little set with 64 pieces and 3 figures for under $10. may have seemed a bit steep in 1991, but i wouldn't know, i'd passed into my dark ages already, so alas, i haven't a copy of this set. looking at the parts list, i could build one out of my current inventory though. issued today for $10, i'd buy no less than 14 of them, even though it does lack the obligatory rowboat for the pirate to make his escape in. very nice review and comic, thanks for doing them! *y* edited by imperialshadows, 20 october 2007 - 06:10 am.

3 mister phes, on oct 20 2007, 12:38 am, said: you've done a good job of this review mr imperialscouts! but two things. 1) background far too bright and the set is far too dark, easily rectified with brightness & contrast adjustment. 2) no poll to rate the set out of 5. nonetheless this should be frontpaged on classic-pirates.com! alas, i cannot make polls in the pirate forum, so a generous moderator/admin would be so kind to add one. nonetheless, the picture was fixed, and appears to be alright. but i'm glad that the review is enjoyed!

4 nice review, funny little story, and a 4 from me. a useful little set indeed. *sweet*

1 well i only know the european price: 89.99 euros i think that's quiet expensive against the 2005 police station (7237): 74.99 euros - rupeeclock

3 excellent review copmike! i feel as if i've actually seen the maquette up close in real life. x-d i swear i've even touched it. tack for sharing min kompis! *sweet*

4 beautiful...i'm really trying to resist these. any word on who's next after boba fett? a c-3po/r2-d2 pair would probably push me over the edge.

1 wow i went to my local toysrus and apparently they had some there dont really like them but there neat:)

1 not my thing, but a very nice review, thanks for sharing it! i was seriously considering this one when it was originally announced as a 6212 copack item at a particularly good price and then everything changed. i do, however, seriously ache to get my hands on one of the more traditionally lego looking 2ft+ vaders they use in the official stores (at least they had one here in orlando). *wub*

4 during the annual thanksgiving road trip to the relatives, i stopped by the tru in portland, or. lo and behold, the new mars mission sets! obviously, i bought them. ;-) the box: not much to say. standard box art for mm sets, nothing new. the parts: some good parts here. even if you don't like the set (which i highly doubt after i've had my say :-p ), it's a decent parts pack. i noticed that some old parts have been renewed. i know the wheel has been used in the '07 sets, but the cockpit and hitch i haven't seen in a while. the vldss (very large dss). grr. new part. at least, i think it is. someone slap me if it isn't. *wacko* the figs. i know i've seen that head before, but i have no idea where. does anyone know? i was hoping that the aliens would have new arms, at least. i was sadly mistaken... on the upside, i finally discovered that they glow in the dark. :-$ the alien has a jetpack. if that's not the silliest thing i've ever seen, i don't know what is. the build. simple build. a block. so easy a caveman cou- oh, never mind. geico's used that one enough. then, we have this jobber right here. not sure what it is, but it looks like some crystal scanning device. it's starting to look pretty nice. it almost looks practical. the cockpit is suffering from a bad dose of over-stickering. on the upside, we have a new piece there to hold the cockpit on. part 1 complete. it has a nice little radio antenna, which is ruined by the use of a random missile that looks like it's going to shoot the antenna before it shoots the alien. still, i never say no to a good missile i can use for something else. the trailer: fairly simple, but it works. it features stabilizing arms, a handheld saw, and an extremely random mini-bot who's purpose escapes me. the whole meal deal- erm, general pics. overall, i thought this was a good set. in fact, it reminds me of this:

4 thanks for the review! *sweet* aside from the fact that i like the model, this set has a few new and useful pieces so i will have to get it! *wub*

4 a wonderful set and, perhaps, as close to classic space as possible. *y* also there?s a great amount of very useful and interesting parts too like these round 'stabilizer' parts with clip.... :'-) there?s a complete different feeling with this new sets compared to the first mm ones.... 8-| beside the a little more realistic aspects of it with the more enclosed cockpit (nearly with some controls.... ;-) ) it?s the overall more solid feeling i guess.... the other sets look pretty neat and fashionable at the surface, but their internal structure is much more hollow and useless with some studless technic beams and such stuff.... very shining, but hard and boring to mod, just aimed for maximal cool looking box art and the rest went down for saving costs.... (beside that already pretty good 7692 dropship that is). the only thing i don?t get with that is why the minirobot?s a one-armed one.... ach, pirates on mars i suppose.... x-d

4 that head might have been from rock raiders. lovely set, and a good review. jifel

1 tks for the great review mm ;-) its always appreciated to have reviews of new set. having said that i really don't see the point of that set and its such money and time wasted imo. i don't like that theme apart the dropship and 6wheeler and that tiny vehicle doesn't do the trick for me. i see it as a really cheap excuse to try and please classic space fan with that horrendous mm graphics and what amazes me is that you guys loke that :-d money saved on !! *yoda*

1 exo-builder59, on nov 26 2007, 05:54 pm, said: excuse me?! a mass of technic parts? wow, you better lock your doors tonight.... uh oh. don't get me wrong- i like the set, but the world's gone crazy when we need technic parts for the little bike. |-/

4 mr. mandalorian, on nov 26 2007, 05:20 pm, said: come on, you have to admit that a jelly with a jetpack is funny. pathetically so, any way. i might make a vig of this, involving a brick wall and plenty of trans-green peices. x-d :-d hilarious actually.......however its imapled to it, so i guess its a suicide mission :-d piranha

4 thanks for posting the picture of this new mm set. when i first saw the mars mission sets i was a little apprehensive about the design and the aliens (they could have at least make movable arms :(), but anyways when i bought the small fighter i was totally hook. my fave set from the line is the mech.

4 thanks for that very good review, mr. mandalorian! *y* i think that this is a plain beautiful set, oh how i wish that tlc would?ve taken that direction from the beginning.... :'-) the design is much more practicable, with fewer non-system parts and technic beams with(!) studs.... this makes everything much more easier to mod and a lot more useful, at least imo. *y* so it?s for sure not very hard to make the (wonderful enclosed) cockpit one brick higher, and even that little alien ship looks decent and nice.... x-o and the fighter looks sleek and elegant too, in both modes! that?s just very cool, compliments, tlc. now all we need?re aliens with moving arms and here we go, classic space on forever! x-d

4 friggin sweet, thank you mr mandy for the reveiw of this sweet ship! *y* *wub*

4 hmmm, great review for a great set. *y*

3 lasse d, on nov 26 2007, 04:54 pm, said: i'm not sure it would nose dive when transforming from tank mode. i guess it would pick up speed and transform quickly since it doesn't seem to have any downwards pointing thrusters. the one thing you'd have to make sure of, though, is that it was fairly light and the wheel base had a fairly large surface area (actually, that's two things), so as to make sure it didn't dig into the soil. if that happened, transformation would be harder as the wheels would dig into the ground and drag through the soil. then it'd nose dive.

4 konas2002, on nov 26 2007, 05:21 pm, said: i really like the transforming aspect of this! the one thing i wish mm sets would include would be baseplates. i liked that about the classic space stuff because it really helped create the environment. some "red rock orange" mars baseplates would be great! that?s a really fine idea and would for sure be very cool.... *y*

1 lasse d, on nov 26 2007, 03:34 pm, said: 1) there will always be kudos for a good review at eb ;-) 2) yeah. it does look quite slow and tank-like. it is a shame lego didn't make a more obvious way shoving what goes on. you mean the ungainly way in which the wheels have to turn in order to change from tank mode? i think you are right as well. on the other hand. if it has anti-grav, then it doesn't really make sense to have wheels as well. i mean. if the power goes, then the wheels can't turn anyways! it must have anti-grav. otherwise, none of the flying sets would work... athos, on nov 26 2007, 04:02 pm, said: i think blue must be a cheaper color for lego... steve i think this is weird. tlc included way too many random colors. blue, red, green, and yellow... *wacko*

3 so hinckley, can you give us a hint on what our walrus friend will do with the dark panther? i can't wait to see. 8-|

4 awesome. i can't wait to get my hands on this one.

4 sweeeet. *wub* it's nice to finally see a set that's not bipedal or (?) tripedal. quote exo-force is an anomaly in my lego interests. i don't know why i like it so much or why i keep buying it but i do. that would be a problem, wouldn't it? :-p quote the cockpit itself is constructed very well but the canopy seems like an afterthought, closing on to the robot's head and leaving his back and sides completely exposed. i dunno. at least it has a canopy, unlike past sets..

4 thanks hinckley! it's always nice to see your reviews, and i can't wait to see the story mode (from the pic, i guess it will include sinner and hinckley, instead of bianca and gavin, right? 8-| ) luxorv

4 thanks for that very neat review, hinckley! *y* this set looks indeed very interesting, with a very cool antlike look and a simple but essential overall design. the cockpit seems better protected than many other ef ones, that spine?s lovely and the way these iron drones?re attached is simple but effective. :-) and hey, did i miss something or?re there really no crappy shooting devices...? :-p thanks to the minirobots and their inventor i guess.... :'-)

4 great review as always, hinckley. frankly i'm in love with this thing. so much so, in fact, that i've been calling it 'shadow panther' for weeks, but never mind... anyway, why do i like it? well, purple is such a fantastic lego colour- it's sparingly used, which makes it interesting, and it simply looks great. those jetpack/backpack things the robots are wearing, and if they are jetpacks, as the back of the box suggests, then the use of chaisaws is quite nifty and innovative. the minibot is cool, and certainly an interesting gimmick. sure, they don't look quite as good in some of the other sets, but here it looks great. the overall structure and design are cool too. it's always nice to see an 'irregular' mech, and this is no exception. it's especially cool whee the spines are concerned. plus, on top of all that, it's got a nice selection of parts, including some lovely new ones, and the inlaid box is interesting. well worth getting, i think.

3 from the lego store in chicago, if i recall his post properly! my goodness hink, you're going to pull an all-nighter for reviews at this rate! oh well, it's kinda worth it, right? :-p

1 fantastic! great review, thanks a bunch for all the pics, they've shown me how (in my opinion) bad this set is. :-p i just expected it to be more bricky rather than technicy. oh well, i wasn't planning on buying it anyway. x-d i noticed you spelt mini-figs mini-fgis in the first paragraph, in case you wanted to know. x-d so again, thanks, and i'm looking forward to seeing the rest of them, and the comics! ~peace

4 thanks for this great review hinckley! :'-) i know you're loving this attention! x-d :-p i actually like this set, and like it a lot more now that i've seen this review. i'll most likely get, mostly for the figs and parts. i reckon it would look a lot better alongside the rest of the 2008 ef mechs. anyway, thanks for the review! to the brickmobile! >:-)

3 thanks for this other great review, hinckley *y* ! you sure you don't work as one of tlc's prs? x-d ;-) everytime i see one of your reviews i want to buy the set, and that is sweet to me, but bad for my money 8-| luxorv

3 can't wait for the extended review!! ;-)

3 thank you for the review hinckley :-) already waiting for the comic x-d

3 jifel, on dec 2 2007, 08:37 am, said: crap! >:-( now i have to spend all my money on this! *wub* *wub* and whats the code? oh well, awesome set, and judt curios, didnt the reviewers used to be bianca and gavin? jifel yes they did! *sweet* i like using me and sinner better, though. i have put fabuland housewives on the back burner for a while, but plan to revive it for the first season conclusion in january. it's nice to see that there are people who really follow it out there. thanks! :-$

4 thanks for this new review, hinckley *wub* for me, it was love at fistr sight with this little set :-p it's simple but nice, and way better than shadow crawler for a spider-like mech *y* you sure will be very busy these days, and your characters will get breakdown before they finish filming all the comics x-d luxorv

4 awesome! thanks hinckley! i was not planning to get this set but now it look as if i will have too. (i still cannot afford it anyway) :'-(

4 i would agree. the spider looks really cool. too bad we can't see how the combo mech looks like. instructions are not online yet. :-/ there should be another combo mech but you'll need the storm lasher set. :-p

4 hinkley, you are the man! your reviews just keep on getting better and better! although all of the sets this year are great and i love them all to bits, i can't say there was one that i absolutely felt like something i'd buy except for the storm lasher. but with this review, i think this will be the first purchase of 2008 for me! i totally agree with you on how the spider looks better without mini-robot. but from looking at where the cockpit is placed and how the skull on the cockpit is lodged underneath the walker, maybe the mini-robot would look better mounted underneath the head? that way it looks more even and even gives the thing a nasty set of teeth! i gotta try it out once i get it. can't wait for the fabuland comics! keep it up, hink!

3 zero1312, on dec 6 2007, 09:48 am, said: yes, when in 2008 do these sets come to germany? :-/ um i do not know, i live in the u.s.a. *sweet*

4 fantastic review! i'll post my views on the set later when i have more time. but i've already fixed the poll.

4 nice review! hmm...i gave it a 4...why? very good bits: -3 epaulettes for 3 gurads! -patterned wall parts -cannon bad bits: -no pirates to fight -title is rather grand for an outpost -top needs battlements, not very low lattices -needs a more substantial base - the wall goes right into the sea! - surely the whole thing would sink... -palm tree is too short ...and the rest is good! :-p you might want to fix the vote option for 5 - it appears to be the title; you can't vote for it... pirate king skelly killer edit: ok, boney, but i gave it a 4! edited by slyowl, 06 december 2007 - 07:32 pm.

4 you even have the box! splendid review. i also own this one, and i think there's nothing to complain about. (more figs would be appreciated though, a sneaky pirate perhaps) 4 out of 5!

4 thank you for the comments! *sweet* i wonder who voted "1", surely such a nice set doesn't deserve such a low score!? *wacko*

4 mister phes, on dec 8 2007, 07:47 pm, said: it's not a bad thing to vote sabre island 1 if someone feels that it's genuinely worth 1but t'would be interesting to know why. i do see your point mr phes, but 1? i would like to know why he/she thinks sabre island is worth so little!

4 i give it a 4, only because there are no pirates. i aways loved this set, nice little fortifaction. lots of details. i only wish i could have worked it in aberbrick.

3 remind us what aberbrick is mr radar... or better still give us a link and give your moc plug x-d

3 bonaparte, on dec 8 2007, 09:40 pm, said: i gave this one a 5. *snip* it can be used as a small independent base or in combination with one of the bigger sets (eldorado or trading posts) as a lookup or outer defense.*snip* i hope that when i got eldorado fortress for christmas (the one i got for ?25) i can somehow combine the two to make a single larger base. i will post pics of the results one day if all goes to plan.

4 lord of pies, on dec 6 2007, 08:24 pm, said: but never fear, the lord of pies is here! me throwing a pie at captain ironhook from another angle. lol (somehow i cannot add a clickeble smilie) i never had this set when i was young, but i bought it some years ago second hand. it is a nice in between piratesoldierset and i like it very much.

4 its a fantastic set, cant think of anything wrong with it to be honest, even if the island is a bit small, the plate itself is still useful, and the rest of it is also very useful, walls can go toward a bigger fort, cannon can extend your ship, soldiers extend your army, boat extends err your boats, and the island prin is just cool

4 :'-) i really love everything you did with this gas station. it looks very cozy!!! amazing how you said you built it by the book, does that mean you didn't have the set but you used your own pieces to rebuild the thing? the flourescent lighting is genius! and the interior space looks just like what you'd see at those little shops. i really dig the moc ;-) it gives me good ideas and now i want a gas station of my own :-p and the history behind how it was "rebuilt" and how it will improve business etc is so cool *wub*

4 that's a beautiful upgrade of a classic set! the new interior is great. *wub* do you still have the tow truck?

3 thanx for the compliments :-$ stauder, on dec 9 2007, 01:47 am, said: ... (which pierced a megablock causing it to self destruct) ! stauder yes! any destruction of a megablock is a good thing. thanx stauder. sinner, on dec 9 2007, 06:07 am, said: ... do you still have the tow truck? i definitely still have the truck *wub* i don't have the heart to destroy it :'-) captain green hair, on dec 9 2007, 11:54 am, said: ... but...start dodging cannonballs now, boom, harr! :-p just don't hit the gas station, don't want to destroy my meager town too :-p p

4 tinypiesrus, on dec 15 2007, 05:39 pm, said: thank you big pete *wub* this set looks very good, it looks well built and the statues are nice. the ark looks great and the star wars hieroglyphic is classic :-d just a two things: is marion's face double sided? it looks like a calm face on the back of the box. where do the snakes come out? and about the stickers, have you tried putting them on the long bricks above the breakable walls? once again, thanks very much *wub* *y* marion's face is double sided and the snacks come out right under the sticker that has r2-d2 and c-3po with the egyptian.

4 indy565, on dec 16 2007, 10:31 am, said: nooo! :'-( patients my young indy loving friend *sweet* anyway thanks for the reveiw i wasnt going to get this set but i just might, it's a coin toss between the truck chase and this one, which one do you guys think i should get?

3 this is great, thanks for the review...but they're using a new skellie? i thought those were just for the reanimated dead...not just skeletons. unless that skeleton is supposed to be reanimated? either way it makes me sad :'-( that marion is beautiful *wub* worth it for the set alone! and that sw reference is great x-d

3 oky wan kenobi, on dec 16 2007, 08:46 am, said: lol! those star wars heiroglyphics are awesome! were those in the movie? or is this just a joke by the lego designers? that would be the first time tlc showed any kind of reference humor! the rest of the set is great too, even the skeleton and the stickers. yes, that's right, i actually like those things. i like the new skellies because of their posability (i'm a big supporter & user of stop-motion) and i think there's nothing wrong with stickers. i mean seriously, why does everybody hate stickers so much??? :-| sure, they are a pain in the megablocks to put on and, sure, they come off after a while and are never usable again, but hey, you don't have to put them on, even better, you can save them (like i do) and use them for your mocs! could somebody tell me, please? i'm just curious. however, as i said, nice set! i might even get one. gotta love that marion with the carot torch x-d and that arc is neat too! by the way, are all parts on it golden? some more pics on it would be nice as soon as your camera is recharged! ;-) thanks. peace out! as far as i know, those insignias on the arc are in the movie, too. but i don?t remember if they actually were on the arc or somewhere else. there are a lot of star wars references in all the indiana jones movies. looking at your name, you might find it funny to know that the asian club of lao che in temple of doom is called "club obi-wan" the plane in the first indy has the callsign cpo, which i just found out the other day :)

4 my 2nd review (what a veteran) ... again, found this set via a shop assistant, in my local tru (portsmouth, uk) this evening. comes in at ?44.99, which, is pretty steep, but, you get quite a bit for your money. front of the box : back of the box : back of the box closeup : contents : it was a nice surprise to get numbered bags ... not had a large set with numbered bags for quite a while, at least in none of the sets i've bought recently! didn't take a close up of the stickers, but i was quite disappointed that the curved pieces had stickers ... if they could print the att curved pieces, why not these? minifigs : oh ... and there's a nice backprint on the pilot figure : now, the build was pretty good ... you build the plane first (after the minifigures). quite an interesting build in a way, becayse for a while you think the back is the front ... and then you realise, heh! now ... i've not seen the film in a while, but i don't recall a guy flying a plane with a fishing rod ... don't flame me if this is what happens, see earlier point regards not seeing the film in ages!! :-p after that, you build the temple in stages, starting with the entrance first, and then the holey floor section with the spears. these spears are just loosely placed into technic holed bricks. quite easy to make em flick out but they can go anywhere! hehe entrance : holey floor & spears : these two parts are hinged and on an angle to each other and the gap makes for a handy bottomless pit, complete with pole for indy to swing over with his whip. after that, you create the door and the ratchet mechanism to keep it raised. after that, you add the runners for the ball and the swinging knives trap. swords trap - before : after : finally, you build the statue that holds the efigy. nice bit of construction here, especially the way that everything falls over once the efigy is removed. do be careful when putting the curved bits on though ... it appears one of the edges on mine has slightly bent when putting it on ... nowt noticable though. temple : preparing to steal : run!! you can see that the temple has toppled and debris has fallen all around ... and then, as he goes through the door, the door falls (he gets his hat) and then the rock ball starts a rolling! ruuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuun!! the stickers were a pain though ... there's no room for a border around the sticker here! beware!! after all that is done, you join all the pieces together and it makes more a really good playset. plenty of opportunity for recreating scenes here! idol closeup : total set : spares : yet more spare stickers??! (sorry, i've already put the spares in my box of bits!) overall, 8 out of 10 ... lots of play value and a pretty nice build. too many stickers though ... and defo poor arms for the skeletons! edited by imperialshadows, 01 june 2008 - 12:18 pm.

4 thanks for the review! this is certainly bigger than i expected! can't wait to see your other pics! *y*

3 is the efigy a totally new peice, or is it made of smaller peices with some gold hair attatched? sorry if i missed this :-$ nice review, just wish we had some more pics of the built set :-d

4 thank you for another excellent review big pete! *y* *y*

3 thanks for the great review! i'll probably be picking this one up if only for the minifigs (how can you not complete your alfred molina minifig collection?) and the idol piece. tinypiesrus, on dec 15 2007, 10:41 pm, said: oh, i watched this scene a few weeks ago, and the pilot is fishing while waiting for indy to escape. this is correct, and in pure serial film fashion, the pilot is has just hooked a big one just as jones starts yelling for him to get ready to leave ;-) badger

1 no hovitos? no! ah well, if i get more pirate sets next year i'd use the islanders as hovitos. in the video game they have the same torsos. i'd really like to get this, maybe in june i'll have luck. :'-)

3 this set is pretty nice i love the idol id probably buy the set just for that :-d lol is it just me or in the earlier concepts of this set we saw a native on the box? i wonder why they removed it :-( *wacko*

3 i just noticed another inconsistency between box art and the actual set ... on the box, the biplan has white wing supports (they're just plane windows without glass in them) and yet the set they are dark grey (or is it bley ... can never tell the difference without careful study). add to that ... the outer of the engine at the front is white on the box and black in the set. we don't normally have this many inconsistencies do we ?

3 this set is so cool... and another must buy! :-$ i'm in trouble next year it seems... the figs are great! *wub* i think the plane is only ok; perhaps they should have made that in a separate set as it needed to be a certain size to fit the figs, but that meant that the tail is way too short. here is a picture of the actual plane so you can see what i mean. (notice the pilot is fishing... ;-) ) the temple is another story; i think lego have done an incredible job with this, fitting in the key parts of this sequence without making an absurdly large model. addtionally, there are many parts in this set that i haven't got so it shouldn't be too hard to justify. x-d thanks for another great review. *sweet* i love the photo of indy running with the idol and the boulder close behind. :-p naith, on dec 16 2007, 10:20 pm, said: lol is it just me or in the earlier concepts of this set we saw a native on the box? i wonder why they removed it :-( *wacko* i recall that too. :-/ edit: yes there was one... big pete, on dec 16 2007, 11:28 pm, said: we don't normally have this many inconsistencies do we ? quite annoying ones too. i think the plane looks better with those being white.

4 because of exams and other obligations, i haven't posted this sooner. seeing that no-one else has reviewed this set, i thought i might as well do it myself. the set in its entire glory (minus the slammer, instructions and the (obviously) massive sticker sheet) the four cars included in this set; a muscle car, a sports car, a roadster and the police off-roader(!): because the police obviously have no clue that an off-roader is useless for catching street-racers, no less a batmobile-ish sports car, it will always trail behind: but the police have a trick up their sleeve - the drawbridge: gotcha! and the mechanism that makes it all tick: the motor is nothing more than a (slow) pull-back motor. push down the bridge, the latch will hook on to the gear and keep it in place until the latch is released. and there's the new gas station. staying within theme, this gas-station is, like the tanker in 8147, from the company fuel 4 speed: there's a notable presence of detail here, such as the soda-dispenser, water (coolant?) bottles and other accesories, two fuel pumps and bumper-level railings to prevent cars from crashing into them. there's no interior however. and as demonstrated here by a loyal octan-employee and a pursuing officer, the gas station is built to minifig-scale: my impressions of this set: as a collector of tiny turbos, and yet to miss a set, i got this one regardless of what it included. the gas station is indeed very nice, and the minifig-scale accesories were unexpected. the lack of interior is no big issue, and the both the station and bridge can with ease be implemented into a mini-fig town. the bridge also solidly built, and includes the ramps in its design, so it can be lifted, with ramps attached, without breaking apart. the slammer included in the set is identical, apart from the white color, with those in 8147. the cars are also very nice, altough i am yet to get used to the yellow batmobile, as i've grown accustomed to calling it. i also love the off-roader's chunky tires, they make perfect wheels for the newer minifig-scale cars. i never consider price/parts ratio, and here it would, for me, be irrelevant, because it will never be demolished for parts. the play value is what i would consider pretty good, and while the bridge won't rise with a car on it, it's still strong enough to stay open with a car tipping over the edge. hmm. every nerve in my body is saying that this sets is worth roughly 8/10, so: verdict: 8/10 edited by whitefang, 23 may 2009 - 07:01 pm. indexed

3 looks like a nice set, i like the tiny turbos and have most of the older individual cars, but i am put off by the ever increasing price of the large sets with lots of extra parts that i'm not really interested in. i wish these were available as individual vehicles as well.

3 i want this set but its $60 aud which is a ripp off! i like the yellow car! *wub* :'-) *y* by the way good review! *y*

4 heres all the parts in assorted baggies, and the horribly messed up instructions. four astronauts and four aliens, with an extra gold visor (yay!) not bad. the base of the horribly unstable alien craft. the wings move up and down, aswell as back and forth, the purpose i know not. next we build the nerf section of the base. basically technic. and the rest of the tube connectors. heres the farthest i got the little missle to go. its fairly dissapointing. good thing i didnt expect much from this portion of the set. heres the start of the command base. more of the main structure, will be adding lots of things to all the little beams. heres a storage container and the surprisingly not flimsy radar. on this side we see the alien elevator. it uses a horribly long technic rod, i have not seen one of this proportion, its like, a foot and a half long. more of the inner base where all the little tubes shall go. all the connected tubes and such. i also encountered a problem. in the instructions it says for the end of the elevator prong to be touching the tube connector where it is shown here, but mine has a 1x space inbetween. no matter. heres the completed base. + my knee. again. onto the spaceship. the bulk of it is just technic supporting beams, with some large slope peices covering it all up. more on that later. the white coverup. the middle section lifts up to store the overly large jetpack. as you see, the storage containers take up most the bulk in the back, and you can see the jetpack on the ground. aswell as the trigger hand hold thing that allows you to swoosh it. look, in the back! lego greebles! despite the large cockpit, it only holds one person, laying down. the wings are really the saving grace - double layered with a nice two toned effect. kitty nudged me this picture so its abit blurry, my apologies :-| extra peices and or peices i have no idea where the hell they go. :-p overall, the set is quite fun i must admit. full price, i probably would not go for it, but i got it for just under 70 dollars. for that price i can confidently say its quite worth it, many useful peices, nice figures (other than the aliens) and the tube things are quite fun to boot, even though i liked the life on mars system more, which i also have. none the less, its very fun to make them shoot around. alright, so its not much of a command base either, and it looks abit bare. but it's still fun, even if you ignore the nerf section. overall i give it a hardy 3.5 out of 5, the openness and epic fail of a missile launcher are hard to get by, but overall, its a dandy set :-d merry christmas *wub*

1 thanks for the review brickmaster! i wanted this set at first but i realized i don't want it as much anymore, seems like a waste of 90$. :-(

3 i don't recall mine having an alignment problem on the tubes... could you perhaps take a closer picture of the area? did yours also have two of the same sticker for the wings of the alien craft?

4 thanks for this review. lots of minifigs is a plus, although half of them are junk jellies, but dang the base just doesn't seem impressive. it looks so cheap, like a skeleton. the tubes are just ridiculous. but hey, at least it comes with two cool spacecraft, that's nice.

3 i agree, it does seem very scarce, but ive taken apart the nerf launcher, made a new module with the tube the launcher used, and beefed up the base with some computers and other things. for 90 dollars i would pass, i agree. on sale it is lovely, though. and none the less ive been entertained for ages with them flyin through the tubes :-d

4 thanks for the photos and review brickmaster. i'm hoping to find this on sale as well... no luck so far. i love the white ship, and i think the base would be amusing, but ultimately hard to re-use. incidentally, that long axel is common in recent technic sets, but i think it was orignally made for the hockey sets. :-d

4 great review! the helicopter is very nice and a cheap way to get a cop and those new handcuffs i wish the police impulse had those new cuffs *sad* thanks for doing this *y* x-o a printed part :-d mail carrier review on p edited by piranha, 26 december 2007 - 04:07 am.

3 caseyref, on dec 26 2007, 02:02 am, said: i quite like it, but i feel that my lego city is getting over-run with helicopters and planes. also i have got the helicopter from the 7237 police station set, but it is not as good as this plus i'am sooooo dissapointed that the :-x stickers :-x are blue instead of black and green as they will not fit with the sets i have already got :-d nice review thanks if you look at the police picture from the instruction booklet, it looks to me that the 3 sets in the bottom left corner are the bike (7235), patrolcar (7236) and prisoner transport (7245) from 2005, but with new blue stickers?

4 thank everybody!! sinner, on dec 26 2007, 06:09 am, said: thanks for the review pspguy. i think this is a very nice little chopper... but the biggest reason why i will probably get this is for the handcuffs! :-d are the side windows flush like the old ones or recessed like the new ones are supposed to me? (the look recessed to me. :-/ ) yes, you're right. ;-) what? if your asking how they are but together you snap the window piece into the ho\lder. edit: scrypt, on dec 26 2007, 03:36 am, said: if you look at the police picture from the instruction booklet, it looks to me that the 3 sets in the bottom left corner are the bike (7235), patrolcar (7236) and prisoner transport (7245) from 2005, but with new blue stickers? hey!!! thats copyrighted mister!!! :-p edited by pspguy, 26 december 2007 - 05:21 pm.

3 thanks for the review psp guy. i just have one question for you, in bottom right picture on the back of the box what is the policeman putting in the container. thanks in advance!

3 nice review *y* i will get 2 of these at the least especialy since they're going to be $15 aud *wub* :'-)

3 a nice simple helicopter! i always had thoughts of this, but after the review i'm gonna go get it! (well, not at the moment... x-o )

4 pspguy, on dec 27 2007, 03:08 am, said: what? if your asking how they are but together you snap the window piece into the ho\lder. errr.... no. as brikbitz said on his site in the 7732 postal plane review... quote you can see the traditional airplane window piece, but the bad news is they've changed the window pane. it's the new flat piece used in 4996 beach house, it just doesn't work as well. without the original bevelled edge it doesn't seal the window and there is small noticable gap around the edge. not a major problem but it might get a bit draughty inside and certainly no high altitude flying. i was wondering if it is the old or new type. darth_legois_619, on dec 27 2007, 08:20 am, said: nice review *y* i will get 2 of these at the least especialy since they're going to be $15 aud *wub* :'-) how did you find out the price? if you are right then this is a must buy! *wub*

1 is it wrong that i got an extra printed control panel with this set? edited by db24, 27 january 2008 - 01:36 am.

4 thank you very much for the wonderful review, legocastlegirl! plenty of pics, thanks again! *wub* *y* ~peace

4 can you take a picture(s) of all the film posters?

4 legocastlegirl, on dec 28 2007, 02:12 pm, said: there?s no necessity to take pics of all the film posters. there are only 3 different film posters at the set. always one poster twice.. and you can see every different poster at the brickshelf gallery. if you need more details, then you should maybe buy it :-) regards sandra ouch ;-)

4 i see the service station has a full arry of tools, oxy/fuel torch and other goodies. not a bad set, still very pricey :-/

4 thank you for the review

4 really cool review: i have got so much to do that i even did not know that set is already available. the cinema is great. aredhel

4 kimt, on jan 4 2008, 10:25 am, said: btw: which set would you recommend: market streeet, town plan or cafe corner? just curious. they're pretty expensive and i might only afford one of them. i guess it all depends on what you are after kim. if you want a really great and detailed set i would opt for the cafe corner, but if you want a set that can easilly be included in a city i would opt for town plan. since i can't afford all of them, i will just get town plan, because i lve the feeling of thge set and that theater is superb !! *yoda*

4 thanks for the review. i really want this set because: 1. it looks fantastic 2. has harder to find colors 3. is a 50th anniversary commemorative 4. some of the models are based on the 50s sets (i love the old stuff) the tanker truck is a perfect recreation of the old ho 1:87 scale esso tanker truck. i have one, and you can look at it for comparison if you would like. lego ho vehicles i'd like to modify the truck from this new set to look even more like the old esso truck, getting rid of the green and adding some decals.

4 happy new year, everyone! i went to my local wal-mart looking for an exclusive bionicle set yesterday, but was amazed to find everything there- sw, bionicle, ef, indie, the works. i nabbed the jsf and the rogue shadow and scampered home to take pics with my new camera. *wub* the box: the same as the other '07 boxes. nothing new. the back shows the various features, with "pop out r2." :-| luckily, the intruction booklet and the dss were intact- not folded like the last mm set i got. |-/ the dss: not too bad, but printed parts would have been great. the figs. anakin is amazing, imo. *wub* fits the cw anie great. i noticed on the s@h reviews the kiddies were saying how ugly he looked. |-/ they need to see the cw cartoon. for the sake of my health, i should probably stop reading those. :-d the build. i won't go too in-depth on the build, since *vader* posted a very in-depth review here. the start of the build: the body of the fighter starts out long and skinny. the jsf's landing gear allows it to sit comfortably without getting in the way while swooshing. r2-d2's launching device. r2 in position. when launched... ...he often gets stuck if you don't press the button hard enough. :-/ looks like r2 needs to lay off... whatever it is robots eat. so far: the flag stickered. it's a big sucker sticker. completed. i forgot to add the nose stickers before i took the pic. warning- the nose cone sticker is actually two stickers. i thought it was one, peeled of one of the stickers, and put it on the middle of the two 1x8 plates, and didn't notice the other sticker. *wacko* various completed shots: i think this was a beautiful little set. r2's launching unit and the flick missiles are annoying, but easily fixed. i plan to add proper cannons in place of the flick missiles. anakin is a great minifig, but he doesn't look so well standing next to my other figs. the brickshelf gallery (when public) will

4 tks will for your great review !! g after reading *vader* 's reviews (of that set and the rs) and yours i really can't wait to get that set and all of the sw sets :-p really nice photography there which is sweet !! *yoda*

4 thanks for the review, mr. mandalorian! this set looks very nice, and it's good to know the nose cone stickers are 2 separate ones, so they don't cross bricks. :-d that camera is working out great for ya'! thanks again! ~peace

4 thanks, guys! i have the rogue shadow in the review pipes, should be up soon. legolover100, on jan 1 2008, 07:36 pm, said: this is a brilliant review of a brilliant set! *sweet* thanks a lot! i know this may be a bit much to ask but could take some pics of the whole instruction booklet? please!!! if you can thanks a bunch. but if not do know of a place where i could find the instructions? take pics of each page? that is a lot. i don't know of anywhere that might have it. :-/ if you check *vader* 's review, he has a lot of pics of the build, that might work just as well. will

4 than kyou for the review. i don't know if i buy this set now i know there's also a anakin in the at-te with a new jedi, but who knows.

4 wow, i'm surprised no one had done this already. first off, this is a truly lovely set that many people should own, even though it's sold out on the s@h :'-( . now lets start off with an overview. *note*: i was missing a few of the pieces (the rabbit, the trike) when i toke the pics. the figs and a cat. the engine: i really love this thing. it's a beautiful 0-6-0 steam engine with a tender. this is probably the most detailed steam engine lego has given us. i loved it so much, i made a non-holiday version for my town. the flat cars: i like these, but they seem a bit simple. their cargo is good for christmas or a birthday party. the passenger car: it resembles the green passenger car we got a while back, but i like the interior in this one a bit better. the caboose: a simple caboose like the one from 2001. the sad thing about it is thats there is no interior and it's hard to take the roof off. overall: i like this set, but it is kind of hard to use during the non winter months. the price is kind of good, but with that price, it should have came with the motor. i give it a 9/10 happy new year! edited by agentrick57, 04 january 2008 - 12:00 am.

4 thanks for the review agentrick57. it is a beautiful set, and quite cheap for me; $50 aud for 965 parts! 8-? not sure what i will do with the rabbit though; it is huge! :-d (i was considering doing this review myself but sinnerton is a mess... :-/ )

4 dang it, i meant to try to get one of these after christmas ... i knew they were half-off at s@h and i just forgot. now they're sold out. darn! thanks for the review!

4 i was fortunate enough to get one along with the hobby train. they are the first trains i have ever owned (mainly by virtue of them having been half price). it's a fantastic selection of parts with the holiday train, as well as it really looking the part as a set. i'm happy not to get a motor; as i think the 9v setup would prove expensive, and the ir control system for the rc setup seems a bit poor. i got some "dead" track for with it to have just as a push train for now.

4 got one for 90 usd, one of the best trains ever..funny as train, perfect for parts. what else to say. *y*

4 okie guys and gals, here s time for some droid exploration with my review of set 7670. as a general statement i have to say its really a neat set that is not that expensive for what it holds. 1) box art like always i will start with pics of the box art. btw, notice anything guys ? no bloody crappy dss. yes, finally a set without stickers and that feels great :-d 2) the mfs nothing really spectacular there. the only novelty lies within the inclusion of the new commander (yellow torso) bd. apart from that, there are 2 bds and unfortunately yet another sbd (i like those but i have a huge amount of them, and i would rather had something different). you have 3 short blasters and a couple of extra parts. 3) the spider droid i think it?s a pretty cool little buggar. it?s a rather simple yet classic construction i think. it has sweet parts such as the bd body in dark bley. it really has a spider feel unlike the previous ep3 one. 4) the hailfire droid this baby represents the ?pi?ce de resistance? of this set. i truly love it !! sure it?s a bit under scale but i don?t really mind that. its conception is superb even if i totally dislike assembling those technic treads (especially 80 of those small things). the ellipse of the treads is well balanced and that trans disc is a brilliant idea. the great thing is those new flick fire missiles: they don?t fall unlike the other ones and they do look good on this baby. also you can put the wheels together and the missiles to gain some shelf space (easy storage on :-d ) in conclusion those druids re really sweet and are perfect target practice for the upcoming rgs hehe !! i hope you enjoyed that review and do not hesitate to comment and ask pic requests if any ;-) *yoda*

3 nice review! and you finally got an 08 set! i haven't gotten any, i blame wal-mart for putting products out late |-/ :-d instead of a sbd, tlc should have included a droideka(new version) *y* the scale is a bit off, so this is a dwarf hailfire droid :-p p

3 thanks for the reveiw, i've got one of these and an at-ap in the mail hopefully arriveing tomorrow :-) edited by legoman, 06 january 2008 - 12:15 am.

1 nice review, thanks. it still seems overpriced to me though. also, the box shows the droid torsos that are used for "feet" on the spider droid as being light bley, yet they are clearly dark bley. *wacko* tk

4 thanks for the great reveiw *yoda* fantastic pictures (very crisp) i am now going onto bricklink to purchse to because you have reasured me that this is a good set. ashoka~

4 great review, as we've come to expect from *yoda* *y* nice to see that tlg is finding new and interesting ways to get around the "no minifig only" sets restrictions with hasbro. clearly, this is another army builder with a minimal vehicle as we're becoming accustomed to. heck, even the diminutive hailfire is technically a droid as well, thus making this all minifigs, from a certain point of view. only negative: it is a bit overpriced. i'll have a better feel for that when i get one. treads/links always drive up a price, so it might just be fair. the spiderdroid is a winner, even with the unusual parts assortment. i like it when lego thinks of different ways to use things, i think it promotes the same from us. i'm not sure what i think of the new battledroid commanders, but at least i can make extras easily if i need to, as i bought a bunch of yellow droid bodies off bricklink once, thinking i might want to make some kind of new droid out of them. they were cheap at the time, now i expect the price to go up just because of this potential use. between those and the grey ones, it's good to see more becoming available. hopefully we'll see black and a few other colours produced for some nice customizing possibilities. all in all, a nice little set with a great army building potential, especially on a buy-one-get-one-half-off or better type of sale. until then, i'll grab one or two and be glad to have them.

4 i got this set for a few months [1 or 2].. and i agree that it is small.. but still.. it looks great on plates, clone troopers [just for fun..] >:-)

4 excellent review. you convinced me to buy these two. could you tell me how much you payed for them? i think i'm gonna buy them tomorrow if they have it already (or if i don't see any cooler sets).

4 thanks for the takes on these two sets, yoda. stickers or not, i still think these are charming sets with all the essence and nostalgia of the older sets back in the 80/90's. am i the first one to notice the new doors used in the back of the van. not only is it using the popular new frame, but the old container doors have been redesigned to fit with the new frame as well. pity they're not yellow, though.

4 very nice, cheers yoda! i'll definitely be getting the post van, not sure about the plane though. both are awesome, but i think i have enough planes... can you tell me though, the wheels on the van, are they rubber or plastic? they look a bit tacky...

4 loool : spielberg goes on a career change :-d these are some nice sets. i really love that car. looks sleek

3 thanks *yoda* for the great reviews. i love the airplane, it's really cute. the van needed to grow on me though but you did the trick. i don't like the wheels of the van. they will need replacing. and wouldn't everything have been better if they were completely red? dr. brick

3 i didn't know that the other models in this set came with interiors. this changes everything!

4 another great review from dunamis thanks! i will get it if i can find it on sale!!

4 thanks for the great review! very in depth! *y* *y* those wheel pieces are quite old by the way, i have 1 from some time ago. ~peace

3 agentrick57, on jan 26 2008, 12:42 pm, said: probably going to do an interior soon. have fun.....its pretty hard theres hardly any room in my house now i will post pics soon. (i was able to fit a small fridge & freezer under the stairs 8-? )

4 very nice! i have been debating on whether or not to buy it-it would appear you made up my mind for me! *y*

1 a big thumbs down for me. this doesn't look like lego at all :-| *n* *n* *n* *n* *n* out of *n* *n* *n* *n* *n*

1 thanks for the review, but its an utter pass for me on this one - i already have a huge juniorized plane from the airport set - one is enough for me! :-$

1 thanks for the review, unfortunately the pictures did not load for me! i have to say having seen other images, i do agree with your comments, the plane is far to big, and not enough details. that sums it up for me!

1 i have to agree with almost all of the replies here that this set is the most ugliest looking lego set i have ever seen. if i have never seen this set, and ppl showed it to me, i would have thought it would be some little kid's moc or something (no offence!) huge juniorized pieces, bad color theme (i would say it would look better if the wing is white), no interior and huge dss! i will avoid this set like the plague. i own the entire city line (except for the airport) and planning to get all the city stuff that lego releases. but, this set will ruin my plans coz i will avoid it... unless someone gives it to me for free. haha *wacko* boo lego boo! :-x

1 this still looks like a cool set but the price not so much. do all lego police set come with the polizei option or just ones from europe i have not bought a police set in years. edited by legoman132, 11 september 2008 - 05:30 pm.

4 nice review, very detailed. *y* as for the spare parts, mine didn't come with any. both dark grey 1x1 round plates are used on the weapons rack (one for the armour, one for the helmet) and i only got one robot hand for holding weapons.

4 thanks, agentrick! actually redman's based on the wrestling costume version of spider-man, as seen in this set. *sweet* ~peace

3 commander andrew of 501 st, on jan 19 2008, 12:51 am, said: seems like a good set should i get it? btw how did you get you hands on this? well if you like the fantasy line then yes, if not no. i had to get this set through shop @ home, took ages to get here i'm sorry to say.

4 nice review. *sweet* this is a must buy for me since i *wub* the new sand green giant troll! now i just have to wait until it's available in the us :'-( general tarful

4 thanks for the review *vader*! the first picture of the troll is great, the gold armour really shines! x-d a fantastic set, i'll definitely get a couple of these! *wub* as for the ogres/'giant trolls', the dark tan one fits in the mine setting well, but for above ground, settings, i prefer the sand green one. *y* ~peace edited by iamded, 19 january 2008 - 10:21 am.

4 thanks for that vader, i love this helmet *wub* it will certainly work great as an asian dynasty war helm i reckon. thanks again. batbrick is back! >:-)

3 batbrick, on jan 19 2008, 01:39 am, said: thanks for that vader, i love this helmet *wub* it will certainly work great as an asian dynasty war helm i reckon. thanks again. batbrick is back! >:-) yeah it's alot better than the other one, i'll have to buy some extra ones now just to replace the old ones |-/ still let's hope the new impulse set has the new version *y*

4 those extra helmet pictures just seal how much i love those new helmets *wub* they look so great.

1 great review, vader :-) as i've said before, this is a nice set, but doesn't really come with anything that doesn't come with the other sets of the line. for this reason, it will be somewhere at the bottom of my list for 2008. also, i like torso and helmet of the dwarf mining orcs much better. the colours make the torso look rather dull and boring, while the other, more brown one, looks much clearer and more exciting. i think i like the *knight* helmet better too, looks more covering and threatening than this one, although i'll save my judgement until i have one in my hands. thanks again vader ;-) edit: forgot to mention, hilarious pic in your sig, vader :-d edited by tinypiesrus, 19 january 2008 - 08:28 am.

3 vader, on jan 19 2008, 01:32 am, said: am i the only one who thinks this helmet looks a bit like the juggernaut from x-men?

4 tks for the review mate ;-) now i have to bloody wait long because lego france has this line available in freaking march >:-( pissed *yoda* on !! :-d i love the "new" goblin :-p that helmet is really cool. why on earth tlc didn't include that one in the dwarf mine ? such another idiotic move |-/ anyone keeping track of tlc's stupidity lately ? that would be interesting !! i clearly want a huge goblin army now hehe !! and i totally agree with you mate, the troll lokks better in sand green. the cart itself is pretty lame imo - just a sordid excuse to include yet another annoying shooting crappy device. but for a 21? set its okie i say ;-) need my bad guys on !! *yoda*

3 thanks for the review of a set i would otherwise probably have passed on. out of curiosity how did you 'know it was for you'? you seem to be building quite a collection. why castle now? was the fantasy element all it took? just curious. thanks again and god bless, nathan

4 lego city truck & forklift set # 7733 pieces: 343 price: $24.99 (usd) store of purchase: toys r'us release date: january 2008 after discussion of the mysterious yellow cargo contained in this new city transport set and a visit to my local tru, i purchased this set. i was immediately pleased with the price/piece which i think is pretty reasonable (343 pieces for $25). starting with the box, great city artwork boasting "special edition": tha backside of the box (no alternate models comes as no surprise): the dreaded decals (i was looking for the skull and bones for radioactive, but no such luck): my favorite part of the set, a very clever forklift: side view: and the backside: what i like about the forklift is the bars across the top giving the vehicle a "real-life" design. the double wheels in the front with two pieces that can hold the wheels also adds to a clever design: i like the figs (although not much new - perhaps i'll make the driver into a werewolf later): the set includes three cargo pallets, the first some sort of fuel with gauge: the 2nd, two indy containers, and a square 2x4 brick (i have not put the decals on yet): and the mysterious yellow cargo. your guess is as good as mine :-$ . on to the truck, the front section: the front grill: another angle: the back: i like the opening mechanism that is very simple, but works well. also is the large plate tile piece inside. i like this because the entire interior has no studs: and the trailer section of the truck: orange and yellow tail lights: and the rear trailer open: the complete set: summary: this is a neat set that reminds me a bit of classic lego city (but larger). it is very playable and has a lot of accessories adding to the value. the build was very simple, and enjoyable (took me about an hour). it is a great addition to a number of city sets including the cargo ship, container stacker, the world city cargo train, and the new cargo plane. as i mentioned previously, i have not yet put on the decals that i'm sure will really add to the overall look of the set. the forklift is awesome and i like the cargo containers. the truck could have benefited from a few additional details (chrome smokers, and an undercarriage box that really opens). considering everything, i would buy this set again. hope you enjoy and perhaps this mysterious cargo will make its way into a brickster mystery. *y*

3 question: what's different with this "special edition"? btw, nice shots!

3 general kannon, on jan 19 2008, 05:10 am, said: im guessing the main difference is the fact that the box says special edition. it's either that or it's a toysrus exclusive set, as my armoured drilling unit box also had special edition on it.

4 thanks for the review! that forklift is wonderful! *wub* i may have to pick this one up convince dragonator to pick this one up! :-d too bad it can only hold 1 crate. :-/ ~peace

3 i'm curious, for those of you who are not into city sets and want this set for the forklift, what would you use it for?

3 mr tiber, on jan 19 2008, 10:26 am, said: hmmm, put it in my pirate port and use it to carry rum! perhaps that's the mysterious cargo. mr. tiber replaced the petro with rum... :-d

1 highlandcattle, on jan 20 2008, 09:15 am, said: this set looks pretty good to me, it is six wide isn't it? that is nice for a truck like this yes, 6-wide. the only problem with these big trucks is how they look on the city roadplates (i've always thought too big), compared to classic city trucks. getting off topic, i'd like to see lego make a car transport truck. i don't think i've ever seen one in lego. it would definately have to be 6-wide, or even larger.

3 hollisbrick, on jan 20 2008, 04:38 pm, said: edit: $7!!!!! geez i thought $6 was bad :-x oh, my bad! i forgot to say that's 7 nzd, not usd or euros or pounds or anything. :-$ don't panic! thanks for the comment! batbrick, on jan 20 2008, 04:41 pm, said: yay! another redman review! you are an excellent reviewer iamded redman, your pictures show all the details included in the set and your thoughts bring new light to features and bits i hadn't noticed or thought about before *y* i love this little set, i will get two i reckon, because i want all the wizard bits in a minifig box as well. nice little humorous pic at the end too. one improvement i think could be to include the pics of the back of the box and other side of the instructions anyway. honestly, there isn't much to improve, you are an excellent reviewer :-) redman on! batbrick is back! >:-) thanks batbrick! :-d i sometimes flick from the minifig view of things to a person's view of things, but no one seems to notice, so it's okay. x-d and i didn't include pics of the back of the instructions and box because they were included in some one else's knight review, and there's no change. but i will include them in future, in case someone hasn't seen any of the other reviews of the set i'm reviewing. x-d expect to see a review of arachnoid stalker (or battle arachnoid) in the near future! ~peace

4 iamded, on jan 20 2008, 05:29 am, said: his belt has 4 gold crosses (as seen in, if you look closely, the new crownie's torso and the crownie archer's torso) and a belt buckle, and the legs have a bottle, a coin, and a small bag. nice little wizard-ey items. i think the "coin" is actually some kind of amulet or locket. nice review, keep them coming! *sweet*

4 thanks for the review of this nice little set. for it's price (3 euros here in holland) it contains quite a lot of useful parts. the only thing that could have been better in my opinion is the wand, i always liked this one:

4 well, since no-one seems to have done one for this set, here we go.... here's the complete set in all its glory. yes, i really like it, but then, tabletown has the capacity to support it and my green army have their eyes on it as a potential military transport as well. :-) i'll start out with the little airport ground car thingy - very neat and functional, here are views front and back: next up, the steps which allow the plane crew to embark and disembark: and to round off this little trio, the cargo loading platform, here in its lowered position. note the prong thingy sticking out from the rear: and here raised. the prong thingy is now hinged up to support the back of the platform and keep it level: here's a slightly different angle so you can see the pieces under there: the all-important cargo itself! hmmm...not much for a plane this size... the cargo pallet slots neatly onto the loading platform: here's the complete set of ground equipment - all attached: and so onto the plane itself. note that unlike the other large planes, the main wing sits at the top of the row of bricks making up the side of the fuselage: i took it apart a little so you can see the internal construction of the fuselage. note that the cargo area is really small, right at the back. what else is this thing carrying? illegal immigrants? :-) a picture of the rear of the fuselage, just because i like the sticker: front landing gear. way better than on the other large planes. i don't know if this is a new piece or what but i've had no problems with it at all, and my kids have been playing with it as well: the rather sexy rear undercarriage - this area reminds me of one of those giant russian transport planes - wicked: those angled grey slopes atop each side of the rear undercarriage annoy the heck out of me as they keep coming off whenever i pick the plane up. i think a 1x4 plate on top to bind them together might solve that. a slightly blurry view (sorry) from underneath. the gear looks like it might be capable of retracting internally, but alas, no. this is a shame as there's certainly enough room in there and it's a wasted opportunity imo. might have to modify that... a view of one of the four engines, i personally think they look too small and should have something under the wing as well to make them rounder: cockpit: crew door, open. i love the smooth action of these doors and the way they seal flush against the fuselage when closed: cargo door, open: crew door with docked ladder: cargo door with docked loading platform: cargo slots inside and locks into place the same way it sits on the loader, neat: the minifigs, sorry this one is a bit blurry: and that concludes this week's "show and tell". dr. s.

3 lt. veers, on feb 4 2008, 11:42 pm, said: i do admit the amount of cargo is rediculously small, but it still looks good. say, how much can the plane hold? thanks for the review! *sweet* that's all the space you get. now, it might be possible to rip out that rear bulkhead at the back of the wing and fill the middle area with tiles so cargo pallets could slide up the fuselage. but that would definitely prevent the undercarriage folding internally if that's what you wanted to do as well. dr. s.

3 thanks for the review and pics dr s! i am still considering this set. what is the instruction manual number?

1 hairy ruben, on feb 5 2008, 10:55 am, said: holy snap that thing is ugly :-x luckly those doesn't fly above us. :-/

3 thanks for the review, i like the looks of the set but i'm not sure about it still. is it work ?35? would you recomend buying it?

3 the amount of cargo that huge plane carries! 8-? green peace would have a field day! x-d nice review dr s but this set is just too big for my town scale! ;-) edited by casewindu, 05 february 2008 - 09:54 pm.

3 nice review, dr. s! i have been thinking long and hard about the scale of the planes in my town. i would like to keep my passenger planes in their classic 4-wide fuselage style, but i really don't mind the new plane hull pieces if they are used as an enormous transport plane like the ilyushin-76. unfortunately i can't afford this lovely new green one at the moment (which would be perfect to go with my green army) as i took too much of a hit buying the new 2008 star wars sets! but i have modified my white one to take huge cargo loads, in fact my apc is designed specifically to fit inside. unfortunately i'm a bit busy to take pics at the moment, but hope to put some up soon.

3 at my local wal*mart there was most of the 2008 sets including the indiana jones ones :'-) i picked up this one and the motorcycle chase! name: 7621 lost tomb price: $20.00 parts: 277 figs: 3 *box art first off we have the great indiana jones box art!! i must say the designers did an excellent job on it! i love the little temple design with skulls! as well as including indy in the right hand corner. the back of the box is just as cool showing all the neat play features of the set as well as an advertisement for the indiana jones game *figs first off we have our hero, indian............. what the hell? why is there a freaking cw anakin head on indy!! there was a production slip up as instead of indy's head i get anakin's! :-| |-/ i open the box up and there staring me in the face is his ugly face!! tlc is defiantly doing to here a gnarly complaint from me!! >:-( ok now here we have the " real" indy fig that is supposed to come with the set :-d i just noticed that his fedora hat goes down in the back! bonus picture time, here is a jacketless indy with his sleeve torn off, like he looks in the temple of doom *sweet* the next figure up is our lovely marion *wub* *wub* *wub* plus her head is reversible with a scared face x-d love the new hairpiece in black!! finally we have our undead skellie with second style head and poseable arms *the well of souls the set itself is a nice model and playset! the anubis statues are very cool and i love all the hieroglyphs on the walls 8-? here is the sw link with artoo and 3p0 x-d the ark in its resting place the ark removed, its very cool indeed, but tlc should have made the whole thing in chrome gold |-/ not metallic gold with brown and yellow!! the closeup of the anubis statue, yes the eye is a sticker but at leasts a gold color! *playability first off you can pull the pin on the anubis statues which send them falling and taking out the walls. behind the wall a skellie swings out! there is a lever in the back of the model where you push down and the snakes shower down upon the figs hehe with the snakes all around, marion is both modeling with the new carrot torch and fending off viscous cobras :-d in the meantime indy uses his whip to scale the wall and avoid all the snakes which he is afriad of. in the meantime leaving marion behind to fight them off. :-p the whip is bendable but it will always snap back into a coil, its some type of bendy hard plastic *scoring figs- 9/10 model- 8/10 playability- 8.5/10 overall satisfaction- 4/10 (would be 9/10 if it wasn't for the stupid anakin head error!) in the end this is a charming set and could easily fit in with the adventurers! it has the cool anubis statues as well as the ark. plus indy, marion and a skellie, great selection of figs but sallah would have been better since he actually removes the ark with indy however i am still wondering the point of the anubis statues, this set does seem pretty silly :-p p

4 thank you for this review! it is a brilliant set! i am definitely getting this set once indy is released in new zealand hurry up tlc! >:-( ps:could i have pic of what indy looks like with an old classic whip?

1 wow what a screw up from lego! that one is even more out there than the extra obi wan in the rc. x-d

4 welcome to: my sigfig sgt. joey sh. will lead trough this review of the new city 7743 police surveilance truck. first of all the box: front back the minifigs: 3 police officers and a bad guy now the vehicles: the cute little atv *wub* the main part of the set: the surveilance truck a shot of the interior the trailer back of the trailer the truck back side the little building: front the interior and last but not least: spare parts and not needed stickers that?s it! hope to see you again at the next episode of sgt. joey?s reviews.

3 great review stealth hunter, a bit blurry in places but overall nice shots of the truck. it is much, much better than i expected, but i still won't get it, i have no need for more police. thanks for the great review! batbrick away! >:-)

3 i like the new station but the truck is a good question. i still like the classic 1994 one and the 1980's can that was one of the first units i got

4 great review, batbrick! iamded got what he deserved. x-d

4 great review! keep them coming! i might get this set now. i must have those grey barrels... oh dear... :-d x-d :-p x-d this was a hilaruos review, too. edited by ~vbbn~, 10 february 2008 - 11:21 pm.

1 i wish i could just get those grey barrels alone, the rest of the set doesnt really intreigue me much :-$ thanks for the review.

4 i really like this set... even though i was hoping for a mini-motor! :-d chock full of great parts too. thanks for the review. *sweet*

4 thanks guys, heres the final part: the instructions for the boat begin on page 46: the overall set, its actually much nicer than i thought it would be, the pictures on the box make it look ugly. top view, tommy guns do not actually come with set ;-) side view, the designers have done an excellent job with the hull, considering the lack of many slopes pieces. you can see it is pretty much minifig scale too: here you can see that by pushing in the red technic axle, the "anchor" on the front will be hauled back into the boat: back view, these outboard motors are pretty cool, though i wish they could go own into the water more: overall, though the weakest model, its still a lot of fun, and has a clever way around the lack of a shapely hull. i was impressed with it after the building it, it even has two rounded snotty bottom pieces on the nose of the boat to give the impression it is speeding through the water with the front lifting up. lots of leftover pieces for this one: the pieces: sorry about the poor photograph there, it was getting late :-$ overall the cargo chopper is another great set in the fantastic creator line. loads of fun, great play, and some clever designs, it challenges you to make your own things, and even includes some nifty pieces (bley barrels! *wub* ) i won't give it a rating, but i'll just say i certainly recommend it to fans of the theme and lego fans in general. now, finally, iamded and i teamup in the face of a larger foe. get that lord of pies! batbrick away! >:-)

4 howdy how , my batman fellows! today i was in a toy mart - and i was looking for a sw set - but all were that expensive! then i saw this batman set ! for -> 13 ? yea ! 13 euros! :-p i had to pick it up! as i came home i started building! figs: i really like them both cause they are new to me ! the green dude x-d looks cool! batman is also very cool! building it : first there was this speeder boat from this green dude :-p , it looks really cool and these shark eyes ( or what are that) look also really nice! then there came batmans speeder boat - its a nice little ship! then the boat : its really cool the simple makes it that good ! at the end i got that : ranking : figs 10/10 parts : 8 /10 playablity :8/10 price 10/10 -> 13 euros there .. thats a good price! overall ranking of aayla : i think i got batman feever - am guessing wich set i pick up at next .. any ideas wich is good - or wich you can say me .. was good is good?! batman collection deffinitly on!!! aayla

4 congrats to that nice review.... i like the batcave set, you should also been able to find it at discount....

4 thank you for your wonderful review! ) i was done very well.... ) i suggest that you will find "two-face's escape" set a very interesting one to build.... it also provides great playability and is not very expensive for what you will get. ) good day to you. )

4 very nice review, lord of pies! thanks for taking the time to put this together, and especially for all the detailed pics. *y* i very much regret that my dark ages occured when they did. basically, i missed out on all the cheap and easy troop building sets, and this one is certainly no exception. the big sets are nice, but these are the ones that always make me wish just a little harder for a return of lego pirates... :'-) i gave it a 4 out of 5, just because i'd buy 4 out of 5 sitting on the shelves today, were it possible.

4 great little set! i bought this set only a few years ago misb and i am still very happy about it. the hut is simple but very effective as a castaway building on some deserted island, the palmleaves are a good addition to any lego collection. this set had a nice amount of weapons, two for each pirate and two of those weapons are flintlock muskets as opposed to just pistols. nice poll as well, but you made sure nobody can give this set a 1 which is very nice (but probably a little mistake :-d ). i gave it the top-rating. *y*

4 wow. i remember this set from when i was a kid. i got it for my birthday and opened the package first. sadly, i had to go to school so i had to leave it at home and not build it or play with it until i got home. needless to say that was one of the longest days of school ever. good review, great set.

4 great small set that can help you add to you minifig count. the little boats are always cool, and the den isn't that bad either.

4 a very nice review of a pretty and neat little set, thanks lord of pies, guess it´s a 3 for me, with strong tendencies to 4....

3 laurinator- i don't mind an occassional old review coming back to life for discussion, but it seems you've replied to many old reviews that have been stagnant for years. please try to refrain from "bumping" a lot of old topics as it pushes down new content that should really be the focus of discussion now.

3 well since this topic has resurfaced, i would add my 2 cents about my appreciation of this set. it was the first and (unfortunately) the largest pirate set i owned as a kid, but i played the wazoo out of it. some of the minifigs have lost almost all their face printing after so many play sessions! theres just something about the hut that appealed to me more than the cheesy skull-face islands we keep getting.probably that it wa kind of neutral, good for my pirates, settlers or islanders. though the palm leaves were rather fragile and used to break off the studded parts. it would be nice to get more of these "beach village army builder" sets. edited by ardelon, 21 september 2014 - 03:40 pm.

3 thanks for the review brainbox. *sweet* these look really nifty* i might pick up a couple of these as for the parts, i'm sure they could come in handy for something. and so cheap as well. i still miss x-pods though. :'-( *do the kids still say nifty these days? *wacko*

3 ricecracker, on feb 19 2008, 06:39 pm, said: why not? they are all very nice (i have all six of them), especially the helicopter, my least anticipated, but one of the most detailed!! thanks for the review brainbox!! well, i shall wait until it goes for $1.25 on my s@h, than buy it with a load of other sets. plural, on feb 19 2008, 07:25 pm, said: thanks for the review brainbox. *sweet* these look really nifty* i might pick up a couple of these as for the parts, i'm sure they could come in handy for something. and so cheap as well. i still miss x-pods though. :'-( *do the kids still say nifty these days? *wacko* eurobrickers do, that's for sure!

4 thanks for these great reviews brainbox, i never expected you to do a review for some reason. i love these mini sets, the train in particular is great. i won't get any though, those indy sets are coming in fast and i'm gonna need all the money i can muster. still they are nifty little sets. batbrick away! >:-)

4 brainbox, on feb 20 2008, 02:55 pm, said: you're welcome guys. :-d sorry, that just made me laugh. i did some research and re-read tyour review. i will pick this up this weekend. quote yeah, so do i. they really were a neat idea. i had all the x-pods. they were awesome. i haven' collected all of these though.

3 mmmmh, i *wub* love the train... great review. it looks like each model can be connected to the other to make a complete train. *y* *y* it makes me want to get 3 of them (or more) to make a long one. :-d

4 so here it is finally, my first ever review of a lego set..oh wait, it's actually 2 sets. so i don't really know how to do it right, but i'll try the best. (sorry if some pictures are a litte bit dark, but i'm not really into photography and i got bad light here) let's start with the dwarf's mine defender: theme: castle 2008 set name: dwarf's mine defender number: 7040 pieces: 86 price: ?9,99 (eur) first, as always, the box: the back, a few instructions on how the defender works, for those how don't know ;-) : and the instructions: we continue with the minifigs, sorry i forgot to make a closeup of the dwarf: and finally the mine defender itself, i personally think it isn't as bad as maybe some people think. the chain for the catapult is great i think: i kinda love those controls, the mechanism with the rubbe rband actually works pretty well, but only on a not-glossy underground. that's pretty much all of it, it's small but i like it a lot. so let's go on to the tower raid now, which would be my absolute favorite of those new sets. -------------------------------------- theme: castle 2008 set name: tower raid number: 7037 pieces: 364 price: ?29,99 (eur) again, first the box & instructions: we got 2 sets of instructios here, one for the tower and one for the siege tower: the minifigs, we got one archer and one soldier here, both with the torsos of the 2007 sets: now thw orc side, starting with the great leader, with the new armor and the golden helmet (i love those pieces!): closeup of the armor & helmet: then we got another orc-knight: and the prisoner, with handcuffs! the crownie tower looks great overall, though there is something i don't really like about it, but later on that. now the back, and that is what really bothers me, there areno walls on the first floor except the one with the wall-piece and the door, and theprison also is open at the back. the orc easily could jump out there: not sure what these are all about, they really don't add much to the set: enough rant now, let's go on with a pretty sweet detail, the golden crystal on the little table: the wall piece on the first floor you can ram in: and finally the very best thing of this set, the amazing orc siege tower! from the front: the great working ram, you can pull it back very far and it got pretty much power: here we got another sweet detail, the siege "platform" that moves out by pulling a cord in the back of the tower: finally a picture of a bit siege action: if you ram in the lower wallpiece, the brown shelfs of the prison-floor collapse and the prisoned orc is finally free! summary: likes: as i mentioned before, i really think that's the best ever produced siege tower, it's got so mich details and works extremely well, also the overall look of it is magnificant. the destroy-mechanism of the tower is pretty cool too, the brown door is a fine detail too. nothing much to say about the mine defender, i like this little set, and there's nothing really to bother about it. dislikes: the back of the tower. that's really the only thing that's a bit bad imo, they could have put there 2 more walls on the first floor and something to lock the prison easily. final thought: the tower raid for me personally is the best of the 2008 sets so far, it's got great playability and looks simply good. my opinion: buy it!

3 this set didn't come with the new jail door piece? i'd have guessed it would have, since there is an orc in prison. nice review. i'm looking forward to picking up these sets. steve

4 *sweet* wow!! another excellent review! haha, that tower does reminds me of kk ii of mistland tower =x well, overall, i love these 2 sets very very much *sweet*

1 xwingyoda, on mar 1 2008, 06:32 am, said: its still looks good but the crappy rubber band system is really not well thought off. *yoda* i totally agreed with your comments. the rubber system is not effective at all. i bought 2 defenders recently and i found out that when the wheels move, the rubber just stuck there without rotating the blades at the front :-/ i have not really found a solution for mine yet. so far, i only took out the rubber band, placing the blades on the ground, removing of the red technic part on the left side. in this way, when the defender is moving on smooth ground, the blades will move too ;-)

4 now that this topic has been brought up again, i just want to say that the rubber band on my dwarf mine defender actually works

4 wow! that's a great review i'm glad you took so many pictures, this set is far better than i ever expected it to be, the detail inside is great. is it the first set you'e given 100% to?

4 a great reveiw dunamis *y* . you have only backed up what i thought when the pictures first appeared, if you are a lego fan there is no excuse not to buy this set. it is a must have! i love the mouse hole and the mouse and his cheese *wub* .

4 damn you to hell dunamis >:-( now tks to you i really want the 3 sets put together x-d wow that is what i call a sweet review 8-? tks for taking the time to make once again such a fantastic one ;-) the overall look of the building is brilliant and i love the nice additions they did: the cheese and mouse (jerry :-d ) is hilarious !! i didn't know green grocer had a rodent infestation !! and the use of the new built furniture and detils like the radiator is freaking awsome !! also that set has a definite plus for me: its the back details !! i love the stairs, the deck with table !! wowx that is what i call sweet backdoor details !! now its clear that i will need to buy the 3 sets asap !! tks once again dunamis ;-) *yoda*

4 very nice. very nice, indeed. lots of lovely, little details, even at the back. this review hasn't changed my opinion one bit, i'm still looking forward to when i can finally pick up mine at the post office. i'm crossing my fingers that there will be more buildings following after this one. i'm guessing that lego's just testing the waters to see how far afol's are willing to go regarding price vs. details. green grocer is still epic, though.

4 this is a nice review, thanks for all the great pictures!

4 truly an awesome review. thanks dunamis. i ordered my two copies (one to build, one to store in the "vault") last week. can't wait to get this one! the attention to detail here is what makes the set great. there's nothing to criticize about this set. it's really the closest thing to perfection that i have seen from tlc. the difference between this set and cc is the interior detail, and because of that, gg now become (in my opinion) the best set ever released by tlc. do the cc/gg/ms sets fit well with the 50th anniv. town plan? my impression is that out of the box, at least, they don't. which is too bad. however, i don't think it would be hard to mod the town plan so it looks like it belongs in the same town as cc/gg/ms. these sets, to me, are what i have always wanted from tlc as an adult. i hope they keep up the line, and add more elements to this excellent lineup.

3 afol sf, on mar 8 2008, 06:29 pm, said: a very informative review, indeed. thank you so much for doing so. now i know that the price is worth every penny leaving my pocket. ;-) what do you guys think is tlc putting up as the next modular set? is it asking too much of tlc to produce 1 modular set each quarter (4 times a year)? i would vote for a bank next.

4 wow, another old technic set review by you. nice set, and thanks for that review.

3 looks like you have the original 1989 version with the yellow top cylinders. :-) i got one too several years ago, although i probably paid too much for it. :-p on a side note, if that pneumatic tubing feels harder and stiffer than the modern type, i highly recommend that you don't use it and buy some of the newer stuff off bricklink instead. tlc originally used a different material for the tubes and this stuff degrades the nozzles (on pistons, switches and so on) over time. the old tubes also grip the nozzles much more firmly and if you aren't careful when removing them, it's actually possible to rip off the nozzles completely. x-o i had this happen a few years ago, although tlc replaced my broken pistons for free. i got rid of that stuff for good after that, although the pistons on my power crane still have slightly discolored nozzles. edited by cp5670, 10 march 2008 - 04:57 am.

4 i bought it some years ago for the b-model, and like it so much :d

3 this was my first pneumatic set

4 this was my first technic set, aged 7! still a great one in terms of function density, and a great b-model. in the uk i'm certain it was called the "salvage hoist".

4 yeah. if i rebuild and wash a model i will record it. glad to see you liked it!

4 ah a good old retro review. those old school days had some pretty impressive sets, with alot more complexity than modern sets. if you have it may i recommend 8880?

4 nice pictures. i also sort out the pieces the same way if i'm rebuilding a model. *y* this set packs a lot of functionality into a fairly small size, but was rather expensive for its size ($70) when it was still available, compared to other sets of that time. you can also rig up the technic flag sticker that it comes with to the main model. i've done that on mine. you may want to reinforce it with tape if you're going to leave the model on display though, as it will break up over time due to uv exposure like many stickers do. i had to do that with mine after it started to crack, although it still looks pretty good.

1 i've seen a few cases like this where the box pictures are slightly different from the actual model. the airtech claw rig compressor is another one that comes to mind. the changes sometimes seem pointless and make you wonder why they bothered. :-p quote the only original stickers are the front headlight-patterns on the 2 red 1x2 bricks. the others have been destroyed - must have been the bad decaying sticker quality that breaks when you'll remove it - so i printed them. i didn't print the flag for only the alternate model needs it, although it's a neat idea...! the other stickers on mine have held up pretty well, although i didn't try to remove them after i put them on. the flag started to break after a year or so and just fell off its axle at one point. i taped over it and it's holding up well now, although it's a little frayed along one edge. this is actually the earliest set i've seen that uses this crappy sticker material (which is unfortunately very common today). even other technic sets had good stickers for many years after that.

4 wow, that first picture is great! you must have a very wide angle lens with the capability to focus very close (macro). the perspective makes the model look huge. nice work. i think the suspension on this set is my favorite of all technic. it has such large travel and is so.... what word should i use..... "bouncy". hey, why do you only review sets which are red? :-d eric

3 blakbird, on mar 10 2008, 09:35 pm, said: hey, why do you only review sets which are red? :-d i exactly thought that today as i made the pics for my signature...! x-d at my school leaving examination i made a model in blender3d and explained to the board of examiners how to build a car and how to animate it. it needed a color, so i took red "because all beautiful and fast cars are red..." my physics teacher contradicted. :-)

4 a neat review of a cool set with very informative pictures, thanks bernddasbrot! *y*

4 i can remember that i've seen a few color variations on brickshelf and on ebay (they sold well). it's new and familiar at the same time. that makes it more interesting!

4 somehow i also managed to get this set in very good condition (including box, instructions and all stickers) for a mere €22 a few months ago. this is indeed a very special set, and was a pleasure to build. the only flaw i noticed was weak support of the rear drivetrain, which was easily corrected with a few extra plates.

4 cool review. makes me want to get the set. *y*

4 well, as bad a concept aliensvshumans is for a theme... i really do like this set. the human rover has nice parts for reuse, especially those oldschool space wheels. and despite those wobbly wings, i really like the alien ship. goes from a flying saucer-ish shape to a spread winged almost raven shape, very ominous and cool looking. now that 'alien commander' is terrible... if i don't buy bionicle minifigs already, why would i be interested in that thing? kinda wish they'd take the drones from the retiring exoforce theme and do them in green, they'd make nice alien robot things...

3 (sorry, double post)

4 that looks like a very nice set! :-) in your opinion, how does it compare to the current dune buggy? -toa of justice

4 hello all apologize for digging out a such old post. recently i got a bag of lego technic parts where there have been mixed three sets: 8858, 8829 and 8235 the resurrection of 8858 has been described by me in a separate post. going back to the dune buggy – when i saw it for the first time back in 1994 i did not like it, as i was always big fan of 8840 (which i consider to the day the best looking buggy) and set 8829 looked to me ugly. so there were those all parts in the bag… then i though why not build it ? and i started to do it. when i finished i was very surprised how the final look of this set is! really taking my words back. unfortunately in the bag there were missing some parts and i could not rebuild the back spoiler. so i made some changes to it and make it from spare parts that i have and it came out acceptable. i also added some additional parts such as “fake” steering wheel, “rally” logo, antennas. i have also reverse mounting of the rear tires – why lego did them like that i never know – as i think they look better this way. set: well the review has been already made by owner of this post so i will only add few things into it. engine – v2 (aired cooled?) is driven by 4 gears -> from the single wheel (no differential as in 8840) using two old school z14 tooth bevel , then by z24 tooth crown and z8 tooth type 1. actually the (as in most old sets) the pistons are moving very fast (not as in current sets) and smooths – i needed to extra clean all engine parts as there was a lot friction. suspension – set has “engine bay” working using two old gray shock absorbers 6,5l – the movement is not big but works very nice, better then in 8840 in my opinion. steering – this is a bit odd as there is no direct connection to hog as in most old sets, but first the gear rack is moved by z8 then two z14 tooth where reverse movement is taking place. later connection of two old school z14 tooth bevel goes to hog details – this is the most that i like in this set, specially how the use of axle pin connector perpendicular and 1x10 bricks with 3x3 cut corners and plate 1x5 toothed ends 2 studs with center axle hole are making the body shape – is just wonder. tires – the balloon rear are pretty nice the front is a new version of those that were in 8840. what i do not like: 1. missing of technic figure (8840 had it.) 2. no steering wheel in the original set 3. no differential – but having in mind that lego has introduce 24-12 teeth would be difficult to build the transmission in such small space where the engine is. i will shortly upload new pictures and post them here later on . over all – i think it is worth buying it as it is very payable ! actually very payable and runs smoothly , the steering, suspension – perfect thank you and regards

4 finally, after a very frustrating incident with the internet explorer 7's 'back' button, i present to you my very first review. this is a review of set 8158 speed racer vs snake oiler, it's also the first review of a speed racer set on eurobricks. also you should know that i didn't put the stickers on as they can be quite valuable later on down the road, so i'm sorry for the lack of stickers. :-$ so without further ado i present to you my first review. he he, that rhymes. :-d edit: i just finished resizing the pics and uploading them to brickshelf after having a heated argument about when my bedtime is with my mother. so, i will be doing a complete redo of the picture portion of my review of set 8158. i'm going to work on that as soon as i finish typing this message... edit 2: review fully redone now, *sighs*, that took forever. edit 3: almost forgot to put in a new link to its brickshelf folder. this is v.2 of my review of set 8158, enjoy... theme: speed racer set:8158 speed racer vs snake oiler price: $19.99us pieces: 242 minifigs: 2 first off pics of the box, instructions, dss, minifigs, and new parts: there are so many stickers they had to number them! x-o so's sunglasses are chrome gold. 8-? close-up of the hemets. new parts include, first system lego hubcap, new more curvy fenders, curved windshield, and a s-shaped connector piece. now onto the build, first speed racer's mach 5: back part of the car. the cockpit of the car. they connect with the new s-shaped piece. front part of the car. front and cockpit also connected using the new s-shaped piece. side view of the car, so far. underside of the car, so far. adding more detail. ground level front view of the car. side view with added detail. underside with newly added axles. demonstrating how the new hubcaps are put on. now on to building snake oilers orange-ilicious racer: back part of the car. the cockpit of the car. they are connected using the s-shaped piece. front part of the car with seemingly random color choices. *wacko* the front and cockpit are also connected using the new s-shaped piece. adding orange-irific fenders. side view of the car so far. adding more detail. smoothing things over. ground level view with lime green "eyes" and white "fangs". side view with more detail. rearword view of the car with newly added cuve-acious windshield. no hubcaps!?! :-| now onto finished views of both cars, first the mach 5: side view with sweet hubcaps. up close and personal with the mach 5. a rearend shot. "i got hubcaps, i got hubcaps!", speed racer. now so's snake racer, yes thats what i'm calling it. :-p :-d beautiful! blurry, :-$ rearend pic. "watchout it bites!", snake oiler he's ready to take on sr, hubcaps or no hubcaps! >:-) racin'! now for some comparison shots: hope you all like v.2 better then v.1, i know i liked it better. x-d seriously though i even learned a thing or two doin' this last version. ;-) now it's time for my summary: overall a very well designed and executed set. it's only downfalls are that there are way too many stickers, 32 to be exact, :-| and there are no cool contraptions on the cars to take out the other racer. a great buy for $19.99, i reccomend this set to everybody because of the reasons i staed above and because even i, who is not a big fan of speed racer, x-o was drawn to this spectacular little set. price: 10/10 pieces: 8/10 too many stickers. minifigs: 9/10 needed some accessories. playability: 8/10 needs some cool contraptions on the cars to take out the other racer. overall: 35/40 general tarful edited by imperialshadows, 01 june 2008 - 12:07 pm.

4 can't wait to get me one of those!!

3 you're wrong. lego has made a hubcap before! here it is: look at the wheels (click).

3 lt. veers, on mar 23 2008, 01:39 am, said: what store did you find this at? x-o great review. i found all the april released speed racers sets in the shop in legoland. i was going to post a review tuesday of this set, but i can see i'm too late. now i cross my fingers for the fierce creatures set doesn't get "taken" as well. i would like to comment on the review, but the pictures are too big - it simply takes too long to load. regarding that new resize function. i can see it does "nearest neighbor" rescaling. doesn't it resize to less than 640x480? i thought that was the standard for forum post pictures. edited by lasse d, 23 march 2008 - 12:55 am.

3 nice, but not my cuppa.

4 as i said elsewhere i couldn't see this reviewed anywhere so here you are! to start with, a couple of box shots: the contents and the parts laid out: the instructions: this is what was left over from the build: and here's the kit complete. build time, about ten seconds if you pick your nose whilst you are doing it. :-d i love the little robot, it reminds me of that weird machine in the first wallace and gromit adventure, in fact, give it some skis and you are away. oh, and it has a metal detector thingy which i might have to borrow for a future episode of grunts (i'm not sure if i have any already...who knows...) cost - £2.49. value for money? erm, no, knock a quid off and i'd say yes. dr. s.

1 i don't even see why you reviewed this set... it didn't tell us anything that isn't perceivable from the box, being so simple. though i do appreciate the effort.

3 as i mentioned elsewhere, i couldn't see a review for this and though it's only small, let's strive for completion! here's the box: the contents: the parts: leftover bits: and the set: not much to it i know, and not much of a review, but there you go...quite a lot of stuff with the copper though. dr. s.

1 when i went to blue water they have dogs in the pick a brick wall so i have plenty! ;-) yes i think i have everything here thats why i havent baught this, the fireman, or the construction worker, they need to bring out something unique.

4 a very neat and useful little set, thank you for the nice review. *sweet*

3 hi! this is my forth pre-old-school review. as promised: a yellow-set ! my 8862 arrived today, survived the washing machine coaster and actually was real fun to build! #1: information: this set contains 664 parts (only! i thought i’d be far more!) and was released in 1989 in the technic theme. be sure to visit technopediaif you want to know more! #2: building instructions: wow these instructions are used! i'm not used to this after all this sets with unread instruction booklets... the pneumatics page: the last step for the alternate model: #3: the parts: wow! look at all those technic beams, gears, pins...! (a few parts are missing in this photo!) #3: building: the left worm gear is for the outriggers, the right one for turning the “rear boom” the three 12l axles: left one: outriggers, middle one: steering, right one: erm… rear-boom-rotation. the two worm gears in the front part: left one: lifting the bucket, right one: dumping the bucket. the turning-mechanism for the “rear-boom” is finished. once again a toothed 10l axle. the boat weight 2x6x2 is hidden underneath the radiator grill. okay… many hoses and a nice, comfy seat have been added. now you can recognize the backhoes real shape. only with a little violence it’s possible to lift the bonnet (?) through the pneumatic pump. yeah, outriggers. same technique that the 8854 uses. the finished “boom / jib / scoop thing” (=bjst) :-| x-d the finished loader bucket. and to end the building process: the same picture from the introduction. (off-topic: “it is all part of the miracle of nature! - the circle of life!” #4: functionality: this time, i tried something new! i hope you can spot something - if not: technopedia! okay, here we go. #5: random shots: i’ve got way too many pictures this time, so i refer to my brickshelf folder. until it’s moderated you can follow the multilingual links! eins deux three quattro fem zes sédem osiem #6: final thoughts: definitely worth buying! as a child i thought it looks hideous - but today i’ve found out it’s totally fun to build and freaking functional. three things i want to mention though: the bjst can only be slewed (a new word!) if the outriggers are deployed. it is also possible that the bjst will reach the ground (danger of grinding or sticking) even if the outriggers are deployed. the two mechanisms for the loader bucket can actually interlock, and the 14 tooth gears might break / disentangle from the axle. thanks for viewing the pictures, i hope you enjoyed it! please comment if you want to!

4 thanks for the review. it looks beautiful. my father was a backhoe driver, so understandably i used to drool over this set in the catalogs. i never did get it though as lego was so expensive in australia then; i had around 2000 pieces and i thought i had loads! :-d anyway, last year i bought 8455, which i love; it works great with a compressor i made too! *sweet* i wish mine had a real cab though... :'-( do you have 8455 as well? i'd love to see how they compare side by side... it looks bigger than 8455 but i don't own any of the big old chuncky tires so i find it so hard to tell. by the way, i have been reading all of your reviews but i have been a bit busy of late so i haven't had time to comment. i hope you have more planned; any chance of a supercar one?

4 a great review for a great set! it even had the old technic t-pieces and bevels, which i actually prefer to their modern counterparts. cp5670, on mar 24 2008, 08:14 am, said: the turntable on the back doesn't turn very well though, as the weight is all distributed on one side. the screw axle prevents it from popping off but there is still a lot of friction in it. i got mine for £20 in a second hand shop; it said complete, but one of the screw knuts was missing! x-o so it's practically impossible to keep the back arm on with only one |-/ and they're rather rare on bl too |-/

4 thanks! *sweet*

3 quote there are ~324 axle nuts on bricklink with an avg price of $0.89. i didn't know of this accessory-set: 5110-2... you can buy it for $40.00 8-? i was thinking of getting one of those off bl several years ago, back when the price used to be more like $15 or so, but i realized that i hardly ever use the couple that i already have. :-p they came out with the modern turntable the year after this set, which mostly negated the need for these screw axles. i think their only use now is to hold non-lego objects onto models, like the technic pen in 8094. i guess you can try to make linear actuators out of them, but they're often too rare and fragile for that.

3 slyowl, on mar 24 2008, 07:53 pm, said: thanks! *sweet* glad to see that i could help! cp5670 said: i guess you can try to make linear actuators out of them could you explain your thoughts please? you know: my english skills ;-)

4 bernddasbrot, on mar 23 2008, 02:32 pm, said: hi! this is my forth pre-old-school review. as promised: a yellow-set ! my 8862 arrived today, survived the washing machine coaster and actually was real fun to build! the finished “boom / jib / scoop thing” (=bjst) :-| x-d thanks for viewing the pictures, i hope you enjoyed it! another great review and a wonderful set of pictures. i like your nomenclature for the bjst. acronyms always sound nicely scientific; much better than "digger". no one would know you made it up until they found out what it means. i also really like what i will call your "kinetic photos". they convey a sense of motion and show the range of the mechanism without the big file sizes of animations. how long of a shutter speed did you use? the secret to not getting too much friction in the turntable is using extra nuts and jamming them together. you don't want to actually clamp the nuts tight across the turntable. you want to jam two nuts tightly together at each end which prevents them from unwinding, but still leave a little free play (gap). this way it will hold the assembly together but not prevent it from moving. mine moves quite easily. this same concept is used on the pen plotter or 8094. "slewed"? i think that's a word. how about "slewn" or "slain" or "slewifacated"? i think "rotated" is best. *sweet* eric

3 quote how long of a shutter speed did you use? 15 seconds. quote by the way, don't forget to build the alternate model of 8862. i will review it too and post it in this topic! quote "slewed"? i think that's a word. how about "slewn" or "slain" or "slewifacated"? i think "rotated" is best. actually i took it from your site! x-d quote white is pretty rare. unfortunately i don't own 8480 but i think 8824 is also a very good (though small) white set! 8462 rocks as a blue set. i just got it a few weeks ago. let's see... 8462 also is one of the last technic sets i would call old-school. 8479... okay too, but 8458 is imho not. 8868 and the totally mysteriously black set will follow...! quote i was thinking you could somehow attach a 16-tooth dark gray gear (the one that spins freely around axles) to the nut, which would make the axle move in and out when the gear turned and convert the gear's rotary motion to linear motion in a fairly compact package. did you had something like this in mind? if the toothed 10l axle rotates the axle nuts want to rotate too but they can't because of that 2x4 technic plate. so they'll decide to move along the axle. the 1x6 bricks on each end make sure that the axle won't move in or out. thanks for your feedback!

4 quote 8462 rocks as a blue set. i just got it a few weeks ago. let's see... 8462 also is one of the last technic sets i would call old-school. 8479... okay too, but 8458 is imho not. yeah, the tow truck was the last set that still used mainly studded beams. they made many changes to technic the following year, with models becoming predominantly studless and making heavy use of the flexible axles/hoses and decorative panels. the technic logo and box art style was also changed a lot. i really like the overall construction of that set. the model is fairly lightweight but extremely sturdy. it must be one of the strongest large sets they've released. quote did you had something like this in mind? that's basically the idea. as blakbird said though, it wouldn't be very powerful and would put the axle under some stress. the linear actuators they're bringing out this year do the same thing and should work much better.

3 @ black shovel: i just tried a black shovel but i can't / don't want to determine which looks better. front, on mar 30 2008, 11:40 pm, said: a great review. i only have new sets, so looking at old ones like this is great. i would suggest multiple pictures

4 some time ago i sort of complained about the fact that there was not much technic represented in the eurobricks community (this was the topic, if someone is interested). i am glad to see someone took that complaint serious and started reviewing technic sets on large scale to show us how fascinating the theme really is! this review is once again an excellent one, i really enjoyed reading it. i must buy this set sometime soon because i always liked the three-way pneumatic system it came with and the overall look of the machine. for many years it seemed out of reach, much to expensive and hard to come by as a kid. now as an adult there are many ways to acquire this wonderful set. keep on reviewing! *y*

4 those are some beautiful cars, thanks so much for the review! *sweet* of the two, i like taejo's one best, as red is my colour. >:-) a perfect car for you and the bird to roll round in. :-d i like the windscreen pieces, they're new right?

4 great review! i personally do not like the stickers very much. it's great that you show us the cars without stickers. hehe, it look nice! was thinking why other characters do not have a visor in front of their helmet

4 again, nice review! lego should have used this for their helmets, you can put a (protecting)glasses(don't know the name) in front of it: offcourse with a little 'm' printed on it.

3 generaltarful, on mar 25 2008, 01:43 pm, said: nope. :-p and thanks hollisbrick. they are both really similar so it really depends on which colors you use more in moc-ing, or which characters you like more. my personal choice is 8159 as it has cooler minifigs, except for racer x's recycled head :-|, and the colors are more useful to me. then again if you're like batbrick the only thing that matters is if a set has orange in it. :-p regards, general tarful thanks *y* probably will get this set although the orange..oh the orange peices 8-? haha anyway once again thanks for the reveiw, and meditate on the decision i will *yoda* x-d

4 crap, now i want these sets!! great review!

4 very good review! these sets are a lot better than i expected, and for $20, i might have to pick up both! my family and i are going to orlando this summer, hopefully i'll pick these and some other sets up at the lego store in downtown disney. :-d

4 a fine review of a fine set, thanks lasse d! *y*

4 thank you for your detailed review, lasse d! *y* the only problem about this set is, that most of the people here will regard this as a pure parts pack. x-d oooh - i just found out about the red "teeth" - cool. i want that! *wub*

4 thank you for review very good army builder i see

4 thanks for a lovely review! i only recently bought this set off ebay (pretty good deal: misb for 30 euro's!) and i enjoyed putting it together and mixing it with the other piratesets. when you put two sets of two baseplates together you'll get a large pond with an island in the center, just to achieve that i bought two more baseplates off ebay. the result is this moc. i always loved the islanders and have most of the sets, not all of them but that is going to change in the future. *y*

4 excellent review! i really like this set and so i gave it a 5/5. this set is on my list to get. i especially like the speedy pirate boat, and the also very fast outrigger canoe with a sail. i don't think a small number of these cannibals will make much of an impact on gaming though, even if they get a bonus with spears. duke

4 good review, mr. slyowl! and good pics too! i know it probably deserves better but i only give him a 3. i'll be surely the only saying that i don't like this set but i remember i had it for christmas when i was a child and it disappointed me very much because i expected it much larger after seeing it in the lego catalogs. well it's just a little trauma i had :-p lol anyway i must admit it's an interesant set, specially because of the large number of mini-figures and accesories it brings with and the two little "ships" edited by bluebard, 31 march 2008 - 01:13 am.

4 excellent review of an outstanding set! i love the main image. i want this set so bad!

4 slyowl, you're a legend! thank you for taking the time to do such a comprehensive review. you've captured enchanted island in impeccable detail and anyone who doesn't own this set should know it inside-out by now. i shall write my thoughts on the set itself, directly.

4 great review! i think this set looks great. i really like the islanders and that statue is really nice. it comes with a lot of nice leaves and i like all of the secret compartments and the like. thanks for the nice review!

3 here is a preview of my review of speed racer: grand prix race i will try to get a full review up later today pics (when public) sorry about the blur, i am not a great photographer. also if, there are any pictures you would like (that i haven't included), just ask

1 judging from your pictures there seems to be many interesting torsos and new fleshy heads but i don't think this set is for me. fueling my dismissal of this set is that i saw the trailer for this film at the cinema today and it looked pretty terrible! :-x thanks for taking your time to review this set though ricecracker! ;-) edited by casewindu, 29 march 2008 - 10:18 pm.

4 i will most likely get all the speed racer sets as it was one of my favorite movies(the animated one) i just loved the decked up and tricked out cars >:-) great review and red tux = x-d

1 doubt ill get this, i used to like the anime but the the film looks cheesy as a cheese sandwhich

4 i picked up this set a few weeks ago (along with the smaller sets that come with the mach 5 and racer x's car), and i was pleasantly surprised. the commentator's stand is nothing to write home about, but the assortment of figs is great (numerous new face prints in flesh, i believe), and in spite of the large amount of stickers, the three cars are each unique and very well-designed. my only gripe about them is that cannonball taylor's car (the black and yellow one) was a missed opportunity, as in the movie it's yellow and purple. i know tlc is dropping purple for the future and had a bunch of problems with it in the past, but it would have made for a great looking car imo.

4 speed racer is the action film.and he has formula 1 car but he is intersted in art of the race.

4 ah, thanks sommuch again for that great review! *y* *sweet* man, i am so happy they made this set. the new one seems too boring. ;-)

4 somehow i competely missed your review when you first made it, i saw your pics on brickshelf and wondered about the review... you have managed to review my all time favourite technic set! it was the first large technic set i was given by my parents, when it first came out in 1995. i played for hours with this set, making minifig seats in it (it was so huge there was room for four minifigs to sit next to eachother in front....) i made various applications for it, a bungee-jump system with a large rubber band, and lots of containers to be lifted. the first changes i made included the inverting of the wheels and the disabling of one of the flashlight-steering wheels because they obstructed eachother. by the way, the nob for your winch is yellow instead of black (i know this set by heart, so watch out :-p ). i always liked those nobs. i do own the 8421 and i can tell you: this 8460 is much, much stronger, it can carry more weight because the boom is lighter then the 8421: they are powered by the same two pistons... you know when you made it right: when the crane is in upright position, fully extended and you release the brake from the winch. does the hook lower without having to pull it? if it does, you succeeded in constructing the set right. the alternate model was great fun too, the pump is cleverly hidden and the crane folds up great between the cab and the loading platform. you could easily mod it with a pneumatic claw on the crane, a motor to turn it and a compressor. the only flaw was the loading platform which had no floor (only some axles). thanks so much for reviving my memorie concerning this great set! *y*

3 i'm in the same situation as you; i have this set but missed out on the newer 8421. this was a great set for its time but the 8421 definitely looks better to me. i've been trying to find a good deal on it on ebay but it's pretty expensive, considering that it only went out of production last year. quote inlay: i wonder why tlg doesn’t make inlays anymore… they’re noisy and brake easily but are great for (pre-) sorting. the box designs in general are crappier these days than they used to be 10 years ago. you don't see the old "featured parts" trays anymore and the boxes don't have the different sections either (these also acted as internal supports for larger boxes, so they were less prone to being crushed). the cardboard material is also quite a bit thinner. i think it's a result of tlc's overall cost-cutting moves since then. most people toss the boxes and probably don't care, but i keep all of them. there was actually a time when the boxes used to be even stronger. i have an old 8859 set and the outer box is made of a hard, styrofoam material, although they probably stopped using that for environmental reasons. edited by cp5670, 06 april 2008 - 10:13 pm.

4 a great review, thank you. i do not know these old sets like this one, but it is very cool to see how they were made. i have an un-opened 8421, maybe i should do a small review of that when i get to build it. btw. boxes are expensive, so at a given price point, it's a choise between more bricks or nicer boxes. i have no doubt what most people would chose. front edited by front, 06 april 2008 - 10:21 pm.

4 front, on apr 6 2008, 05:19 pm, said: btw. boxes are expensive, so at a given price point, it's a choise between more bricks or nicer boxes. i have no doubt what most people would chose. yeah, it's certainly understandable why they did it, but bad for box hoarders like me. :-p

4 great review! while i admit i wasn't into technic at the time this came out (i was a mere child, give me a break! :-d), i can see now why it was featured so much. from the booklets to display stands at toy stores and at my local lego center (when it was still around), this thing was everywhere! with your review, i can now truly appreciate all the details of the set. i got to admit, i can see the appeal now! that comparison shot you took is amazing. i love not only just how it included the little details such as the stabilizers, but also looks incredibly fun to play around with. great set and an even greater review!

3 thanks guys! @ sinner: i hope you refered to 8285 so my answer will match: 8285 is interesting: main model: american styled truck, alternate model: european styled truck. i don't think tlg produced many european styled truck. edit: i just found a wonderful moc-alternate on brickshelf: 8436 by industrialdesigner. if i got him right, he designed a few offical technic sets for tlg. @ all: promises, promises, promises... hm. and again it's ebay that's blocking me. i want to foreshadow my next review (although it'll take some time to make it): i know, you know. but please act inconspicuous until you'll can act very astonished...! edited by bernddasbrot, 09 april 2008 - 03:25 pm.

3 funny review just a question though: did your set come with three cutlasses? also your food crate seems to be missing... edited by sir dano, 15 april 2008 - 09:04 pm.

4 alex54, on apr 15 2008, 08:57 pm, said: those giant ants are made in a smooth plastic, in dark red and trans black colour: i'm pretty sure those 'ants' are actually spiders. i really wanted an in detail review of this set with opinions as well as pictures- and you provided the goods alex54! i really need another tent (i can later use it for rebel troopers), and i love the selection of minifigs. the new spiders are freakin' awesome. why didn't lego make them before this set is a must buy for me (i guess in the uk it will be £8.99) edit: where did you get this set alex54? i really want to know! edited by the rancor, 15 april 2008 - 09:13 pm.

4 actually they are ants. spiders have 8 legs while ants have only 6 like these. the two thing that look like legs in the front are the antennae. back on topic, i think this set looks great and i can't wait until i can get my hands on it and the other new ij sets. edited by erdbeereis1, 15 april 2008 - 09:26 pm.

1 the new man hair looks like a wig!

4 thanks for this review alex54, this looks like a great set. i love the new hair molds and faces, plus al those extra pieces are fantastic! batbrick away!

4 great review

4 nice review indeed thanks for review all these new indianna sets just wondering did your set have a crate as im sure the prims has a crat with a banana in.

4 is that a laptop it's on? does it come with the set? seriously though, it looks liek it has some good pieces, particularily the soldier's clothing and the crocodile hehe. hooray for new indy sets, lets hope the film is as good (it will be).

4 nice review, i like what i'm seeing in this set. i liked the little comic, marion should be arrested though

4 my favorite part of this is prob the amphibious vehicle! looks really neat! nice to see another (different) torso for marion...

4 sweet review again, alex! great pictures, i loved the little comic with the croc. you're quite right here too: alex54, on apr 16 2008, 09:17 am, said: yes you can use all those military things without creating an army in a layout: just put the violent parts out, and you’ve got nice things, like a biologist car in the case of the amphibious vehicle! without the gun, that vehicle is a nice little amphibious car with a tent (i assume) strapped to it, some tools, a spare tire... the little tree hut is quite cool, and a nice touch with the box in behind there. i love the design for those gasoline cans too. thanks again, alex! you're lucky to be getting these sets! ~peace

3 shoc, on apr 15 2008, 10:31 pm, said: is that a laptop it's on? does it come with the set? yes it's a laptop, and it was in the set! when i opened it, i understood why this little box was so heavy! asus is my official sponsor, so i have to show the logo! i have to add that i don't have put on the stickers...

4 just like 7626 this is a must buy in my opinion. i just the amphibious vehicle,very nice for army building.

4 this set looks good. about the jerry cans, i like how they give me more pistols. this may be the only indy set i get from this batch. i'll just have to deal with the fleshie heads... (exchange them for yellow.) like stealth hunter said. this will be good for army building. silent help

4 set ref: 7626 name: jungle cutter number of minifigs: 4 number of pieces: unknown price: 39,99€ a general view of the set: we’ve got 5 giant ants, two russian soldiers, a general, indy of course, 3 trees, a small entrance of a cave, and the debroussaillor vehicle (i don’t know the english name of it…). you can’t enter into the cave, because there is a spider web with its spider…unless… unless you know how the mechanism works and the spider web go up… and reveals a case with diamonds and accessories. a closer view on the mechanism (which is simple but works well), and you can also see the difference, or maybe the same, size of a spider and a giant ant! and i’ve always thought that those spiders were very big compared to the minifigs! so those ants are really giant! poor small frog! the three trees with the entrance make a nice jungle layout! don’t speak too loud, you will wake up the soldier… don’t worry for him, he will be waken up by the vehicle before being eaten by those giant ants! a front view, making the vehicle really menacing! a back view: push the red part from the back and there are two parts that fall down from the vehicle. i don’t know why… the movie will clarify this i think… and here you can see how the two big circular blades turn when you push the vehicle… simple but effective! run indy, run! this set is really nice. the playability of the different elements is great, the colour scheme is nice too (i like those dark green tree parts!). the vehicle is really impressive without being too big and its very well details! in general the designers of the indy sets have made a really nice works, with a lot of efforts in all those details everywhere! i’ve got some project for this set, to integrate it in my city... i’m a city mocer, and not an indy fan. so i don’t have bought the temple, the bigger set of the series, because it has nothing special for me in term of part selections or in the design, in relation with the town theme, and because my supermarket doesn’t have it yet! so, we are waiting for a member to review it and make the part 4…

4 i like the creatures in this very much, and it is good to see the vehicle from different angles. thank you i think i shall buy this.

3 i cant wait for these!

4 excellent review alex. thanks for sharing. i can't wait to buy this set once available. i really like the dark green leaf pieces. i like the cave/temple which will look great in my jungle diorama. blending the dark green and light green works well for the vehicle. overall, a neat little set.

4 great review, thanks a lot for all the pics. i agree that this is probably the nicest set of the indy 4 wave. so much dark green and i love all the plant pieces. it's been ages since we've had enough pieces in a regular release to build nice forests so it's great to see 11 of the dark green leaves in one set and all the vines! the design of the cutter looks very solid and brick built as well. giant ants are great looking too.

3 here some close-up pics of the russian soldiers and the general : and i know that you have seen that i don't have put the stickers on...

4 ahhhhh now this swamp vehicle looks great to me, when i first heard lego were making it i was worried that it would be a poor version. however im pleased to see that it's not, even though i'm not a great fan of those treads. the trees don't really add anything to the set which is a shame, still the parts are welcome at least. the entrance is good though it could do with being bigger, but i guess we can moc that. i really like the commie general, he looks like a real bad megablocks

4 great review again alex !! same question (in case you didn't se it in my reply to the other set): where did you get those new sets ?? i really love that set !! its called jungle cutter the trees are really cool and make a great adition to it imo. that temple entrance or monument is really cool !! those bionicle parts do make fantastic vegetation !! i totally forgot about that green frog !! thats cool , those are so cute !! 5 more ants is great !! the vehicle look really sharp (ah ah ah). 2 more commies yeay !! that officer is really freaky actually !! could have been a high rank under pol pot's regime in the s21... yeay looks more asian than russian imo now its time for my grips: * same bloody rant about indy !! * i haven't read the instructions before but once again there are so many parts in crap colours that need to be changed look at all the crap red and yellow in there !! i will need to look for those parts before buying the set like i always do !! mod while building on !! i am really soimpressed with that indy line !! i sincerely hope it will have a long and healthy life !!

3 xwingyoda, on apr 16 2008, 08:42 am, said: whats that funky name lol! just making sure your yoda-ee awesomeness is known. yep indeed and i have that set if i remember correctly the first line to use it as vegetation is aqua raiders tiger shark attack (7773) a-ha; it was in aquaraiders! it was also the squid's intestines, or whatever lays inside his baggy head. why, its just a flick fire missile in a wrench i'll use my brickarms rgp which is way better oh yeah, i forgot that. ok so i just finished reviewing the instructions and look at the parts you need to just change the horrendous colours !! damn its really getting worse and worse ahh, thanks! i'm definitely changing them; they may be bearers of the red star but they don't need red lining inside their vehicles.

4 looks great

4 what a lovely set! i think i have to put this on my wishlist,just for that beautiful woodcutting tank thingie. 2008 is gonna get expensive for me

4 what a marvelous diversity of plant parts, very nice mfs and a cool and detailed harvester. that conventionalized cave with its neat opening feature´s also very well done. thanks for that fine review of a pretty cool set, alex.

4 great classic dragon den! i love the old green dragons very much! there were my fave. i love these theme very much after the black knights era. this is a very very good set! i wished i can have this too.

4 this was the last castle set i got before my dark age.. really liked it although the big rock parts looked really bad ( i am kind of used to them now) unfortunately i lost the little wand.. and i never understood who is "good" and who is "bad" does the wizard own the dragon? well they dont seem to be enemies but isnt the dragon supposed to be evil??

4 i own this set and i think its a great for a smaller fortress building. there is a good selection of mini figs, the burps do detract somewhat from the set, but they do make it feel as if its in a large cave. the cloth flags that are included are really nice and mine have lasted a long time.

4 i have just finished building this set. i was a bit disappointed with the amount of bricks when they were out on my table, but the final model is really nice and totally makes up for that. i like the small details like on the handles and fuel tank and the only real negative thing i can say is that the cog seems a bit oversized in the rear. i don't know if the designer frequents this forum, but i'm sure he will be happy about how much you like it - it took quite some time/prototypes to get to this design: (sorry about the size of the picture - it isn't mine)

3 sinner, on apr 23 2008, 10:37 am, said: i'll try to take a photo this weekend. well, i took the photo but didn't get around to posting it! here it is with a smaller gear. i think it looks better... ...the problem is that it's too tight and it doesn't rotate as freely anymore. adding another link makes it too loose! thus the set is probably the way it is as it's the gear that fit best.

3 great review! i never have been interested in this set. i am saving my money for a grey technic set or thatt technic ferrari set...

3 thanks for the review! i bought this set when it first came out and it is still in the box. it is stuck in my fairly lengthly backlog but after seeing your review, i'll have to put it to the top of the queue.

3 thanks for the review! i think i am going to get this set for it's many technic pieces. i could really use those for a rig i'm going to build.

3 looks like an interesting set. i didn't realize the motor controlled two functions through a transmission switch. that's always good to see. i'll probably pass it up though until the price falls a bit. the overall design is a bit too studless for my liking (i think the 8275 bulldozer has a much better balance of studded and studless pieces), and the wheels somehow look too small to me. i also have something of a backlog at the moment; i still need to pick up that bulldozer along with the 8421 mobile crane (on ebay).

4 svelte_corps, on apr 30 2008, 10:44 pm, said: and what everyone's been waiting for, the skullies - three of 'em and a conquistador skellie - very cute. note the backs of the crystal head have a plume-sized hole - or maybe that's just where they injected the blue brain-plastic. spooky! i love these skulls, i wasn't sold from the initial pics but they have a very creepy smile and the head shape is just... weird. with the large eyes, it's kind of homer simpson-esque. they reminded me more of the movie "coneheads", but i think your description is more accurate. looking forward to the rest of the review!

4 i was going to review this on monday but my camera ran out of batteries! anyways, great review! as i have the set built, it's a really fantastic set. the waterfall is a reall cool sticker, and the flick fire missiles are quite interesting. another point of interest: there are seven of the new flick fire missiles overall, if anyone cares.

3 that's awesome!!! i'm going to my local tru today to see if i can find the two smaller sets.

3 great review, thanks! as i thought, amazon did send out my pre-ordered sets not until yesterday evening, so i should receive them (hopefully) on monday or tuesday. can't wait for them! btw., i wonder what's up with all these sticker leftovers in the indy sets..this hasn't been the case in any other set with stickers, right? edited by metalandi, 03 may 2008 - 01:56 pm.

3 nice review! although you need to use the macro setting(a.k.a. the flower setting) for better pics. are you using a digital camera? you really need macro... the idea is, turn it on and hold down on the 'take picture' button halfway until the pic focuses. then press it down all the way to take the pic. i'm glad this one also comes with the new uzi; i wanted an extra...

3 a very nice review of a very lovely indy set indeed, thanks wilhelm screamer. but you need for sure a better lighting for taking your pictures....

4 very good for a first review! i bought this set and jungle duel at target the other day (i was going to wait and buy them when i go to downtown disney this summer, but how could i pass up saving four bucks that i can spend on store-exclusives? ) and i have to say i absolutely love them. the amphibious vehicle (don't they call it a duck in the movie?) is definitely my favorite lego vehicle i've ever built. everything about it is wonderful- the size, the colour scheme, and it's accurate to the one in the movie. and irina spalko's hair is to die for. on a side note, i don't get why they made marion's arms white in the set. the shirt underneath her vest in the movie is obviously blue. i switched the arms out for light blue ones and it looks a lot better, and it makes marion's eyes look great. -ryan

4 thanks for this review! you have reviewed my most favourite town set of all times, i am so happy to own this one. i actually is a story to go along with it: in the summer of 1998 i went on holiday with my parents to the country of luxembourg, in the city of wiltz we encountered a small toystore which still had this set for sale, (9 years after the release!). i did not had the sufficient amount of money to buy the set and had to leave it at the store, i was practically in tears... four years later we passed through luxembourg and i remembered the city and the store. we made a detour and stopped by the same store. every other old set was sold, the only one remaining was this one! i bought it immediately and treasured it ever since. i use the baseplates a lot in my cities, they serve well as roads with parking spaces next to them. this was the first set i owned which had the huge 6x24 plates in them, i remember my surprise when seeing plates of such enourmous lenght... i recently made an entire racetrack together with this set and to promote myself i will place a link here

3 wow simon you got two? yummy!

3 adik_sa_lego, on may 15 2008, 08:29 pm, said: wow simon you got two? yummy! i'd be happy if i had two... no, it's just one, but extended with the baseplate of 6381 (mentioned above) and some more plates and small fences. alex54, on may 15 2008, 10:20 pm, said: looking at the pics, i've got a question : is the "rescue rig" trailer one piece or is it brick build? it is one piece, not even the wheels come off... this trailer is always ready to go and was only used in a slecect number of sets.

1 i'll be passing on this set, thanks for the review anyway, is everyone supposed to be bald in the film? it looks weird

3 thank you for the nice review

4 thanks for the great review! it seems like the most awesome part of the set is the sticker sheet, which is a reversal of the usual situation!

4 i really like this set: my favorite parts are the minifigs and x's car. vrooom!

3 i enjoyed the review. some cool fleshie heads and parts, but it does seem a bit lamer even than i imagined from the box (the "airy" truck is rather slyly disguised on the box art). i would like to get it if it is ever on sale, 50% off would be nice :) speed racer lego doesn't seem to be selling too well in local shops here.

3 hi all newly arrived today, don't you just love shop at home. thought i'd give it a quick review. see more details over at my site. the tumbler: joker's ice cream suprise

3 nice review--i'm surprised these are out already. i'll probably end up passing on this one. even with the surprise. :)

4 good review. a must have for my batman collection. are these sets already out in germany?

4 good review.i think the sets amazing!

3 that is a very nice and quick review! thanks for giving us a quick summary. not much comments on this set, as i do not really go into batman theme yet. however, the ice cream truck in the set interest me. apart from that, nothing much yet. who knows, maybe i will change my mind in the future.

3 oh wait, is that torso dark grey or light grey?

4 general grievous reviewed by dunamis set 10186 1,085 pieces $89.95 from lego shop @ home build time 3.5 hours it is the start of summer here in california and along with the weekly deluge of new action films we start to see some of the next wave of star wars lego sets. the latest offering from our favorite building toy company is none other than the infamous general grievous! no doubt you all know the story of grievous; two parts technic and one part human and his hatred of the jedi. follow along as we get a close-up view of the mighty general. no doubt the observant will wonder why i purchased this set from shop @ home instead of my trusty lego store in glendale. well, it’s really as simple as two things: i’ve been traveling a lot and didn’t have time to drive to the store to get it and gas is now $4/gallon and i would likely spend more in gas than the $9 shipping cost to get it to me. so there you have it. the box: a gigantic box (much larger than expected) held the mighty general. we’re back to the perforated tabs on the side and two stickers on the front that let the box lift open: inside, we have 17 bags, two manuals and three stickers on a relatively small sticker sheet. the manuals: the manuals are not terribly thick in fact the second manual is noticeably thinner than the first. they come in at 75 and 31pages. interesting to note on the back we see the next (and more interesting) wave of sets later this summer. nothing new to report on the manuals as they provide the lego standard of high quality and features we expect. - piece callouts - models divided into sections - large images - page numbers since there were links posted to the .pdf files of the instructions online, i’m sure you can all get an idea of the manual and the parts inventory. however, for those of you without access to the internet here are photos of the parts inventory pages: random manual image: features page: the pieces: the short answer is you get lots and lots of little pieces in white, gray and black plus some big pieces in white, gray and black. mixed in the set is a fair amount of oddball pieces like minifig tools, jedi hood and trans yellow dome. fear not, despite the eclectic collection of parts, it all comes together in the end (not unlike a typical day at work for me…) it is probably worth noting again that there is a heavy amount of technic parts and pieces here. the build: the build starts off with a rather in-depth build of the stand in which general grievous stands on. once you think you are done, you keep adding on to this (rather solid) base. i bet there are 250 pieces just in the base alone! it is quite nice when you get done with it though and really adds to the display. i’m glad lego didn’t skimp on the base as it completes the model. once you get through all that, the rest of the build is a real thumb-bruiser. anyone who has built a decent size technic set knows the feeling of your thumbs being sore when you are done. you get the same effect here. it is actually a fun build and i really liked seeing how the designers used all the various pieces to recreate a fairly accurate model of grievous. the model is built from the ground up as seen in a few of the progress shots: here is what is left over: the design: the design is quite good and is very accurate. some might be disappointed that since this is a technic set we don’t have more articulation in the shoulders and have the ability to separate two arms into four as seen in the movie. however, it would seem the real intent is for display and not functionality. here is a shot of the torso and the detail involved: here are grievous’ organs: careful observers will note that my model is lacking two “arrow” stickers from the two white chest pieces. i failed to see these on the sticker sheet and only grabbed the large grievous sticker. so, note that there are actually three stickers and not one. chest protector and respirator: head and arms: i was a little disappointed that we got two yellow blades and no green blades on the lightsabers. note how all the lightsabers have different hilts which is a nice touch: here are some shots of the completed model with a few other sets shown for scale. he is actually pretty tall: you have the option to remove the top two arms and put in shoulder plates if you so desire: detail on the back: overall thoughts: i’ve been saying for a few years that we should have a technic grievous set and we finally got one. designed more as a model and not a fully functional swooshable figure, grievous is a tad flimsy. you won’t want him to veer too far off his massive and sturdy base. it would have been nice to have is cape with him (like the technic vader set). i do like the size of the model and it is impressive to look at. lego star wars system fans will likely want to think twice before purchasing but technic and ucs fans should be satisfied. final rating: 75% build 8/10 (very good – fun, relatively quick build. technic fans will be more pleased than others.) design 8/10 (very good – some nice snot and technic techniques. a bit flimsy but the base is kind of cool.) parts 7/10 (a mixed bag of stuff. probably can’t get too many diverse builds from this except for other robot type models.) price 7/10 (just ok – a bit stiff at $90 usd for a nice display model with limited functionality.) as always, let’s hear your thoughts and feedback.

1 thanks so much dunamis for your awesome review . yeah i think tlc miss the cape, it would be cool to own one but when we were talking of the 2008 sets around july of last year i can remember someone said it would come with cape. finally is a little dissapoint tlc miss it . edited by darkrebellion, 16 may 2008 - 07:20 pm.

4 excellent review, dunamis. this set looks great. the designers really though the kit out, it seems. the internal organs have got to be my favorite part, but everything is good. now all we need is a ucs obi-wan with a laser pistol to finish off grievous in a totally anti-climatic way!

4 deinonychus, on may 16 2008, 09:21 pm, said: hey dunamis, think you can get a straight-on shot of the face? the red pieces inside the eye sockets are topped with trans-greenish-yellow studs which make his face look eerily alive and very close to his screen appearance. it's a nice little detail that seems to not show through on pictures i've seen of the set. the legs are a little wobbly. i'm scared that he'll be leaning too far forward in about 5 years sure. i'll get a few photos tonight and post them. the eyes are a nice effect. you are right about the legs as the model does wobble a little. i forgot to mention that the base does turn which is another nice feature.

4 awesome review, dunamis! that's such a sweet set, i loved it as soon as i thoroughly examined the online instructions. it looks way awesome in the brick, my favourite part has to be the eyes. very cool, and creepy. thanks again for the info, and of course the pics! ~peace

4 this is a very nice, i never gotten to chance to own or buy one of the sw big sets. i'm definitely getting these one.

3 thanks for the great review! sad to say, as cool as he looks, he's a sale-only set for me.

4 thanks for that interesting review, brickbitz. the alien fighter looks pretty nice, nothing special but streamlined and fast nevertheless. that transforming feature´s a nice addition for sure, and these new flicker missile with its launch apparatus.... hmm, i hope i won´t spend quite some time in search of that little 'rocket' piece.... however, there´s still something i miss with these alien crafts.... i don´t know.... i like some more organic looking design, and they even come in some nice and different shapes, but still.... perhaps a real space fighter just needs a solid cockpit, cool windscreens and controls to satisfy my odd likings. that 'exo suit' looks really good and i wonder why it´s a little underrepresented on the box art. the jet pack/space scooter´s a really good idea, and the only thing i hate´re those darned studless technic beams.... it could look so much better with a studded version of these parts. but of course that´s only due to my personal preferences.

3 thanks for the review!! that makes me wanting this set even more!!

3 thanks for the review brickbitz i don't normally come into the space forum but this set it tempting me, on the basis of you review i think i might aquire one at some point.

3 my first impression upon seeing this set was "no thanks", but now i'm warming up to it. still, i'll skip it if it interferes with my hypersonic operations aircraft fund. :p

3 that's a great review for your first one. i think the jet pack if far to bulky it could do with some minimising but that’s life. i assume that you can’t fit a standard hand in the chainsaw arms are the hole would be to large but would you be so good as to confirm this for me? overall i quite like the jet ski and the ability to lower the arms to much doesn’t both me. how much was it just so i can get an idea of the price? finally thanks for posting this review so quickly.

4 thanks for the great review oky wan the two vehicles look quite nice for a small set and the minifigs look great! the two sided head is nice, although it would've been nice if it was a new head rather than the standard frowning face. the cyborg looks good, nice and cartoony, i like the printing on his back. the belt on the hips should be useful, not to mention the robotic hand. i assume that anything that fits into a 1x1x1 cylinder can fit in it? i hope so thanks again oky. any chance you can get any more sets?

3 thanks for the review. i'm looking forward to some of the new parts and ideas in this line. the figures look great. the actual sets themselves don't really appeal though.

3 this set looks wicked! thanks very much for the sweet review oky wan! the pics are perfect, great quality and the perfect size, well done! this sets got everything, a new hairpiece, tank treads, a gem, well, i could go on but you can all see everything from the great pics. thanks again oky! this is one set i'll definately be getting! ~peace

3 thanks, guys! i really tried to make it a good first review! now to answer your questions: the robot arm can fit ef robot claws and anything that a minifig can hold in his hand or that would fit into a 1x1x1 cylinder, so normal minifig hands are too small to fit. tlg is using the robot claw idea for the main villain of the agents line! do you still want me to try it out and take pics? the price was 10.99 usd at the tru i bought it at. i bet it'ss be a dollar less on s@h! and i'm sorry, but i probably won't get any more sets any time soon. i have to save my money for all the other good set that are to come. but if i would get another set, it would just be the one with the helicopter and the all-silver car! if anyone gets this set, can he/she please review it? thanks! any other questions i can answer for you guys? edited by oky wan kenobi, 18 may 2008 - 08:59 am.

3 omg omg omg. im coming to the us in just under two weeks, really hope i see them somewhere! does anyone know what ny times square toys r us is like for new sets?

3 is there any chance u could post pics of the comic and the box i love legos box art and instruction art?

4 i love the way the bad guy has a special attachment on the jewel case just to allow the agent to grab it with his hook. it's like the two of them sat down beforehand and drew up the plans for the vehicle together... cyborg: "ok, and then i'll make my getaway in the special snowmobile and you can follow me..." agent: "...and i'll scoop up the jewel and return it to foil your plan". cyborg: "perfect. see you tuesday?" dr. s.

1 good review! thanks oky wan. hmm, although i really like the villain (not just the new arm, i think the color is very... villanous, as all bond-villains with class have minions in uniforms. it's even possible to fill out their numbers with exo-force grunts of the same color) i'm not that hot for the agent himself, his uniform... nah. it doesn't even look like clothes, just give the man a suit or some nifty leather. i think i'll try to grab some sets from the agents line just for the new parts (to begin with... mocs may follow, who knows?) when they are available in stores here in sweden. haven't seen them yet, though indiana jones just got here so there might be some further waiting for me. now i want to see reviews of the other sets :)

3 yay, oky wan! wow, the agents line is looking good so far. the jetpack is pretty nice, and the minifigs... my dad was in portland just yesterday, and if i'd have called an hour sooner, he might have been able to get to the tru...

3 great review!thank youvery much! i think this line is much more promising than most orginally thought it would be. i'm onmy way to see ifican find the big rig right now!

3 thank you.

3 thanks for the review! do i see a little indy hint on that map? oh and btw., the map looks like it actually is printed am i right?

4 very useful pieces, that new agent head (i think it's new) could be used for a gordon freeman minifigure, and break jaw's head for otis the security guard when you take his donuts away from him.

4 thanks for the review. i the bike and the bad guy's helmet.

4 i've copied another thing because i don't know how i must do a review. and i can't do long reviews! set ref: 7884 name: the buggy: the escape of mr freeze number of minifigs: 2 number of pieces: 76 price: 13,95€ front of the box: back of the box: the comic: very close: what's in the box: without: the set: the set with the box: the time: wow, this is a funny set, but it's a little expensive, and a little to small, but i like some pieces like the fire, and the mr freeze gun. and the best of all, here it comes, no stickers! that's one of the greatest things. but i understand why lego has made this set, some people want batman lego, and they are most of the time expensive, and the mr freeze set is also expensive, but this set not. if you want more pics, you msut ask! for exaple for the minifigs, or the mr freeze and the blaster. ask it, and this is my first review and sorry for the great and blurry pics! the final verdict: 7.5/10 figures: 8/10 playability: 6/10 build: 7/10 pieces: 7.5/10

3 very nice review riddler!

3 thanks for an interesting review, ???theriddler???. the set´s cheap and very useful to get two fantastic mfs, a great mr. freeze and a very cool new batman. but i have to say that these two small vehicles just look plain ugly imho, without any inspiration nor orginality.... sorry, tlc, but you can for sure do better than that, and even with less pieces....

3 quote but i have to say that these two small vehicles just look plain ugly imho, without any inspiration nor orginality indead. the only reason to get this set is if you couldn't afford the batcave back in 2006 and want a mr. freeze fig for a cheap price. and anyone who did get that kit really have no reason whatsoever to get this. wait, did i forget something? oh yeah - thanks for the review, riddler. edited by grevious, 22 may 2008 - 11:54 pm.

3 wowie!!!!!! i'm glad you like it! maby i'l do the tumbler also! but soon the batcycle and the scuba also come!

3 pretty nice review for a first time ???theriddler???. next time though, if your camera has it, use the macro function (little flower icon) and perhaps a tripod. that should get rid of any blur and provide you with better pictures. apart from that, a good little review. keep up the good work!

1 thanks for the review. this set was poorly design, when i first heard of it i think it was like a car with a much better design than this one. i think i will get it for the minifigs.

3 the pics as promised. extra part:

4 looks cool, one of the best in this line. cant wait for review!

4 chrome..... can't wait for the review, deino!

3 yay! can't wait for your review. i plan to get this and the giant truck. the brick rat, on may 23 2008, 07:31 pm, said: 2)this set contains the best lego sound brick ever (it's just begging to be incorporated into my arkham asylum). what is a sound brick?

3 the brick rat, on may 23 2008, 10:31 pm, said: 1)my set came with defective instructions. in 2 places pages are missing and duplicates of other pages repeated. for instance, the car instructions are missing steps 16-21. fortunately, i was able to make out what pieces went where in the missing steps by studying the illustration in step 22. i hope you have better luck with your instructions. everything was just fine with my directions. sounds like you just ran into some bad luck there, my friend. quote 2)this set contains the best lego sound brick ever (it's just begging to be incorporated into my arkham asylum). i agree 100%. and i didn't even see it had a sound brick until i read this last night. usually lego promotes stuff like that pretty loudly on the packaging. not here though.

4 i love it ! fun, playable, cool looking, and killer minifigs! sweet!

4 thanks for the review deino! i love going back through the old "agents" thread just to see how wrong we were about these awesome sets! i actually really like the gate, those portcullis pieces people may know i always find nice uses for, and i really, really, really want that awesome sound brick. the figs are a bit disappointing in numbers, but agent chase is very cool, generic henchman are great, and spy clops is one of my favourite minifigs ever! the helicopter is wonderful too, i love that it is customised for spy clops to winch him down. the colours as usual for these sets are fantastic, the dark blue, orange and chrome silver! the car is the best though, i love all the functions. how does the ejector seat work though? batbrick away!

4 thanks for the awesome review, deinonychus! this really is a sweet set, a bit expensive a set for me, as i only get the cheaper non-castle sets, which is a shame because i love that head! it would be great for some more cyborg troops. the car is awesome, i didn't expect it to have that many silver parts, that's fantastic! heaps of play features too, that ejector seat mechanism sounds interesting. thanks again for the sweet review! ~peace

3 deinonychus, on may 23 2008, 09:12 pm, said: the rear has two cones sticking out. i'd like to think they're smoke nozzles or oil-slick sprayers. according to page 14 of my brickmaster magazine, the left cone is for smoke screen and the right cone is for oil slick.

4 wow great review thanks! this set looks absolutely great!!!! but i'm afraid of the price oh weel i'll just get the 2 smaller ones. i'm really liking this theme! well done tlg

4 hello all eurobricks members, i will present to you a very short review on the recent castle battlepacks. this time, i will be reviewing skeleton battlepack, and i hope everyone of you do enjoy viewing it. this was a request that put up by hollisbrick in the castle thread. initally, i thought it was a very simple set to do a review. however, for the love of castle, i decided to whip this up for every castle fan out there. this is an image of how the skeleton battlepacks look like. i have bought 12 last packs of these in total so far but none of the crown battlepacks yet. there were snapped much faster, that i imagined. do pardon me for the poor lightning. today is a bad weather, it's hard to get natural light. the skeleton gang for a single battlepack like this, with an attractive reasonable price. you obtained a series of 5 skeleton mini-figs with tons and tons of useful castle accessories. to me, it's a very very great buy, and it's a must to stock up for my army building! some add-ons! however, i was not very satisfied with my skeleton armies standards. therefore, i decided to make some slight modifications with some additional castle accessories that is stocked in my castle warehouse. after the makeover, ok, this is what i called a real skeleton army. this is mainly my opnion and it have to be aligned with my standards. i felt this improved battlepack gives a punch to the exisitng battlepack. the two soliders on the right, is able to align with the rest of my castle chess sets armies. while the one on the left, it gives me a great archer back up with the quiver and helmet attached to him. the ones, on the center especially the armored guard which equipped with the black nose cone helmet is my fave. it is able to illustrate the "elite" among the rest of the guards with its armor and helmet which was featured in my castle deep forest expansion moc.. promotion on! in addition, the one which was hastly done with a modify mace, it looks rather simple. in time to come, i will change it and gives a better equipment and look. these are the remains. i can use the axe for my dwarf in my dwarf mine defender. in that set, there is no weapon for my dwarf and i have to get it from other sets. the rest of the accessories, makes a very good stock up for future upgrading! overall: 9/10 this is not a playset. it is mainly bought for its abilty to mass recurit any armies, and is a main love for all castle army builders such as me! this set mainly have no major faults, and i love it so much. although, i have done some slight modifciations, but this set is a must for me to buy more and more! meanwhile, i will need to wait for the next shipment! hope everyone have enjoying viewing this simple review of mine! edited by whitefang, 25 may 2008 - 12:52 pm.

4 thanks for the review!!! it wasn't "really" a request but more of an imply to do it anyway great review! can't wait til these come to aus. probably when the rest of the castle comes out in september though

4 thanks for the review i wanted to see what was in this set looks good! is it sold in stores? edited by mammymarf, 25 may 2008 - 03:38 pm.

4 thanks, whitefang! castle battle packs.... simply wonderful! finally a dream came true, well done tlc!

3 sdpirate, on may 26 2008, 10:40 am, said: no offence- make this 7.99 can. too expensive to be coming with only a few figures. 20$ earns you the same amount of figs, plus a catapult, barricade, two horses and a jousting divider. are you refering to these following sets? both these sets adds up to $18.00 (cad) and the skeleton pack have the same price of $18.00 (cad) *prices quoted from s@h i understand that 7009 and 7090 offers more pieces, horses and same amount of mini-figs compared to a typical battlepack. imo, i feel that all 3 sets are all army building sets. 7009 offer small catapult, 3 mini-figs, a skeleton white horse. 7090 offer a joust divider, weapon rack (good accessories), 2 mini-figs, a horse with barding and a skeleton black horse. these sets have different purpose. for me, buying multiples of 7009 is to build its catapult, white skeleton calvaries. while 7090 is to build on crown calvaries and black skeleton calvaries. however, battlepacks have a different agenda. it offered some castle accessories that is not available commonly. for a castle army builder like myself, castle accessories are always in demand. the black robe, silver armor, silver short-axe are not very common castle accessories. it can be used as a good stock up too. i am not saying this battlepack is an one way solution to solve everything. that's why, different sets are released to target on different purposes.

1 mack, on may 26 2008, 01:30 pm, said: you cannot say that the battle pack contains the same amount of stuff that the other two sets have and therefore should be priced the same. it just seems that lego is ripping off canadian army builders, to me if the battle pack contained a small catapult, or wall so that it contained about the same amount of stuff that the other sets had it would be fair. it seems stupid that you will only get minifigs from one set, while you can get about the same amount of minifigs plus a bunch of other stuff from two other equally priced sets. that’s why to me these battle packs are a rip off, because of what they contain, imho the battle packs seem to be only worth about 10 dollars. mack, i can understand your concern when pricing is concerned. pricing is always a big issue for us to determine whether to buy or not to buy a certain set in a particular country. pricing varies differently across different countries such as us, europe, canada, australia and etc. this is something very hard for us to decide on. we can't be sure why tlc placed their pricing strategies this way. well, i think we should appericate what tlc is trying to do for us, by not using price as the only factor to judge whether to buy this set or not. at least, i am sure there are many of us trying to request for battlepacks to muster armies for their mocs, armies collection and etc. different people have different judgements towards different sets and different themes. i respect your opnion. imo, let's don't let price be the only determined factor to decide whether to purchase a particular set or not. instead, consider an array of factors that is offered. however, i do know that consumers like me and you are always affected by price. iamded, on may 26 2008, 01:40 pm, said: thanks for the review whitefang! your additions look great, i like your mace much better than the use of a small technic cog, your looks much sturdier. and that helmet looks really great on skellie soldiers, i never thought to use that before. very cool indeed! iamded, i am glad you enjoyed the review and my slight modifications. that mace was a much looking weapon. it looks much firm than the orignal look. the design was inspired from dwarf mine and dwarf mine defender. i would not want to have so many troll flags hanging around. the nose cone helmet, was to give the soliders a whole new look. to me, it retains the classic look, yet it belongs to present theme, suitable for my skeleton elite guards.

3 thanks for the nice review whitefang! i got the knights bp just for the scared face.

3 for those of you who buy so many of this and the other battle pack with crownies, what do you do with all of them? is this simply to create a large-scale army, or do you plan to build large castle scenes with all the figs. i'd love to see some pictures (on the "share your castle army" thread).

4 thanks for this great review, voltio! i never knew of this set 'till now, and it really looks great! i never paid much attention to those aztec/incan style sets, which i now regret. i love the bright colours used here, and all the great traps, there's so many of them, which is exactly what we can expect from an old incan temple like this one. i'm surprised there's no catapult. anyway, the minifigs included are also great, and am i right in guessing those bricks are printed? that would be fantastic, as they look amazing. that boat hull is new to me too, although i guess the fact that it's mainly in belville sets explains that pretty well. thanks again for the sweet review, do you have any other jungle adventurers sets you plan to review? ~peace

4 a real classic, thanks for that nice and funny review, voltio! a well designed set, very playable with a lot of nifty traps, a very good use of that raised baseplate and really nice crafts. the mf characters´re excellent too! and although the color scheme´s great and original, especially with all these neat printed pieces, it´s perhaps the only part of that set that looks a little out of date today.... nevertheless, the set´s plain charming and shows clearly that tlc don´t need licenses to do some distinct adventurer sets.

4 great review. i saw the instructions of this set, but never atracted me until now a great set an a excelente review.

4 thanks for reviewing this rare set! since it came out in 1999 i have only seen this set in a toystore one single time, one single copy as well... it was in the summer of 1999 in belgium (arlon) in a store called 'maxi toys' (belgiums tru, i think). they had the three biggest junglesets for sale there: these ancient ruins, the set with the beautiful black boat and the zeppelin. being into adventurers at that time i had never seen the entire jungle theme (not even in a leaflet or catalog) and surprised as i was i bought all three sets. that was one happy dutch boy in belgium! surprisingly the two smallest sets made it in very small quantities to my local stores in holland (except for the pontoon plane and small raft which was my very first shop at home order). the spider's secret i bought off bl, which makes me the proud owner of the entire jungle serie. back to the set: this was the first time in a long history of collecting lego that i had a deformed piece: an 2x8 red plate was twisted, i twisted it back and it still serves it's purpose... i loved the whole steam-idea in this jungle serie: the two boats both (including the one in this set) had nice steamengines and a very cool mechanic (yours has the wrong hat/hair btw) to come along with them. the skeleton falling down on the end of a chain was the most intriguing part of this set for me, it worked really well and when you were done scaring minifigures you could winch it up again ready for the next go. the only thing i did not really like about this set was the difference in wheelsize on the car, front small, back large and the way the palmtree consisted out of just three parts... all in all a great set that is becoming more rare and expensive as we speak/post. get it! edited by simonwillems, 26 may 2008 - 07:59 pm.

4 i absolutly love this set. this is in my opinion the best adventurers set. it has it all; the falling bridge, the falling skeleton, the spear trap, and the classic trapdoor. it is a must-have set. thanks for providing such a nice review.

4 this set is awesome .......... gr8

4 i just rebuilt this entire set today, and the nostalgia was totally worth taking bits and pieces from a few of my own mocs. only now did i realize how rare some of those pieces are, and i'm rather thankful that i have all of the printed pieces, and achu. the only pieces i am missing is a transparent orange headlight (3 out of 4), black minifigure hammer, light gray chain(replaced it with a dark gray chain), and one whole minifigure, which is the mechanic guy. i still have both the instructions and the box, and both are in appalling conditions. kudos to the pre-2000s lego sets like this one! love 'em

4 great review voltio, i never actually owned this set but my friend does, he gave me some of the peices, but he burnt the base (don't know why)

4 i got this as a birthday gift when i turned 7 years old or so. i can still remember the big box with the brown bridge in its display! so many hours of fun. one of the most amazing sets i own. a lot of play value. a true classic!

4 haha, i love seeing reviews where sigfigs and minifigures from the set present the set! i'm looking foward your next reviews! :d

4 thank you very much for the review, cardinal brick! that's indeed a very nice little set! klaus-dieter

4 this has gotta be the coolest chopper ever. i love it its so accurate plus your review is great because it shows all the inner details

3 great review, 5150. although, you might want to resize your pictures before posting them so they don't take forever to load. quote wow. i was skeptical of this coast guard line. i was actually the complete opposite. ever since i saw the first pictures, i fell in love with the whole line. the helicopter looks to be one of the two best in the line, right up with the 4wd and jetski. great job tlc, and i do hope you have something equally as great planned for next year.

4 nice review! the helicopter reminds a sikorsky chopper,isn't it?

1 all stickers i'm afraid. though i'mnot a fan of stickers myself. some sets (like ferrari for example) take longer to put on than building the actual set. this one is not as sticker heavy as it seams though, and the ones that areon there really give the set that extra touch. printed would have been preffered of course, but in this case i didn't mind it.

3 5150 lego, on may 29 2008, 07:12 am, said: thanks everyone for the nice coments! its nice to finaly have a camera that can take some decent photos! makes doing reviews much more enjoyable! there is no real way to lift up the stretcher. due to the crane arm being in the way there really isn't any room for any kind oflifting straps. the set does include a 1x2 plate with a hinge for the diver to stand on so at least he can hold on to someone, the crane lifts them up and then he can put them in the strechter. thats my guess at least. as far as the motor, i don't believe it uses bateries since you pull out the motor, and all the button does is recoil the winch line back in. i have to say it does a very good job of that, and is very smooth. (as long as you don't have anything to heavy) one detail i forgot to meation is the shark. its nothing new, just the basic shark lego has had around for nealy 2 decades, but it was a detail nothing less. thank you very much for that information, 5150 lego!

3 that's a very nice set. i'm having my doubts about getting it though still. the overall shape and size of the helicopter remind me of the real-life ch-53 military cargo helicopter. a very nice review. you've got the photography down very well i feel. perhaps a bit of nitpicking but at the end where you assign a rating, if you do a rating with faces (which is fine by me) you may want to seperate the faces by a line. otherwise it may become too crowded to the eye.

3 oky wan kenobi, on may 30 2008, 09:19 pm, said: but i have some questions about the grey new parts in the life raft. are they 1x1 like their counterparts with the clips or 1x2? and can they be held by a minifig by the handle? (...) btw, which jedi has an orange eta 2? i guess it should work with mfs.... hmm.... i think it´s count citrus....

1 i noticed that you said the torsos are the same as the last line; the last line had orange torsos, this one has yellow torsos. -chuck

4 thanks for the review! this set looks great and i really wish i had the money to buy the entire line. but unfortunately, i don't. i love the way tlc used the wing parts to the jedi interceptor for the life raft - very well thought of. anyhow, great review!

4 what an outstanding copter! i love it. the orange looks fantastic. this is probably lego's best copter to date. thanks for sharing the review. i would definately recommend that you downsize your pictures a bit though.

1 ???theriddler???, on may 29 2008, 02:54 pm, said: who want's the second riddle? bring it on, oh mysterious puzzler.... perhaps it could help a little if you would resize the pics for your next one, with all that automatic resizing going on it needs quite some time for the site to load.... in this context, to see two pics of your clock was perhaps a little odd too....

1 the stickers ruin the tumbler but the truck is very good if it was cheaper id get it

3 i am gonna have to pick this up, what a grand representation of the tumbler and it would be my first joker minifigure. my lego bat-life is looking up! )tnr(

4 nice review m8. shame that most of the pictures are blurry but nonetheless. just wanted to say that out of all my lego sets, this one, 7888 is the best. the tumbler is so cool once it is put together! those four huge wheels at the back make it quite unique! if you do not have this set i highly recomend it. edited by 4olic, 30 august 2009 - 02:59 pm.

4 i bought this off ebay, while not having been collecting space as a child, it was mainly wild west and city... i have decided, upon reading kdog's m:tron bar brawl mania strip in his space comic, to buy as many m:tron sets and figures i could find.. except i got distracted and bought some different sets as well... to start off with, here's a picture of the box: here's a general shot showing the entire set: a front view: the buggy: another shot of the buggy without the minifig: the flyer: the flyer without the minifig: m:tron crate with some equipment and hoses, i don't know the use of the hoses though : the cockpit open: the cockpit closed with the crew: the magnetic crane: another shot of the crane: rear view with hatch open: one of the side slots that can carry either the buggy or the flyer: top view of this excellent vehicle: excellent for getting spyrius or blacktron out of your way : final shot: excellent set, one of the biggest space ground vehicles and one of the best sets made by lego. undoubtably better than it's newer counterpart the mt-101 armored drilling unit.... a great addition to any collection and has a lot of cool neat features that make it have a lot of playability. simply excellent! five out of five!

4 sinner, on may 28 2008, 02:35 pm, said: care to explain why? the mcm has a pure weight of parts that i find hard to quantify but love... it is just so dense when you build it, full of nice surprises, no technique required, and a wonderful stearing mechanism that i rank as more important than the suspension of the mars version. this thing was meant to crush anyway, who needs suspension? i also like the way you never felt that the m-trons deserved a base after building this, it was that good... the colour scheme was perfect... it's space and i like it... enough said great review btw god bless, nathan naturally you're entitled to your inferior opinion...

3 norro, on may 29 2008, 01:30 am, said: it's space and i like it... enough said indeed! norro standing up for a space set!

4 thanks for those wonderful pictures and congrats! i think buying this on ebay was a good decision! i have no m:tron sets at all, but i like the mcm very much. it's just a wonderfully big set with many nice detials. lots of playing possibilities! i wish i had it too.

3 fun review, thanks! kinda sad to think that with tlc's recent ban on magnets in their products, we'll never see an m:tron revival ...

3 i love the design of the front canopy of this set, but i always felt that they could have done more with the rest of the model. this set is good candidate for customization though. there is quite a bit on unused space inside, especially in the middle section. i want to try putting a technic-style engine into mine at some point, along with the necessary gearing. i got my mcm brand new off ebay some years ago for a pretty good price, but the box was very worn out and the big trans-neon panel, which floats freely inside the box, was a bit damaged. as for the hose/jetpack things, i always assumed that they were either welding torches or flamethrowers. take your pick. quote kinda sad to think that with tlc's recent ban on magnets in their products first time i've heard of that. what are they going to do for the train couplings?

3 sinner, on may 28 2008, 11:35 pm, said: care to explain why? personally i think that aside from the colour scheme the new one is far better. why? suspension, more enclosed cockpits, bug-like appearence.... i suppose it's a matter of personal opinion though. i just thought that the mt-101 was very skeletal and couldn't really steer that well, although i do like it. also the mcm has a better design, in my view, as the wheels are closer together, making it look a lot more tankish than the mt-101. also space in the rear isn't wasted on having a shuttle. cp5670, on may 29 2008, 02:52 am, said: as for the hose/jetpack things, i always assumed that they were either welding torches or flamethrowers. take your pick. hmm.... well they don't have much else to defend themselves with, and i think in the uk the mcm was marketed as a mobile recovery center. fluyt, on may 29 2008, 03:56 am, said: anyways, m:tron is one of the greatest space factions, with mega core magnetiser as my favourite set of these guys (even though i do not own it ). the only thing that bothers me is the lack of (reachable) controls for the minifigs to drive their vehicles (but iirc it is the same with a lot of other space-sets as well) yeah they could have used the normal levers instead of the pronged two piece things at the front of the cockpit. but there is certainly a lot to mod. joebot, on may 29 2008, 04:25 am, said: but the old m:tron round magnet pieces are presumably discontinued. shoot... guess that bl and ebay are the only sources now... thanks for your input!

3 thanks for the review, maybe i can pick one off ebay.

4 this super set contains many of the city sets you can get for your mini city hospital. the smallest set is the 7902 car with a doctor. i thought it looked a bit too slow. here is a car you can build with the same bricks. the instruction manual for the ambulance does contain a picture of an alternate model, but it is actually quite hard to build something significantly different. this sets lacks some snot-bricks, so i had to be a little more creative and came up with this ambulance. it is more a hearse than an ambulance. the helicopter has a lot of slopes, so i built a speed boat for those special emergencies. unlike the first two sets, i used far from all the bricks in this. this set does really have some great parts. the brickshelf gallery with some more pictures. is anyone up to the challenge and build some alternate models of the last set in the super pack - the hospital?

4 these are great! i especially love the speed boat and your ambulance reminds me of ecto -1! (i would take you up on your challenge but i don't own the hospital. it seemed overpriced to me...)

3 darn you! making us wait like this. meanie.

3 why must you taunt us?! just kidding, can't wait for the review and to see a detailed view of ms. harley quinn! ryan

3 what a showman!, guess you have to get in before someone else does the review! looking forward to the review....

3 looking forward to the review, this looks to be the best of the new batsets. funnily enough, it took me a while to realise ms quinn whacking deino was not on the boxart batbrick away!

3 i look forward to seeing the review. novelty sized hammer on!

3 monday my review, i hope you like that one also! but i can't wait for your review. who want's the second riddle?

4 harley, the fig, is amazing. love that hat. batcycle, meh...ok. truck: flick fire missiles!!?!?? lego have you no sanity! sure they're great but you're putting them on every single action set!! hammer thingy; win. nice truck! great review!

4 a very nice review, thanks deinonychus. that batcycle looks pretty neat.... like a hells bats angels version of that tumbler, a really nifty idea. the truck looks simply sweet, a smooth design and, this time, tlc´s new habit of vehicle oversizing just works very fine. a wonderful and very comical vehicle indeed! and harley.... oh my, this bill i´ll have to pay for myself.... clonecommando007, on may 30 2008, 02:22 pm, said: truck: flick fire missiles!!?!?? lego have you no sanity! sure they're great but you're putting them on every single action set!! yeah.... this starts to become a little annoying. these things simply don´t work in a that much satisfying way.... when i was a child all i needed to play with my mfs were some old fashioned classic space blasters.... zoom zoom, zzzaaap.... honestly, do they really think that this tiny rockets deliver that much fun?? just imagine on!

3 the '08 batman sets look like a step up from the somewhat lackluster '07 sets. this looks like a very fun set with a whimsical sense of style very fitting with harley quinn's character. the price isn't great, but i guess you gotta pay for that batman logo. on the downside ... i am so over the good buy vehicle vs. bad guy vehicle concept. i really wish tlc would get over this. you see it throughout the product line -- batman, castle, mission to mars, etc.

4 this set looks really fun! the figs are sweet, can't wait to see that jester in the flesh. of course, the jester i'm talking about is the castle one but that doesn't mean harley isn't a sweet fig! thanks for that awesome review, deinonychus! ~peace

4 thanks for the review deinonychus! this is an awesome set, it may just be my first batman set

4 hi all, so i was at "the wal-mart" yesterday and had the munchies and was looking for something to eat. somewhere along the line, i stopped caring about food and decided to browse the toy department to see what they had lego-wise. usually, they have jack squat, but on this particular day they had a lot of new sets. i impulsively picked this set up, along with harley quinn's hammer truck and the new little campsite from the indy 4 line. i must say, when i first saw images of this set i wasn't exactly thrilled or anything. i mean, i didn't really see anything particularly special about it, but after purchasing it, i must admit that i would consider it a must buy for any lego fan. but enough babbling about myself. onward with the review (my first of an official set)! in this picture, you can see everything you get with the set. i thought the box-art was pretty nice looking. the manual, on the other hand, took somewhat of a beating within the box, a common problem with most more recent sets. i do have to say that i wish they would at least make some effort in fixing this. they could just make a little thin cardboard "folder" to minimize bending and tears. for batman minifig collector's, the highlight of this set are the robin and penguin figs. previously, you could only get them in the pricey bat-cave set, but this set provides a much cheaper alternative. one thing you will notice, however, is that robin's hairpiece is a new mold, as it is actually a black version of mutt's hair (from the indy 4 line). personally, i think it actually looks better than the hairpiece used on the older version of robin. as the batcave had before it, this set comes with some bricks to make two cute (but deadly) penguins. they help add more charm to an already charming set. when you're finished building, you'll end up with a nice little assortment of extra parts; 1 black "cheese slope," 3 1x1 tile (black, yellow and white), a revolver, a technic pin, and a 1x1 red round plate. here's robin's scuba jet. it's nice and sleek looking. notable parts of interest would probably be the green turbine engines. my only complaint on this one would have to be the use of decals on the 2x2 round yellow tiles. for that type of a part, printing seems as though it would have been the best way to go. now for, in my opinion, the best part of the set...the penguin's sub. this set has more decals than robin's scuba jet, but they seem more necessary in this case. i actually wanted to put the decal's on the sub, as i think the it looks great with them. obviously, it looks like a penguin, but wow, does it ever do it with style! it has a lot of interactive features, the first of which i will mention, being the periscope which raises up and down. and for the collectors of parts in new colors, it has a few parts in medium orange?, such as 2x2 tile. here's a shot of the bottom of the sub. another nifty little feature is how you can lift the top off and fit the penguin inside. and there is enough room inside, so that you can firmly place top on again, and without interference to the movement of the periscope. another little feature is the rear spring-loaded missile. you just tilt the small lever toward the front of the sub, and it fires. and the last small feature are the flick-missiles on each side. overall, this is a great set with a lot to offer for a decent price. a lot of fans might view the only drawback to it as being the use of decals, but if you plan on keeping the kit together they make it look really fantastic. buy it if you can. matt edited by imperialshadows, 01 june 2008 - 11:42 am.

4 awesome! i am totally getting this set. good review!

1 clonecommando007, on may 29 2008, 06:53 pm, said: great review! though you really seem to like this set, and it probably is a great one, i'm not a fan of the penguin sub, or at least i'm not from what i see. it's not for everybody. personally, i just bought the set for the figures, and i was originally just going to sort the parts and put them away in storage asuka, on may 29 2008, 07:13 pm, said: thank you very much for that neat review, brickadier general .... i´m glad that you changed your mind, a review of a burger wouldn´t be half that interesting for sure. it´s just a mediocre set to me, but of course it´s always cool to get important mfs in less pricy sets. i like the penguin´s sub from the batcave more, just because they did a fine job on resembling a penguin without using a sticker.... robins craft looks fairly nice, but the most useful parts of the whole set, for me personally, would be those indeed very neat green engines. yes, it probably would have been nicer if they would have at least done a brick built beak for the front of the sub. unfortunately, i never got my hands on the batcave set, so i never was able to build the original sub.

4 thanks for the review! i love this set, i didn't think it was much at first either, but i really love it. another cheaper robin and penguin is great, and those nifty mini penguins are awesome. the spare pieces are even nice! i love robin's little scuba jet, those green engines are very nice and i love it compactness. penguin's sub is even better, at first i was annoyed at getting two subs but now i realise it means i can have a fleet of them i'll be sure to mod over those cannons though, but the details are very slick. thanks again. batbrick away!

4 thanks for the great review, brickadier general! the sub looks very nice, and i like the idea of a raising periscope (did the batcave sub have that feature?) and the details on the sub look very nice. the inclusion of the penguin, robin and two of those great brick-built penguins really confirms that i'll be getting this, considering that i didn't purchase the batcave. however, i am rather dissapointed that this set is so similar to the vehicles of penguin and robinin repectively in the batcave set. i feel that it only really caters to those who havn't bought the set, and i would've much appreciated different vehicles. overall, a very nice set, perhaps the best of the 2008 wave, despite it's lack of originality. thank you very much for the review bg

4 set: 8635 - agents - mobile command center pieces: 1154 price: $us89.99 those dedicated agents. they've fought chainsaw-armed villains, battled radio-controlled cyborg crocs, chased pallets of badly-stored golden loot and wrestled killer sharks with vicious, toothy grins. finally they've caught the notorious dr inferno and imprisoned him in their cavernous mobile command center. but dr inferno won't go down without a fight! can the agents stop the evil dr 'disco' inferno fleeing? will spy clops laser gun burn through the door in time, or will dr inferno simply use the lovely agent trace's enormous ponytail as an escape ladder to freedom? more importantly, will there be a riot in the streets of lego city as afols go apopletic at the thought of a 12 wide truck roaring through their ordered town layouts? stay tuned! part 1: the box, instructions, parts as the largest of the agents sets (so far), the box is easily the biggest. trainee agents, examine the following three pics and see if you notice anything odd. box front: box back: box middle: spot it? that's right. the printed cardboard which has supposed to be the bottom half of the fold out middle section is on the back, slicing the ultra-large set image which would form the foldout in half . the way the cardboard is printed as one piece before it's folded i think this would be very hard to do 'accidentally' so suspect a major stuff-up somewhere along the production line. i bought this set off bricklink so would be very interested if anyone in the states who has seen these boxes actually on the shelves can tell me if this is common or rare. basically i want to know if i should be annoyed that the bricklink seller didn't list this in the set description, or are they all like this? the instructions come in 4 booklets. the parts list comes in at 5 pages, which is a lot even at half-size pages ! large images of the parts inventory are in this folderwhen moderated for anyone interested. here's also some cute agents-type artwork at the end of one of the books. instructions show piece call-outs and are divided into sections according to numbered bags. as you'd expect for a set with 1100+ parts, this baby comes with a lot of bags. it's a treasure trove of dark blue. as well as the obvious large slopes and wall panels which make up the body and the roof, there is a wealth of smaller navy blue pieces as well - small 1x1 bricks, 2x2 bricks, 1x1 plates, 2x2 tiles, heaps of 2x plates, some slopes, 22x cheese pieces... basically anyone wanting a lot of dark blue should think about this set. the roof panels alone, for example, could provide a dark blue sea for a modernised pirate moc. 2 dsss (dreaded sticker sheets). quelle surprise - stickers! the grey parts of the stickers here are metallic silver ink, which is a nice touch. actually, as sticker sheets go, they're not too bad. fairly subtle for the most part and the navy blue actually matches the bricks themselves. however, after looking at the sticker sheets i thought i was missing something. what about the pieces used for the projection screens showing dr inferno and the sharks - why weren't they on the sticker sheets? there must be another one! frantically i checked and rechecked the box and flipped through all the instruction manuals to find the elusive 3rd sheet. where was it? ten minutes later i noticed something which had honestly never occured to me - there were actual printed pieces in this set! so obvious and yet so unthinkable. it's horrifying how years and years of exoforce and speed racer set releases can mentally condition people's thought processes. tut tut, lego. what have you reduced us to? here they are, folks - actual printed pieces. (yes, i do believe this news deserves the caps.) i also noticed this nifty modification of the usual 2x3 cupboard - you can now fit drawers in it! very clever. this may have been around in belville sets for years for all i know, but it's new to me. the drawers slide in and out very well and the top one sits on slight indentations in the middle of the cupboard. part 2: the figs! our trusty agents - charge, chase, trace and fuse. (high powered agents don't have time for names of more than one syllable - that's why the bad guys always lose ). chase and fuse have the mutt hair in black and dark orange. the lovely agent trace has an exquisite new hairpiece in dark brown, perfect for 'rapunzel' themed mocs. as you can see, her ponytail is loooong. makes it hard to sit down, the poor girl. i feel sorry for all these female figs with such intricate hairstyles that they can never relax in an ordinary lego chair. however, at least she has two breasts unlike the recent harley quinn fig. compensation indeed. seriously though, it's great that there's a separate torso print for the female character and this attention to detail is typical of the set as a whole. three of the agents have reversable heads - nice touch with the headsets and i like the id cards on their pants. obviously the agents security system is based on some kind of crotch measuring device. this would make sense considering the conspicuous bulges in the pants of dr inferno's men (see the other agents set reviews.) the villains - spy clops, dr inferno, gold tooth. dr inferno's hair in all it's glory. this is a great piece, although the orange colouring is a little rough on the front. it's so 3d, it deserves a back and side view (and indeed eb thread) all of its own. as mentioned elsewhere, this is different plastic to the normal minifig hair, but it doesn't quite feel as soft as the exo-force hair. it doesn't fall off as much, anyway. the figs get 10/10 from me. awesome hairpieces in great colours for the agents and a sleek navy blue/ neon green uniform. the villains' faces are great and they are all very distinctive. the attention to detail is outstanding and it's great to see a lego in-house theme with characters as memorable and cool as figs from the licensed themes . part 3: the build the build is divided into three stages - the small vehicles, the front of the truck, and the massive command center section. (a) small vehicles first up, all the small vehicles. we have a small flyer, 2 buggies, jet ski, and a speed boat - all in glorious navy blue with little bits of silver detailing. top view. these vehicles are all simple, small and well-designed. probably the weakest is the flyer, only because the cockpit looks a little large. in fact, the small flyer is probably the weakest element of 8365 overall, which tells you how good the set itself is! in various threads here, this set has been heavily criticised for being way out of proportion. there's a reason for that, as we shall come to. however, the existence of these small sets should appease some people. with the new coast guard sets, for example, all of these save the flyer wouldn't look out of place on a city beach with a little modding. here's an example - agents beach party! (spongebob couldn't help but crash.) the villains only have one small vehicle, but they've been well-served in the smaller sets, and this one is a unique and clever design. i love the triangular shape and the simple but clever technique of making the arch slopes meet up around the propellers. it's sort of insectile in black and orange, and looks very different from the usual assortment of helicopters etc. (b) truck front this thing is a beast! seriously, look at it. it's chunky and mean looking. you don't want to mess with this baby. the build is really nice. like a lot of star wars vehicles, it's all based on technic beams pinned together. unlike a lot of mars mission sets, underneath isn't all technic beams with some plates slapped on like a facade. the majority is a lot of plates and bricks which all fit together solidly. you can see from the detailing of 'cheese grater' slopes and silver pieces on the front how effort has been made to give this vehicle a distinct feel different to other lego sets. sure, the silver slope mirrors might be a bit too much for some, but this baby is all about attitude. you can imagine it roaring down the road en route to dr inferno's diabolical lair! after all, these sets are 'agents' sets - nobody said they were *secret* agents (c ) command center - whole assembly here's a view of the whole thing assembled - inside and cool details to follow at the end. it's kind of hard to show here as it is extreeeeemely long. this is indeed a big set. the build for the trailer part of the command center is fun and very satisfying. yes, there are large pieces but there is also a huge amount of detail. it is also solid as a rock. i remember being annoyed building the big ferrari truck a few years ago - everytime you looked at it, an 8 x 16 plate fell off. the mobile command center is solid - even with the hinged roof and special features, it is not delicate at all. kudos to the designers, again as it is mainly a brick build rather than a technic one. i also like how the command center part connects to the cabin - it's not a special piece at all, just a technic axle going through two circle plates, but it works and it's solid. (please note i've been selective about which stickers i've applied during the build.) top view: the rear: here's an example of why i like the build: (a) the designers have enough sense to put a ladder so a minifig can climb up to the interior when the command center is open (b) notice that although the ladder clips at the top, there is an *extra* clip there in the middle purely to hold it in place so it doesn't flap around and holds firm. i don't know if most designers would even think to put a ladder there let alone go the extra mile and put a mechanism to hold it in place. pure class. oh, and notice the greebly detail stuff to the right there too. the other side. this is probably the other weak part of the build - the bricky gaps at the top where the hinge to open the roof sits. it's a little gappy but the set is so big you don't really notice. (d) and now for the fun stuff - inside and neat details! ok, so we've built the thing. it's big. it's blue. the top of the trailer itself would make a good warehouse moc for a harbour layout. but what about inside? is it any good? what about all those small vehicles from the start of the review? where do they go? well, i'm glad you asked. because the solution is superb. the small flyer folds slightly and slides into place here: lift off the roof and you're away! the large buggy and the speedboat go under here: the jetski slides out of the rear here, attached to its own little platform: and the small buggy goes inside the main cabin. there's even a crane so you can lift it down. so now we know why this set is so large! to fit everything in! it's amazing that this functionality doesn't affect the aesthetics of the set as a whole. but we still haven't finished on the details. the front section has a very easy-to-swing-open roof section and missiles: there's also a command section underneath the bit where the flyer lifts out: and now for the interior. i have to say i really like this space. not only is it packed with great stuff, there's also enough room for minifigs to move around. i hate bases where the figs only have about 2 studs to actually stand and walk. aquabase invasion is a nice set, for example, but the actual functional space inside the base is teensy. claustrophobia! you know within a week they'd be fighting to toss each other out of the airlock. no such problems for these suave agents, who have plenty of legroom *and* the ability to launch missiles from their ceiling. the whole of the interior: zooming in: moving from left to right. first off, the medicine cabinet. looks like someone's been leaving secret mission dossiers lying around. the projector area for mission briefings. dr inferno recently changed his hair colour from purple to orange, it seems. why are all these minifigs so obsessed with their hair? the projector folds down when the trailer is open. push the button and the light glows on. now dr inferno's hair is orange again! this is one of my favourite parts of the set. it works a charm. the batteries for these lightbricks can also be replaced - instructions are in the manual. agent charge considers shark-fin soup for dinner. did i mention these projection panels are printed? the detail is very fine too. the tool section. laptops sit in the middle compartment. you get some flippers, yellow scuba tank and various implements. i'm so impressed that the helmet is pearl silver with a different coloured visor too - there's so much variation in the parts in this set, you don't get the sense the designers are using the same thing over and over to save money. it all feels luxe and top-of-the-line, just like the command center itself. two laptops - yay! the aforementioned rooftop missiles: the dr inferno cage. nasty electric shocks! bzzt! (you can see my reviewing skills are burning out now - sentences.... truncated...) another example of detail - nowhere else in the set is a 1x1 transgreen tile used - they could have used a 1x1 trans green cheese wedge piece as there are others in the set, but they didn't. how does dr i get out? flick that lever on the right hand exterior and the door pops open. spy clops the loyal minion awaits his master on the other side. and there we have it. take a bow, guys! there's a lot of spare parts. a suspicious amount of dark blue small slopes but i checked the instructions and didn't see anything missing. i have to say, i do like the new policy (since speed racer i think) of including these small slopes as extras. part 4: overall rating if you've made it this far, you've got more stamina than dr inferno's army of cyborg animals themselves! as i said earlier, this set has drawn criticism for the size of the truck. however, large vehicles do exist - i grew up in a wheat farming area and as a kid the size of the lorries that thundered past carrying grain was probably intimidating to me as this monstrous espionage machine is to the good citizens of lego city! on top of that, it *does* contain a plethora of 4-wide vehicles inside ! criticism of this set on the basis of size to me also seems misguided as this is basically a playset - and it is a very good one to boot. as you can probably tell, i love it to pieces and wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone, whether for parts or for play value. check out the parts list in this folderwhen moderated and you can see just how many excellent pieces it contains. a light-up brick, a flood of navy blue, metallic silver bricks - we're spoiled. 8635 is also an enjoyable build, with fantastic figs and top-of-the-line detailing. in a year when i've found city a bit disappointing after the run of great sets in 2006-2007, the agents line has been one of the surprise hits for me and i can't wait to see what the designers come up with next. edited by svelte_corps, 02 june 2008 - 12:46 am.

4 i see you've also learnt to call dibs. looking forward to seeing your review!! edit: oh, i see! i just arrived early. a truely fantastic review, you make me not want to pass this set up, even though i can't possibly afford it without leaving my beloved castle collecting. it really looks like a fun set, so many neat vehicles, and two laptops, i can't wait to see what other sets we'll see them in. thanks again, great job! ~peace edited by iamded, 31 may 2008 - 09:56 am.

4 man i was hoping to be the first to review, ordered from tru 2 days ago. oh well this set looks sweet, can't wait for your review.

4 omg! thank you, thank you, thank you! you made my day! so that means dr. inferno's hair isnt rubber! but one question, is it like that weird funny soft plastic like the ants from indy 4? please answer

4 thanks for another wonderful review, svelte_corps a very fine set indeed, i absolutely love the way all of the vehicles fit into the command centre, very clever. the projector is really cool, it looks very nice. it's great to see these light and sound bricks in the agents sets. all of the little nooks and crannies in the centre are great too, i really love the amount of detail featured, mixed with all of the playability of this set. the minifigs - as usual - are brilliant, the uniforms look fantastic. dr inferno looks especially great, i love his white suit with hints of orange, and who can forget his hair? i'm really tempted to buy this beast now, though i'm not sure my wallet will forgive me for it. i suppose i'll have to cut back on indy and castle multiples for now... thanks for the truly great review, svelte_corps, nice work

4 great review, thanks! that's one hell of a set. i think lego has reached a certain kind of peak with the design, cleverness, and fun of this one. i'm so relieved that agents seems to be shaping up to be even better then i thought it was going to be...and i thought it was going to be cool to begin with. agent "charge"? not only does he look like dash justice, but he has the name of one of dash's alpha team squadmates? i call shenanigans!

4 splendid review! i love everything on this set. no question 'bout it. somehow i knew i should have saved up and buy that when come to tru...but the sight of turbocar chase and jetpack pursuit was to tempting to pass up.

4 i first i thought the whole agents line would not be very good. but boy have i changed my mind! this set looks amazing, as do all of the other sets in the line. i really like how the small vehicles all fit into the truck. i don't like it when sets come with smaller vehicles and don't have anywhere to store them, so they just float on the side. that light projector is fantastic! i can't believe they are actually printed! this is definitly on my to-buy list! thanks for the amazing review!

4 7645 - mt-61 crystal reaper piece count: 600 price: $aud79.95, 49.95 euros (in most countries), 39.99 gbp, usd 49.99 it's happened in the wider world, and it had to happen to lego - yes, the 80s are back. space invaders, holograms, compulsory seat-belt wearing legislation, and the return of classic space. ok, we don't have a fully fledged classic space theme back yet, but if 7645 is the way of the future, i think lego is ready to do it properly. i wasn't a huge fan of last year's mars mission sets and only picked up a few on clearance, but this set is light years (excuse the pun) ahead of 2007's offerings. this mining vehicle is solid, compact, and well-designed. it looks impressive, and even better, it has fantastic power functions operability! behold 7645 - mt-61 crystal reaper! (ps i wasn't joking about the holograms or seat belts.) part 1: box, instructions, dsss (dreaded sticker sheets), parts front of box: back of box: 2 x instruction booklets: dss numero uno - for the reaper dss number two - apologies for the blurry pic but i wanted to capture the sweet shimmy of the metallic holographic background on this sheet the way it catches the light really makes a difference to the small alien craft and makes it look much more interesting from the plain stickers of last year. there's heaps of spare silvery stuff once the stickers are applied for those who use the leftover sticker material for customising. parts bags - 4 numbered with one extra with larger pieces parts everywhere - woo! i know the lego instruction books scold me if i mix bags, but i'm a devil-may-care kind of guy. in your face, tlc. i love mixing all the parts together before i build, it reminds me of my youth when the days were long, anything was possible, and i didn't need strict instructions not to build on grass or poke my eye out with a technic shooter. interesting parts - these may or may not be new, my technic knowledge is not that detailed. the little scoop parts are so cute and have a heap of potential uses. i love 'em. they're like smurf hats at miniland scale. these technic wheel things in orange are also cute. they kind of remind me of marigolds. giant fabuland marigolds! the track pieces - you get 70 of these - here's the section of track for one side - as you can see it's about 52 studs long. these hold together better than the small ones on the hailfire droid/ jungle cutter. part 2: minifigs, small mining transport, alien ship i have to confess - i forgot to take an individual snap of the astronauts . it's the usual bunch though - scaredy face guy, sunglasses in space man and a third one i can't remember. you don't really care, though? you're only interested in the alien commander and his matching arms/ legs combo deal. as brickbitz noted in his review of the smaller set, the glowy eye is just a 1x1 cylinder. the set also comes with 2 normal jellies - one pictured here for size. you'll see what happened to the other one soon enough... the alien craft is nothing exciting, apart from the gorgeous glinting stickers. here's the road safety angle. the commander actually clips onto a 1x2 plate with handle so he can't fall out! then the lime tentacle thing descends on top of him to keep him firmly there, like a baby seat. not very brave for an alien commander, is he? i mean, did darth vader ever use a seatbelt? tssk. with cradle up: this part of the build also includes the small astronaut mining buggy - small and effective. (please note in this build i've applied stickers to everything bar cockpit pieces.) this comes with radio and saw piece. part 3: the reaper! the first part of the build is the detachable shuttle. i really like the retro aesthetic of this with the angled wings and the side hoverpod things. it is much better than the comparable vehicle from 7699. the new flickfire piece is a waste of space - it's fairly limp. i prefer the simple flickfire technic pin to be honest. there's also a very nice little side workshop as you can see. i really like how the control unit is 'plugged' into the wall via 5 1x1 round plates (third pic, it's a bit dark). great detail. [the technic pins on the back are there to connect the power functions battery box. it's odd they're included at this stage of the instructions - maybe the intention was to release it originally with all the necessary motors etc but the price point was too high and they scaled it back] the base. the shuttle sits on that bley technic axle in the middle when the reaper is fully assembled. the little vehicle scoots down the ramp at the rear, which folds up to hold it in place when the reaper is in motion. you can see there's a crystal container here as well - another nice small detail which i found the 2007 sets lacked. there's also an alien here - thankfully not in those horrendous trans-orange tubes so prevalent last year. the complete assembly. isn't it snug? it's just the right size too - not massive but large enough to be a serious mining vehicle. the ominous black treads contrast nicely with the white/ orange colour scheme of the vehicle itself. the trans detailing - blue for weapons, neon green for energy - is carried nicely through the whole set. the blades and the scoops whirl nicely as the machine trundles along. top down view: tread detail: whirling blades of death! the buggy descends: probably the most disturbing aspect of the whole set is this pic: the jelly has an orange pump plugged into its heart which is connected to an energy supply on the left hand side! this vehicle runs on alien jelly juice! either that or it's milking the jelly in some equally disturbing fashion. how amoral is that! i know there's been debate about this - the jellys aren't innocent, they're evil energy crystal thieving maniacs etc - but i find it a bit odd that the humans respond by chaining the jelly up to the bowels of their mining vehcile and suck energy from its heart. people debate about violence in lego as represented by realistic minifig weapons, but i think the moral lesson here is even worse - it's ok to exploit foreign life forms for our own gain if they treat us badly first! (who-fans, i think the ood should have a word with the jelly commander ) that aside, this set is well-designed and fairly good value at $aud79.95. it's definitely a notch above last year's mars mission sets overall, with improved detailing and more useful functions. the holo-stickers are fab and it's nice to have an alien commander, even if he is a bit bulky and his fingers are identical to his toes. however, if all these reasons by themselves weren't reason to recomend this set, the following is.... part 4: power functions the best part of this set - and the reason i bought it, really - is the integration of power functions. bizarrely this isn't mentioned at all on the box and i only found out about it from the instructions when they were posted on eurobricks! (instructions for book 2 which has the power function stuff available here.) this is a great idea and hopefully we will see more new sets take this kind of approach (especially with the new train sets). luckily i got monster dino 4958 on sale for half price earlier this year so already had most of the necessary motors etc - the only one needed was an extra small one. what you need is listed in the instructions below with redirections to shop @ home to buy the motors. note there's actually a mistake on this page. the 2 small motors you need are both 8883 not 8882 (which is the large xl motor). way to confuse the kids there, lego! attaching them was a dream and only took a few minutes (in contrast to 4958 where it was almost impossible to remove motor elements without dismantling the model). basically the back platform and some plates and orange slopes come off, you attach the motors, and then the smaller plates go back on. these parts are now left loose: overall the look of the reaper isn't badly effected as you're mainly viewing from the front anyway: sadly i can't show you how it moves, you'll just have to trust me that it does ! the way it is steered is demonsrated in the instruction pages above. basically each motor is controlled by a corresponding switch on the remote. move them both forward to move forward, move one right to turn right, move both back to move back etc. it zips along! it's a speedy little thing! personally i wouldn't want to be in it's path as it comes roaring down the martian canyon! (my cat was scared as it was.) it is oodles of fun and definitely worth trying if you have the motors or can get them cheaply, and adds a whole new dimension to the 'play' aspect of 'playset'. it is also as i said very quick to switch between modded and non-modded reaper in contrast to the more fiddly dino creations. the only problem i had is that if it moves too fast, the weight of the battery box at the back tends to pull the whole thing back and it rears up. it does correct itself though. i only trialled this on carpet last night so it may behave differently on other surfaces - i will need to experiment! part 5: summation this is a great set made even better with the addition of power functions. at $aud79.95 it's well-priced. buy it! buy the motors as well (k-mart still has stock of 4958 at $89, wait for a 15% off sale)! you won't regret it. buy 2 and make competing battle machines! the only thing is... just don't torture that poor jelly edited by sinner, 24 june 2008 - 03:25 am.

4 great review. i just got 7644 mx-81 hypersonic operations aircraft. it's a great ship. i started to review it, but then it started to rain (i was outside), so the review is coming tommorow. technicolor stickers! very pretty!

1 this set looks 10 times sweeter with the power functions, too bad i'll have to buy some extra.

3 so, is there some way to get all those motor bits at once, or do you have to buy them on their own? i don't think i've ever seen them in a store here...

4 svelte_corps, on jun 3 2008, 12:09 pm, said: the only thing is... just don't torture that poor jelly i smell another "dont hurt the dragons/jellies" or something group nice reveiw i dont realy like the mm sets [we want more starjustice/space skulls!!!!!!] but this one looks ok i guess suprised they dont say that it has power functions on the box

3 algernon, on jun 5 2008, 02:03 pm, said: why is it that agents and star wars get their own news articles but this fantastic set is totally ignored? i think maybe there's a bit of star wars excitement on the front page which has probably got a few members frothing with excitement. not every review needs to be frontpaged anyway .

4 i appreciate your review mr. mandalorian, but why the negativity?. i'd try to find more positives about the set instead of kinda criticizing it after each picture. i personally think it looks freakin' awesome!. the size is very impresive and i nearly fell of my chair when i saw the first pics earlier this year. it's quite unlike anything i've ever seen from lego. edited by radiant7, 04 june 2008 - 08:27 am.

1 thanks for the great and very detailed review. i love the new holostickers! i'm still not sold on this set though. i'm not sure why... i think it's the big wing piece and the too-technicy build (from looking at the instructions). the platform seems kind of out of place. and for the size of the set, the functionality doesn't seem as good as it could be. it reminds me of 7699 armored drilling unit - looks impressive but doesn't seem to do that much. i do think mars mission has improved this year though. bar none, this is the weakest of the new mm sets i think.

4 iron moose, on jun 4 2008, 02:34 am, said: that certainly feels like an homage to the deep freeze defender... which itself feels like an homage to the galaxy commander. thats the observation i had when i saw the first pictures of this set online a few months ago. i am a proud owner of the 6973 deep freeze defender and 6980 galaxy commander, so i'm looking forward to see how the 7644 stacks up next to them. there is a definite lineage here, and these sets clearly demonstrate the evolution of lego set design over the years. the mx-81 may not have the most playability out of all the new mm sets (although it has alot from what i can tell), but its hard to beat the look of a large sleek space cruiser sitting on your shelf or dresser, at least for myself. anyhow, this is my first post to the forum and hope my welcome won't wear out here anytime soon. edited by spacefan, 04 june 2008 - 06:43 pm.

3 thanks for the review. i have to concede this does appear to be the weakest set of the summer mm lineup. i've noticed a trend that the larger sets have plenty of parts potential but when assembled the model is not more than the sum of the parts... eagle base certainly didn't seem worth the asking price, at least this is one large model. on a positive note the lame aero tubes, darts and martian carrier pods have disappeared. don't get me wrong, i love mm and most of the lineup is great, this one just seems to fall a little short of the bar.

4 i don't understand why there's so much negativity... this is actually my favorite of the new mm sets. the finished look is very sleek and not very gappy at all. the deployable landing pad is great, and it'll make it easy to put on a shelf without taking too much room. lots of greebles... although i will concede that it's just begging to be modded. still, though, i'm definitely buying this one. :) it has a really great look to it!

1 hm, needs more firepower.

3 a very nice little review of a pretty nice little set that i wish i'd bought between 1 and 10 of. just for the griffin. oh well. your review has shown me that it's useful for more than just that, so maybe i'll try to pick one up someday. can't have too many black capes, books, or printed things. speaking of which: whitefang, on jun 9 2008, 09:41 am, said: interesting parts it comes with a wizard book, owl, 2 printed tiles with a spider and stone prints on it. the far right, seriously i don't find any good use for it. can any eb members enlighten me on that gray thing on the right? the gray thing is technically a plume, like any castle plume, except in this case it's a feather (presumably from the griffin), and made from the mold to the old indian feathers in the wild west sets. it's a case of an old part coming back for a slightly new use, in a new colour. beyond that, the "stone print" tile is a bundle or rolled up blanket or package, depending on where it's used. i don't think it's ever meant to be a stone. it was used as a rolled up pack on the back of the star wars speederbikes, for example. nice pics, plenty of useful information. i'd give this review an a+ thanks for doing it!

4 i own about 6 copies of this set!

3 thanks for that nice review of a really interesting and pretty cool set. at least, a griffin, i guess, is pretty close to an unicorn or a dragon, huh?

4 thanks for the nice review - it was one of the first ones i got when emerging from my dark ages . i bought two of these, just for buckbeack - i thought he would make a good statue in a persian temple type moc. i also liked the minifig head pumpkin and plant part in bright green - both new pieces to me at the time. all in all, it was a good castle or forest building set with a nice selection of pieces for rocks, grass, plants and trees. the dark bley plume piece also now appears in the 10185 green grocer set as detailing on the roof of the turret.

4 great review. nice set for plants, huh? too bad i didnt get thus set... but luckily my neighbor did! that griffin is nice for castle mocs, and that orange head (pumpkin, i know) seems rare to me. not much else to say...

3 mr spielbrick, on jun 11 2008, 04:28 pm, said: ohhh great idea to review the "old" potter sets! especially the line from prisoner of azkaban... i was in my dark ages then. luckily i was able to catch up on the missed figs with one internet order. this draco is the best tlc has made, if you ask me. the new one (also doubling for belloq and "guards" in the indy line) doesn't look quite as hautain as this one. buckbeak looks cool. looks like his neck/head can be moved, right? rather similar to lego horses. well designed. the orange brick doesn't have a pumpkin face on it, right? unlike the one from philosopher's stone in the set with the troll. i'm looking forward to more reviews by you, sir whitefang! good work no printed face on the pumpkin since the event didn't happen on or near halloween, unlike the whole troll situation i also agree that this draco is the best one, the new one looks too much like a draco from the oldr films, when he smirked a lot more, but, since very character got a redesign...they had to "tune him up" even if it meant changigng him for the worse

4 guys, thanks for your comments! glad you find this review useful! and be sure to watch out for more old sets reviews. mr spielbrick, on jun 12 2008, 12:28 am, said: this draco is the best tlc has made, if you ask me. the new one (also doubling for belloq and "guards" in the indy line) doesn't look quite as hautain as this one. buckbeak looks cool. looks like his neck/head can be moved, right? rather similar to lego horses. well designed. mr spielbrick, thanks for pointing out some important highlights for the review. i have overlooked it earlier. i strongly agreed with you, that this draco is the best tlc made. i pretty like the face compared to others. furthermore, i used my multiple dracos, for my castle armor guards instead. one could not have too many dracos. buckbeak design is well made. the head can be moved upwards and downwards. the mechanism is similar to the horse design. in addition, buckbeak wings can be removed. similar to the typical green or black dragon wings that we used to see in the past. well, the main reason for me to buy this set was in fact buckbeak. you don't often find a griffin lying around except in harry potter sets. mr spielbrick, on jun 12 2008, 12:28 am, said: the orange brick doesn't have a pumpkin face on it, right? unlike the one from philosopher's stone in the set with the troll. sorry to said, there is no print on that pumpkin face. it's pure orange.

4 hello eb! yes, i'm cranking out the reviews! the other day i picked up this gem for an okay sales price at devonport, tas, while searching for the new batsets. i informed iamded of this as he is a spidey-suckup ( ) and he informed me this was the only set he didn't have of the wave 2 of this theme. so i ask you great eb members to please remind him of this when commenting! here we go with the review of doctopus' lair: anyway, unlike other reviews, this stars more people, the batbrick-iamded-dragonator-daisy review! (daisy is the mouse that came in the set) first up re the figs, and i must say they are great. i love fleshies and these are excellent to expand my batman world, plus having a spiderman to beat up is good too doctopus is great, though his tentacles are annoying to keep in order. peter parker is a nice addition, i love that torso. eve though harry osborn was totally absent from this scene, i welcome him as he is a good fig also. best of all is mary jane, fleshie females are hard to come by and i love that hair, my very first one! oh, and even better is bley daisy on the far right: another fantastic thing is that by mixing mj with doctopus you get a far more deadly and real villain than anyone could've forseen - the hippy! oh c'mon, tell me that ain't cool? anyhoo, here is a pic of doctopus showing his might: random fact: did you know i influence both dragonator and iamded in their sigfigs? dragonator adapts his from my ia series while iamded added mutt hair when i had him like that in a pic i posted. now onto the box, sorry about the lighting. the art is good and the cartoon spidey in the corner may have beenthe inspiration for a similar style in the new batsets: back of the box. again, sorry about the lighting and blur, it was gtting late and these were the last pics: finally we get to the first part of the set: the catapult. is that movie accurate or what? i love the part in sm2 when he uses his homemade genetic spider powered catapult to launch himself to the scene! oh well, it does comes with a cool spider web an trans blue spider, so it gets some points: and it is really fun! i launched spidey several metres once, i don't think he ever recovered. infact, he almost certainly webbed himself slightly cooler extras are these two. this awesome little boat is great for city, as is the simple but nice bouy, daisy approves: naturally dragonator ruins everything when he found out the "dragon" that would be riding with him was our nickname for daisy now finally, the main attraction - coctopus' dock. iamded and i threw dragonator in the water to see if he could swim. he er, couldn't one sweeney todd later, we continue! the overall construction of the building is very good. i know a lot of people hated stickers and i hated applying these, but they do look spectacular and perfect for any city setting, like a bank, a gotham bank as iamded has already noted below me the black lifesavers a very cool as are the web piece and log pieces: the inside contains the neutron copperplate triple bypass humdrum holy hum 5000, which does does, see movie. anyhoo, it is very cool, and includes a little control thingy on the yellow brick next to it. unfortunately, the inside is plain but for that: the other side has no wall too which is a bit of a letdown really, but atleast it allows daisy easy access. one gripe is those yellow 1x1 bricks, they serve no purpose and break up the colour scheme: better shot of the thingy thing. i quite like it, the use of technic parts actually works, and the whole set is worth it for those purple flames and dishes alone it closes up pretty well too, unable to hit the dish which is a nice feature: me and iamded liked it so much we threw a revived dragonator into it. unfortunately it disagreed with him, but it was fun: another shot of the dock. i like how they have gaps in the jetty, i know the movie version was pretty wack, and although the set isn't very faithful to it (looks more like a seaside library to be frank) it still is very nice. this is my first large blue baseplate too which is wonderful, though funny how the set only uses about half of it: the roof is a well designed and fun feature, it uses some technic connections to render it flexible of any degree, as you can see here by my opening of it: better shot of the roof design, it can lie flat or at any angle. i might use the design myself in the future: as much as i love the building this feature bugs me, for in order for it to work this wall has to stick out, which not only looks ugly but makes you be able to see through the corners. still, easily modded, and log pieces are fantastic for mocing. it also means that there are 7 windows all up for a good, sizeable building: by pulling out the piece in the center the walls both collapss sideways outwards, which is actually pretty fun and works everytime: overall view of the set including characters: now for the story that makes no sense....at all: spiderman is dead after falling down the wall mechanism (see above): only daisy can save the day! for dragonator is being held by the evil doctopus! and iamded and dragonator are too busy not caring! and brainbox is too busy complaining that this goes against all marvel continuity! unfortunately daisy is on a lunchbreak so tough luck dragonator: and daisy goes on a search for fortune and glory: okay, this is what i think of the set: build: 3/5 - fun, but those stickers ruin the experience somewhat, and if you don't apply them the instructions are a bit hard to follow. playability: 4/5 - great little gizmos and bits, not the kind that keep you going like with the 2007 aquabase, but good fun still. design: 4/5 - not very movie faithful no, but still a great little building and a smart design for certain aspects. minifigs: 5/5 - great figs with all different faces and very useful bits. price: 2/5 far, far overpriced even on sale sadly total: 18/25 - a good set that could've been better with a few minor changes. nothing wrong with it, but it doesn't really cross the line to greatness. that said, it has a lot going for it and definitely worth buying or atleast a look! thanks for reading batbrick away! edited by batbrick, 13 june 2008 - 12:21 pm.

4 lookin' good so far! though i must say it's doc ock, not dok ock... the catapult is, well, ridiculous, but the boat is very spiffy, and the buoy is a nice addition! i actually like the stickers on the window pieces, perfect for this building, and great for post-apoc scenes. black life-saver rings are a nice addition too.anyway, hurry up dragonator and batbrick! and daisy! i want to see the rest of the review! ~iamded away!

3 great review as always, batbrick! ) i always enjoy reading them because they really make my day! )))) i hope that we shall see more and more.... good day, gentlemen! )

3 i got this set in 2006 in a 'byrnes world of wonder' toy shop. i dont remember how much, but it was a deal. the box was all battered but it had everything. good review batbrick.

1 where is my soap????!!!! haha, anyway, nice review as always, batbrick! i too have the set and hate the wall jutting out, catapult, and missing wall. but hey, review.

3 hmmmm... it does go against all marvel continuity! oh yeah, daisy found a job working for indiana jones as a stunt double in the temple of doom!!!

3 great review! i wish i'd bought this set when it came out. oh well...

3 great review! and what are the stands that you used? they look much better than the white bricks that i use.

3 oops. sorry, valentin!

4 imo, this set is the best sw set of 2006. its cheap and sturdy for me its 9.8/10

4 here's the 3rd of the whole batch of complete reviews done back in 2006. hope you guys enjoy them so far. product: 6206 tie interceptor theme: star wars no of pieces: 212 release date: february 2006 rrp: sgd39.90/usd19.90 availability: lego shop@home, target, toys 'r' us (us & europe), bricksworld (sg). lego.com said: challenge the rebels! blasting out of star wars episode vi: return of the jedi, the tie interceptor is the fastest fighter in the imperial fleet! open the cockpit canopy and fold down the instrument panel to put the tie pilot inside and recreate your favorite classic star wars battles! includes tie fighter pilot! cockpit opens and instrument panel folds down! it does seem to have more pieces than the average tie fighter, but this is actually cheaper than the 7263 tie fighter. of course, there's no light-up feature in this set. :sweat: yesh!! finally... a... tie interceptor!! this is probably the most anticipated for all set for all lego tie collectors worldwide, since the fighter, bomber, advanced, and even the expanded universe droid fighter had been released by the lego group. this set is near movie-accurate, since the bottom part of it ain't. :p the cockpit and pylons uses the same design as that of the tie advanced piloted by darth vader. except for one minor change, that is the aft interior of the cockpit is strengthen this time. and this is indeed good news, since the older models had a problem of hard hinge and loose brick connection. there's no landing gear for this set, but it doesn't require it anyway. this tie interceptor balances perfectly on its wings. standard instruments panel and, of course, standard imperial pilot. the "swoosh-able" or play factor of this set is definitely very high... just take a look. :d *camera view from own craft* *camera view from tie-advanced* *combat simulation of endor's battle from the archives* no bomber, since i started late in re-collecting. :p to conclude, for a typical lego fan, this set is a 60/40, 60 due to it's good design, and for a typical star wars fan, this is a must-get. the only flaw for this set is the same flaw for any lego set in sg, the price. :doh: comment(current in 2008) being a starwars fan... no... being a typical toy collector, space is definitely a premium... so much so that i turned to lego starwars to sate my appetite for more starwars products when i already have no more display space. for the next few non-lego pictures, they are the crown of my starfighter collection in 1/18 scale. so just view them for fun, eh? and no, i haven't had the chance nor the time to do up a scene of my lego starfighters blowing up spectacularly since the pieces would be very hard to put back... hmm... then again, isn't that what lego is about. "doh".

3 great review!! thanks for posting!

4 great review indexing it, as i write this. how come you think the ctt is the at-ats predecessor? do you mean the motorized at-at or at-at's in general? i think this is a great set and i am very fond of mine. it's one of the few sw sets of mine that is on "parade" at all times. most are packed away in the attic. kimt [btw it's not alone, the older version of the at-at is keeping it company]

3 i mean by the clone turbo tank turned into the at-at i think in the films. when they changed all there technology and vehicles when they became the empire.

4 great review kimt . i like this set (even if i don´t own it) because it looks simple fantastic to display. i just have one question: the mini executor can be moved around the death star ii or its attached to that place? thanks for the review .

1 i think it's a very weird and boring ucs set, but... what a lot of grey plates! you could build something much better out of them, but it would be fairly flat. it looks very fragile though , my ucs at-st is... edited by shoc, 25 june 2008 - 10:28 am.

1 i also don't feel this is a very good set. but is that old grey? in which case it would be a nice part pack... dr. brick

1 the build was a bit boring and i suppose a big grey ball isn't all that interesting, but since the death star ii in the movie is a big grey ball too, i don't see the problem. i didn't think it was particularly fragile. i don't care about minifigs or playability either. a few plusses: in my opinion it looked pretty damn impressive sitting in my lego room and the construction is really clever. all in all, i actually liked this one, but perhaps i have a different expectation of sets than most of you. sets are mainly parts packs and would you look at the quantity of grey plate in this thing! (it's new grey btw). i paid half price for it at shop@home uk, which is still a _lot_ more than half price from the us, and i didn't regret it for a second. cheers, ralph

4 lasse d, on jun 25 2008, 06:04 pm, said: here are some advantages that makes isd win for me: - a lot more fun to build with less repetitions - it is easier to build alternate models from it! (how many alternate models of the ds2 have you seen?) - the bricks are more varied. - you get magnets! - it is a larger set if you look at the size - it's more intresting to look at - it's got more variety of nooks and crannys

1 wow, what a letdown. i recently picked up this set, and i looked up this review to see what i was getting into. not good news. the silver lining is that it was a "damaged box" deal at brickworld, so it only cost me $100 (half off the already lowered price) so it was definatley worth it as a parts pack, if nothing else. it's the last unopened/unbuilt "large" kit in my collection, so even if it is repetetive, i am going to build it anyway. it is likely however that i may substitute pieces to do away with the colored interior. i've already determined that after it sits on display for a while, i want to do a zepplin as an alternate build. looking at the parts list it looks like its the perfect set for such an undertaking.

3 neoconagenda, on 24 june 2015 - 11:29 pm, said: i decided to re-read this review because i just got this set today. i dont really have a concern over the design or repeating build process because owning this set was never an option for me as i collect ucs sets... but i am surprised to see an almost total lack of positive posts. i really hope that i enjoy this build. hi, you may find this thread interesting, i really enjoyed bricklinking it

3 very nice review jim! i haven't bought this set yet, but am planning to just to get a gg fig as i don't have one already. bought an imperial landing craft instead this week as it was on sale, but after this review, gg's fighter is sure to follow soon benny

4 that's a neat little set. i like the design of the fighter. thanks for the review - it's been keep it up kimt

1 jameseh, on jun 28 2008, 08:24 pm, said: does the sliding cockpit come off easily? my friends brothers breaks everytime you touch it, but he may have built it wrong. it put me off the set. im very sad to say that sometimes it does. but thats only if you hold it from the top and bottom with your fingers and thumb respectivly. but if you hold it in your palm or from the sides, it wont break. emphasis on sometimes. but dont try to mess around with it by removing its pieces or adding new one, or modding it in any way, because the sliding mechanism wont agree with the mods and break. but this hardly takes away from anyone liking this set because, imo, its perfect just how it is.

4 its a good review but you forgot another thing. the troll needs a shiled like they used to in the 2007 castle line the sets always had shields for the minifigs and it could be better if it was 3.00 instead of 3.50 but yes it is a good impulse great army builder.

4 nice review, i will definately need a few of these!

4 guys, thanks for your kind comments. it seemed most of us here love this impulse set, mainly to build army. guess, i am a little bit too critic in my review. i was expecting a little bit more! nevertheless, i intend to buy multiple sets of this and build on my orc armies and split them into different battalions. this is indeed one of the better ways to acquire orcs. wilhelm screamer, on jul 3 2008, 11:30 am, said: i got two of these in the mail today and was so eager to do a review of it. thanks for saving me the work. opps, i was eager to do a review as well, when i bought these sets. i hope you enjoyed reading this comprehensive review. nikola bathory, on jul 3 2008, 04:08 pm, said: hey, your review is great (as usual!!) as for the set itself - well, it's an impulse set after all - small and cheap, nothing special. well, the rat is special, hehe, for me the rat is the most interesting in the set (cause i don't have a rat). i don't have a troll warrior either, but i'm not very interested. give the new theme a chance. i feel tlg have made an effort to revive certain elements that are present in past castle themes. although it is not as good as the past, but it is certainly better than the recent castle themes. shoc, on jul 4 2008, 01:00 am, said: why is mouse friendlier than rat? well, mouse sounded more friendly, because it can associate with tom and jerry. but, calling it a rat equal calling it a pest.. it's just a matter of putting it in different terms. that's all. edit: instead of posting another post to explain why i used mouse. i will write it here. tom and jerry is reflected as a cartoon. children associate jerry as a mouse, since its supposed to be heart-warming and make us laugh. in real life, there are many different pets we raised. one of the possible pets we considered is a mouse. mouse are supposed to be shy and friendly creatures that live in harmony. while rats lived in packs, hunt food in the dark and is widely regarded as a "pest". in this review, i am trying to illustrate rat and associate it with mouse by presenting it in a much friendly approach. there is no right or wrong answer. it's just making use of different words to represent how i feel towards a particular thing. edited by whitefang, 04 july 2008 - 08:08 am.

4 this is a nice way of building up orc armies, but i do wish it was designed like the knight impulse set. there you have a minifig, enough weapons and armor for two figs and a weapons rack made out of basic pieces. add a generic fig from your collection and you have two knights and the pieces from the rack can be easily used in mocs. the pieces that make up the siege weapon in the orc impulse are not as easy to use in other creations. i'd rather have seen a "orcish" weapons rack (different from the knights rack, but like it, using basic elements) with a second helmet, another weapon, the orc armor and a shield to put on it. still, although not as good as the knight impulse, it's a nice little set. whitefang, on jul 4 2008, 03:43 am, said: tom and jerry is reflected as a cartoon. children associate jerry as a mouse, since its supposed to be heart-warming and make us laugh. in real life, there are many different pets we raised. one of the possible pets we considered is a mouse. mouse are supposed to be shy and friendly creatures that live in harmony. while rats lived in packs, hunt food in the dark and is widely regarded as a "pest". where i come from people keep both as pets. however, if either are found in the house uninvited, they are considered pests. and if you look at the chinese zodiac, rats are very well thought of and are symbols of prosperity. the brick mouse rat

4 hello all eurobricks members, i will be doing a continuation of my impulse set reviews. i was pretty excited when i laid my hands on these new impulse sets yesterday. hope to give most of you a good insight for this set. name: street cleaner theme: lego system / town / city year: 2008 pieces: 22 minifigs: 1 an image of a 5620, street cleaner let the cleaning begin the street cleaner has a job to do. it is to clean the rubbish on the streets, after a new year countdown. it seemed the cleaning agency have a new equipment to use. it's not as big as the previous street sweeper machine. the cleaner will need to operate the equipment manually, by pushing it. look at the mess after sorting out look at the pieces offered. it's not a very complicated set, since it's an impulse set. there are some pretty useful parts lying around such as the broom, spade. however, i was quite surprised when i could not find the lid of the rubbish bin. i can't used this rubbish bin to place it around my town, without a lid on top of it. i believed it is not a norm, by not including the lid. look at that bin well, that rubbish bin seem to be containing his equipment in it, instead of the rubbish. the cleaner's face looks pretty sad. i think he wants to have a change of job. front view i love that blue brush very much. quite fun to play with, especially pushing the rubbish aside. that's why a spade is there to help him to dig out the litter and the broom to brush it away. ok, now i know why his face looks so sad! where is that street sweeper machine? summary review playability: 6.5/10 (not bad to play with) design: 7.5/10 (the design is relatively interesting, with the use of the technic part, to be its foundation.) price: 8/10 (an inexpensive set to get another cleaner and some neat accessories.) overall: 7/10 (not a bad set after all. pretty average, but still quite good to buy if your towns required more cleaners.) hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine. comments and critics are strongly welcomed. pictures can be found in my brickshelf(when moderated) edited by whitefang, 04 july 2008 - 03:44 pm.

4 thanks for the review . not a bad price (of course, its impulse) for a fig, a little cleaner thing, and two accesories. the brush, fig, and spade i dont have yet, so i might just pick this up.

4 looking at this is making me want to build one of the favourite sets of my childhood, 6649 street sweeper (might do that today actually). cheap. good pieces (despite the lack of a bin lid... that's just inviting disaster isn't it?), nice fig, and one of those blue brushes, which i've always loved but never managed to use. thanks whitefang.

4 thank you for the nice review. this set looks good. i have too many of the blue sweepthings, but the fig is nice and i didn't have this face, so i will pick up one some day.

4 wow, what a great little impulse set! i relly dig the face as well as a chance to get some cool accessories like a broom, bin (no lid....sigh) and a mushroom top (hat). a really nice review and story too whitefang, i think this guy will be joining my set of lego when he shows up in australia. cheers isc

4 hello all eurobricks members, i will be doing a continuation of my impulse set reviews. this will be the third review at a go. hope everyone of you will find this review useful in a way. name: coast guard kayak theme: lego system / town / city year: 2008 pieces: 21 minifigs: 1 an image of a 5621, coast guard kayak roll roll, roll your boat it seemed the coast guard has a kayak of his own, roaming in the sea, making sure that swimmers will be safe in the beach. now, i am illustrating him as a life guard instead. this set is simply wonderful. among the 4 new impulse sets, coast guard kayak is the best looking set in my opnion. the kayak design is very simple but looks realistic . furthermore, if you don't need it to be a coast guard kind of stuff. use it as a leisure water spot instead down in the marina. i will think any lego citizen will love to have some water spot in their busy life. so come down here and wind down with this new sport. bits and pieces kayak and the bouy the bouy is very useful to position it at the coast of your water to highlight the boundaries in the sea, and warning incoming ships or vessels. oh, i did not make it tilted purposely. there is a white round base which allow it to tilt on both ends. useful parts these parts are useful to add on in your city. somehow, when i see that red cone, i can use it as a police stop, to inspect vehicles on the road or form a barricade with it. the bouy base shape is unique too. i like it very much. it is great to attached it by the side of the boat as a life bouy. the coast guard's life vest and helmet are very useful for water activites. the life vest was produced in past sets, and now it re-surfaced again. i am glad these vests made their way back. a look of him, without the life vest summary review playability: 7.5/10 (fun to play with, especially the bouy when you see it moving up and down.) design: 8.5/10 (design is simple but straight to the point, especially the kayak design.) price: 8/10 (an inexpensive set to get more coast guards and more kayaks.) overall: 8.5/10 (a very good set to have in your lego town. the kayak is simply so lovely to me.) hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine. comments and critics are strongly welcomed. pictures can be found in my brickshelf (when moderated)

4 thanks for doing these impulse sets, whitefang. this set looks like it has a good number of useful parts. i dont have the minifig torso or head, nor the oar or the life jacket.

4 excellent review; i like how the new coast guard sets blare out new when you see them.

4 i really enjoyed your review of the kayak! so many little things in one set that aren't currently in my collection. i didn't even realise it came with a buoy! cool helmet, lifejacket, face, and oar, i will definitely need one of these! cheers isc

4 hello all eurobricks members, this will be my last impulse set review for the second wave. hope everyone of you will find my reviews useful and helpful in your purchase. name: crystal hawk theme: lego system / mars mission year: 2008 pieces: 26 minifigs: 1 an image of a 5619, crystal hawk alpha 3 in sector 5, reporting to base alpha 3, crystal hawk, reporting for duty, sir! may i present mars mission, latest scout craft, code named "crystal hawk". this spacecraft looks very sleek and cool with its usual white and orange color combination. i am not a fan of mars mission, but these white mini-figs simply attracted me for it. in fact, i only owned its impulse sets, and none of its main sets. nevertheless, this set has the "swoosh" factor. i was swooshing around in my home last night. well, i am not swooshing it like kimt though. am i seeing double? haha, the answer is "no". it has double sided face. i combined the pictures, to illustrate the two facial expressions. bits and pieces different angles love the way how the wings bend upwards and downwards. the only thing i find it a little bit wierd for spacecraft. normally, i thought joystick is the typical navigation controls for a spacecraft instead of a steering wheel? i am not complaining about a steering wheel in a spacecraft. to me, it's quite an uncommon sight. anyway, the white steering wheel is an useful part for making vehicles mocs. summary review playability: 8/10 (fun to play with when you bend the wings up and down.) design: 8.5/10 (design is simple, but creates a sleek and cool look.) price: 8/10 (an inexpensive set to get more scout craft and mars mission mini-figs) overall: 8.5/10 (a very good set to have for any mars mission fans, and for collectors like me whom can't afford all mars mission sets, this set is a very great alternative.) hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine. comments and critics are strongly welcomed. pictures can be found in my brickshelf (when moderated)

4 thanks for the great review. now i just have to have that set!

4 thank you for the nice review. this set has a very classic space feeling, so i don't care about the lack of cockpit. a nice little set with a nice minifig.

4 droool must buy!!!!!! to svelte_corps: how on this wonderful planet, did you get that??? i thought it was coming in september!!!

3 awsome review dude im proably getting this though the main downfall is there is hardly an inside

3 svelte_corps, on jul 7 2008, 11:03 pm, said: that's the best pic i have at the moment, apologies re blurriness. cool. he looks a lot meaner and more damaged-terminatorsy that his brother.

3 great review!!! realy thank you svelte_corps! maybey you can put al the agents villains round dr. disco like a sort of dicussionroom or something...just an idea undersigned mowo

4 thanks for the review svelte_corps, i have yet to purchase an agent set but i think that will change shortly. i am not a big fan of the stickers but the huge laser gun, the unique minifig design, and beaucoup trans-orange pieces have me sold.

4 this will be a wonderful set for a mustafar moc

4 cool set. i got that firearm thing straight away lol. i might get a few of these sets and combine into mustafar. great review

4 i didn't exactly know where this belongs the best but i think it fits the best in here cause it's somewhat space related. i got this nifty little set yesterday from an auction ebay, new and sealed! i think the rock raiders theme was a great theme, and i wish they would have continues id back then. but anyway, let's see what we got here: set nr.: 4910 name: hover scout number of minifigs: 1 number of pieces: 39 release year: 1999 first, a picture of the little box & instructions: a general overview of the set: and here we have the lovely (?) miss jet! (yes, the minifigures had odfficial names in this theme ) the little vehicle: and finally the crystal analysis station. i like that very much, even if it's simple, but it does a good job and the amount of equipment also is cool: that's it, little set, little review, but big fun. i can recommend that to everybody, it's great for the parts, and the minifig is lovely. gets a 10/10 from me

4 omg iamded's torso! [ spoiler] oh my god!![ /spoiler]

4 when i got this set, my first rock raiders set, i thought it was the best set i ever had. maybe that was a little bit of an overstatement, but i like a lot, the pieces mainly, and this is a nice little review! are92 rowar, on jul 10 2008, 08:22 pm, said: omg iamded's torso! [ spoiler] oh my god!![ /spoiler] what would be more appropriate is commenting on iamded's torso saying "omg jet's torso!"

4 great review . man, this brings me back! i still have like 5 of those rock monsters. in response to your statement, rock raiders does belong in this forum, being everything space related. 1) it's on an alien planet 2) in the computer game's start and in the story (yes, there was a computer game-my cousin has it) they are in a space ship 3) there are huge alien rock monsters trying to kill them.

3 great review and such a nice figure! i consider rock raiders space too. i also consider many of the diver themes space as well... i've yet to own a rock raiders set. i have tried to buy a few off ebay, but they always went too high...

4 rock raiders was one of my favorite lego themes ever.

3 sinner, on jul 20 2008, 04:56 pm, said: i consider rock raiders space too. i also consider many of the diver themes space as well... me too. the rock raiders are very sci-fi, with the best lego space storyline. the aquazonies would be inner space rather than outer space though, but they look very 'spacey'. edited by shoc, 20 july 2008 - 07:45 pm.

3 jimbutcher, on jul 10 2008, 09:44 pm, said: a hidden compartment! now this was a very cool idea by tlg, a secret compartment found by taking off the top slope of the hull you're supposed to slide the front of the hull off, rather than lift the top piece off.

3 led zeppelin, on jul 10 2008, 04:46 pm, said: you're supposed to slide the front of the hull off, rather than lift the top piece off. yeah, i was looking at the construction booklet and it reminded me of that (i forgot about it), but that makes it more fragile.

3 thank you for the nice review. i like the design, although i didn't want to buy it. the new little speeder is very nice, but maybe a little to small.. darth mauls eyes are looking a bit more dangerous now.

3 great review. i love that slime face !

4 darth_legois, on jul 11 2008, 10:28 am, said: [color="#0000ff"] *cough*alphateam*cough* i'd forgotten about ogel's mutant vehicles i guess i meant a bigger cross between the 8636 sub and the big squid from 7775 aquabase invasion - that is such a great design. sort of keep the retro feel but make it bigger. with the 8636 sub, there's really only room for one agent to sit and despite its size, there's just a few (not amazingly great) functions such as the hidden chest and missiles.

3 i feel like a n00b asking, but what is the usd price? i didn't see a price in the review.

4 nice review, thanks! tlc is really going all-out with the agents theme. i wonder if it will last longer than one year (unlike other recent one-and-done themes). my only real criticism of the theme is those freaking stickers. my god, look at the size of that dss in this set!

4 aside from the price, i love this set! when i saw the prelim pics of agetns i did not like the theme, but all the sets are starting to look more attractive now i can see the cool features and details! as for this set, i really like the bad-guy boat for some reason and the submarine looks good - i love the dark blue colour.

4 great looking set. and that glowy blue octopus is really cute, i might just get it for that. be great in a space moc.. wondering, from the pdf instructions i saw, it wasnt clear what the agent in the sub is sitting on, hows his seat work? and it looks like theres a compartment below him...

4 thanks for another informative review of the best lego theme ever, and not in attempt to hijack your thread but to add to it, here's a pic of my blacktron 1 version of this beautiful set. the 6927 has to rate as one of the best 5 classic space sets ever along with 918, 6970 and 928.

4 i've always associated this set with 6929, the voyager. they're of the same timeframe and more or less the same style. 6927 is without any doubt my favourite ground vehicle of space. it was pretty simple, but it was such a creative set. the stories you could tell with this model... g... most defenitely in my top 5 of space sets...

3 wow! that brings back memories. i have that model too (in storage somewhere). the pictures are great. i will definitely be checking out more of your reviews.

4 yeah, first time that i am getting a set before everyone.^^ first of all: the package the european version has no "limited edition" button. hooray!!! sorry for the blurry back-shot. we see the hospital back, a few bubbles with set functions and a little comic. comic: bubbles: the figures are injured spongebob, patrick and the new fish doctor. spongebob has a headprint... ...and a backprint (other than the normal spongebob). spongebob and injured bob: the set comes with two litters. the ambulance car is a bit extraordinary. i don´t know how the car is like in the show (and i saw a lot of episodes) but it looks a bit strange, mostly because the weehls are too small. of course we get another ss (not so d this time). the litter fits in the back, with help of this lid. i wish it would be the hinge-lid from before 2004... now we come to the meanpart of the set: the hospital! the entrance has got babyblue traindoors and a hudge sign that shows "emergency". the tubes are nearly everywhere in this set. i was getting insane when i came to the part, where i must put the stickers on the tubes. this parts are very usefull, but i wanted that the set looks good, because i will display it. so i stickered just two of the parts and not all four. now we come to the interroir: the doctor has a desk with computer. sadly it´s not very well placed and he must duck because of his fin. next to the door, we get this little case, wash basin and two drawers. again we get stickers... not that i don´t like stickers. it´s just: everytime i get to the part where i must put the stickers on, i think how i can re-use the model and if i rebuild the model, later and and and... i hate it to deside! a few posters are in it, too. the set is a great addittion to your own bikino bottom, but the playability is not very big for the kids. they can just play that patrick steals the ambulance car, like shown on the package, and is hitting spongebob. than the drive back, the doctor gives spongebob two medicines and let him go. i bought the set mostly because of the parts (tubes in lightbley and a few woodpieces). but i am thinking about let it stand in my little bikini bottom (just consist of crusty crab and chum bucket). playability: 3/10 figures: 10/10 price: 8/10 design: 9/10 total: 30/40

4 thanks for the review, looks like a great set. i'm surprised that spongebob's bandage has a full body headprint so kudos to lego for that

4 i love the sponge bob sets, i have all of them! nice review.

3 great review. as much as i hate spongebob lego, i just might get this set. it has a good number of useful parts, like the computer and keyboard, and all of the brown pieces. how much does this set cost in usd?

3 great review! i want that set, mainly for patric and the spongebob with the bandage. but: why does bob have full length pants? i thought he wore briefs?

4 how much euro did you pay for it? it looks a great set, great interior, nice figures and funny posters. :) it's also nice: the newest spongebob sets are now also available in our stores and they are the coolest (belgium)!

3 cpt. pegleg blockbeard, on jul 12 2008, 04:23 pm, said: is sponge bob sets available in auzzi land? i have not seen them in shops... regards cpt. pb generally not, although as a special sale promotion target has 3830 bikini bottom express and 3831 rocket ride available now (although the sale starts 24 july for 20% off) and k-mart briefly had the krusty krab set last year.

4 i'm not a huge fan of spongebob, but this set i might want also have. maybe i can combine it with the city hospital.

4 thanks navy trooper fenson for the review - good one ! i really like that sb is printed! i will need to get this one when i go to the us in two weeks. copmike

1 i recently bought this set for my daughters birthday. it's the first belville set that i've bought for her so it's a bit of an experiment. the house is 5 rooms and it's made up of mostly large pieces. there still is a decent amount of normal lego in it though. the doorways in the house align when it is opened out. starting with the bathroom, included is a shower, toilet, sink with vanity and a baby potty. the mirror sticker is one of the few that i put on. the open plan lounge/kitchen/dining room is well appointed as well and it has a nice glass table and coffee machine. the kitchen chairs are fabuland parts... and don't work really well. it seems they are having jellyfish for dinner! the clock is the only printed part in the set. upstairs is a baby room and the master bedroom. the radio and the tv (not shown) were stickers to my disappointment. up top is an extra room suitable for reading. (those antenna things were made from spare parts by my daughter. i have no idea what they are supposed to be... ) there are some stickers that go on the back, but i didn't put them on. as it is the set looks ok this way, but since it is a dolls house it doesn't really matter. i do think though that the fireplace should have been given a back. the bbq is made from normal parts and is quite effective. i think it uses the same light brick that's in the 4998 stegosaurus set. my kids were using it as a torch before my grumbling ruined their fun... like all belville sets, the highlight is arguably the accessories. i'll be borrowing a few of these from time to time... here is the controversial baby catapult. as you can see, it works ok, but lego probably should have tried a bit harder. we also bought for her 7583 playful puppy. it also comes with some nice accessories, but not enough to justify buying unless you want the rest of the parts. poor puppy; where does he sleep? here is my daughter assembling it. she made me make the house though as she wanted to play a game we bought her. (note the lego drink bottles! ) i didn't take any photos of the figures as they don't seem to be anything new, but i can if people want me to. at the time i was in bit of a hurry as i took these before bed so i wouldn't be stressed if the kids broke it the next day. overall, these sets seem overpriced to me, and hard to justify unless you actually want a buildable doll's house. (which we did.) it's still too early to tell if my daughter likes it or not... but at this stage it seems she lost interest in a few days. she does tend to go back to toys though. edited by whitefang, 23 may 2009 - 07:03 pm. indexed

4 excellent review! it's nice to see how... it's nice to see how ... ... it's nice ... okay, i can't get over the sex in the bedroom and the unattended baby crawling into the oven. i didn't read anything else except, where does the puppy sleep and my daughter made me build this. you are sick and twisted and that's why i love you! it seems you are coining the belville edge. now will you please stop sitting around eating clams and get that baby out of the oven or make the fun in the bedroom a three-way? please! thank you ps. ok, i read it. i want the baby toilet and i think the jellyfish is supposed to be a jello-mold. i bet you knew that. the fireplace lattice look like the harry potter one and not the fabuland one. boo!! wienies. when your daughter outgrows it, will you turn it into a belleville star wars moc please? thank you in advance

3 i was sort of hoping for a flick-fire baby. still, this looks decent, for what it is, i guess. obviously, it really is all about the accessories, and it's got 'em, but not enough to make me spend that kind of cash, and i don't even mind having a pile of pink parts around. if you throw in a complete turkey or some birthday cakes, it's a slam dunk, but as it is... eh. thanks for the review, though, it's very nicely presented and leaves no doubt in my mind as to just how easy this set would be to misuse for other purposes.

4 nice review, good to see your almost letting your kids play with your lego i like the functionality of the baby catapult, its good that they include some working features in a build this big! are you not showing the figures because its really hugh hefners playboy/belville mansion? i dont see the grotto though, must be an add on set like the poor puppy! its just so darn pink

3 the lego lives on!! but you are one evil parent, getting your kids addicted to belville like that! but uh... whats that doll doing on the bed? whats underneath it...? and look what you found... a bucket!

4 aw, sinners' playing with toys again! great review! the set is good for parts it appears. and that bedroom scene is...interesting.

4 thanks for your report and the pics, my sister wants this set, but she's already got the last house and she doesn't play very often with it, but the new one looks very good, too

4 sinner, on jul 25 2008, 09:47 pm, said: i'm still undecided on if it was a smart buy. she played with it a lot this week, but last week she ignored it... and i had to fix it twice! my daughter is 12, and she still plays with all her belville stuff (mostly the fairy princess castle sets). if your daughter is anything like mine, you will definitely get your money's worth out of it. however ... as soon as my daughter says she's done with it, i plan on raiding the sets for all those great food and accessory bits. patience .... great review, by the way. the belville sets are indeed overpriced, but they're probably lego's best attempt at wooing the girl audience (i still hate the fact that tlc thinks they need separate "boy" themes and "girl" themes, but whatever). they're a very nice alternative to barbie -- you get posable figures with realistic body proportions, plus some creativity and building aspects thrown in.

4 7655: clone battle pack year: 2007 number of pieces: 58 number of minifigs: 4 price: 9.99 usd brickset welcome to my third review on eurobricks, i hope you enjoy! while at any store that sells lego (target, wal-mart, tru, etc.), you will notice that the clone battle packs on the shelf are way fewer in number than the droids battle pack. as you might guess, the clones are way more popular, and finding them gets harder and harder as the release date of this set goes farther into the past. so stock up! alright, heres a pic of the box: a small box, as expected for inexpensive sets like these. note the "build your army" button on the front: tlg obviously is encouraging customers to buy multiples, and with good reason, which will be explained later in this review. well, lets get straight to it: the contents of this set. you will notice a speeder bike, a gun turret, and some clones. looking good so far! lets have a look at the turret: an excellent star wars element to have around, especially for mocing. it is very cleverly built, using a tire guard from city sets for the general shape of the turret mount. all you have to do is attach the (new mold! explained later) gun to the 2x1 plate with the center stud, and... presto! i wonder how the clones build these turrets to fast in the middle of battle... a rear view: with a clone mounted: my only gripe about the turret is that you have to take off the gun in order for every clone to have a gun. now, we move on to the vehicle of the set, the speeder bike: a rather sleek and good looking bike, with some useful pieces on it as well, such as the blue cones, the megaphones, and the engines. some say it looks bare without the figs mounted on it, but i think it looks just fine. the commander drives while a trooper shoots on the back. a side view: and a rear view: my only gripe is the same as the turret: you have to remove the back gun for all the clones to have weapons while on foot. the back pistol attaches to a 2x2 round studded plate with a technic hole in the middle. finnaly, here are the new guns: this set comes with 1 new blaster rifle and three new pistols. it could have included one more rifle for the turret. and of course, the figs: includes: 1 yellow commander (lovely fig), 1 shocktrooper (comes with a pair of elctrobinouculars), and two regular troopers (so clean and white). the figs are excellent, all that any sw or lego fan should want. it could have maybe included one more regular trooper, but that might be pushing it. thats all for now, folks, here is the... final verdict: build: 8/10, extremely easy, should take the seasoned builder about 5 minutes to complete. a fun build, though. playability: 5/10, i guess you can get this with the droid battle pack and make them battle, but this set has no real play features of its own. but it is good for collecting troops and using them for mocs. swooshability: 9/10, i guess you can zoom the speeder bike around... minifigs: 10/10, four great figs that should be bought in multiples, a great army builder. design: 10/10, a clever turret, an awesome speeder, and four great clones. what more do you need in a 10 dollar set? price: 8/10, not bad i suppose, but if you calculate a dime for each piece, this set should come out to 5-6 dollars. but still, billions of these are being sold world-wide, and tlg is making a ton of money off of them. overall score: 9.5/10, a truly memorable set, one that will be a favorite for ages to come, and very popular. a great army builder for a small price, plus vehicle and turret! with only a few very minor flaws, this set is one of the best of star wars. and this concludes my review, and as always, comments are most welcome.

4 when i saw this topic i was like : "oh my god this set is out since 2007. this guy is so late!" but i read your review and this idea got out of my mind! thank you jim! i have 2 of these and i even have twice more droids than clones! i should have buy more but it's sold out now

4 nice review jimbutcher , this set is for many reasons awesome but unfortunately i just buy one. now i am planning on buying one more in my wal-mart there are like three in stock but with a high price of $19.99 each so maybe just one and will keep it misb .

3 that's strange. i saw about 20 of them in my tru. anyways, nice review. i thought this set was great for armies.

4 thanks for the review jimbutcher . i think this set is cool especially the cool redesigned stap i just it.

4 hello all eurobricks members and town lovers, this is my first classic town review. for today, i will be featuring the 6641, 4-wheelin' truck which is produced in 1987. for some younger members in eb, you might not have encounter such a baby roaming down the streets, horning at others with its big massive truck. considering this is a 1987 set, such a vehicle size is considered big in those days. name: 4-wheelin' truck theme: lego system / town year: 1987 pieces: 80 minifigs: 1 price: usd$6.50 an image of a 6641, 4-wheelin' truck *hello everyone* why the name 4-wheelin' truck? it is because this truck is equipped with 4 heavy duty wheels which is considered "big" among other small vehicles in classic town. please take note, most of the vehicles that are produced in classic town era, are 4-studs wide. this truck is no exception. meet the driver and his truck! this truck has a very good combinations of different colors that are common for most town vehicles. it made used of blue, white and red as its primary combinations. i find that this combinations is quite soothing to its eyes especially the blue bricks. in addition, the mini-fig torso is superb. the driver must be a great fan of this vehicle. i realised most truck drivers in the classic town era wear this most of the time. i wonder if its some kind of an organization? front view there is 2 red doors coupled with the truck, to enable the driver to get in properly. this vehicle is considered big in the 1980s. however, if you compared it with the current city vehicles, this truck certainly will not outsize the current designs. please take note of the wheels. the wheels are pretty different. i don't remember seeing these wheels in many other vehicles, maybe some members can help me on this. most of the classic town vehicles have a window frame on top which is known as a "sun-roof". in this set, this feature is also included. furthermore, the vehicle frame has a simple mechanism which all town lovers love. it is to lift it up and place their driver in and out the seat. most importantly, you do not have to take off the entire window frame just to put in the driver. different angles of the 4-wheelin' truck snot technique? back 20 years ago, lego had been experimenting with snot technique. you can see that the back looks very neat without the studs. in addition, it can be quite useful to place a mini-fig on top of it, or throw some baggage for some quick getaway. summary review playability: 8/10 (great addition to your town collection.) design: 8.5/10 (very good design. i love 4-studs truck. at least, it is able to occupy one side of the lane) price: 9/10 (an inexpensive set based on the 1987 pricing) overall: 8.5/10 (a must have for all classic town lovers, we have been complaining for more wider range of vehicle) i gave it a "4" based on my review score card. what about yours? hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine. pictures can be found in my brickshelf (when moderated) edited by whitefang, 13 july 2008 - 12:08 pm.

1 hmmm.... i probably would not have bought this as a kid in 1987, unless i had money to spare or the shop had no other set from space or castle, the two other big lines in 1987, and no better set in the town section. i think it's a great parts pack, but the model itself does not look very attractive. i never really liked those wheels, honestly. they're from the basic sets, mostly, and they work pretty well in those, but i'm just not a fan... the roof, on the other hand, was very popular and the blue modified bricks at the front were quite rare in those days, but generally speaking, this was not the star of 1987. gave it a "3"

4 dear afol friends, due to leakage of production plant in our country one member of our lego club had bought a new promo set. until now he placed only photo of the box, later on promissed to make a review. heavenly god, i wanna one at all costs! most were found here... edited by sinner, 17 july 2008 - 12:47 am. put photos in

4 omg, i have seen the light! will it be availeble from s@h? or is it just a promo? thanks for making my day wonderfull! dr. brick

4 wow, it does look really cool. i love that...oops! it's gone. can't post pics of that yet, sorry. it was requested that we remove those pics. sorry everyone. have a nice day.

3 awww i wanna see it please? edit: omg its all over the interwebs, if you know where it looks amzaing its a giant windmill with a house at bottom edited by pencoin, 14 july 2008 - 05:24 pm.

4 omg! omg! wow! that's simply amazing. wow! i can't say more... wait, i can. this is such a beatiful set. i sure hope it will be available for us to, like european people. it's so nice. it looks like the real thing, great cottage, great pieces, great van and figures. and the windthing. wow!

3 god save the save as-function

3 bagh i missed it all i know is that theres a cottage and van! time for brickshelf no doubt they've been taken down to. edit: awsome just found the brcikshelf pics. edited by skipper 24, 14 july 2008 - 06:05 pm.

3 wow! managed to find a pic on brickshelf and this is a great set. hope it going to be released properly and not just a promo. one thing though, would it not be quite noisy if you lived in that house

3 that sounds amazing! a wind power plant as a lego set is absolutely awesome and helps the lego city to get environmental energy. regrettably i missed the pics. when browsing through bs i didn't find them, too . can someone please post a link or sent me the link/picture via pm ? thanks. klaus-dieter

4 i recently got a few still sealed and new sets from the 90' on ebay, and after the rock raider's hover scout this isthe second one i'll review. i really like the space port theme, even if the sets may be more simple than earlier space city sets, i like the overall look and the color scheme. but enough of that, let's go on with the pictures! set nr.: 6455 name: space simulation station number of minifigs: 3 number of pieces: 240 release year: 1999 first again a few pics of the boxes and the instructions: the main box: this theme had a kinda strange seperation of the pieces, the parts for the control center and the shuttle are in seperate little boxes, and the others are in polybags with the models printed on them. also seperate instructions for each step: a general overview: we got 3 lovely minifigs here, from left to right the control engineer, the mechanic and the astronaut: the -i dont know the english word for it- testing-thing, the astronaut is being tested to hard nerves there the mechanics little car, on the back an extinguisher and a radio device is attached: the take-off station for the little shuttle with the shuttle itself on it: and without it: tools, tools, tools! the shuttle as stand-alone: i think that would be fuel tanks, i like this little detail: and finally we have the controll room, would have been better with seats, but it's alright: a really sweet mid-sized set if you ask me, a few juniorized parts, but it fits perfectly with the set. the theme itself is also great, and i wish that tlg brings it back, i could see stunning sets with the quality city sets have right now!

3 in the catalog images i thougt that the base was on a 16'16 baseplate... i have some sets of space-port and like them, but i would want real town sets in 1999... edited by lord santos, 15 july 2008 - 10:58 am.

4 *mini-bump* wow, i'd completely forgotten about this theme, which is suprising since i absolutely loved this theme as a kid (minus the sound n' light brick, which i thought was pretty big and ugly). sure brings back memories of looking at those little catalogue booklets that came with the sets.

3 i had never seen this set or this theme before. it was released during my dark age, and i had missed it. it's nice to see such sets, surface once again, to educate members like me that there are some good sets we had missed during the dark age. and, i must admit that this is a very good set. it's comes with 3 mini-figs and staudie with it. geez, i never thought he was an astronaunt back then. the testing facility is great, and i love to see it spin, by putting staudie in it for a "test-run". the buggy is cute as well, but somehow, i don't really like the white frame at the back. it looked a little odd to me. the tools, are simply wonderful to have. furthermore, these are grey tools. the last time, we had so many tools are the aeroplane mechanic. the shuttle is nice, but does the shuttle supposed to come with a cover as well? i guess, since this is a simulator, they must have cut down the budget for it. the control room is good, and it will be even better with chairs included. metalandi, thanks for the wonderful review!

3 do the manga guards heads fit on a regular minifig torso?

3 stop calling them "manga guards", people, that sounds silly! it's magna guards! sorry, but i just hate mangas. edited by oky wan kenobi, 20 july 2008 - 11:28 pm.

4 the copter this is one bigass copter. the photos really don't do the size justice. lower cockpit with cool computer. too bad it's a sticker, although i'll definitely leave this one on. upper cockpit with cool computer. see above. awesome gatling gun. yes, even the technic beams have stickers. i'm actually really fond of that little canister thing. i can see using it elsewhere. yes - that's a sticker. the rope and hook. i forgot to mention it before, this set comes with two accessories besides the machine gun - binocs and one of those little things to slide down the rope. also, the thing that 'extends' the rope turns. the other side, because they're slightly asymmetrical. one of my favorite stickers. the door says 'survival equipment'. it's on both sides. definitely a keeper.

4 another of my favorite parts - landing gear. this is the front section. ... and it retracts! unlike most ships with landing gear, this does not retract without effort (coughxwingcough). very sleek. the back landing gear. ... and again, smooth retraction. gotta love it. final score: 8.4/10 parts: 8/10 figs: 10/10 dinos: 2/10 copter: 9/10 value: 7/10 don't buy if: - you can wait for vikings - you don't like any set with stickers - you're not a space fan buy if: - you're a space fan - you don't mind stickers/don't apply them - you're like to create cool figures overall, i think it was worth the price, even at 605 pieces. however, i'd suggest buying vikings even considering this. well, hope this review (unexpected as it was ;-)) helped someone out there. until next time, bloody jay

4 great review jay !!!!! tks a lot ;) i am not that of the big fan of the copter due to its proportions - but i admit its really asome looking, better as i expected :od the best are those mfs !!!!!! they are truly awsome !!!!!!! i wiil but some of the smaller sets just for the figs hehe (too bad that my favorite - your second best - don't come in the smallers sets :'( ). are you going to review the other sets as well ??? that could be cool !!!!!

3 sam89, on jul 25 2005, 01:11 pm, said: that looks like a really great set, although i don't think i'd have anywhere to put it. i don't think i'll ever be able to get the set anyway, since it doesn't come out over here. sam, missing your point. the set _should_ come to europe, as 7298, but without guns (large crate instead).

3 hmmmm . . . . interesting. it's a shame though, because i really like the guns. any idea when it should come to europe? edit: i've just scene the official dino attack site, which says they're coming to europe in october.

4 the... weapon. whatever it's called. this uses the same mechanism as the longboat (for those that don't have either, you snap the little sports stand thing, which hits the 'missile', which fires, and since there's nothing holding the technic beam up to that height any more, it drops down so that the next missile drops into place. pretty cool, if unrealistic.). the two on the side do not fire, i think they're mainly there for 'extra ammo'. my biggest problem with this set. open bed. this could have easily been remedied with a few plates. interior opened. the fire hammer next to the t1. they look very cool together, don't they? you can also see my curio shelf. final score: 7.4/10 dinos: 1/10 fig: 8/10 (but that's just me) hummer: 8.5/10 parts: 9/10 i'm a harsh reviewer. i still think that if space/vehicles are your thing, you should buy this. however, if you're a bigger castle fan, or just like to get all sorts of lego, i would still suggest buying the viking catapult before this. however, i do think that these are some of the coolest sets of 2005. this is something you will eventually want to get. until next time, bloody jay

3 mr. lego_bildur, on jul 25 2005, 10:11 pm, said: thanks bloody jay! any chance you could be reviewing the other dino attack sets? possibly the steel sprinter and urban avenger, but i can say with finality that i will not buy the tank until i find it available for $30 or less. on that note, if anybody does find it for $30 or less, shoot me a pm. ;)

3 sorry for the double post, but i just had another question in mind: how long/high/wide is this "badass" copter? (including rotors). i have heard of as long as 25 inches for the length, but is this true or is it just an exaggeration?

4 wow, i think this is the first time i'm the first to have a new set (at least here) and review it. got it 2 days ago, thanks to a fast shipping from s@h this time, and i found time now to review it now. enough of the babbling, let's let the facts and pictures speak, which actually turned out pretty well this time. set nr.: 4210 name: coast guard platform number of minifigs: 4 number of pieces: 469 release year: 2008 a few shots of the box first: 2 books of instructions we got here, first one for the helicopter second one for the rest and the platform itself: a general overview of the platform from above: the 4 minifigs, 3 rescue guys and one oil rig worker (?). the pilot seems not very happy that he has to work in the middle of nowhere at sea right beside the entry of the tower we have the diving equipment holder: next, the guy can jump in this little speedboat... ...and another guy brings it down to water with the crane: if somebody is rescued from the air, he arrives here and is brought to the tower with the little moving platform than runs on "rails": down under we got a buoy and several life belts and extinguishers: with the lift somebody who is rescued by the boat can be brought up. i think it would been better if they would have made a mechanism there to bring it up, but it's okay: a few floors higher the sea is being observated and watched: on the ground level we have the medical station/warm-up room: the helicopter as stand-alone: all in all for me this is besides the police station the city set of this year. it's got great features, and looks fantastic and also has many useful pieces. you can't do anything wrong with buying it, 10/10 for me! that's all for now, hope you liked my review. edit: oh damn, i forgot to write "review" in the topic title, can a mod please add this? thanks!

3 seeing the pictures in this review certainly reinforce my original thoughts on this set: here's an oil-rig mod waiting to happen...

4 excellent review metalandi. it's always great to see early pictures of new sets. this set really reminds me of an oil rig, and could probably be easily modified as one (if one wanted an alternate model). the two components that i like most are the boat crane and the control room, but other sections are pretty slick as well. are those printed pieces in the control room, or stickers? i'm really starting to gain an appreciation for these new coast guard sets. they've come a long way over the years: 575 coast guard station -released 1978. i picked up the control boat & tower (7739) a few weeks ago but haven't opened it yet). in any case, thanks for taking the time to review this set and share it over eb.

4 i it!! i dont think i'm gonna buy it but i loved the review nice oil rig worker; he looks so rough undersigned mowo

4 thanks for the great review. i'm loving this set a lot - it looks well designed, and the helicopter is awesome! plus, i love the new worker figure with the beard. quote i agree, this is a great set - one of the best of the cg line for sure, way better than the boat set with the tower on the bionicle baseplate i wouldn't say that at all - true, this base is bigger, but the other set was well designed as well - plus the included boat is wonderful.

4 i think it looks good on the real set. i thought, the darker glass might be good on the ground level so the rescued guy has it nice and dark in there

4 nice review! this is just the "crown jewel" for the coast guard theme. i love the layout of its platform. it looks real neat to have it placed it in the midst of the deep blue sea, awaiting of any emergency rescue. sometimes, i feel that this set can used it to merge with my aqua raiders sets. i thought of using it as a land base, for the raiders to dock in their stuff before submerge into the ocean. ok, it's just a wierd idea of mine. just feel that aqua raiders and coast guard can work hand in hand, since they are naval expertise! it seemed, i can't view all the pictures somehow. nevertheless, i can still view some of it quite well. i love the command center. the amount of computer printed pieces simply make me smile, with the monitor, keyboard, radar screen and etc. the helicopter is cute too. however, i pity the victim that is loaded at the back. it seemed a little bit too dangerous. in addition, this set seemed to have quite alot of stickers, which can be quite discouraging. i do hope to see this set soon. so far, i quite like the current coast guard sets.

3 i agree with both of you. first, i have to add, that a few of the stickers were a bit annoying as it comes to put them on espacially the ones on the helicopter, where you have to put them on round parts. but i didn't really see this at a bad point, i really can live with it. second, it was a very hard decision, believe it or not, on which new set to buy, cause i got a huge 2008 set-wantlist. i guess it'll take some time before i can get most of the other sets i want

3 paramedic unit set #: 6364 year released: 1980 piece count: 140 minifigs: 2 list price: unknown well, let me first say that the english name, "paramedic unit" is not really a good name for this set. the function of a paramedic is to take a patient from an emergent situation, and deliver them to a hospital for treatment, generally an emergency room. this is a rather small "clinic" that i would imagine is more for family care than an emergency room. in addition, the car looks more like a doctor/nurse's car rather than an ambulance or emergency response vehicle. i would call this a "clinic" rather than a paramedic unit. in any case, it's a great set, esp. for table towns that need medical services. what i like is that this set is small enough to place anywhere in your lego city or town. starting with the instructions: like all the classic town sets, alternate models are pictured, although i never tried building one: i like the little medical bus/van. the set includes two minifigs, that include a female doctore or nurse, and what i presume is a patient, based on the torsos: i really like the vehicle. it's a 4-stud wide two seater: the colors work well and i like the use of the white bar between the seats (and the 1x1 blue plates for lights). unfortunately, the emblems are stickers. here's a shot of the neat little "clinic": i like the use of the blinds for the exam room. it shows that lego considered patient privacy when making this set. the interior includes an exam room, desk, and two blue swivel chairs: and a neat little eye chart: although the letters l e g o would have made a nice touch. lastly, a picture of the complete set: i must admit that i remember buying this set back in the 80s and i regreted it after taking it home. i'm not sure what i didn't like about it (perhaps the "girl" back then), but now i really think it's a neat set. well, there's a line of patients waiting to have their eyes checked... comments welcome.

3 thanks a lot for the review, brickster! i never had the chance to get some classic town sets, but i wish i couldve! i just wonder why lego cant release sets like this anymore....

3 thanks! i own this set...! it was a good time as tlg released a lot of little buildings. (just look through the 63xx-setnumbers)

4 paramedic unit, does not seem to suit well for this set's name. it should be named as clinic, outpatient treatment, family doctor and etc. from what i understand, parmedic unit, is a stand-alone unit, that is on standby, 24/7, ready for any emergency rescue in lego town. ambulance, with a group of paramedics will be ideal for this kind of situation. i love female doctors, especially with that lovely hairpiece! the cruiser, is a neat 4-studs wide design. just love these small car designs back then. i wonder what can be used at the back of its boot. the clinic is neat. maybe, we can send holodoc for some medical audit, to make sure that this clinic is up to standard. what surprised me the most, is the neat little eye chart. you don't see such details in any regular lego set. the red and white color combination for the building, works well for me. most of the hospital buildings and vehicles, always revolved in red and white. i gave this a "4" thanks you so much, brickster!

3 i just can't believe someone would rate this set a 1. it appears to be a trend among these classic reviews, never with a comment of why.

3 people giving this "1"? g... i'd give it a "4". i'd give it a "3" but added a point out of nostalgia... i think it's a nice town set from the old days. the only problem i always had is the lack of an ambulance... and we got a female doctor! :-)

4 brickster strikes again with another awesome review! ah, one of the few hospital related kits lego made. wasn't this the first hospital with modern minifigs? (because i seem to remember seeing an even older hospital online that had the armless, faceless figs). regardless, this would be great as a little doctor's office in someone's town layout - although the vehicle is a little silly. and that eye chart sticker has to be the coolest decal ever. quote maybe a tfol... well, it sure isn't me. i personally love older kits, even though i'm only a teen. i like a lot of the newer sets a bit more than some of the classic stuff, but i have always agreed that the 70's and 80's were an extremely high point in lego's time (even though i don't really own any kits from the period) edited by grevious, 19 july 2008 - 05:05 pm.

4 thank you for all these reviews, thebrickster! and: the idea with the polls is a very nice and interesting idea. (it will only take a while until i will have commented on all - so please give me some time. ) i gave this set a four: the vehicle, the minfigs and the design of the house are excellent - only the interior could be a bit spiced up (telephone, some other equipment). klaus-dieter

3 whitefang, on jul 18 2008, 09:11 pm, said: paramedic unit, does not seem to suit well for this set's name. it should be named as clinic, outpatient treatment, family doctor and etc. the definition of a paramedic is "...someone who assists physicians in providing medical care..." i think in more modern times a paramedic is generally thought of as a more qualified and experienced ambulance technician but the dictionary definition would seem to fit with the lego model quite well. cheers rog

3 wow! old thread. just for the record, so long as it is here. paramedic's are advanced ambulance technicians. unlike standard emt's they are trained for advanced cardiac life support. they can push drugs, defibrillate, place a breathing tube etc. in the 1980's when the set was made, it was quite common for paramedics to respond to calls in "fly cars" or special response units. they would join up with ambulances at the scenes that required their skills. if you ever watched the old american tv show "emergency", johnny gage and squad 51 were one of these response units. they were mostly phased out in the 90's in favor of simply putting the paramedics and als gear in the ambulances.

3 indeed they have; they've appeared in 15 different sets, in total. they also have an identical width with the wide 2x2 wheels holder which is used on cars today. they are still excellent today, since retrofitting these suspension parts onto today's off-roader trucks won't give them weird proportions or any problems, and it looks perfect. plus they are useful if you're lazy and don't feel like constructing the pin-suspension used in the early 90's for truck-trailers, altough stability probably will suffer.

4 4/5. i've had this set since i was young. never understood why a tow truck needed to be an off-roader; maybe it was used to tow the other off-road vehicles. the suspension made the truck too tall to tow some cars, so i often took the hook out and use the truck as just an great off-road truck like 6672 (which also had the suspension wheels). other tow truck sets better filled their roles better, but that doesn't diminish this set at all. whitefang, on jul 18 2008, 09:19 am, said: i think it looks really out of proportion. no, for 25-odd years this vehicle was perfectly proportioned with all others in the town/city line. it's all these new 6 and 8 and 20 wide vehicles that are ignoring convention and making it look out of proportion. granted speed racer sets are more of their own line, but 6660 is smaller than most of the cars produced in the last few years.

4 cool set i really loved the classic town sets. this set has lots of detail, great reveiw. do you know what is exxon?

3 nice it's like an alternative to the shell petrol company sets we had over here in the uk. (or did you have them to?) edited by skipper 24, 19 july 2008 - 04:21 pm.

3 i much prefer the shell version of that station which had the full awning over the roadway, and the special road plate with the extra lane to pull into to fill 'er up...

4 great review of a classic set. man, this is sure a wondeful kit, even today. the level of detail is astounding for the time, and the whole kit is really cute. you know, i honestly don't get why some people have complained about the city gas station's figure count - the majority of lego gas stations had no more than three figures - including this one and the wonderful gas and wash express (which i actually own!). i also don't get why people complain about the stickers so much - because even older kits often had a lot. personally, i think stickers are okay, because printed pieces can't be used in as many places if the stickers are really specialized.

4 excellent review, it's nice to see review of old sets that i don't own i hope to see many more. was this released under the esso name int the uk?

3 thanks guys! the review wonb't be until tommorow, but to hold you guys in suspense...

4 can't wait, ~vbbn~. i probably won't buy it, but it'll be nice to see a review. well, the awesome mars mission set was matched with an awesome review! good job ! edited by adam, 21 july 2008 - 02:25 am.

4 skipper 24, on jul 20 2008, 04:21 am, said: i don't know why but i think it looks a bit like the star wars at-te. could it be that it's really big (mini-fig scaled) and walks on 4 legs? anyway, i don't normally like it when people make a topic to say they'll review a set soon, but i'll let you off since this is one of the few mars mission sets i really like, and i'm glad to know somebody has the set and will be reviewing it. ~peace

4 today i'm gonna review the bigger of the 2 castles from the fright knigh theme. i got this one last week at a pretty fair prive at ebay, new and still sealed. i love opening boxes that had been lying arounf for years and being the first to build an old set. since i know this castle theme is not liked so much by the general public, i'll try here and change their minds, cause i really think this is a great set. this time i have to say my pictures turned out pretty amazing, even if i am still using just my cellphone cam, but i'm really pleased now with the quality. here we go! set nr.: 6097 name: night lord's castle number of minifigs: 7 number of pieces: 598 release year: 1997 let's start with a few box & instructions pictures: the inside od the box, with a few alternate models: the back, with another possibility how to assemble the 3 main parts: instructions: next, the 6 minifigs, starting with the witch on her black dragon: all 5 figures of the fright section: and the poor royal knight: we go on with the set itself, first a general overview (it's really high!): on the "first floor" there's a trap with which you can drop stones or other things down on unliked guests, the pot comes originally from fabuland i think, i love this thing: in the same floor there is a second trap, if you pull the bar, the door opens: we move on to the tower itself (did i mention it's really high?), on the ground level there's the place for the witch to do her spells: the wall is a secret door, which reveals a skeleton when turned over: on the next level there is this little thingy, first it only seems like a barrel.... ...but when you pull the two 1x4 tiles on the back, a skull is being revealed, scary, huh : i don't really understand what this is for but i assume it's a telescope to watch and observate the dragons, i do find that a bit senseless since there haven't been telescopes in medieval times (or have there been): the back of the tower with the prison and the room for the treasure chest: the prison opened. it's secured with a chain, which i like very much cause you really can lock it with that: treasure chest: from the highest peak we now go down to the very ground level, at the back of the castle there is another secret wall-door, flanked by two shields: at the back half of the inside there is the throne hall for the bat lord, with a nice warm fireplace in the back (this is, where the secret door is placed): the second half is pretty empty, except for these two baskets. i don't know exactly what they are for, but i ike the idea for using them as water places for the horses: one thing that might be a bit stupid is that 2 of the 4 side entrances do not have doors, so they are open and a guard would have to stand there the whole day. you can see it in his face he isn't very happy with that : that was my last review of the sets i got the last weeks, but i'm looking forward to make much more in the future. overall this is a pretty good set, i don't know any other one with so much details and playability. the minus point is, as already said, that it is too open on the sides, but that can be solved easily with a bit of modding. also i must say, this set isn't that much juniorized as many might have thought, though the design is a bit unconventional, but exactly that's what i like most about it. all in all it gets a 9/10 for me hope you enjoyed the reading and the pictures, can't wait to see your response. edit: oops, i forgot to put one figure of the fright knight faction on the photo, but it's the one in the last picture. edited by kimt, 10 august 2008 - 01:28 pm.

4 i have this set, and ilike it! 6097 have many usefull parts! greate review!

3 metalandi, thanks for doing this fright knights review, by opening up a misb set which you have bought recently. i am very sure the feeling is very nice, especially touching the bricks which is preserved for 11 years sealed in bags. i am quite fond of the fright knights theme. unfortunately, this theme was released during my dark age. i never really bought sets from fright knights. instead, i bought plenty of minifigs to build an army. if i could turn back time or find another misb set with a reasonable price, i am very sure i will get it. my soldiers need a castle to stay in. i will be looking forward to your next review. keep up the good job

4 sandy, on aug 5 2008, 06:21 pm, said: my first post in this topic looks foolish now that i bought this set from ebay. i just really wanted the minifigs (although i already had the batlord and the black dragon) and the parts. they will help me greatly in building the impenetrable fortress of the dragonwarriors for my princess quest comic. by the end of this week, this set will be in my clutches! great! can't wait for the next installment! good review, the pieces are so shiny and new... all my space sets aren't shiny... or new... this is an excellent castle, i got it the day it came out, it has a lot of playability.

4 good review - the photo from above shows off the scale of the castle much better than the box photo. i was one of those who always thought this set looked lame, ever since first seeing it in the catalogue. a couple of my siblings had smaller bat lord/fright knight sets and enjoyed the accessories and style of the minifigs etc. so last year having not only ended my dark ages, but done so for some of the rest of my family, i got this set off ebay for my sister for christmas. i of course had to build it to make sure all parts were there before leaving ebay feedback and ending the transaction. first impressions were of how much brick there was to the set, as well as really useful large structural elements. and to be honest, while perhaps a bit childish, there's no doubt the style of the minifigs is kinda cute and useful for customs. it was really enjoyable building this set, and the scale is impressive when built, empty spaces notwithstanding (but hey, lego has always had buildings with no back, etc. - just use your imagination and enjoy the access to playspace offered). the traps etc. are neat and more like the kind of "action features" modern sets come with (i for one am in favour of these, for kids they are fun and i think for builders they give ideas cause they are often done with minimal parts or impact on the set design). anyways, needless to say my sister loved the set. indeed she's currently rebuilding it for the second time. if i see it as cheap again, i will pick up one for myself. i got the first one at €30 incl postage i believe.

4 quite the topic bump, but dang, what a cool set, and so tall. this is the kind of sets i had as a kid, but i don't remember this one. i'm jealous.s

4 a 5/5. the set is beautiful, both the remake and the original. a classic and a beautiful thing, like dos. edited by maiq the liar, 20 july 2008 - 09:45 pm.

4 i have a slightly different version of this set, and i must say it is great! boy to these reviews bring back memories, thanks!

4 great review. i love tis set too, the best firestation ever made by lego. mainly because the '80s sets are the favourite with me. only i miss a helicopterplatvorm, well i made a little modification:

3 great review of a great set! sadly, i don't own it. as for the alternate building idea's on the back of every box - yes, i miss that as well! i really miss it!

3 holodoc, on jul 21 2008, 07:16 am, said: i gave it a "4". there is always room for improvement, like the helipad mentioned. so it can´t be a "5" in my opinion. take off you rose coloured glasses. you're a tough reviewer!

4 great review, great set. nice look, great features, very playable.

1 a nice little model with some neat features for it's age plus the all-yime classic fireman as a bonus. however, this design of chopper (the police station around the same time was the same design) i think dated very quickly. while is was good to use the hinged car roof - which was relatively new at the time - together with the inverted screen it was superceded very quickly by designs that stood the test of time far better (for example 6657). also, i don't think i could everbuy a lego fire helicopter because it is not something we have in the uk/eire. police, coast guard, ambulance, military, etc, etc but no fire helicopters. not something i would therefore want in my lego town. great review though. many thanks again for doing these. cheers rog

3 well its ok but its not great voted 3 seems the classic town hater has voted a 1 again!!!! will the madness ever stop!?!

4 i vote outstanding because it makes excellent use of the pieces that were available at the time. that cockpit makes excellent use of an inverted windshield.

4 i owned this set, and i loved it. great idea to have the reversed windshield.

4 a truly great set. i always loved the mobile crane and was gobsmacked when this popped up using some of the great features from the crane but also making it an emergency vehicle too! great classic firemen and - in your version - a suspiciously blue fire extinguisher great review of a great set - just a pity i no longer have it... so many sets i used to have got lost during the period at the end of my childhood before i rescued what was left from my dad's house once i realised what i had left behind!! hindsight is a great thing?? cheers again rog

3 a great review, i like this set it captures the classic town feeling well, and the ladder is cool! i can't help but feel thought that these reviews are being churned out to quickly, you should leave a gap, i am being flooded with all these great reviews!

4 thanks for the review. this set was outstanding for its time with all the features and detail. the extending basket is just wonderful. however, i honestly wouldn't consider it the best firetruck ever. i actually like the one from 2005 even better - becasue like most of the city vehicles, it adds the needed bulk big engines like fire trucks need. many of the older kits, while awesome, were honestly a little too skinny imo.

4 guys, thanks for all your great comments! nikola bathory, on jul 22 2008, 06:57 pm, said: it offers very good playability and this ladder is so long! you can have so much fun with it. yes, the "extended length" of the ladder provides great playability! klaus-dieter, on jul 25 2008, 03:01 am, said: i like it much more than the new one from 2007 since it's not that big and juniorized. thanks k.d. i owned the 2007 fire engine as well, as this set was not restored back then, and i needed a fire engine very badly. i managed to restored it somehow, and i compared it with the 2007. the older design is still the best. osakana, on jul 25 2008, 04:03 am, said: great set. i found only one major fail - this - the hands of robot arms gets easly broken. yes, this is an interesting finding. i remembered when i was a child. that robot arms always come out of its own, when i fiddle with it. i was so annoyed by it and i just kept it there whenever i deployed it for rescue missions. grevious, on jul 26 2008, 02:00 am, said: however, i honestly wouldn't consider it the best firetruck ever. i actually like the one from 2005 even better - becasue like most of the city vehicles, it adds the needed bulk big engines like fire trucks need. many of the older kits, while awesome, were honestly a little too skinny imo. grevious, i appericate your honest comments, and given me your insight towards this set, and state a comparison as well. i agreed with you, that fire engines need to be big and sturdy. on the other hand, it can be nice to have the fire engine to look slim as well, to cut through the traffic easily. i am not against with the newer sets. it just that, part of the reasons which reflected in the review had fufill the basic key factors of a typical fire engine. in addition, it was my all-time favourite under the "fire-fighting" theme.

4 one of my all time favourite i still love it even after all these years, though it did always seem a bit out of place as when i was a child i’d never seen a similar looking fire appliance in the uk.

4 7676: republic attack gunship number of pieces: 1034 number of minifigs: 5 price: 119.99 usd brickset hey everyone, i just got the rgs yesterday at tru after i came home from camp. i saw all of the topics that i missed, and noticed a mini-review and a review with one pic, so i thought i'd make a huge, shiny new review that has lots of pictures and all of the requirements of kimt's index. note: i did not apply any stickers to it, as a personal liking. so, lets start by looking at the box: a shiny, clean, and futuristic box, quite different from the other star wars box designs before this. there was so much clone wars merchandise with this font and design in the huge display at the front of my local toys r us store, and not just lego. it so beautiful, with the white and sky blue... anyways, for some reason, the boxes of the new clone wars sets seemed more shiny than usual. maybe it's because they were just shipped, but once you pick up the boxes, they will feel really good in your hands, despite the fact that only about half of the space in the boxes are used... the back of the box: the back shows all of the main features of the set, plus pictures of the three other clone wars sets meant to be released alongside this one (although i did spot the twilight and homing spider droid, which were supposed to be released in september or october). so, on to the gunship: built straight from the bags. it took me about 4 1/2 hours, with breaks. it has an overall great design, but somewhat fragile, especially when building it. the cockpits always fall apart when opened, as well as the bubbles on the wings (which i will get into more later). the color scheme is very well done. you can always find the piece you're looking for thanks to the color diversity: red, dark red, lime green (ooh!), blue, black, tan, light bley, dark grey, yellow and white. also, split down the middle vertically, the ship is almost all symmetrical. front: side: now, lets start with the many features that this set is hiding. the front has lots of lime green, a rare color. but more importantly: ...a rotating gun is found on each side. they rotate in a pretty wide range, although fragile. cockpits: there are two main cockpits, right next to each other. not very detailed, and are the same. and for some reason, the whole cockpit element flips up to reveal: ...nothing. just the skeleton of the ship. probe droid storage: above the cockpit lies a plate that can be flipped up to reveal a storage area that holds: two of these probe droids. at least, that's what i think they are. hull: in this pic, two features are hidden. mobile command center: the first of the two is a mobile command center, but essentially just a hover chair. it is found by flipping up the two panels on either side of the hull. bacta tank: the second is the bacta tank found by just sliding it out of the storage area behind the mcc. one half of the tank opens: ...so a minifigure can go inside and heal his/her wounds obtained in battle. cargo hold: now, this is probably the main feature for this set. the two sliding doors (two on each side) slide open thanks to a clever technic mechanism. not much in here, just a gun holder and a place where the passengers wait to be dropped off in battle. speeder bike: i guess you guys saw it, the speeder bike. it is found by opening the rear flap. the bike is very cleverly designed by using a brown trike body. it's only a few centimeters shorter than the bike found in the clone battle pack. rear gun: just a gun similar to the front ones. engines: huge engines (or are they cannons?) that are really fun to build. they really give that cartoon feel to this set. missiles: in between the engines are two sets of four flick-fire missiles. bubble cockpits: there is one bubble cockpit on each wing that supposedly control the turrets at the front. very fragile. storage containers: two storage containers on each side hold the clone accessories. but, i wouldn't recommend putting them in there, because the antennae can fall out, or you might forget about them. sticker sheet: the dreaded sticker sheet (dss) has all of the stickers you need for this set. unfortunately, mine was crunched up. i don't like stickers much anyways, but i might still apply some. note the republic symbol stickers, why couldn't tlg just use that printed piece from a few years back? also, you get to choose between a bird-rat thing or a sleeping twi'elk as your hull decal. what they're for, i don't know, looks like the movie or show will explain it though. minifigs: finally, the five minifigs of this set. they are all great figs, including: commander cody: amazing, especially with the gear. the orange is nice, but i thought he was yellow. clone trooper: again, amazing. the gear is great, and the new helmet and torso are great! all of the clones in the clone wars line have the same heads. also, you can see the flesh beneath the helmet. asaaj ventress: not so happy about this one. the torso and dark blue legs are cool, but the dress is pretty ugly. the head is alright, but could do without the cartoon-y face (yeah i know, its from a cartoon). also has purple markings on back of head. obi-wan kenobi: pretty cool, besides the face. cool hair and torso, though. plo koon: beautiful! the true gem of this set, in my opinion. the head is the same material as kit fisto's. and the tosro is awesome, good for making a custom ki-adi mundi. well, that's about it, here is the... final verdict: build: 8/10, very fun and easy, should take the seasoned builder about 4 hours. somewhat fragile. playability: 9.5/10, lots of fun features, although some can break easily. swooshability: 3/10, i wouldn't recommend flying it around much, as you can barely pick it up safely. but with two hands gripping the bottom firmly, it can be moved around, but not spun or swooshed, etc. minifigs: 8/10, all very great figs, especially plo koon, but could have included more clone troopers. design: 7.5/10, some excellent ideas included in here, although some spots are very fragile. price: 7/10: should have been only 100 usd if not for the new molds. plus, at tru, it was 130 usd. overall score: 8.5/10, a great set to have for your star wars/ clone wars collection, with some flaws. save up for this one. so, how did you like my review? your feedback is much appreciated! jimbutcher, out. edited by jimbutcher, 15 september 2008 - 03:06 am. indexed

3 can't wait my friend!

3 good... but you said that you thought that cody was orange, but he turned out to be orange?

3 what's this thing on the clone at right ??

3 ah yeah, sorry ! of course ! i see. thanks.

3 thanks for all the feedback so far, guys! i meant yellow for cody's color.

4 jimbutcher, finally i had seen something that is worth reading and viewing. imho, this is your best star wars review i had ever read. most importantly, it is a complete review which has substance. you have my thanks! keep up the good job back to the rgs, this is the next star wars set i will be getting. i can't wait to lay my hands on this set, and start building. basically, how bad this set can be, it can't be worse. republic gunship is one of the all-time favourites, in star wars prequel and ot. i can't find any faults, except being too expensive due to the licence cost. in addition, the mini-figs are the next big thing. seriously, i am quite impressed with it. on the down side, my rating will go up if there is an additional clone trooper instead of one. nevertheless, this is a "must get" set, no matter what!

3 thanks for the positive comments everyone i’d noticed that although much discussed, no-one on eurobricks had written a comprehensive review for it. i thought this set more than deserved one! i’ve just posted my newest review of the dwarves' mine defender here: http://www.eurobrick...showtopic=19931

4 when i first saw this topic, i thought, "oh, great, another review of this set..." however i'm glad you posted it now, your pics are great and, well, it was just a generally good review! i'm looking forward to seeing more... ~peace

4 thanks for the review! from this set, i prefer the crown knight's tower - it's a very good-looking structure!

4 whitefang, on jul 30 2008, 12:56 am, said: pedro, for your first review, you have amaze me with your photo session and the strucutre of your review. i am very impressed by your high quality pictures. you have done an excellent job! i completely agree. this is an amazing review - bits of humor, great photography, and detailed descriptions/photos. based upon this review i've placed an order for this set (along with some convincing from amazon's 20% sale ). the only drawbacks in this set that i can see concerns the tower with it being 1) small compared to the seige tower and 2) missing a few walls. however, this is also the joy of lego as one can simply purchase a few bricks and build their own walls and/or expand the tower's size (or even attach it to a castle). of course, this increases the price of the set, but considering how cheap bricks are on bricklink, tower raid is still a very good value. i hope you continue doing reviews, pedro.

4 nice short review, although a little hard to read. i agree that this set is a really great one.

4 i picked this up last weekend, mainly also for parts. it came with two mutt heads instead of a irena head. :( but anyway, it's a nice little $10 set...we need more sets like this that include these myriads of "detail" parts.

3 shoc, on jul 29 2008, 04:20 am, said: hello again! wow, this really is an in depth review! at first when i pictures of the set i thought... "yeah, kinda boring." but after reading your review, i think i might buy it (when it's cheaper). the pieces look very good, and i love the droids and their accesories! thanks for the review! also, awesomestar, i knwo it is a default thingy but it would be good if the quote was taken out of your post as it does clutter up the topic (or "yopic" as dsr calls it). your welcome! glad to help! also, "yopic" has been fixed, thanks for pointing it out! dsr

4 nice review! i probably wont get it, since i dont like ships much, but maybe ill order a magn guard from somewhere. "here's my card." jifel

4 fantastic review! it's very in-depth and i love it. i hope we'll see more reviews from you

4 thanks for the review! nice job! and speaking of in-depth reviews, my ultra drill walker review was very in depth..two brickshelf pages.

4 i've got to go with the town one, since you have to stand on the dino one. steve

4 i like the dino thingy because of the pieces and the dino is a lot of fun on its own (i know, thats akward)...

4 the rancor, on aug 2 2008, 09:39 am, said: i wish i had that but i'll have to make do with the much less violent european version (dino '2010' not 'attack') here's a comaprison... european version: usa etc. version: there's a subtle difference, but i prefer the us one i did not know that europe had a different quad (or at least one without the bazooka). interesting that the gun was removed from the european sets, or added to the us sets. i sort of like the chain. i also notice a big difference in the boxart. destroyed city to prehistoric volcano. i wonder if the story was different as well? thanks for sharing a good picture. ----------------------------------------- well, it does look like the dino quad has the upper hand; almost double the votes.

4 dino attack quad for me. no, this isn't because i own it and not the other one, but because i think just about everything is better in it - the design is better, the colors are cooler, and it has a better figure. i don't like the figure in the coast guard quad at all - but since it was from world city, i'm not suprised. i also kinda like the dino, actually. it's flexible and fits in with the previous dinos a lot better than the cruddy bigger ones with bright red, yellow, and green highlights.

4 ooooooh! this is a very hard choice,i like this new coast guard theme but i loved! dino attack.the dino attack set has a weird looking gun,but imo the coast guard set looks.........cleaner if you get what i mean.the little dino/lizard thing is practically worthless (thats why i have a bin full of those little guys).i want to keep liking dino attack i just can't.so i know your like "just get to the point already!" so i guess i have to go with coast guard. thebrickster, on aug 3 2008, 09:41 am, said: i did not know that europe had a different quad (or at least one without the bazooka). interesting that the gun was removed from the european sets, or added to the us sets. i sort of like the chain. i also notice a big difference in the boxart. destroyed city to prehistoric volcano. i wonder if the story was different as well? thanks for sharing a good picture. ----------------------------------------- well, it does look like the dino quad has the upper hand; almost double the votes. wow i would have so much wanted the european one more than the us one, i mean that bazooka or as they called it a "sonic screamer" looks very silly

1 nice review , for portugal it costs 60€. i also consider it oversized, it shold be the third of that size... portugal and spain may have good prices but 90€ for the v-19 must be a tippo.

4 thanks for the review! i think this is my favourite clone wars set, behind the republic gunship.

3 deinonychus, on aug 1 2008, 08:06 pm, said: one question... do the top panels on the rotating rocket assembly mounted in the skids pop off regularly when you flip them back and forth? the ones on the version i built from the instructions posted online seem to eject with the slightest provocation they do fall off from time to time, but not as easily as you describe. skipper 24, on aug 1 2008, 08:13 pm, said: i'll probably get this in hong kong where lego is cheap next time i go there to visit my relatives. also pretty nice review, a few more pics couldn't hurt. also are there just two of the same white control computers for the controls? that's what it looks like in the instructions. yes. its two identical white slopes decorated with computer screens.

4 nice review, thanks for taking the time to share your thoughts. looks like a really nice set and i'll be picking it up eventually when it makes it to the us.

1 thank you for the first ever review of the fighter tank. i like this set and every features it offers. but i think that the engine could have a better look than just four green cylinders in a grey piece.

4 this and the at-te and the spider tank and maybe the droid gunship are the few clone wars sets i'll buy. i loved playing as this tank in the clone wars video game( even better with cheat codes for extra missile spam ), so this is a must get.

1 thanks for posting the review, i’ve been wondering about this set. to me it does feel a bit fig light, for £50 i’d expect maybe one or two more clones. i’m not to sure about the oversized issue, it seems to me it’s better to have something a bit to large and have a better level or features than something smaller will less.

4 im definatly gonna get the atte. im thinking about getting the spider droid and fighter tank. i alredy own the older version of the republic gunship (but i still want it) agentrick57, on aug 1 2008, 08:44 pm, said: i loved playing as this tank in the clone wars video game( even better with cheat codes for extra missile spam ) sorry to get off topic... but i own that game! i liked playing as the republic gunship the best!

4 4478 geonosian fighter review parts:169 figs:4 price:?15.00 (i think) here is a review of the amazing geonosian fighter set, it was my first ever star wars lego set! here go's... 1. manual not much here although it's an old style manual cover. random shot. back. 2. general set and minifigs a pic of the entire set, it has 2 reddish tan battle droids geo pilot, geo soldier, geo star fighter and geo turret. the 4 figs, the droids come with backpacks. geo soldier. i prefer this gun. give him a cane to become poggle the lesser the geo leader. detailed legs are always nice. the bodies are a little fat for geonosians i guess but nice printing on them. the head. the wings. 1. 2. 3. voila! all done 3. the star fighter it has a landing gear type thing. the detail on those plates. the pilot in the cockpit. cockpit with canopy. 1 of 2 ball joint things, this is the engine. 2nd ball joint which is the front gun. 4. the turret the turret by itself. turret with the soldier. a printed round plate. 5. overall build: 7/10 a little repetitive but enjoyable. minifigs: 9/10 4 that's pretty good for a set this size. design: 6/10 the fighter dosen't really look right nor does the turret but they are both strong. parts: 8/10 lot's of interesting parts and comes with two of the ball joint things as well the minifig parts being good. price: 10/10 cheap (for the uk) considering the amount of minifigs and parts. playability: 5/10 not much but you can have mini battles with the turret and starfighter. overall: 8/10 i gave it 8 because of the design which was not accurate and the low number of parts. thanks for reading and hope you liked it as much as i did . edited by kimt, 04 august 2008 - 11:42 am. indexed

3 good review. i would get this set, but sadly they don't have it anymore.... i wish they did to get those sweet figs! the battle droid colors are sweet! the only set with geonosians....

3 i wish they made more sets with those colored droids as well. we should have got them with the hailfire droid and dwarf spider set i think. i also just noticed look the ball turret on the manual there's no markings on it.

4 thanks for the review skipper. this is one of my favourite sets. i really like the colour scheme and the geonosians are awesome. keep up the good work kimt

4 this is actually one of my favorite star wars sets. awesome rare pieces, and excellent construction. geo figs are a plus too. best of all, it's nice and cheap.

4 i am fairly confident that something involoving geonosis will be released in 2010 but any way i had this set ( one of my first ones) but i droped the ship and it blew up. i found all the pieces but in never rebuilt the ship. although i still have the figs ant the canon. overall this set was above average in my opinion. great review!!!

4 great review! really shows off the main aspects of the set. wish i had picked up a tie when they were around... dsr

4 thanks for the review. i'll definately get this set sooner or later. imo the tiny turbos are awesome. i actually bought nearly every set so far, built the models, added the stickers and packed them away in zip-lock bags in the attic. sadly i don't have display room for them (yet). a fine set, carwise.. dump the slammers and buildings into the spare bag and keep the cars. kimt tiny turbos on!

4 tiny turbos are good for parts, but i'm not so keen on them as they have no minifig drivers. so, i wasn't sure about this set. but your review has made me like them more, i probably won't buy the set but i appreciate it more. thanks for the review!

4 thanks for the review. this is another good sw set. a true classic. i especially like the colourscheme of this set. the rebel gun is crappy though, but overall the set rocks. kimt

3 there isn't much difference apart form it has stickers on and is grey. also the guns and tow cable gun are different as well as the engines. but if you look at pictures of the hoth base speeder not to much is noticeable.

3 skipper 24, on aug 3 2008, 11:09 pm, said: the minifgs on the box top. they spelt dack's name wrong good set though.

3 kimt, on sep 11 2008, 08:29 pm, said: no they didn't. read this. you'll find the answer close the end of the article. oh, nevermind. thanks!

4 i find myself so stupid i didn't bought this set. it was 30 euro and i thought that it would be for sale after a half year. (it was with earlier sw sets also). nice review.

4 good review, i like it a lot. nice job

3 i had this set (£15 rrp actually ;-)) and agree mostly with your review, although on the wheel bike itself two legs can be placed at the front end and two at the back to enable it to 'roll' properly. boga is very juniorised, and the set itself is very simple and contains many large pieces. the minifigures are good though (i traded my gg however ). just to offer my personal thoughts; build: 5/10 minifigs: 10/10 parts: 3/10 price: 7/10 playability: 10/10 overall 7/10 -- (not an average) tk

1 kimt, on aug 3 2008, 03:22 pm, said: not one of my favourite sw sets. kinda boring and the set is poorly designed imho. we do get the general, but that's not nearly enough. thanks for the reivew and fine pics. kimt gg has a cape...a custom cape!!!!!! what more do you want?

1 personally, i hated that set. i fell apart way to easily and was just not built well.

4 i got the original jsf for christmas, which i might buy and review. wonderful set, the obi in this one is really awesome and it's really just a great ship, sticker free. probably my favourite, i'd fly it if any ship from star wars. maybe i should get it and the slave i from episode ii... after all, i like jango despite having a crap story.

3 good review. i always wanted to know how it was different to the boba fett slave i. i would probably only get this though for jango fett. the newer one looks sturdier and proportioned better imo.

4 outback desert racer g'day mates! today from the legoland's desert down under, i'll be sharing an image review of outback set #6550, desert racer set #: 6550 theme: outback year released: 1997 piece count: 48 minifigs: 1 list price: $4 (usd) starting with an image of the box: and the back side with three alternate models: instructions and decals: the pieces: a side view of the vehicle: diagonal view: one minifig: and the complete set: pros: - price is under $5 ($4 usd retail) - good impulse set - goes well with other outback sets - combination of yellow and green pieces - working doors and liftable top for playability cons: - stickers on doors, hood, and 1x4 tile. no printed pieces - no accessories (a wrench, gas can, and other extras would have added to the set) - no extra tire for blow outs summary: i picked this set up new a number of years ago as a true "impulse buy", after buying one of the larger outback sets (amazon crossing or outback airstrip). it's a neat little addition to the theme with its working doors and playability factor. although i only built it once before today, i would buy again if i had the opportunity. hooroo for now! some good aussie music to leave you with: down under

4 manta, on aug 3 2008, 10:33 am, said: wish it was still around. even though, little sets <$10, like the new coast guard 4wd & jet, and the quad are great little city sets. lego seems to be returning to good quality small sets with their latest city line-up. metalandi, on aug 3 2008, 10:46 am, said: i remember having this set (actually i even still have it, at least the pars are somewhere ) when i was a child, and i used it for making races, as it is there for. you should look for them and resurrect it. it really feels good after you've found all the pieces and put a set back together again (as it was when you first bought it).

3 i hate how the original release had the light-up windu, which was really lame, and one less clone trooper. i bought it when it first came out, so missed out on a good windu and another clone trooper.

3 did your version without the lul mace have trans blue grill things (like the ones on the back of the speeder) ? or was my set a one off.

3 hanks for the price. i got the set a while ago and couldn't remember correctly i have now changed it.

3 skipper 24, on aug 4 2008, 04:04 pm, said: did your version without the lul mace have trans blue grill things (like the ones on the back of the speeder) ? or was my set a one off. i bought mine online, thinking it was the new version but i ended up with that very lame lul fig. i just hate that fig... it's completely useless, we can't use any part of it for anything (although, i only discovered yesterday that the lightsaber blade was a standard one and not glued, as i always believed, so all isn't completely lost) in the end i still was rather disappointed by the set. it's too full of holes ( hum; i think there's kind of a paradox in that sentence...)... but the barc speeder and green clone are indeed fantastic. oh, and yes, mine came with sand blue grill parts instead of the trans-yellow ones... didn't realise it at first, and i spent half an hour cursing, thinking they forgot to put them in the box. but in the end, i don't know if the replacements are any better , since they're supposed to represent some kind of thruster light or something... all in all, i think it's my worst set... not necessarily for the set itself which is ok, but psychologically, there's too many things that went wrong with it...

4 nice review again, skipper. i passed on this one because of the price, but it's a nice set. good for you for getting the newer version with non-lul mace and an extra clone. that purple blade sure is a beauty. the tank itself is alright, just an at-at on wheels, in my opinion. the turret is great, though, and so is the speeder bike. i didn't realize that the jet pack had two "nailguns" (harpoon guns) on it. i thought that the nailgun was a new piece... but the jetpack is very cool.

1 kdog, on aug 5 2008, 04:45 am, said: why would the yellow astronauts freak you out, sinner? is it because they look nekkid? ;-) you bet! but this set is still the most freaky...

3 lol, i don't know what's going on there!

3 erhm... where's the review? it would be nice to have a few pics of the v-19 itself and a few comments on it. could you please add that? kimt

4 thanks for the review, simonjedi. this just re-affirms that the v-19 is my highest priority this fall. behind the rgs, of course. is that new printed piece a 2 x 2 tile? it looks like an excellent detail part for mocing. those black pieces used on the landing gear look very bionicle-like. if they haven't been used before, i'd suspect they will be. not that i'm a bionicle expert or anything. it is a shame that this set only includes one clone. that seems to be the only drawback to the set. everything else looks spot on.

4 the v-19 was my first tcw set. i buyed it, when i was visiting my father. i just wanted to build it there, and i do so. but how do you will get sth.big like this with in the train?? so i had to destroy him. when i was still home again, i had to build it 3 times, because the mechanic dont works i only can say that the v-19 is one of the best tcw sets. thanks to you for the review simonjedi , i just wanted to make one in german. but now i needn`t to make it

3 pedro, on aug 5 2008, 12:29 pm, said: it looks pretty big compared to other starfighters too. did it take a long time to build? it took me 3 and a bit hours to build it, although i had some problems with the technic and i had to take pictures during the build.

4 thanks for this excellent review simonjedi . this looks like an awesome set and this is the set i am most looking foward just as well as the separatist spider droid (7681) .

3 rayman, on oct 4 2008, 11:11 pm, said: hydraulic wings! i am very impressed and am now considering getting this set purely because of this funciton. i am just curious as to know why are there sand green parts on the bottom of the v-19. is it visible when the model is completed? i am also pleased to see tlc giving us a printed cockpit computer this time around. while i do like the functions and they way it is built, i cannot get into this model. first the price is a bit steep. i know all the cw sets are expensive but this one just seems more so to me. i mean there is only 1 fig in here. second to me, there is no playability or display-ability. i gave below average.

1 i built mine today. as soon as i tried to put it in attack position, the thingy rotates the wrong way and it falls apart. what a waste of $55

3 ah, i wish modern trains had 11 figs... but seriously, why is there a civilian train stop in a cave?! did 1 too many people get lost playing zork? edited by maiq the liar, 04 august 2008 - 10:21 pm.

4 outstanding train set. the legend of the entire train series, is the metroliner. this is a "super 5" set. the color, design, minifigs is just so perfect and lovely. it resemble the trains which we see on our rails in our daily life. i can't find any flaws on this at all. the only flaw i noticed is my mistake of not able to buy this set at all. in fact, i had never seen this set in the shops before in my entire life. thebrickster, on aug 5 2008, 09:23 am, said: how cool is that? and 11 minifigs - when was the last time lego included 11 figs in a single set? there is another set fufil the criteria above, which is also a well known legend. it has 12 minifigs which is the 10159 city airport aka century skyway airport.

4 nice review i collect all metroliner i can, i have 3 metroliner and when i can, i buy a other . my aim : have the more big metroliner collect, in france ( in first time ) it's my favorite set

4 really nice train, i always wished tlg would have made the passenger ir train longer and maybe used some of the nice features of this train, i still love that faucet piece.

4 this is a great review of a great set, hairy ruben! i voted for outstanding since the only thing you can say about this train set is that it is outstanding. it has been the best passenger train in all the time from lego's beginning on until now. i bought the rereleased version of it in 2003 - and i really, really do not regret it! klaus-dieter

3 i don't like the set and i do like the set. the reason why i like it: it looks good. the reason why i hate it: this train was the first train for the new 9v system and it means to me the end of the beautiful 12v series. for this last reason i own this set. i voted average. only strange they named it metroliner. in holland when we speak of a metro, i need to think at short distance trains only used in big cities like rotterdam. and your minifigs at pic ain't right according the instruction .

3 well it makes the latest trains look crap.

3 skinny boy, on aug 5 2008, 01:51 am, said: cool review. i actually have two of these. i got one for christmas when it was rereleased in 2003 and another one in a charity shop a few months later for €5. i love the minifigs even if they all have smileys, and having two sets of them can really fill up a town. 5euro! wow i didn't know charity shops sold lego. i'm in dublin, is the shop near me? you check out charity shops often or you just happened to come across it?

4 i never got this set i spent a long time after one christmas trying to get and failed miserably, admittedly i was much younger then. it has however remained one of my most sought after items but i’ve still never got around to getting one. the set generally makes me rather nostalgic for a time when the trains were painted in simple liveries like that one! anyway it seems an excellent set from what i’ve seen and the figure selection is amazing. i hope lego produce something as good as this when the new trains are released next year.

4 i got my indy exclusive in the mail today. packaging front: back: instructions: mini-figs this set comes with 1 mini-fig, the standard indy with hat and whip-no satchel: the build i am really happy with the amount of frown headlight bricks that come with this set. 12 in all: the mudguards are cleverly built with 1 x 2 panels and 1 x 1 panel corners in dark green. in the first 2 pages of the instructions, there are a lot of great pieces. this set would sell like mad if it were released for sale. parts monkeys alone would go insane buying these up for the dark green and frown pieces: the body of the car consists of black plates, brackets and modified bricks with curved tops that allow the dark green mudguards to just peak out. cool technique: the grill looks cool using only six pieces. i wish all small sets were this unique and cool: here's the completed jeep. it looks a little small for an actual jeep, but for a brickmaster set, it's awesome, imo: some more detail shots of the set with indy in the driver's seat: i hope they take brickmaster exclusives overseas because it'd be awesome if everybody could get these. my buddy copmike would probably love to be the first to review this set, so i've dedicated my review comic to him: my rating playability: 8/10 (you need to add some other sets and characters to really play with this set) design: 9/10 (great techniques and inclusion of rare parts, but loses a point for being an unrealistic size for a jeep) price: 10/10 (part of the brickmaster package, it is a reasonable prize for an exclusive set and everything else that comes with the subscription) overall: 9/10 (great, but not perfect and definitely needs to be offered overseas. lego would make a ton of money releasing this for sale, imo as it really is a terrific small set.)

4 super review, thanks. simply put, i'd have to admit this is one of the best indy sets. and in such a small package. it's a very detailed lil' jeep, and that's why i like it. i have this too, but i don't want to open it since it's exclusive. wait, i thought we were calling it "rown" and not "frown"

4 outstanding set and review, thanks for presenting it! i've had this since it first came out, but didn't think it would be that impressive, so i didn't bother opening it. now, i'm tempted. aside from the slight size issue, i can't find anything here to gripe about, except for the limited availability. i want 5. i think that makes me a parts monkey. eek eek. you're exactly right about this selling like mad. it's another one of those missed opportunities for tlg. sure, it's nice to get people to subscribe by offering it as part of brickmaster, but in the long run, put it in the stores for $6 and sell a million. just give us indy's manbag, we need it for postal employees and such. as is the running joke whenever i comment on one of your reviews, i'd give this a solid 985. not out of anything, just 985. or, in clearer terms: + 1/2 (though i voted 5)

4 nice review! i would like to get this set... unfortunately i don't get brickmaster mag, and the prices on bl/ ebay will most likely be ridiculous. i wonder why indy doesn't come with his murse (man purse) in this set? thats the best part of the fig. the jeep itself is very nice, especially with the dark green. by the way, what is frown? brownish... something, i guess. oh yeah, and funny comic.

1 i voted below average since i'm not a big fan of classic space.

4 thanks for this review, if you'd only know what memories you brought back! i think i remember this set better than any other i had, when i was a child. some time after i got it, i decided to disassemble it and combine it with the jeep from 6552 rocky river retreat. it came out pretty good, though. as it became the main attraction point of my town (beeing the car of my favourite minifig back then, and, and, and... looong story ), i kept it assembled that way from this day on until earlier this year, when i finally disassembled it because i needed the parts. edited by metalandi, 06 august 2008 - 03:57 am.

3 thebrickster, on aug 7 2008, 04:06 pm, said: at leat you were able to pick up two of the sets. do you still have them and/or the pieces? yes, i have the parts, the manuals, and even one of the boxes. unforutunaltey, the parts are mixed in a big pile of parts, as i never had any time to sort out my parts. you can see i used the yellow doors here, decals applied. the great thing about the copter was it had 2 suitcases, which as far as i can tell ain't a common part, not rare, but still nice to have. and it had the guy with the green jacket. the winch wasn't bad either, the only flaw was it was a "standard" lego copter, meaning similar ones where avalible in quite a few sets. do you plan to review it? staudie.

4 nice review. this set looked very nice for it's time.

4 very interesting indeed! i especially like the folding ladder. i never thought of making such a clever function. i might have to use it in my future lego models. another great reveiw bloody jay! ;)

4 tks for the review once more jay ;) i totally agree with you jay !!! this set has very nice details suche as the mini gun, movable ladder, green barrels and great figs !!!! however, it is very expensive for what it is and i don't think there are that many very usefall parts in there !!!! (well, i could use those treads !!!). if i ever buy this set, its really not for the design, which i totally dislike...

4 thanks for the reviews once again. it looks like qite a nice set to me, although the european version will lose the big gun. i like some of the stickers (although i wish they were printed), and i actually quite like the dinosaur. i probably won't get it though, the set i'm most likely to get is the fire hammer.

1 quote i would easily pay $30 for this, no questions asked. but $40 was a hard sell for me is it easier for you to "eat" if you know that this would cost you around $60 if you live in denmark :|

4 nice review cobra. thanks for sharing. i think arctic was one of those neat themes that never really took off. i like these little poly-bag sets as they make great starters/introduction sets for themes (or) serve as a nice supplement or add/on to an existing collection. i've always liked the thick green hood piece used in the arctic theme and have thought about using it in a sw hoth scene. in any case, nice review! i've got an arctic set that i built recently and will share a review soon.

4 so it comes with an extra gun-holding arm? it looks like it, and that's great. that way you can make all of the droids gun-totting ones.

3 kimt, on aug 8 2008, 06:22 am, said: the pics are....acceptable. perhaps you could redo them in sunlight and with a different background than a carpet? i'll add this to the index soon. thanks, i'll try to have some better pictures by tomorrow, as soon as i get my camera back from my brother.

1 i don't really like this set because it isn't my idea of the droid gunship, which is from sw battlefront, which can hold as many droids as a rgs can hold clones. if i buy this, it'd be for the dark blue pieces, which is the signature color of one of my castle nations ( dark red and dark blue ).

1 hollisbrick, on dec 29 2008, 10:20 pm, said: this is a great set it's too pricey though if it was $10 or so cheaper i'd get it! actually its on sale now. or at least for americans.

4 hollisbrick, on dec 29 2008, 11:22 pm, said: damn americans jk nah i'm aussie mate oh that sucks. actually im 1/4 aussie. but i dont live there. i love this set. i dont see how people dont like this. this is exactly like in the movie and personally if you thought it was supposed to be different i think you should study your star wars a little bit more.

4 nice review! crud..i wish i took this gunship instead of the lego indiana jones game.. edited by general magma, 10 january 2009 - 09:58 pm.

4 i'm definitely getting this soon. a good value for money, a cool set, and another part to my clone wars collection!

1 i am a proud owner of this set. like others, i got it discounted and couldn't resit the parts pack. this is the type of lego sets that bothers me. when you look at it now, you'd be tempted to say "hey not bad", but at the same time, some years ago, it wasn't good enough to buy it full price. i was kinda disappointed because usually sets using that kinda baseplates are excellent (castle, paradisa), and this one is just "ok". one really minus point would be the lack of any opponent faction in the set

4 that's it! thanks for the review but now you make me want to build my own one! thanks a lot! on a more serious note, i really like this set and have always wished to aquire it. i have two broken tie interceptors, so this should be a easy build. and as someone in the pirate forum, i think, said, it would be a great baseplate for building cave to hide the booty! thanks pmg and welcome!

3 thanks for the welcome everyone! though i'm still wondering where the drone minion/commander idea came from.

3 thanks for the review pmj . i like the play value in this set even if i don´t own it . the way the orbs are put into the rocket is awesome and i really like it, but at the end the set have some lack of detail .

3 another outstanding review by the "awesome set reviewer"! i enjoyed reading this review very much and i felt that you have redress twilight in an approriate manner. i have very mixed feeling about this set especially with its design. it seemed i will need to watch the clone wars movie in the theatre before i compared with it. most of the time, when this lego set is used in a movie, you will tend to compare it and what is the actual purpose for twilight, same as the rest of the sw vehicles and aircraft. for a high price like this, i can actually top up a little more and get the at-te, with the same batch of minifigs plus commander rex. if there is a special figure such as the v19 torrent (clone pliot), it will be a much ideal scenario. at the moment, i have not bring in any clone war sets into my collection, and i am quite sure twilight is not in my priority list especially when i am not a full-pledged star war collectors or i have strong intentions to complete the entire range in this recent release. therefore, i need to prioritise my purchase, and likely to get two rgs, since that is my favourite ship in clone war era. i am not comparing it with rgs. both sets defintely have their pros and cons. oh, i love that postcard you made. certainly looks very nice! svelte_corps, thanks for doing up this superb detailed review which had given "twilight" the neccessary attention it should have.

4 really awesome review svelte_corps . you did a really complete and in-depth review of this beast and with your nice pics is really enjoyable reading your review, so congrats . i like this ship even if it looks so bulky but i need to buy first other sets, so maybe this beast will be landing in my collection the next year (or this one if i am lucky ). i can just ask for something, can you post a pic of all your clone wars sets together with this one (all the sets in one pic, not many pics with this an each set ) please . edited by darkrebellion, 12 august 2008 - 02:20 am.

4 thanks a lot for a very nice and entertaining review! your photos were really nice and there have been some reviews lately that have such blurry pics... cough.. cough... it was a pleasure to see you can 1. put lego bricks together 2. write a review 3. handle your camera! i think this ship is underrated, it is really nice! i love the playing features like landing gear and back door, perhaps just cause i had to get along with so called landing gears in the past, that did not work at all (7140 for example..). and i simply love that there is space inside. you said there is not really some cause of the landing gear mechanism, but it seems it should be easily fixed. do you think there is enough space to put some plates over the landing gear and add some beds, kitchen und tv? i think this set is so perfect to mod it into a clone wars mobile home, your back garden ist just perfect for this. i prefer this over the at-te and over a 2nd gunship! thanks a lot for the review!

3 thank you svelte_corps for the review! i like the inside, nice and cosey! i also like your little garden! for me, this put the twilight different in a better perspective than my first perspective of the twilight. i voted outstanding. greets the-force!

1 thanks for yet another awesome review. quote seems like tlc has done a pretty accurate representation of the ship. the real fault for the ship's messy design has to go to lucasfilm, not tlc. my guess is lucasfilm is trying to recapture that "what a piece of junk!" magic of the millennium falcon. i guess we'll have to wait to see the movie to see if they succeeded or not. this sums up my opinion exactly. i can easily admit that the design of the kit is spot on - but unfortunately, the actual design of the ship in the new movie is garbage. actually, despite the millennium falcon's odd design, i really think it's a pretty appealing ship - and its really cool! i can't say the same for the twilight, though.

3 looks fine... but still that designs quite a downer.

1 dovchenko, on aug 13 2008, 12:29 pm, said: looks fine... but still that designs quite a downer. but look at that wing design! its lovely! looks exactly like the b-29 bombers wings look like.

4 good review there! my daughter loves the backyard garden of the twilight my opinion of the ship has changed after reading this, thanks!

3 [/quote] part 3: a closer view[/b] close-up of the main body of the ship: front-on. it is well-designed how the figs appear in line of sight (unlike the 6211 where jabba and leia were photoshopped in to the box art). don't ask what rotta is doing out of the line of vision there. some things are better left unsaid. [/quote] rotta: can i get on your knee to look outside? anakin: no! rotta: can i pull this lever? anakin: don't touch it! rotta: i want to drive! anakin: if your not quitting i will get you back to that mean white woman. rotta: i need a clean diaper! anakin: ashoka, get of the toilet! it's my turn to get some rest. ashoka: i thought i would become a padawan, not a babysitter! [/quote] [the rear deck is so large that it is wasted just being used so ahsoka can bungee-jump. i came up with a much better use for it. outdoor garden! despite having one roboticised hand, anakin was still quite the green thumb. and his light-saber was very useful as a hedge trimmer. so much so that he set up a side business between rotta-rescue missions. here's a promotional postcard: and to finish on a light note, i'd like to remind you that you do get another ahsoka hairpiece, which can be used for all sorts of things. ugha warrior upgrade: dr inferno hair transplant: and finally, attack of the deadly blue-ringed octopus, native to australia's beaches and oceans! thanks for reading! [/quote] lol, the garden would be lovely to see in gardeners world. never thought patrick star also liked gardening.

4 having plenty of time on my hands this summer i did some reviews. yes, i'm aware this has already been done, but i'll just do it once more. no harm there set# 5615 set title: the knight price: 2.99 euro / 3.49 usd pieces: 21 (yes a whole 21 bricks) release: 2007 the box: a neat little box that has a great size for dropping into your shopping cart. for once tlg didn't shove the bricks into an oversized cardboard box ;) the knight: this is a great minifig. though he looks a little unsatisfied...might be because his head isn't put on "all the way". a great army builder fig. the only thing that i find a little annoying is that the "collar" isn't completely rounded. it looks too much like an animation and left-hand work. the weapon rack: yes! thumbs up for this. plate mail, sword, shield and jousting helmet. plus the spear and open helmet on the fig. so many great additions to put into use. bring it on pesky skeleton army. the all in all verdict: a great set. a little too expensive compared to the crossbow attack in which one gets 2 knights and a skeleton plus bricks for 5.49 euro / 5.99 usd. but still a great army builder set. and the 7090 set, does not have the same knight fig. kimt

4 this little bugger brought me back from my dark ages! as a movie fan, i just couldn't resist the thought of making an animation with living lego skeletons (i'm referring to ray harryhausen's work on the classic jason and the argonauts here). buying the indy sets stopped me from getting a lot more castle sets. though in time i added the final joust, the wizard and the impulse knight to my collection, as well as buying more unique figs (king, princess) from expensive castle sets off bricklink. so yeah. great little set. two crownies, a skeleton and a skeletal horse, you just cannot resist that! even if you hadn't been buying lego for 5 years. as far as i'm concerned, this set is one for the ages! i love it!

4 lovely set. nice collection of weapons. cool horse-accesoires for the white knight, cool black skeletal horse on the dark knight's side. loving the printed armours of both knights! and, as opposed to kimt apparently, i really dig the black helmet. i feel there's a lord of the rings-flavour to it with those curves. well designed!

4 another small set my local target doesn't have. they don't have the best castle selection, they only really have dwarven mines and castle seiges. i'll buy this if i see it there though, because it looks like a great little set. i could use the awesome knight, and a skeleton that has a regular body so he looks like he is in armor!!!!!

3 i'm not a huge fan of this set but it is a great way to nab a fully mounted knight complete with a very attractive barding. given that in prior years it wasn't possible to get a barded horse in such a small set, this set is actually a decent way to build a mounted cavalry for your kingdom. looking at bricklink, it would probably cost as much to buy the knight, horse and weapons separately, and that doesn't take into account the skeleton or the extra bricks. despite my indifference to this set, i actually have purchased four of them in the past year simply because there isn't a cheaper way to acquire a mounted knight. (a quick question about the poll: are we voting on the quality of the set, or the quality of the review?) later. edited by blueandwhite, 13 august 2008 - 05:50 am.

4 you know what i think this set has? charm. lots of it. i'm not a big fan of castle, having very few sets, all of them spanning different nations/armies, but i couldn't resist this set. and while not obvious at first, it really is backwards compatible with every castle set with a horse in it. nonetheless, i think this set is great. it's simple, cheap and has charm. that's good enough for me. plus it has that fantastic grinning knight and the black skeleton horse. those just made it better.

3 perhaps he meant the pearl light grey lance, which is not that common.

4 dj2005, on aug 29 2008, 11:26 am, said: i'm a bit curious, does the knight's helm have a hole for plume? i can answer on behalf for kimt, if memories served me right. yes, there is a hole for placing the knight's plume. do correct me wrong, if i had answered wrongly. it's been awhile since i last touched my castle sets. thanks kimt for this fine review. this is one of the castle sets which i had bought high volume, mainly for its horses, barding and the weapons. a great army builder and accessories for your castle armies. this is an instant "5".

4 first things first. the knight's helm does have a spot for a plume. now, i really like this set and it was the first one i dug into when i got my collection in the mail. it has a great selection of equipment for good or evil figures and the barding for the horse is outstanding. my only wish was for one of the long chrome swords for the knights. i think the new knights with the tall shield and chrome sword look excellent on foot and on horseback. it would definitely be neat to revisit this set with another human knight instead of the skeleton. make that change and add a lady to joust for and it'd be bang on.

4 this looks like a really great set! i wasn't around in '88 to get it but i like it! it actually has things inside the interior! thanks for the review. hinckley, on aug 13 2008, 06:11 pm, said: there were quite a few sets in the 1980's that weren't sold in the us. hooray! (sort of) in england we don't get, in normal shops, batman and spongebob sets, and not at all - avatar sets, and brickmaster, but america gets all of these. maybe it's revenge for america's lego neglect in the 80's. hinckley, on aug 13 2008, 06:11 pm, said: i remember reading once that it was because they contained wine glasses and tlg felt they wouldn't be able to market a toy that encourage the drinking of alcohol. this set was one of them. they didn't want to encourage the drinking of alcohol in america but were fine encouraging it in other places? maybe that's why my country has such a big problem with binge drinking... or maybe not.

1 it's a nice house but perhaps a little sparsh on detail. just a few more pieces for additional furniture would have been nice. like the car though.

4 i wish i could find this set some day (including the right baseplate). some of my house mocs are styled after the classic 6349. and sometimes i've rebuilt it after instruction scans exchanging the baseplate (i don't own one of these) with 2 at 16x32 each. and this city house out of an older thread of mine. it's offensive, that i've used styling elements of 6349's just enlarged. in terms of interior details: not much, but still enough for classic town. i voted outstanding mfg widdi edited by widdi, 09 october 2008 - 01:22 am.

4 this is an awesome set, man... and a great review. just too bad it is so rare! i voted 5. by the way, does anyone know if there is a review for this? or other sets that come with a camper, perhaps? also, i was wondering if the creator houses are in scale and could be used with minifigs and such.

4 has anyone noticed the dwarf in one of the completed shots? nice set, alot better than the new city sets...*looks at an army of firefighters that have no fires to put out and the police officer army* edited by indianajones, 21 april 2010 - 12:06 pm.

4 hello all eurobricks members and town lovers, today, i will be doing up the third item in the shell promotional series in 1998. three out of the eight promotional sets are under town theme. the third in the line is the exterme team sub theme which is promoted in 1998. extreme team is a bunch of adventurous, daring, breath taking individuals that risk their lives for an unforgettable excitement of the lifetime. their vehicles range from land, air and sea type of extreme taking types. extreme team is one the unknown themes ever released in my "dark age". i only had this small lovely set in my entire extreme team collection. hope we are able to see more interesting reviews under extreme team as well. name: extreme team raft theme: lego system / town / promotional / shell year: 1998 pieces: 19 minifigs: 1 price: usd$2.00 an image of a 2537, extreme team, raft this will be an exciting water adventure! this is another great addition to your female population count. she is one of thhe daring individuals in the extreme team, that take her raft beyond limit, into the rough waters where she might face possible dangers. look how confident she is, with those witty eyes of her. i am very sure she will survived the course of her entire journey. raft's design this is a very simple design, with just a big piece of wooden plank and a couple of logs tied together on the side, and it is ready to take it down to the water. speaking of some real adventure, do you dare to take this raft in the unknown waters? there is a small holding area, where she is able to place her critical equipment to ensure her safety throughout the journey. bottom of the raft excellent range of equipment this set actually provides very good range of equipment. there is a pair of oars, hammer, life vest and backpack. the most wonderful piece of equipment is the pair of dynamites. first of all, they are printed. next, they can be used in wild west or any playing possibilites which involved in explosives. this is a very good impulse set to stock up these accessories. i wondered what she need to use these dynamites for? her extreme team black jacket is very nicely designed, with their logo "x" or another way of saying "xtreme". i find the green arms and black jacket matched pretty well, with that blue cap. front view relaxing herself, listening to the calm sea to summarise, this is one of the better impulse sets ever produced. it comes with a simple raft with tons of good accessories, and a very cheap way to obtain dynamites. in fact, these are my only 2 piece in my entire collection. somehow, this set managed to find its way to my collection in my dark age, and i am very pleased to have this. no major flaws on this set, it fufill the conditions of an excellent impulse set! summary review playability: 9.5/10 (high playability involved. you can used it as an indy, adventurers or whatever purpose for the raft) design: 10/10 (very very simple design with superb great accessories. for a promo/impulse set, it's very good) price: 9.5/10 (a very inexpensive set based on the 1998 pricing. great way to buy this to add in some adventures of your own) overall: 9.7/10 (this is a fanastic set, mainly for its accessories. get it if you still see any of these. it's defintely worth the money, if its reasonable) i gave it a "5" based on my review score card. what about yours? hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine. comments and critics are strongly welcomed. pictures can be found in my brickshelf (when moderated)

3 cpt. pegleg blockbeard, on aug 14 2008, 03:29 pm, said: over all a nice set, i am a little confused by the dynamite though... perhaps an easy way to go fishing hilarious! i bet she threw out the penicillin and flare gun to make room for the axe and dynamite in her survival kit. who wouldn't? maybe she's a lost escapee.

4 overall, an excellent set concerning the price range. nice review, whitefang!

4 thanks for this review thebrickster, i also have this set and think it's one of the best helicopters tlg made in the 90's. it's quite big and has got place for 2 minifigs in the cockpit. i also like the fact that there's a victim included in form of the x-treme diver, which also is a theme i always loved as a kid. do you have any other res-q sets left to review? it would be an honour for me to also do a review of one or more sets which are left, but unfortunately i got not much time at the moment.

3 cool, then i think i'll do a review of 6451 river response later today or tomorrow, stay tuned!

4 this helicopter is so cool and i agreed with you that this is a high playablity set. it's not common to see such a big scale helicopter which has two cockpits back then. the color scheme works well for me. with so much features such as the lowering of the grappling hook, storage box, storing of the gurney and etc. one thing which can be improved onto the helicopter is the rotors. it could be extended a little longer as the size of the helicopter is too big. it makes the rotors rather weak as it is not able to support the weight. i am confused why there is an extreme team personnel there. i thought he was supposed to be recovered from the res-q team? although there is so many questions in my head such as why include the black tri-cycle bike, extreme team, and etc but this is still one very good set to play with. too bad, i had never seen this before. somehow, through your review, i like it very much. the only big scale helicopter which i owned is the 7738 coast guard helicopter and lift raft. neverthless, i gave this a "4". thanks brickster.

1 i think the set is too unrealistic, i like the new resq sets better (and i'm somewhat a lifeboat freak so i'm always following such a sets with interest). i would like to see some rigit inflatable boats some day ;) but about the chopper, i like the accessoiries.

3 metalandi, on aug 24 2008, 04:17 pm, said: what exactly makes you feel this set isn't realistic? since the question was asked... 1) tiny rotors 2) dual cockpits (only seen on a few military copters) 3) stretcher extends beyone edges of fuselage when inside the vehicle 4) extra long canopy (really only seen on military helicopters), and "military" design. 5) black colorscheme for rescue vehicle. the the stretcher, minifig designs and rescue logo are the only things about this copter that really suggest that it is a civilian rescue aircraft. it's a toy set with alot of play value, but i agree with karto that these kind of desgins really turned me off to alot of the town and city sets of the 90's. on the positive side, the new city sets, with thier realistic non-futuristic designs have really tempted me to buy more vehicles.

4 this set was my first set ever from the resq series, and i loved it entirely! ofcourse i modded it slightly here and there after hours and hours of fun and excitement, it has great play value, even for a set in this size

4 this is one of my favourite sets. i remember getting it in tesco soon after it was released. those were the days... the res-q line was good, and this set made it better.

4 wow. i loved this set, i still have it actually... in pieces though, i took it apart quite soon after i got it, then managed to lose the instruction manual

3 very nice review. this is another set which i had never seen before when i am in my dark age. quite an useful set, especially with the accessories and the minifigs' torsos. the speedboat is able to hold the car and the rubber rescue boat. how can the driver steer this boat with so many things blocking the way? i can't seemed to find its control though. thanks for doing this review.

4 well i for one really like this set it has to be one of the nicer ribbies that tlg has made tons of playability and nice options for redesign, great set overall. thanks for the review.

4 6004 crossbow cart review because i may start collecting castle here is a review of one of my few castle sets. please note i hurriedly put his together meaning some parts are the wrong color, look out for them! this review will also be done in my star wars review style. the lighting is also particularly bad in the pics. on with the review... parts: 20 figs: 1 price: ????? 1.overview and fig the whole set. the fright knight's knight. the disemboweled knight. the head printing is just longer then the helmet visor. 2. the cart the cart has 3 crossbows and 2 norman type shields. the cart's advanced defense and weapons systems. all the parts from the cart. (forgot to add the fig in) 3.extras & overall here are all my castle figs. remember i don't collect castle. (yet ) oh yeah i forgot to put one of the old skellies and a ghost on there. could a castle fan tell me if any of these minifigs are rare. i have no idea because i don't collect castle. build: 6/10 pretty standard for a impulse. minifigs: 7/10 nice minifig with lots of accessories. design: 8/10 this set made way for some of the new castle carts of similar size. parts: 10/10 3 crossbows, 2 shields, arrow quiver, and spear as well as cool minifg in a 20 piece set! price: 10/10 well i don't know but lego was cheaper in '97 so it gets 10. playability: 5/5 pretty much standard for a impulse set. overall 8/10 good parts and price as well as minifig scores this set an 8. thanks for reading.

3 nice review i collect castle too and the ghost isn't really rare (i have one too) but it's not really found anymore so it would be a good thing to keep it. anyway great review edited by mammymarf, 15 august 2008 - 08:48 pm.

4 very nicely done - this cart is a striking resemblance to the crossbow cart we got in 2007.

3 quote even though many people don’t like frightknights. i don't really like fright knights either i just happened to have this set.

4 this is a pretty nice set. i really like the torso and its "genericness" so it can be used for other factions. and at least this set has 2 shields (althought i prefer the triangular ones) instead of just 1 shield you get from crossbow attack (from the wrong fraction, i'd have liked a crown knights shield 100x better). some improvements for this set would be a normal bow and a sword instead of 2 of the 3 crossbows, smaller wheels and triangular shields. 4/5 from me (actually 3,5 but i'll round it up)

3 i gave it above average. it was a nice set and included some nice pieces, but it is only an impulse set after all. edited by newright, 19 august 2008 - 01:06 pm.

4 this is really an ideal small set. in spite of its size, it has nearly everything: • three minifigs • a vehicle • a building • numerous minifig accessories • numerous rare and useful parts • nice model design (especially for the time period) too bad outback came out during my dark years.

4 i have had this on my bricklink wanted list for ages, and yet noone with my criteria has it. nice review and brilliant set.

4 set#: 7103 theme: star wars set name: jedi duel pieces: 74 release: 2002 price: 10 usd minifigs: 2 (count dooku and yoda) links: 7103 brickshelf folder bricklink reference catalog peeron.com introcomment: i remember getting this set solely because i collect star wars. as i rebuild it and took pics of it, i found that i actually like this set for different reasons. dooku's speeder is pretty cool and the lightsabre rocks. the dooku minifig is also great. what's not so great is the flythingy and getting another yoda. though that's kinda hard not to get in a set focused on their duel "you can't see the wires, because they digitally removed them." "be careful or i'll digidally remove your head" - steven seagal [i hope i quoted that one right ] so to get the review on the move, i'll impress you all with a box picture: neat, huh? one of the smaller boxes, but still kinda big when consider that you only get 74 pieces and 2 minifigs. the instruction isn't that big as i said, the dooku minifigs is awesome i love the print on his torso that combines the brown cape with the torso and also the head is neatly designed. not a fleshie, though. this was before the flesh-license-facelift a sideview of the light blue speeder. mmmm that crome light sabre hilt is nice the design of the speeder is also ok, and without the usual off-colour-scheme bricks. no tan or yellow sticking out there yeah, i'd panic too if this came right at me...who wouldn't when noone's driving? and a rear shot. i think the design is a little off. the shields makes it all a little too open in my opinion. the printed bricks are a kick and thus evens the score here. this hideous design is meant to flip yoda around the air. put him in this funfair from hell thing and give him a twister he and dooku will never forget. my guess is that it's there to add some playability, but it's just odd and quite useless. much like the playability soccer thingies in the ultimate light sabre duel the verdict: ups and downs. this set offers both. i rate it as "average" since the size and price of the set make it acceptable to have odd things. confused? good so am i making a small set isn't that easy and remeber this set is from 2002 and a lot has happended since then, designwise that is. what do you think?

3 whats wrong with another yoda and some nice light blue bricks? i probably would destroy this set, and keep the minifigs intack tough, chrome lightsabers on!

3 oky wan kenobi, on aug 18 2008, 02:41 pm, said: wasn't this the only [yoda] that was ever released except for the one in the dagobah/x-wing set? sure, he is not the best fig with the unmovable legs and all, but still: it's yoda! edit: i'm pretty sure we got a yoda in the wookiee catamaran set from revenge of the sith ...runs to check brickset... yep, there's a yoda in that set, as well. but the jedi duel is the only reasonably priced set with the green force-guru. nevermind, looks like a couple of other members already covered yoda's availability in other sets. back on topic: great review, and a real blast from the past. i never did get this set, just didn't care for the speederbike or the weird piece of equipment. thanks for explaining that it's supposed to be used to "force-jump & spin" yoda all over the place. i never knew that's what it was for. anyway, wish i had known yoda and dooku were going to be impossible to get later; i may've picked this set up just for the minifigs. edited by bamaker, 18 august 2008 - 10:39 pm.

1 i think this is a pretty lame set. it came with dooku, who i think only came in this set, plus a unique lightsaber. still, they could have made it much bigger, added anikan and obi-wan, and added structures and made it more like the scene from the movie. also, the speeder doesn't seem very accurate.

4 i missed this set.but i reallly like the yoda and count dooku.i especially like count dooku's lightsaber.one thing though,is it me oris yoda's lightsaber blue in the picture? edited by pr0visorak, 20 august 2008 - 12:21 pm.

4 thanks for the review. it's always good to have a 2nd opinion on a set. i've added the usual poll and i'll index it tomorrow (must sleep). super pics and great to have "in-build" pics a fine set which i'll surely buy when i find it.

4 thanks for the cool review vbbn . i think this set is really cool and very neat detailed to be a small set , also thanks for the clear pics . edited by darkrebellion, 18 august 2008 - 10:30 pm.

3 nice review! thanks for the clear pics. also, if you place a brick so the axles on the bomb mechanisms tips are touching the brick, the bombs should stay on. jifel

4 thanks for the review. i have had second thoughts about purchasing this bad boy and i think you made it clear that it was a nice buy. however, i would have loved the maf too!

4 you're me want to buy this

3 set data 4920: the rapid rider year: 1999 subtheme: rock raiders pieces: 37 (+1 extra - trneongreen plate 1 x 1 round) price: euro 3,50, used, not including s/h, on ebay building time: less than 10 minutes. more info: bricklink - peeron. i could have owned the 4910 hover scout (see metalandi's review here), but while i was buying some used sets, i forgot to buy that one too! so, here's my only rr set, the second smallest one (if we don't count japanese promos; sweets are surely sweeter if they come with a lego set!) pieces: face and torso closeup; i like the torso, the face is good except for the bandanna. building is based on two big pieces: landing skids and plate 6 x 6 x 2/3 cross with dome. let's go! building is over: review: pros: small set (= cheap), 1 fig, two accessories, some interesting pieces like the rock and the crystal. no stickers but 3 printed pieces! good color choice. cons: tipper bucket is fixed, no hinge. no levers or steering wheel, it probably moves by using the buttons on the 2x2 tile. it deserves a 4/5.

4 this was the first rock raiders set i got. i really like it, and i think i got all of them except the huge cargo airlift thing. i remember these sets coming out and getting the big base for christmas, though they are all destroyed now... sadly... . nice review.

4 rock raiders was the shit back in the day. awesome theme! i had this set as well as the tunnel transporter, which was amazing.

4 i rate it a full 5 too. and i wish lego would make a set like this in 2010. a town needs pizza! edit: don't always trust peeron. sometimes they miss some pieces, and sometimes they just can't count them! edited by the cobra, 24 august 2008 - 11:41 am.

3 thanks to all of you whom had showed great liking towards to one of my favourite childhood sets. fluyt, on aug 24 2008, 06:36 pm, said: i hope i still have all the pieces from mine, unfortunately, my stickers are in pretty bad shape (took them off because i needed the bricks, stupid stickers covering multiple parts , only downside to this set). flyut, if you need decals for the stickers that are featured in this set. hang around here until imperialshadows drop by to give you a little surprise if he is free. sandy, on aug 24 2008, 07:33 pm, said: for the review, i just have to point out a few things, to give you constructive criticism: first of all, it's chef, not "chief" (entirely different professions), and secondly, the scale you give in the poll isn't very even. "above average" jumps to "outstanding", which is a too big of a gap in my opinion. you should've used "good" or "great" in between them. but these are only minor faults, this is a good review anyway! sandy, i appericate your constructive comments in order to improve the quality of my review. i had amended the word "chief" to "chef". you might want to check it. i did not notice that i was using the wrong word. as for the poll definitions which have been used, for 1 to 5. we used "poor" to represent value "1" while "outstanding" to represent value "5". we need to use clear definitions to illustrate and demostrate non-bias towards the review for the readers to cast their vote depending on their individual liking. therefore, we used a common word which is known as "average". in surveys, for measuring its sample size's liking, we have to use words which is neutral such as strongly agree, agree, neutral, disagree, strongly disagree. that's why, we used this rating approach to represent the terms. the cobra, on aug 24 2008, 07:37 pm, said: i rate it a full 5 too. and i wish lego would make a set like this in 2010. a town needs pizza! edit: don't always trust peeron. sometimes they miss some pieces, and sometimes they just can't count them! i am hoping to see a pizza outlet again, maybe in 2010. well, peeron can sometimes be not very accurate but it can served as a very useful guide in most areas.

4 this set looks really cool, especially for one this inexpensive. the van is neat, and the hidden storage compartment i back is the icing on the cake. i like the back with hidden oven as well, and the rare sink piece makes it all the better. with five pizzas and three minifigs, it's and excellent set to behold.

4 one of my greatest lacks in my town...i can remember going to the store to buy this one, and ending up with another set (pirates) at home :p thank you for the review, it might put me on track in finding this set on the web and purchasing it to correct my childish change of mind, so long ago ;-)

3 wow. great review!

4 i got the original version as a surprise one christmas. my parents liked the design so much they got it for me. this is one of the best town sets. if it didn't have the delivery van it would have been on par with 6683 hamburger stand, a great set in its own right. the van, and they way the back holds the pizzas, is ingenious and bumps this set up to the highest levels.

4 this set is great and so is this review! i really like seeing reviews of classic sets like this and hope to see more in the future. the chef in this set is the base for my sigfig in fact! the classic sets have a totally different feel to them than the newer sets. they look more human. great review!

4 i remember having this set when it was originally released a good few years back, but i don't think i have it anymore. i remember i thought it was really awesome though. i thought the oven and pizza storage in the back of the car were the greatest parts, the little sink on the inside was cool too. didn't realise they had made a legends set out of it... i'd love to own this set again, but misb examples on bricklink go for an extortionate amount of money. ah well, se la vie...

4 thanks for all of your kind words and great support for this once famous legend set, which got a second chance to be re-released again for people whom had missed it before. indeed, this is the kind of lego sets which is great addition for any lego town or city. thebrickster, on aug 26 2008, 02:26 pm, said: excellent review white fang! - and a great set to commemorate the establishment of classic town.net. i almost ordered this set back when it was re-released by lego, but passed on it. i'm so mad at myself! this has all the terrific qualities that classic town sets exemplify. i love the delivery truck and the pizza oven. a great review from one of the "master eb reviewers" - outstanding! hope you managed to find a good deal in the internet. that last comment of yours certainly makes my day bright. thanks brickster. you are one of them as well. lockt, on aug 26 2008, 03:52 pm, said: one of my greatest lacks in my town...i can remember going to the store to buy this one, and ending up with another set (pirates) at home :p thank you for the review, it might put me on track in finding this set on the web and purchasing it to correct my childish change of mind, so long ago ;-) what pirate set did you actually buy instead of the pizza to go? hope you are able to find a good buy on the internet. imperialshadows, on aug 26 2008, 04:53 pm, said: surprise? free? i'm not even close to free, i'm rather expensive, but i do have a surprise for everyone! i think you'll be interested in the companion article to this fine review, my first set restoration project. geez, you twisted my words "free" indeed, you are "dear". lastly, thanks for that lovely surprise. i really enjoyed viewing that sweet decals of yours. looks tasty too. imperialshadows, on aug 26 2008, 04:53 pm, said: again, great job whitefang, excellent review, and tlg, this is a star amongst your sets. think about that when you're designing new ones. seriously. actually, this is one of my surviving stars among my sets. well, i will need to find better sets for the new ones. section8, on aug 27 2008, 10:07 pm, said: i got the original version as a surprise one christmas. my parents liked the design so much they got it for me. this is one of the best town sets. if it didn't have the delivery van it would have been on par with 6683 hamburger stand, a great set in its own right. the van, and they way the back holds the pizzas, is ingenious and bumps this set up to the highest levels. i agreed with you. in fact, recently there was a hot topic created by k.d on what is your favourite takeaway. look at here for more discussions and views.

3 i just built this set in mlcad as a requestfor a fellow eurobricks member. somehow i missed out on this set completely when it came out. i was really suprised how long it took to build (virtually). despite its size this set is packed with details, minifigs, vehicles and tools. thanks for all the pictures! gif xml: 6479 emergency response center edited by missouri_bb63, 31 december 2009 - 09:32 am.

4 there are very few late 90's or early 00's sets worth ever having and i wish i had this one. with it's futuristic look and yes, that tow truck too, oh yeah heaps of equipment ! it's not over junorised, there is still plenty of building in it. thanks and have a happy new year, 'metalandi' !

4 hi everyone, this is my first review on lego sets here. hope you guys like it. and i would like to apologise for the bad quality pictures. hope you guys don't mind. first i will start with the box art. box art: i guess this is the first time that lego star wars sets use white and blue colour for their box. i like the new colour scheme, a nice blend though. here's the front: the back: not to waste space on the box lego do some advertisement to attract us to buy more sets. :grin:the more the side: at the top side there is this minifigs scale picture. it is great as we get to know the real size of a minifigs. contents: the contents consist of a sticker sheet, instruction book, and 8 packet of bricks. the packer are not numbered. but it is ok as there is not much pieces. instruction book and random page: as usual the instruction book have brick checklist, other sets pictures, and tutorial on how you should assemble your set (i mean the very first page). sticker sheet: there is not much sticker sheet and is a great news that the republic logo on the round plate is printed unlike republic gunship. anyway, i didn't apply the stickers. the commander gear: this is a new thing to minifigs as well. well is like batman accessories, they pack it in one small packet. however, you only get one commander gear pack in this set. anyway, i didn't use them. the minifigs: well, we get the the new minifigs. the ugly face clone, new printed torso and new mold of helmet. however i not really like the new head stud, i prefer a black one or at least the one like jango fett, black colour with face. the helmet: everything is printed, no holes at the visor there, but there are hole on the both side. this new helmet mold also made the headgear turn 360 degree freely. without helmet: with helmet: you can see the flesh tone at the hole beside. the blasters: @ short blasters were given instead of long one. is great, at least they give us two blasters instead of one. the tank: here is the pics of the tank. it was not badly design nor nicely design. but it looks great if you didn't saw the beneath or under the tank. view from front: view from side: view from back: what's beneath? under it was 4 wheels, to make it move fluently. it is made by the thread supporter like the one we fet from tie crawler or bat-tank the functions: well firstly, you can open up the hood (i guess) to see the engine. secondly the side cannon that can move upwards. the thing is quite tight (see random instruction page) and there is barrier to block the cannon from going downwards. the cockpit: well the cockpit is small and the space is limited. the monitor stuff is printed brick and is another great news. you have to remove the piece (pic below) to reveal the cockpit and put your clone to pilot it. pop-up gunner mechanism: well the backdoor have a thing to attack to the seat of the gunner. the top hatch is very loose. so it there is a clone as a gunner and you open the back door, the clone will pop-up and automatically open the hatch on top. this is how the top looks like without a clone. there is this movable cannon (upwards, left and right) and a little keyboard thing with it. but the cannon fall off quite easily. the flick launching missile mechanism: the mechanism is on both side and you need to turn the thing inwards to reveal the flick fire mechanism. below are the pic of how it is turned. you can keep you blaster at the front of the side. there are place for you to store them. it close nicely. completion: this is how it looks like. extra parts: there quite a number of them. overall: this set is not bad. the price is quite expensive but you will like it. the pop-up mechanism is something new (to me) but this set have more function and 2 clone trooper with a pack of commander gear. pros: -2x clone troopers -high playability -nice design cons: -a little expensive -sticker sheet -cannon on top falls off quite easy edited by kimt, 27 august 2008 - 12:16 pm.

3 thank you kimt for adding the poll. hehe. this is my first review so, i'm not so confident about the pictures. thank you guys for viewing and commenting.

4 splendid photos and well written review! i love it. i've owned and built mine and must say it's a good set and the tank don't disappointment in terms of design and playability. i got mine stickered, well been a perfectionist i am :p thanks again for the review that it should deserved :d

4 thanks for the pics so far. will you have high-res pics of the other sets in the instructions?

1 mattzitron, you have done well to display images of the dung stain hull... its a darn shame that it can't be extended. however, i see no reason why lego couldn't produce a special middle hull piece that is compatible. although the way they've made the hull is a bit stupid. the old system was a lot more flexible. better still why can't lego design a hull that can be extended in length and width... then they could be as made as long or wide as desired and that would be great!

1 they have made a special middle piece in this 4+ set: http://www.brickset....aspx?set=7075-1 the only problem is that it's red.

4 good work samsta! no wonder i wasn't aware. 4+ pirates and all...

4 yoda601, on aug 17 2005, 02:53 pm, said: it's a shame it only comes with two figs. it would be great for my ancient middle-east project. if you ever get a moment, i'd love some pics of that. i've been tooling around with something along those lines in my ever expanding fantasy setting. akkh

4 thanksfor this review, i also got this set recently, and i'm very happy about it. i live the design of these new trucks, and the forklift is also great. not to forget the good amount of cargo. btw., i think the "mysterious cargo" only are normal fuel barrels

3 great review! i dig this set. it could have only been better if it had been a 6-wide version of the old 6367 semi-truck. still i ask: what's so special about the special edition?

3 the cobra, on aug 27 2008, 09:58 pm, said: still i ask: what's so special about the special edition? hmm...good question. let's hope our reviewer can help us out here.

4 nice review, vbbn! i stumbled upon your yellow seat as well. didn´t you have one already or what made you think it´s new? the big letdown on this set is the big canopy. i would have preferred single bricks for that. and for this truck there is no real need for a hollow canopy - it could as well have been made of solid bricks. maybe we get another set with different use of the canopy. this is one of the reasons i didn´t buy it so far. and i´m especially not interested in another forklift, i have plenty of those... i agree it´s the best one we have seen so far though.

4 that´s really a sweet and charming little technic set, thanks for that fine review!

4 a very original and perhaps even a little weird design indeed, but nice and creative for sure! thanks for that good review!

4 i loved all of these "walker" sets. it was such a smart technique. i made one myself with what i had ...ahhh good times! thanks for the great review.

4 thanks for the review. i'll add it to the index. the y-wing is one of my favourite rebel fighters and this set justifies the coolest fighter

4 a wonderful set and a really charming design, well detailed and pretty smooth at the same time. perhaps that small gap at the cockpit´s an a little weak point, but we can always mod a little. thanks for that very neat review, cardinal brick!

1 stauder, on aug 27 2008, 08:45 pm, said: he doesn't know the story. but those pics of you swooshing it naked sure are halarious... the one in the park is extra good... you should see people's faces i mean, they are jelaous, of your y-wing! (yoda has my email :p hehe) staudie. haha i was making a joke and here comes stauder with his clearly insane lies. for the truth go here. now can we get back on topic or a you just dying to become sarlac food?

3 i've built the y-wing and the imperial landing craft (7659) more or less at the same time and, for about the same prices, i think the imperial landing craft (ilc) is much superior to the y-wing. the y-wing doesn’t have much functionality besides an awkward dropping bomb device and a moving cannon. the missiles firing system is … your fingers. the ilc has an awesome missiles firing system (i wish i could get it individually for mocs), a clever bomb dropping mechanism, 5 minifigures with weapons, the wings fold up together and the “cargo” can be detached as a play set. i’ve built the ilc first so i got quite disappointed with the y-wing.

4 the y-wing is a truly beautifull ship, and lego has done a great job on this one, lacking landing gear is a minus point though. and nice review by the way!

1 siegfried, on 04 september 2011 - 09:27 am, said: please, check the date prior to asking questions in old topics. three years ago in this case. it's rude to expect people to answer questions like that, especially since it's such a generic question. besides, how is he supposed to answer the question without knowing a lot more about the new y-wing... sorry!

1 etav8r, on 19 september 2011 - 01:55 am, said: i think it is a fair to ask questions here with the expectation of a new y-wing in the coming year. i came here to look at the review even though it is a few years old. no images to go with the review. bummer. i'd like to see a more friendly tolerance on dated threads being bumped. again, we know next to nothing about the new y-wing. it wouldn't be possible to say whether 7658 is worth the money relative to the new one until we know what the new one looks like, what its minifigures look like, how much it will cost, etc. also, note that yodalikespie has been banned.

4 thanks for sharing this review with us. i'll add it to the index. one of my favourite impulse sets along with the troll warrior (or is that orc warrior)

4 another fine review! i love the last (action) picture. thanks for sharing! btw, i am so looking forward to that 384 london bus review.

4 since my last post i've had the chance to build the tiger, and i was surprised in a good way. a much better set than i actually thougth. front

4 what do you mean the troll’s should outnumber the crown knight? how are you going to manage that? well here’s the answer. theme: castle set name: troll warrior set number: 5618 number of pieces: 19 figures:1 released: 2008 list price: £2.50 (gbp) $3.50 (usd) 2.99 (euro) 5618 peeron.com 5618 bricklink catalog 5618 shop at home lets us begin with the box. the troll warrior and his might cart. set sets for children to pester for at christmas. now for what’s inside. the contents of the box, it doesn’t look like much. now for the troll himself, i’m glad they selected this troll torso rather than the other one for the impulse set i think this one is the superior one. also he comes well armed with a spear and sword but no shield sadly. someone really needs to look at the rodent problem in the castle sets.. now the cart, nice easy construction as with all impulse sets, i’m still not convinced by the flicking missiles. a line of those would do some damage. what an oncoming army can expect to see.. all together now and it looks rather good. so there we have it a cheap way of bolstering the troll army and outfitting them with some more weapons. also for anyone planning a pied piper moc another set with a rat in it. the rating system figures: 8/10 (|preferred troll torso and helmet style. ) parts 7/10 (two spears and a sword but sadly lacking that all important shield.) fun fun fun 4/10 (somewhat more to do on it’s own that other impulse at least the troll can fight the rat!) design 7/10 (well designed even the flicker missile doesn’t look bad) price 8/10 (at £2.50 more than the other castle impulse.) grand total 34/50 (lack of a shield and to small to stand alone for my rating system..) conclusion. castle fans got a great army builder with the knight and they’ve been lucky enough to receive another one with this set. i’m glad we’ve got a troll impulse as it allow for enlarging the armies of evil some the crown knight don’t totally outnumber all their opponents.

4 best impulse set so far. thanks for sharing your thoughts and yes, someone should look into that rodent issue. i'll add this to the index within long

4 wow. i like this set. but have no money to get it. guess i need to be fast and get it before it was sold out.

1 more firefighter, there must be a pyromaniac in legoland somewhere! theme: city set name: firefighter set number: 5613 number of pieces: 25 figures:1 released: 2008 list price: £2.00 (gbp) $3.50 (usd) 2.99 (euro) 5613 peeron.com 5613 bricklink catalog 5613 shop at home starting as always with the box i didn’t know red cylinders were flammable. interestingly an action shot and not other sets you might like to buy. the contents of the box. looks much like every other impulse set. firefighter, not sure there’s much else to say apart from i wish they’d included breathing equipment. looking pretty pleased with himself if you ask me. the equipment rack is fairly standard and easy to build, it does however include a fire hydrant. inbuild shot, will i be able to finish this complex build.[/. unsurprisingly i did. i nice selection of kit is provided. all together, i think the fire is a bit odd but it does add playability. if you want to increase the number of your firefighter and their equipment this is a great way, though there is something missing in my mind. the rating system figures: 5/10 (fairly standard i already have a fair few) parts 6/10 (good selection of tools, but lacks the breathing apparatus i’d expect in a set like this) fun fun fun 5/10 (there’s clearly something to do even if you just own this set.) design 5/10 (not going to win any awards but it’s robust) price 8/10 (nothing to complain about, you get a lot of accessories for the price.) grand total 29/50 (reasonable design and good accessories a good set to improve any fire department.) conclusion. this isn’t a set i’d necessarily buy, but while i was at bluewater today i decided i should try to review every impulse set myself, so that why i bought it. still i think it has some good playability and a good set of accessories if you need more firefighting kit, i just can’t get passed the lack of breaking apparatus, that would have made it a better set in my view.

3 that’s the problem i couldn’t quite tell what, it’s a bit of a problem in a reviewer. maybe a hose to clip to the fire hydrant i don’t know.

3 cardinal brick, on aug 28 2008, 06:36 pm, said: fairly standard mission mars spaceman, he’s got printing front and back but sadly no air tank! how does he breath? parts 6/10 (lots of white and not much orange, but where’s the air tank!) as you said, he has printing on the back, if you look closley you wil lsee a tank printed on his back with "oxygen" written on it. stauder.

3 opps well that’ll teach me to do reviews without my glasses! thanks for pointing that out stauder.

1 i wasn't all that impressed with what you get in this set for the price. but you have an interesting point; that the robot can be considered a reference to the classic space bots. makes me think i ought to try modding the robot later...

1 nice review and quite funny now i'll never turn my back on a robot again. poor set. i find this set bad, even for an impulse,. the robot is poorly designed and without any use. the space minifig is ok. i'd rather get another impulse set than this. except the other life on mars mars mission impulse sets.

3 something i forgot to mention is that great review xenologer, on aug 28 2008, 08:28 pm, said: makes me think i ought to try modding the robot later... mod the robot? why? you should see the interior! stauder.

4 kimt, on aug 28 2008, 09:52 pm, said: i'd rather get another impulse set than this. except the other life on mars mars mission impulse sets. actually i kinda like the crystal hawk impulse. the default model isn't that great but you get a few nice wing plates to work with (after rearranging it looks pretty good). i guess this one though, is good for some nice parts, tho its pretty limited in what you can rebuild it into, and it seems less value because the astronaut has no vehicle... best impulse set has to be the troll warrior... feels very 'complete', and space orcs are always nice to have...

4 cool! i also like the sticker on the back of joker's ice cream truck that says "i love gotham"!

4 very good, informative review. i really want this set but i never got around to buying it. i thought all of your photos are great and of good quality. keep it up!

4 i love this set... indy is what got me back into lego.

3 i keep looking at this set to buy. since i have 3 10$ cards now maybe i will go pick it up at the lego store next month. so many things i want.

1 good review, thanks! for the mail van, while it certainly adds interaction and fun to a lego town, it alone lacks details and playability, and thus not a good set, especailly taking its price into consideration. its value is pretty much just like, if not less than, some impulse sets, in my opinion...

4 thanks for that very nice review, erdbeereis1. it´s great to see some other city sets beside the usual hospital, police and firefighter mayhem, and this is a really nice little one. now give me some car doors and a kevin costner-like mf and i´m a happy camper indeed, tlc...

4 i do like the set also. i've bought 2 of them. one to build it up and one to keep it misb (i dunno for how long ). only poor things is that the wheels are too wide. car is 5nops wide instead of 4. afterall a good design. i wonder if there's a post office coming soon. by the way, great review.

1 rriggs, on aug 31 2008, 02:55 am, said: i actually like the use of the old style car base and mourned the day that these became exitinct the first time round (c1990). i don't hate the piece, but i did object to the way this set fills in the middle recessed area with a 2 x 2 plate that is nearly impossible to get out again without doing some damage to it. what's more, if you fill in the recessed area, you've eliminated the only rationale for using the car base in the first place.

4 a very good review of an especially charming and lovely set, thanks! the whole cg theme looks very nice to me with a good and detailed set design, and this one´s no exception. although it would be nice to see more car doors and some new mf faces, though.

4 rriggs, on sep 2 2008, 08:50 am, said: you do get a piece call out with this set (i did anyway). it's on the back of the small poster that is included in the set! i meant the piece call outs during the build that show which pieces you need for that step. and cardinal brick, i'm not quite sure what you mean, but i cetainly think that this jetski is wonderful.

4 great review of a great set! one question: how does the robot-arm-piece connect to the jetski?

4 the coast guard sets are very eye catching. the color scheme is making me want to pick up the entire line, although the off-shore platform hasn't been released state-side yet. i've had my eye on this particular set for a few weeks now and is near the top of my to buy list. with instructions provided on lego.com, i build a dr. infero version of the jet ski to replace the one used in mission 2: swamp raid. it's a very sturdy design, bulky enough to make it feel like a real vehicle. great review, too. thank-you for the closer look at the set.

3 erdbeereis1, on sep 3 2008, 04:36 pm, said: it gets placed on top of this piece. i thought so, so thanks for confirming!

4 arrgh me hearties! let's join the pirates as they try to steal the sacred treasure from the islanders' hands. it won't be easy, king kahuka and his loyal warriors closely guard the treasure 24 hours a day. will the pirates with their trusty pistols and cutlasses be able to defeat the islanders' spears, pet alligator and powerful leafy skirts? we will find out! 6262 king kahuka's throne set info set name: 6262 king kahuka's throne theme: pirates-islanders released: 1994 price: ??? (i don't know the original price. i got it from bricklink with no box for $17. unfortunately, i was not able to locate the euro or pounds price.) pieces: 123 minifigs: 5 off we go! unfortunately, i don't have the box because i didn't like the idea of spending over $50 for a set with under 200 pieces. so sorry, no box pics. instructions i think the image on the front is very good. it seems less setup somehow than the instructions these days. it looks more like someone snuck up on them while they were going about their duties and snapped away rather than something that was planned. the parts a nice selection here. there is a pretty good amount of printed pieces in this set which is always nice. for example, the zebra print tile, as well as the pirate flag nowadays would almost certainly be stickered. the set also comes with a nice dark grey burp and a red boat for the pirates. the minifigs the main buying point of this set for me were the minifigs. this set comes with 5 of them which is quite good for a small set like this, especially when compared to the sets of today. the set comes with 1 alligator, 2 pirates, 2 islander warriors and king kahuka himself. i really like the islanders' torso and leg prints. the leafy skirts are a nice touch and the make-up on the faces is superb. some parts i liked these shields have a nice design on them and i always like the treasure chests. a picture inside the manual this is a feature that i liked in the manual, it shows an overhead view of the baseplate so it's much easier to find where to put the piece. i certainly could have used this feature in last year's aquabase invasion set. a close-up of the king the face print is nice. i wonder who kahuka's make-up artist is.... the finished set! first, the pirates' boat the boat is really nice. the sail is made out of a nice cloth, and connects simply to the mast. and now, the main part of the set, the throne! this is a really nice model. i think the colors and the design make it really feel like a different part of the lego world. the rock sculpture looks fantastic as well. the throne, which is sort of a stretcher thing attaches here. it connects on a 1x2 tile with a stud in the middle for easy removal here is the treasure that the pirates seek the treasure rests on tiles inside of the rock. the zebra print tribal drum this is simple but nice. one thing that's great about this which i mentioned earlier, is that this and all of the other pieces with designs on them are printed. that's right, no stickers to be found here! i have used these zebra-print tiles many times for mocs, as they make a great exotic detail piece. the lovely rock head i think this is wonderful. it really adds a lot to the set. it is well built with grey slopes, curved pieces for the mouth and nose, headlight bricks for the eyes and feathers and horns for detail. the backside the complete set! overall, this looks great in my opinion with great landscaping and some fun parts. well, it looks like the pirates walked all over the islanders and stole their treasure... in fact, it looks like it was pretty brutal. brickshelf folder now, for the the ratings! price: 8/10 (for $17 not a great price per piece value. but when you add 5 figs in, it makes it a decent price. plus this set hasn't been in stores for 14 years so that adds some cost) parts: 9/10 (the set has some really nice printed parts, as well as a baseplate, which in my opinion, is great) design: 9/10: (no flaws that i can think of right away. the rock face is very well built) playability: 8/10 (not really anything to play with, although you can sail the ship and steal the treasure) build: 9/10 (rock face uses nice techniques and the rest of the set is simple but looks good) minifigs: 10/10 (the minifigs are just fantastic. great prints, and just overall fun. overall: 53/60 bricklink entry peeron brickset it looks like the pirates have picked up a new recruit from the island... summary the older lego sets have a really different look to them than the new sets, and i think it's nice to have a mix of new and old. this is definitely a great set with a nice build and great minifigs. add to this the great printed pieces and that old pirate charm, and you get a very nice set that i can certainly recommend. thanks, and happy building! edited by erdbeereis, 17 august 2009 - 02:39 am.

4 what a wonderful review with smart (showing the right parts) and clear pictures. fantastic job erdbeereis1! this set is interesting for several reasons. first of all it contains a large amount of (very) useful minifigs. not many sets of this size contain so much figs. secondly, the throne itself can be easily combined with the other islander sets or even with other pirate and non-pirate sets. i'm going to see if i can get this one for a reasonable price on ebay.

4 great review, well done for sure!! i love these reviews of old set, and this one is especially unique. i must agree with you the color scheme is magnificent. makes me want to go to ebay and buy it now! to bad for spongebob though, he got in with a real bad crowd...

4 excellent review! i want this set now!

1 thanks for the great review. this set is pretty standard as islanders go, but it is such a cool subtheme that i don't care a bit. i totally agree with your comment about old and new sets. i don't think i would enjoy lego as much if i didn't have a decent amount of kits from pre 1999.

4 an outstanding set because who doesn't love islanders. outstanding review as well.

4 well, for some weird reason i missed this before, so i tell you now: very good review (as we are used of you, erdbeereis1). i like all the islander sets, and own quite a few myself! for people that don't own any of the islander sets yet, the 6262 king kahuka's throne is a great way to start! lots of minifigs and accessories!

1 i do not like the fact that the clones have pure white legs. it looks weird to me. it was also weird that they included shock troopers, but it was probably a way to get people to buy it. this set also seems like one of those that was kind of thrown in with a mix of other sets like the tie crawler. i never picked it up, and with the new clone wars sets out, i won't.

3 baby, on aug 29 2008, 12:54 pm, said: has anyone noticed the boxart includes the 3rd leg both in the lowerd position as well as the raised one? stauder.

3 i switched my shock trooper legs as soon as i got this set. as for the new pieces, i'm pretty sure that they were also featured in the striking venom set. nice in depth review! i switched my shock trooper legs as soon as i got this set. as for the new pieces, i'm pretty sure that they were also featured in the striking venom set. nice in depth review!

3 did anyone encounter the problem with the main turret? apparently, the very tip of the piece (cone shape) can't be put onto the "pole" piece. i check the instructions 2 times and still can't find what i'm doing wrong. is it just me or did anyone else got this problem as well?

1 i could have gotten this set if i wanted to but it seemed like a waste of money to me. i don't like the shock troopers helmets that much. i feel they should have printed visors instead of cut out ones like they have in my opinion it would make it look a lot better. the at ap itself sounds like it has a lot of holes in its cockpit which drags the set down and make it seem like they haven't exactly put a lot of effort into it. great review!

4 product: 7681 separatist spider droid™ (ssd) theme: star wars: the clone wars no of pieces: 206 release date: 26 july 2008 rrp: sgd59.90/usd29.90 availability: lego shop@home, target, toys 'r' us (worldwide). quote conquer the galaxy, one planet at a time! unleash the power of the separatist spider droid™! this towering engine of mechanical destruction from the clone wars strides across hostile terrain on four independently positionable stilt legs, then uses its movable laser cannons to blast republic forces. includes commander fox™, clone trooper™, battle droid™, super battle droid™ and battle droid commander™ minifigures! rotate the laser cannon on top! laser cannon underneath bends to change direction! measures 6" (15cm) tall and 10½" (27cm) wide! also known as the homing spider droid, this is what i would usually reckon as a mini-fig set if not for the high price point. since there's a total of 5 mini-figs to be had, and at least 3 of them are going to be high sought after.(commander fox™, clone trooper™, battle droid commander™). at first glance, it looked like there's only 3 packets. actually, it's a total of 4 packets, 1 of the packet is inside the biggest packet. it's not a very complex build. took me around 25min since i was playing around with the mini-figs more than i was building up the spider droid. though finally, here's the completed build-up. usually for lego products, what excites me are the vehicles, yet this set is the other way round. yes, the mini-figs are definitely the crowd-pleaser this time. on with the review. here's the close-ups of the droids in the following order, battle droid commander™, battle droid™, & super battle droid™. there's not much to comment on the droids, except that the battle droids come with the new arm that's able to hold the blaster properly upright. the sbd is the same dude that can be found easily in the previous droid battlepack. and now the good part... clone troopers. and that's commander fox, and his trooper. i was quite mystified by the amount of accessories given to the clone troopers as per the instruction booklet, as there wasn't any indication of what they were... (commlink, grenades, sensor scope, range finder?!?) then it hit me... real hard. notice anything yet? yup, it's a night scope, and a range finder. that, plus the visor that's available to fox too. now, this is really a good time to start troop building for the clone wars. :twisted: here's the weaponary. of course, let not forget the main dude... fore: port: aft: starboard: the ssd looks very similar to the actual screenshots from aotc, though am still wondering what's that little translucent red piece for... a re-enactment. and a comparison. this set is really either a miss or a hit. for me, it's a hit, due to the mini-fig count, and the wide array of accessories. it's going to probably be a hit depending on the movie that's coming out this month, since we have commander fox here(i heard that c.fox hasbro figure is a target exclusive, meaning it's gonna be another highly sought after). this set is also stated to be a limited edition, and seeing as how it's only available so far in only 1 toys r us in sg, this just might not be available anymore after the movie starts. :d comments: this review was done immediately after the launch of the clone wars toys at the midnight launch on 26 july on a local starwars fan forum. and after having caught the movie only yesterday, i now only have this to say, "it's not part of the movie!?!". oh well, cmdr. fox probably will fair better once the tv series starts proper. then again, that less-than-one-minute cameo of him, i do find it unforgivable. this being the 2nd review available, i sincerely hope you guys enjoy it.

1 there's plenty of reviews in the review index. (pinned topic)

3 alakazam! the good wizard is the wisest minifig in all of legoland. he is a master of the wand and can see the future. with these abilities, he helps the knights predict where the trolls will strike next. because this set is not in stores in the u.s., i was luckily able to buy this set on my vacation to germany. it is interesting that it is a euro exclusive. 5614 the good wizard set info set name: 5614 the good wizard theme: castle released: 2008 price: eur 2.95-gbp 1.99 pieces: 16 minifigs: 1 the review unfortunately i don't have the box, because in got smushed in my suitcase on the plane, so needless to say, it was not in top condition... the manual the manual is an extremely small fold-out. but the image on the front is nice. on the back of the manual, there is a picture of some of the 2008 impulse sets. this is a nice feature. the parts for an impulse set this has a pretty good selection. a very nice owl, and an interesting clear ball piece. all built this set took me forever to build. i had to take numerous breaks as it was the toughest, longest build i have ever faced! for an impulse set, this actually looks pretty good. the owl perch is nice, also the crystal ball table. the wizard is a very nice fig, with great printing on the legs and hat, and i love his beard. brickshelf gallery the ratings price: 8/10 (not bad, but i feel that impulse sets are slightly overpriced) parts: 7/10 (impulse sets are focused around the minifig, but the parts in this set are pretty good) design: 7/10 (the crystal ball is a good idea, and the owl perch is simple but nice) playability: 6/10 (there is not much to play with here) build: 8/10 (as i said before, it took forever. really it took all of 1 minute) minifig: 10/10 (the wizard is fantastic) overall: 46/60 bricklink lego s@h brickset abracadabra, blades of four... you are now a dinosaur! summary for an impulse set, this is very nice. the wizard is an excellent fig, and getting an animal in a cheap set is always great. i would definitely recommend this set. thanks, and happy building!

3 good review for a simple set. while it does come with the basics for an impulse set, i just feel that it lacks something though i am not sure what. perhaps a printed magic scroll? i am still not a fan of the printed cap (especially the stars), but i do like the printed pants displaying his various goodies hanging from his belt. the plain torso is to be expected from a wizard minifig i suppose. overall, it's not a bad set but it certainly feels to be lacking something, imo.

3 i scream clone, on aug 31 2008, 02:27 am, said: kudos on a well presented and written review. i think the reason this set didn't release in us was because it didn't have any warnings about choking anywhere on the box, therefore no lawsuits in us for lego. cheers isc no that's not the reason. i'm sure you'll get this set eventually. as for the box, well, there's always been 2 box-designs - one for the us and one for eu (actually there's an asian one as well). the eu doesn't have the box count or the don't swallow (we know that). the us version has the brick count and don't swallow warning (typical us). thanks for a super review strawberry-ice-man. i like the wizard, i'm only sorry they put him in an impulse set. who'd want an army of medium blue wizards? so it's the worst army builder, but a cool wizard. does that make sense?

1 thanks for the review. considering the price, i give it "below average". i didn't buy any of the space impulse sets as i don't think they are good value.

4 nice set, lucky you! the only reason i buy the mm impulse sets is lack of good space minifig packs like this nowadays ...

4 7670: hailfire tank and spider droid number of pieces: 249 number of minifigs: 4 price: 19.99 usd/ 25.99 eur/ 19.99 gbp brickset hello everyone, today i will review the extremely underrated hailfire tank and spider droid set. i hope this review does it justice. so, let's start with the box: note: this picture is not mine. standard box for star wars in that time. the background on the box looks like it's from geonosis, indicating that this set is from episode ii, and not iii or the clone wars. the back of the box (not shown) shows the playability functions and some other sets that were released at the same time as this. overview here is an overview of the whole set. it comes with one construction manual and no sticker sheets ( ). this is a very simple set, but with not much to it, it is still a very important part of the cis army, especially if you are interested in army building. i like to call this set a "super battle pack", and you'll find out why soon. let's get right to it, and look at the feature of the set: the hailfire tank. front a front view of the very cool tank. here you can see two triangular shields on the hull. the main body is very simple, but altogether very effective and clever, and making it really look like a hailfire tank, although a little bit sized down from it's movie version. the trans-red stud used as the "eye" makes the tank look more menacing. side the side view. the wheels are very easy to make, but it's a real pain to connect all of those chain links together. i don't see what you could use the links for, except for another tank, but maybe someone creative will find something for these. the dark tan is nice though. the wheels are held on by technic poles, and the tank rolls on the wheels fairly well on carpet or a hard surface. back this is the back of the tank. here you can see eight flick-fire missiles (four on each side) of the new type, so they don't easily fall out. also note the modified 2x2 with extended hole piece sticking out of the back. this may be used to easily push around the tank. i just wish you could fit a droid in the body for the cockpit... now we move on to the spider droid, or what i like to call "the dwarf spider": the front. this one is also simple, but very cleverly built. the main body is two semi-spheres connected together for rotation, and an antenna, a cannon, four legs, and eyes made out of a useful telephone piece. the picture speaks for itself as far as how the gun and eyes are built. side a side view. you can now see the legs better, which are more sturdy then you would think. each one is made out of two pearl bronze exo-force robot arms, a useful bley handgun piece, and a dark bley battle droid body, all connected to the under body (a big knob-like piece). back the back. not much to say here. i like this spider droid because it is very sturdy, and the legs are easy to adjust. finally, we look at the minifigs: there are four minifigs in this set, which is quite generous for a set of this size. it comes with a yellow battle droid commander (i really like this one), two battle droids, and a super battle droid. all three battle droids have the new blaster pistols and one twisted arm. that's about it for the review, so here is the final verdict: build: 8/10, very fun and easy, besides the chain links. should take the seasoned builder less than 20 minutes. playability: 7/10, the flick-fire missiles are fun, as well as just zooming around the tank. could use some clones for a battle. swooshability: 8/10, you can roll around the hailfire fairly well. minifigs: 9/10, a generous amount of figs, and all are pretty good. design: 9.5/10, a really simple and clever set, although a little too small for the movie version. price: 10/10, a very fair price considering the price-per-parts ratio and the coolness of the set. overall score: 8.5/10, a very neat set to have, a great army builder, and great for display next to all of the other cis sets. the price is fair, the figs are good, and the build is very clever. that's all for now, folks. please feel free to give some feedback! edited by jimbutcher, 15 september 2008 - 03:08 am.

1 thanks for sharing this review with us. i think this one of the sets. in europe this thing is waaaay overpriced and thus makes it a crappy set. we pay nearly double the us price. so i rated it poor. also because the figs included does not make it great. the hailfire is well designed and looks great, but that's just about all there is worthy of a positive mentioning. sorry. [on a side note: as a bronze-awarded student, where's the price in eur and gbp? and where's the poll?] [nevermind the poll, i've added that one for you ]

4 thanks for the review, jimbutcher. i really like that set. it combines interesting and good design with some awesome cool parts and a neat amount of charm.

1 thanks for the review. is a great one. this set is not really a good set but i like the spider droid. the hailfire droid scale is not right, i think it is suppose to be even bigger. anyway, this is the first set that re-release the commander droid. so i grab it.

3 this is a must have set for aotc fans and i really love the hailfire droid but it costs like $80 or more now that its discontinued.

4 i love the look of this set it's the closest to getting a walking eye from the venture bros. as well as the droids and troopers :)

3 thanks for the review. i really do like the first year of ef. nowadays they mecha are perhaps more cleverly designed, and use ball joints for playability. but i really love the blocky bulky look of the first drone's machines. and somehow the older ones seem a better value of parts. i'm more inclined to buy duplicates of them than the newer models.

4 thank you for that fine review, thebrickster! i really like how this two small sets create an intense and adventurous atmosphere against the backdrop of a pretty exotic region. the sets´re well designed and very nice with a fine amount of rather unique and well fitting gear. the whole theme offers a lot of playability in a set-up that´s a little different to tlc´s standard sceneries for sure. and... it always reminded me of 'who goes there?', too...

4 hi! great review on one of my favourite themes! i never realized how cool it was until just now, when you did your review. anyways, i remember my one set of the arctict expedition, the arctic expedition pack

1 a nice set review. as for the theme itself, i though it was a very interesting theme. sadly i don’t think lego put enough effort into it, i was personally upset not to se a second year even if i didn’t buy any of the sets. it reminds me of the artic theme playmobil did at one point in the distant past to be honest. i think a number of good artic scenes were missed, when it came out a really wanted to get a ski plane but it never came, i built it myself in the end but i don’t know how lego missed that one. on a slightly random note i do know that at least one lego minifig did make it all the way to the real artic with a research team, sadly i don’t have any pictures to offer you.

3 i find it amusing that the numbers on the decal (for the flag) were chosen so that it wouldn't look stupid if you put it on upside-down by accident.

3 46Â°45â?²4â?³n, 741Â°21â?²7â?³w??? those are some wierd coordinates.

4 thank you very much for this review, thebrickster! i voted both times for outstanding because: i really the arctic theme. i only bought the ice sailor but otherwise no sets because of money and place reasons and because i already collect four themes (city, older castle, western and star wars old triology). but a comeback of the arctic theme - perhaps as addition to a winter sports and winter rescue theme would be very welcome! i really all sets - the little and the big ones. in my opinion they all were very well designed (not too big vehicles, not too little and not minimalitic, great minifigs and very nice and lovely details and accessory). klaus-dieter

3 wasn't there some years back a film based on aliens in the arctic? can't remember the name and i think it was really old, but there certainly was going on something with strange creatures and a polar base

3 on this, the first anniversary of the news organization that has become so near and dear to your hearts, eb news is pleased to present a very special feature that we've only added recently: the eb news review! this is really our third such extravaganza, but the first one to actually be done right, so it's my great honour to welcome all of you to this event. i'm your hostess with the mostest, er, host, imperialshadows, getting in the way and generally causing mayhem will be staudie, of course, and actually presenting the review will be cub reporter and senior reviewer, whitefang! yes, the ever popular whitefang of the reviewer's academy. you know him, you love him, let's hear some applause! *audience cheers wildly* oh, that's too kind, now how about some for whitefang? name: airplane mechanic theme: lego system / town / city year: 2006 pieces: 26 minifigs: 1 price: usd$3.50 the featured set will be a 7901 airplane mechanic. this is the smallest set ever released in the city sub theme, airport. we will be bringing you to on site experience in the hanger. today our special guest is a mechanic who is specially trained to handle with jet engine turbines. *camera rolls* aren't our pose look so cool? staudie, your clothes are still white. let's just all try to smile until this picture is done. look at our special guest. he can still smile in that weird position of his. quiet you! *interviewing process* i am the airplane mechanic, holding a grade 2 license. my specialisation is to maintain and repair jet turbines of 7893 and 7894 passenger planes. we have many mechanics, 24/7, across international airports, making sure that the planes are in safe condition. we are able to maintain from rolls royce, pratt & whitney and general electric engines as well. this is the trolley to push the turbine engine around. this model is used for passenger planes 7893 and 7894 series. look at the size of the turbine. it required actually 4 engine turbines like this, to power a 7893 passenger plane aircraft. i have all these nice essential tools, to work on that engine behind me. there is a wrench, hammer, oilcan, open end wrench, power drill and screwdriver. *whistles innocently* geez, he thought no one would notice him pushing the engine away? *testing process* as you can see, the crane is firm and sturdy. it is able to lift the engine at a certain height. hey get off there! for goodness sake, this is not a rodeo. yee-ha! whitefang must fixed his loose wires. i knew we shouldn't let him read those superman comics on break. give a man a cape, and he thinks he can fly. *the audience laughs* what's so funny? it's dangerous to stand at that position. staudie, are you done with your measuring yet? almost there. *clang bang clank* oof! get this thing off me! i'll push, you pull! let's get moving! *clang* i think i sprained my pride. no, wait, it's my back. i gave up my pride when i took over this news organization. *shadows flips the engine, crushing whitefang* get that hook off my head... guess, we are heading for a commerical break at the moment. wait up, let me pull the white curtain. that's all, everyone. with me, staudie bringing the end of the show. imperialshadows and whitefang are currently in the legoland hospital where whitefang is getting patched up and shadows is flirting with the nurses, mostly. i really hope you loved this interactive review brought to you by eb news reviews. overall, we felt that this was a very good impulse set with a wide range of mechanical tools and an extra turbine to play with. therefore, we recommend you to get it since it's very affordable. anyway, every airport need mechanics/engineers to maintain the aircrafts to make sure it's certified to fly. this is too formal. i hate reading it from whitefang's script. it's best to do it in staudie's style. yo yo yo, whazzup? er. no, that isn't it either. um... thanks for viewing! i hope to bring you another exciting and information review soon, here on eb news reviews! *camera fades*

4 it's amazing! it's stupendous! it's almost like whitefang is a reviewer with previous experience! it's almost like i wrote all of shadow's lines! it's almost like staudie is being as annoying as ever. oh wait, that's all true! great review of a neat little set. i used mine as the air conditioning unit on the roof of my chinese restaurant. then some dork told me it didn't look believable or something. i liked it. um... so. great review! thanks for presenting it! i give you a and, let's just take a moment to get sentimental. a year ago, today, staudie had a lame idea: interview the members of eb. he flailed around with it for a few interviews, including the infamous one where hinck attention whored sinner into a corner and sinner were featured, reprising their roles from the whacker and the walrus. it was quite memorable, but then, a short time later, someone new joined the team, bringing it to a new level of polish and bad jokes. still, this tribute isn't dedicated to that genius of the written word, nay, it's dedicated to the whole staff, including the new guy who is still a secret so don't bother asking, i'm not telling! ha! i salute you, eb news, it's been a damn fine year! i hope i can survive another.

4 great review, whitefang and co.! a thoroughly enjoyable one, i'm glad we have a series of reviews that you can expect to be packed with humour and craziness. looking forward to the next! ~peace

4 2872 witch and fireplace review theme: fright knights parts: 18 figs: 1 price: unknown (bricklink $5.00+) year: 1997 brickset peeron brickshelf bricklink ever wanted to turn into a animal, wanted to curse your enemy or just wanted to be rich beyond your wildest dreams. you should go visit the witch and her fireplace. she can brew you up a potion for any occasion or purpose. so head down to see the witch right now. although this set is from the fright knights theme it can easily fit in with any other castle theme due to the lack of specialised fright knight parts and printings. the set comes with no astounding parts but looks like the source for our good magician impulse set from the current castle theme. i think i got this as a promo set. official pic. the box art for the set has the standard fright knight background and lego system logo followed by the set number. down the left hand side of the box a cat is attempting a head stand. also i think this box display the contents of the set in an attractive set up as usual. 1. the whole set minifigs and all here is the witch. on the torso there is a spider amulet which is a little hard to make out due to the low res of the image. the witches wand is the same as the bellville fairy wands except in trans red like a lightsaber blade although it is completely useful as a lightsaber. as you have probably noticed the witch has no legs instead she has a slope brick with the dress pattern printed on witch (get it witch-which) looks better than asajj ventress' from the new clone wars sets in my opinon. (for this anyway) the fairysaber (new word) duel. this is the old run down fireplace of the witch. at the base there are two smouldering coals instead of fire witch (it's not funny any more is it?) doesn't make that much sense seeming as it is a fireplace. the little triangular brick on top doesn't really do anything i also accidentally put the wrong one on while building, it should be a sloping brick. here are the coals. the old trans orange studs are less translucent than the new ones. i like how they have places them above the main baseplate on a 1x2 plate so they are in line with the rest of the fire place other wise it would look wrong. here is everything else i haven't covered yet, the crystal ball, the pets and the magical potion vial. the crystal ball is identical to the one included with the good wizard impulse form the current castle theme. i like the molds for the cat and the bat although if the cat had some yellow printing for the eyes like the white cat had black for the eyes it would be much better. i think the trans green tube things are a little uncommon but i'm not worried about that. 2. overall build: 6/10 extremely puzzling and difficult do not attempt alone . it's pretty simple but seeming as it has a load of stuff you can move around it is good. minifigs: 9/10 i really like the witch and it couldn't have really come with anyone else also it came with the wand which is really good too. design: 8/10 it should have come with some fire and maybe some more orange bricks to put at the base. parts: 8/10 the minifigure isn't bad nor are the animals or the trans green part. price: 10/10 i am guessing this was pretty good. seeming as i think i got this as a promo i gave it 10 because it was free. playability: 7/10 as wth all impulse sets there isn't much here but at least it comes with some animals to have a fight with or give the witch rabies. overall: 8/10 if it came with some more stuff for the fire place and the cat was more detailed it would have scored higher but because this set can easily be intergrated with other castle sets it got a mighty 8. 3. mini comic ! hocus pocus magic shocus turn my pets into dinosaurs (not to catchy is it?) *poof* oh know i think i might drink my magical potion glug glug glug oh! my

4 i chose above average. it has a great minifigure.... i wish i had it....someday i will!

3 you already know how i feel about the review. as for the set, i'm not entirely sure. it's a fine witch, but you've already gotten her in the witch's windship and a few other sets. i vote average on this. a good minifig (though one does not have the need for more than one witch) and some fine additional parts.

3 i voted "average" think the minifig and black cat are great.

4 kimt, on sep 30 2008, 12:55 am, said: you're damn right, that is strange why is this your favourite? please explain, i'd love to find that out haha! i wish i could. well, i like small sets, and this is, aside from the fright knight's flying machine, comes in the smallest lego box i have seen. i just like the look and story feel of the set. i wish lego put out more sets like this and the 3075 ninja master's boat.

3 review of 7670 hailfire droid and spider droid *updated* theme: sw episode ii / clone wars parts: 249 (- figs) figs: 4 price: £20.00, $20.00, ?‚?25.99 year: 2008 i think many people were deterred from this set because of the low piece count and a high price for it although it does come with 4 minfigures. 1. overall set and figs official box pic. this indicates it is a geonosis set from the background but it is no different from any other set same old brown separatist ship/s. the whole set. some red tan droids would have been nice like in the geonosian fighter set. all the minifigs. the super battle droid body is slightly different to the one in the bp. it looks more grainy and silver. i doubt this has any relevance for it being a geonosis set but i like them better how they were in the bp's the super battle droid body dwarfing the commander droids body. i think that the new commander droids body is better than the old one with just the yellow strip even though it is less accurate. new twisted battle droid arm, each droid has one of these. i don't really like having droids with these new guns i think the older guns suited them much better. 2. hailfire droid hailfire droid by itself. it is certainly smaller than the original. seeming as this is the main part of the set i was hoping it would be bigger but i don't mind it being this small too much. wheels and rockets can fold outwards and inwards the wheels which spin round two large clear discs and made from loads of these tiny links. this is probably the best way to make the wheels on this small scale. the only other alternatives i can think of are using the tracks from the wookiee attack set or catterpilla tracks, both of which wouldn't look right. one of the missile pods. these use the new flick-fire missiles which don't fall out are an excellent idea. they should have come with the purple cones like on the magna guards staffs instead of red though because in the film the missiles are purple. one of the new flickfire missiles that don't drop out when the model is tilted forward. i don't know what the holes in them are for though. the 3 "eyes" are made up of 2 trans red cheese bricks for the sides and 1 trans red stud for the center.you can also see how the missile pods are attached to the side of the body. this is the back of the hailfire droid. there is a plate with a hole in, i have found only one purpose for this. the hailfire droid is the commander droids war chariot! what do you use the plate for? 3. spider droid the spider droid. the design has been greatly improved from the wookiee attack set. not only is it more accurate but also more poseable which is useful when setting up battle scenes. the ball joint provides the place to put the antenna which isn't long enough but the dome form the old set looks more like the droid form star wars episode ii. the eyes are made of a telephone piece with 2 trans red studs on. in the original it had orange studs. the eyes can be seen in action 2 pics down. i told you it was a telephone. 1 of 4 identical legs. these are very easy to adjust into what ever position you want and are much better than the originals. but a word of warning never pull them apart as i did they become very loose when put back together so i put some blue tack in the holes. 4.overall build: 7/10 a little to repetitive for my liking. minifigs: 8/10 4 figs for £20 isn't too bad plus they come with new guns. design: 9/10 both vehicles are very well designed but the hailfire's small size let the set down. parts: 8/10 comes with lots of useful (maybe not ) brown track links. price:7/10 not too bad with 4 figs and loads of little brown links. playability: 6/10 not to much on it's own overall: 7/10 if it came with some clones and tan red droids it would be better. afetr jar jar wiped out a small droid patrold he realized he was being watched mesa in big dodo this time...

1 thanks for the review. this set never got me, so i didn't get it! i also don't like the droid-head-only thing and i haven't bought any set like that. i planned to buy this on sale... but it never happend.

4 is your knight army feeling short? do your knights get consistently run over by the skeletons? if so, this is the set for you! 852271 knights battle pack set info set name: 852271 knights battle pack theme: castle released: 2008 price: usd 12.99-gbp 6.49-eur 9.95 minifigs: 5 it's army building time! packaging the figs come in a plastic box with a slide out tray. to open, you slide out a tab on the bottom, and pull the tray out. the weapons one plus of this set is the good weapon selection. you get a whopping 5 shields, a spear, a lance, acrossbow, a pointed lance thing and a lovely chrome sword minifigures now the main focus of this set, the figs! one thing that's nice here is that you get a good selection of different knights. the figs are quite nice, with different faces and helmets for almost every one. minifig backsides! i really like the archer's quiver. two sided head the archer has a scared head on the other side. brickshelf folder and now, the ratings! price: 6/10 (certainly a bit overpriced. it should have been $10. the star wars battle packs have only 1 less fig plus some parts for $5 less) parts: 8/10 (no bricks, but a nice selection of weapons) minifigs 9/10 (the figs are great) overall: 23/30 lego s@h brickset bricklink even with a bigger army, the poor knights are no match for modern technology... summary even though the pack is a bit overpriced, it is still great for increasing your army's size. i would get this set if you are a castle fan looking to expand your army, otherwise don't worry if you pass on this set. thanks, and happy building!

3 i've been thinking about buying this. i haven't bought any castle sets since kk2. plus i really need that scared face.

3 how were you able to get three small shields. i only got two in mine. i am going to check the trash just in case.

3 swman, on oct 6 2008, 07:27 am, said: how were you able to get three small shields. i only got two in mine. i am going to check the trash just in case. i think it only comes with two. the extra one probably slipped in from another set. sorry for any confusion!

4 i love this set. i bought one when i went to the lego store at downtown disney, and went home and bought another online. i love that it gives you a variety of weapons and figures. i like using the bowl helmet guy to man my catapults and crossbows.

1 it's way to expansive for what you get, besides you pay more for the package then its containts...

1 i like your review on this battle pack. but i think that this battle pack was over priced. $12 for this? i am not paying that much for 5 knights.

1 yeah i have to admit, you expect it to be wayyy cheaper since: a. no packaging to pay for(baggies and such) b. no liscensing fees(like sw) so why isn't this set a better deal than sw battlepack? don't look at me, look at tlc(he he it rhymed)

4 thanks for this fine and elaborate review on the 2nd best impulse set there is. (yes the troll warrior wins by a zillion miles) i've added it to the index

3 i like this set mostly because it has some very usable pieces, but also because of the amount of minifigures in the set, which is a whopping three and one large animal (skeleton horse). the one thing, however, that i don't like about it, is that one of the catapult operators isn't armed. in my opinion, this would have been a good time for tlg to release a suitable dagger piece (not the kitchen knife) for its castle line. great review, by the way, it captured the key elements of this fantastic small set.

4 nice review, it seems that you really covered all aspects of this fantastic set. my favorite part about it is probably the fact that you can give almost every included minifig a mount, except for one poor knight . however, another part i like is that the horse includes a plain saddle, which is a nice relief after the overabundance of the gold-plate barding, which is nice, but overused in the early sets. also, the sw jokes are hilarious! i particularly the running gag with the walker, but i like this one too. reason for edit: i made a mistake due to a loss of internet and an accidental post. edited by francis marion, 03 september 2008 - 03:32 am.

4 that's a super review erdbeereis1, as usual and as we can expect from one of the academy teachers. i gave the set a 4 (above average) because i think there are quite some minifigs included for its price (which is, i think, not that expensive at all) i also like the parts that are included, like the sceleton horses and weapons, wheels,... imho this set is a great armybuilder ! btw: in belgium i have seen this set being sold for 15,99 euros.

4 great review, erdbeereis1 this really is a fantasic set. let's hope lego makes more sets like these (with 5 minifigs+4 horses at a price of $19.99? ) actually, it's about rm200 here. and it's not even price-to-piece count. anyways, amazing review, ad if i could get more castle sets this year, i might even join the reviewer's academy

4 7040 dwarves' mine defender theme: castle released: 2008 price: 10 usd pieces: 73 (3 minifigures) introduction: here i am, with one of the newest castle sets realeased in early 2008. it's a small battle wagon with blades on the front, probably to demolish rocks in mines. but in this case, our hero dwarf has to use his machine against the evil trolls who want to destroy his happy kingdom. there is only one small booklet for instructions, no alternate model: parts come in two bags, one for small pieces and one for bigger ones: apart from the lovely figures, the brown parts will be quite useful for any castle builder. extra parts are not even worth mentioning, there are no stickers: figures are detailed enough, dwarf is lovely with his beard but his legs won't move because he is short: figures are the main attraction for adult players. we haven't seen castle army builder sets for a long while and this is closest we've got in recent years. the dwarf is a little taller than it should have been but it's not possible to do so without creating a completely new mould for figures and that would be expensive. its beard is oversized as well but that gives him a legoish look which i like a lot. the trolls - that's what everybody calls them but i say they are orcs - are obviously evil but they are friendly enough not to scare our munchkins. but i wish they had different torsos or at least different faces like crownies. there are not enough weapons to arm everyone but the flag pole is really nice: unlike the star wars army builders, this set has very little weaponry. only one sword and one pike creates scarcity for 3 figures - star wars sets had 4 figures for same price! so i hope our middle age warriors don't come across any stormtroopers :) building in progress: when you pull the chain the catapult fires a round brick: the set has quite good playability, moving blades and firing catapult should be fun for little children. i wouldn't expect more functions for such a small sized model, it hardly covers my hand. the blades move with the front wheel on the right: there is only one little downside, there is too much friction for the wheel and blades won't move synchronized. you may come over this problem by adjusting the blade height and lining them with the wheels. mow the little buggers! you can adjust the blade height: there isn't enough room for the dwarf: folder when public: http://www.brickshel...ry.cgi?f=338578 rating: -figures: 8/10 dwarf is amazing, trolls are great too but i wish they had different faces. -parts: 7/10 brown slopes are new, rest is ok too. -price: 7/10 acceptable but we have seen sets with more figures for less. -design: 6/10 it looks kind of steampunkish but could be better with a little detail. -building: 6/10 not repeating itself, still nothing exciting. -total: 34/50 castle fans will definetely order this one but average lego player may not be interested. conclusion: overall, it's a nice set and i'd recommend it if you like the castle theme. you'll find some good use for the figures and this is the cheapest figure set of the year - at 3.33 usd each. it could have more armory and weaponry but otherwise it's quite alright. skip lunch today and order this little set! links: brickset reviews bricklink entry peeron inventory

4 lovely review, really. but the sad fact is we've seen it before, twice. http://www.eurobrick...showtopic=20293

4 i've skipped a few lunches on behalf of this set. it's a great army builder, but so are many of the new castle sets. what makes this great in my opinion is the figs - 2 orcs and 1 dwarf - what else could one want? thanks tlg for making this set and thank you for reviewing it for us review added to the index

4 i got this set last month and i can definitely say that even if you think it is one of the best sets ever, you won't fully appreciate it until you build it yourself. the elevated city station is much more complex than it looks, and the whole set is extremely detailed. the good: - as stated in the review, there's a lot of track, roughly twice as much as the last monorail made, 6991. 5 long straights too! - the designers didn't need to put in the hamburger stand or the ticket readers, but they did and made it even better - great figure selection; airport workers as well as civilians the bad (if you can call it that in such a great set): - hard to incorporate into an existing town if using the default track layout. the center loop would be inaccessible to vehicles and the layout is very large. - the monorail needs nearly a full straight section on either side of the city station or it will impact the corner of the station and stall if a curve is too close. - as far as i know the only town set with road plates that doesn't have a wheeled vehicle. a car would have been nice, a bus would have been incredible. but these small things in no way diminish from the fact that this is one of the best sets ever. edited by section8, 05 september 2008 - 01:17 pm.

4 yes, this is one of the best town sets ever.

4 who was the one who rated it "above average"?

4 an aweome review of an outstanding set.

3 thanks for all the nice comments! holodoc, on sep 5 2008, 11:05 am, said: i had to laugh when reading your comment on the minifig seats. don?t you own many of those? i don?t know where to put mine... well, of course i do have quite some seats (a drawer full actually), but this was my first set that had them in black... when i was young however (long time ago, you know ) i always had a short supply of seats, so that's why i noticed and mentioned it.... whitefang, on sep 5 2008, 02:18 pm, said: this is an outstanding review which deserved to be featured here! thank you for drawing attention to this review through classictown.net, i have not been a frequent user of the boards lately and the release has mostly passed me by but i must say that it looks like a great site! whitefang, on sep 6 2008, 06:45 am, said: are the both of you doing grading out of the academy, when he is not a student there? indeed i am no student of the academy, i have another academy (university) to attend to, leaving little time to venture around eurobricks latlely, a shame, i know... i hope my review is in accepted here despite my lack of grades concerning the art form

3 thanks for the in depth review of a set miles out of my price range! it was great to see more of this legend than the miniature square in my magazine... god bless, nathan

4 very nice review indeed. b.t.w. a lot of children just love this set. one year we had it with us to legoworld and children asked a lot of questions about it.

4 what an amazing set and a truly wonderful review! thanks simonwillems for the work you spend on this.

3 it would be cool to see a review comparing this set with the newer orange garbage truck.

4 this truck is simply beautiful! it's on my brickset wanted list! i love the colour scheme. red and yellow are the right choice for this vehicle! the back part of the truck can be opened, so it can discharge the rubbish like real garbage trucks. you've also mentioned that in your review, and i find it a wonderful detail! thanks for the review, jopiek!

4 great review, and i love the soft yellow effect to the pics imo, the most recent garbage truck should've used the same piece for lifting the cans into the big bin instead of the droid arms

4 i did not see this! nice review and beautiful truck. i like it!

4 nice set, but nicer review! looks like the set has quite some nice parts.

4 a nice set, my brother used to have this. i wish the pilot's helmet had a little printing on it, looks messed up to me.

3 i owned it and loved it when i was young ^^ i really miss it.

4 jopiek, i enjoyed this review very much! your first picture, certainly capture the essence of this lovely set. in reality, i am in the aviation line, especially aviation safety. therefore, you re-entact the scene very well. to be honest, i have never seen this set before. this aes (airport emergency service) fire truck is certainly unbelievable. i love it very much. it's a pity i never owned this. this is a set which give me a "5". great job jopiek. i enjoyed viewing your classic town reviews very much. keep up the good work!

3 jopiek, on sep 8 2008, 12:24 am, said: thanks of course for the flattery but, do you then from your profession understand what the purpose is of the front 'spouts' that even can be hide, since that puzzles me. it can be that the lego designers thought it was a nice touch and didn't bothered about the realistic value of such a feature but i don't suppose that that is the case here. somehow, i had just noticed your reply. to be honest with you, the aes in my country does not have front spouts in their fire engine. i do not remember seeing this feature before. it is a possibility that this feature is included in some models or an imaginative addition from our lego designers. i will need to check this out. kimt, on sep 9 2008, 03:16 pm, said: perhaps the front sprouses are for foaming the runway? that is a logical answer.

4 i was going to get this, but instead i got someting else (firetruck i think) nice review!

4 nice review cobra. thanks for sharing. i esp. like the doctor's torso. i rate this little set a 4 based on the design of the vehicle and the classic doors. blogged! edit: i must have missed this review after it was posted back in sep. i went ahead and kept the blog, since it's always enjoyable to look at these reviews.

4 mhh maybe put the pizza horizontally ^^ and gimme some! it was a nice set, it's a nice little crane !

3 this set looks real nice, but a wall in the middle with a stair and a few desks/containers.

3 i think the 6382 fire station is the better one from the 80ies.

4 this looks like a great set, i like the futuristic fire truck. that might be what i do with my imperial shuttle's glass cockpit.

4 found this set on a flea market in munich, yesterday. just 25 years after its release. the instructions for a total of five models, two of them printed, the other 3 are just photo instructions in the book. it still has the box in good shape, despite some wear from the age. sadly five little pieces were missing, and 5 wrong pieces inside instead (2 complete wheels and a classic 80s-90s plane wing (dumped into my bricks). but i was able to replace the missing minifig torch and the 4 missing plates with identical pieces from my collection. the box and contents the set still has the original box. inside the pieces, plastic insert, instructions and a 1987 technic catalogue, imagine that set livespan today. four years and the 8841 is still in the catalogue. classic technic design from early 80s showing a function drawing of the steering and the main model a small set, but with a flap shoeing the contents. all pieces in the inner box and the papers included. 5th model: soapbox racer this is more or less a soapbox racer with working steering, but no engine. it's got a rather blocky design, but still looks sleek enough and is a simple build little over 100 pcs out of 180. the soapbox at step 2 just included the steering at step 6 completed and ready to race downhill. total: 7/10 simple, but effective 4th model: simple chassis very simple and boring alternate using just 1/3 of the 180 pieces in the set. it even hasn't got a seat construction. it's just a plain steering mechanism attached on wheels with a spartan chassis of just a few pieces. this is the whole model at step 5 just attach the steering mechanism and wheels and you're done total: the worst alternate model of the complete set. just a boring 4/10 3rd model: balance very original small model. it's a small model of a working classic balance. and it works with small parts laid on the scales, altough they've got just a 4x4 footprint. it's a fast build. just 15 minutes and you've done it. the model as it looks at step 3 finished. easy build with just 63pcs out of 180 total: very original model, it actually works with small weights, but a very simple build. still a 7/10 alternate model: tractor with equipment this is the second model. it's a simple but boxy design featuring a harrow and a plough. the tractor has a similar design to the very first tractor set, but much smaller. the plough is about 24-wide and the harrow is completely snotted even back in 1983. has two functions: working steering and the coupler for the equipment. uses almost all pieces of the set. the tractor at step 8, the steering isn't completely attached now this is the completed tractor the complete harrow finished alternate with the plough attached. total: nice, but quite ugly and boxy design for a tractor with 4 wheels of the same size. takes me to a 6/10 main model: desert racer this is the main model, with a nice (for early 80s) but boxy design. it has two functions. steering and a working 1-cylinder rear engine, which is of the old 2x2 piston type, since the small piston design wasn't invented back then. this is the only model of the set, which has piece callouts in the instructions. the printed alternate model has no callouts, they weren't invented on both models back in 1983. the three smaller photo instruction alternates have a piece callout at the beginning showing all needed pieces. the seat is a nice, but blocky design and use a primitive snot technique. this is the model at step five. the piston is already attached. imagine this state on step 5 in modern sets. back then lego had challenging instructions, not the step madness like today this is the engine just made of plates with a hole in the middle for the piston step 9. the piston engine is completed. on step 12 the roll bar and the seat are installed. only the steering isn't completed yet. front view of the finished model. just 15 steps needed back then. bird's eye view of the whole set displayed on the box model verdict: nice design, especially the colorful seat in snot technique, but quite boxy especially the engine, since there were only the huge pistons. still a 9/10 set verdict: design and models: 7/10, very boxy designs, due to the age. the chassis alternate sucks build: 9/10 classic 80s technic building. quite challenging but fun sturdyness: 7/10: rear section damaged after the table fall, but rather easily fixed fun: 9/10 blast from the past. overall: 8/10 mfg widdi edited by widdi, 07 september 2008 - 04:11 pm.

4 a nice old classic, the driver has a nice hat and torso, and the train is well designed, except for that thing on the roof.

4 the best 12v legotrain is for me the 7740. the 7725 is still a goodlooking train and the only one with short wagons in a electric version. before i started to with bricklink, i started to build this train in blue. i've build 4 trains of it and sold 2 of them. still one for sale . you can also build this in other colors, like a yellow one: or you can build a black version, which i made a death train of it. driven by a skeleton . edited by panda9001100, 17 may 2009 - 08:01 am.

1 the images aren't working.

1 her name was sky lane. it's quite sad, though, to actually play the game--the "xtreme tower" is the only set that made it into the game itself, and it was a really watered down version of the information center from the first two games. but the island was, in the game, filled with incredible buildings that would have made really cool sets.

3 air chase woosh! the brickster's seaplane flies over the beach quickly. hippie dude is in close pursuit on his hang glider. fuel is running out for the brickster's plane. can hippie dude catch him before he either gets away or crash lands in the water... you decide, with island xtreme stunts air chase. set #: 6735 theme: island xtreme stunts year released: 2002 piece count: 83 minifigs: 2 list price: $10 (usd) a nice addition to the island xtreme stunts theme, air chase includes two air vehicles; a seaplane and hang glider. the set has nice island colors inclusing white, light blue, and orange. also includes in the set are some great chrome pieces for the brickster's airplane wings. starting with the box. you can see hippie dude in close pursuit: the back of the box depicts some nice alternate jet skis: same front box picture on the instructions: and on the backside, pictures of the video game: air chase includes two nicely detailed figs, hippie dude (for lack of his official name), and the brickster: here's a picture of the orange hang-glider: and the underside: unfortunately, the hang-glider is too heavy to be held up by a minigig. while i like the brick-built glider for the extra pieces, the plastic wing pieces from the ninja theme would have worked effectively and be a lot lighter. i think the seaplane is the best part of the set: here's a shot of the front end. i like the skeletal shark/fish design. what's great is none of the pieces use stickers. they are all printed: including the tail end: although the cockpit has no steering wheel or lever piece, it does have a very nice printed 1x2 tile: the wings of the airplane have hinges to allow them to fold inward slightly: also notice the nice chrome/silver pieces. here's a shot of the underside of the seaplane: and lastly, the complete set: final thoughts: air chase is another one of those "fun" island sets. two figs with two vehicles make a perfect combination for creating some dog-fights in the air. at the same time, the brickster's plane can land in the water to explore other adventure play opportunities. this set is also a nice addition to the island xtreme stunts truck & stunt trikes (6739). the seaplane can be hauled by the large semi-truck included within 6739. hope you enjoy this review.

1 it is not very often that i rate a legoset 'poor' (it's the first time actually), but in this case i had no other option. the idea of this set is good, and i like the mostly yellow minifig, but the design of both the airplane (weird 'window'-piece, a propellor that is way too small, minimal skies underneath and a strange colourscheme) and the hangglider (two handlebars on the wings, too many colours) makes the set mark the essence of lego's downfall during those years. i really appreciate the fact that you made a review of this set, brickster, it made me look into the details of 6735, but i am just as sure today as i was back then: i will never buy this. anyway, thanks for the review, the quality of the set may be a disapointment your review certainly is not

3 thanks erdbeereis1 for your kind words. glad you liked this set. just wondering whom has rated poor and below average. i will like to know why you voted this way. perhaps, you could share with me and the rest on your thoughts and views.

4 this is one of those sets that make me really want to start building up a city. it's a great value, has a lot of useful pieces, and is just plain fun to play with. i do miss vehicles having doors though. great review. i was a bit curious as to how the dumping mechanism worked. as well as the sticker count.

3 nice review. this is a very nice vehicle, one of my favorite of the newer city ones. jopiek: there are two generations of road plate that are wide enough for six-wide vehicles like this. the current plates are dark grey with plain white printing, and look not great in my opinion. the previous ones are imo the best road plates of all time - green with dark grey road, white dotted line/zebras, drain covers and yellow verge markings (just like we really have here in ireland). for urban area i would still choose the green-edged plates and just cover up the green - the markings are so much better than the current plates.

4 jopiek, on sep 10 2008, 01:45 am, said: also it will not empty completely because of that panel. actually, it does. the back part of the truck with the panel hinges up, so that when you want the truck to dump, it doesn't get in the way.

4 a good set, with a nice color scheme. i still prefer the last one that had a removable bin.

4 what a great set and a very nice review erdbeereis. i think the only improvement to this set would have been the use of chrome exhaust pipes and front grill. i bought this set with a lot of excitement, but unfortunately have not put it together yet. what are your thoughts on these larger 6-stud wide detailed vehicles as opposed to 4-stud wide classics? here's an image of 6668 recycle truck released in 1992: ps. i like the use of "taking out" sponge bob in your review.

4 thanks for the review! this is one of the few city sets that i own (despite loving the theme so much, most of my town is either custom or classic), and it's about as beautiful as a big garbage truck can ever be. quote nice truck indeed, but the yellow one is better i think, at least if you put them on a roadplate it seems to me that those road plates are too small for that. also it will not empty completely because of that panel. well, for the rest it is a nice set and a fine review! well, the truck barely fits onto the old roadplates (not on curves though), so if you put it in a display it probably won't look bad. i think from what i see, this and all the other 6 wide vehicles will fit much better on the newer roadplates, which are four studs wider than the old ones.

4 that looks like one of those big strange recycle trucks from new york city, i like it!

3 it would be cool if someone made a moc in which hippies steal the truck and cover it with flowers and bright colors and stuff!
