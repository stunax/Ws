0 306 lunar landing plates year released: 1979 piece count: 2 minifigs: 0 list price: unknown as part of the classic space collection, lego offered two sets of moon plates. one was a set of two crater plates, and the other, this very useful landing plate set. not much to review, but worth sharing a few images: the landing plate: and t-plate: the two plates connect to form this very nice classic space landing platform: set 497, galaxy explorer included the landing platform, but the one that i had was lighter in color than the one contained in this set (at least the yellow circle). future lego space sets could benefit by having similar road plates. share your thoughts.

1 cp5670, on jul 8 2008, 05:04 am, said: these are pretty good, but i think they look too much like the standard town roads from that period. i like the black space plates from the early 90s better (6710). oh how i love these plates. afew years ago i found a local retail store with about 6-7 sets of these in their basement warehouse i was given special access to (along with many other old space goodies.. hehe..) i love the things, i have loads, and i've used them for multiple space bases and battles. along with afew grey crater plates and the large grey plates (1.5x the size of a normal baseplate) you can get quite a monorail layout going. *sigh* i should really clean up and get one set up again, so i can take some pictures!

0 i also love these plates! i build a lot with them (e.g. this ). unfortunately they are not available in bley ...

-1 year released: 1976 piece count: 53 minifigs: 2 lego brought out floating boats quite early, and in many ways the first were the best. (i'll explain why later...) this set in particular is interesting as it came out in two versions; one that includes the first minifigs and another that included the non-armless type. (set 709.) the police signs are stickers, and are in surprisingly good condition considering the age of the set. (i am missing one sticker on the front though.) note the technic bush and axel; they are the old type. the position of the second figure is not a mistake; i think he's supposed to be sitting down.... the first boats out by lego needed a weighted keel to prevent them.... keeling over. (i have tested this!) i suspect this is because of the density of the old hulls and the flat bottom... but i could be wrong. (it can't be just because of the flat bottom as the new cargo ship doesn't need one.) the keel in detail. the bottom extension is for a motor. (not included, nor made by lego at the time.) the keel had longer studs. even now it holds extra firmly. this is why i prefer the old design. you can extend or shorten the hulls as you please, or even insert other lego in the middle. you can easily add wheels or any other piece to the bottom of these hulls. i wish they would go back to this idea; the 4+ hulls were of this concept but were too wide. (probably so the keel wasn't needed.) the old minifigs aside from having odd feet and no arms had a normal stud as the neck. thus when you turn the head it tends to come off. i love this set!

1 as you may have seen in my topic in general lego discussion, i received a bunch of old lego from my step-grandmother-in-law. among the bricks were instructions and pieces for an almost complete set 345 from 1969. i was very excited to find this out, so i put it together. i recently took it apart and re-assembled it, taking photographs along the way for the sake of eurobricks. so, without further ado, set 345: house with car. first off is the car. this was still constructed in the bucket of bricks i received, so i never took it apart: next i'll show you the instructions. lots of added bricks per step, which was fun. however, the angle of the instructions sometimes made it difficult to find where things were supposed to go. the in-build shots. finally, an all-around view of the finished set. sadly, i don't have much time to post more pictures or thoughts. however, i'll try to come back and update the review later this week. until then, enjoy!

1 great review mariko! this set is way before my time too. i like how lego used to create simple one story houses instead of the really tall house that we see in today's town theme, such as 8403 city house. one story houses such as 345 just look more realistic to my eyes. the simplistic, minimalism vibe that i get with this set is something that is hard to find in today's much more detailed sets (although, trust me, i love love love today's detailed sets). - the brick is epic

0 there's two alternates on the back of the instructions and as i recall, some sort of bridge on the inner fold or back of box. i threw away the box to this set years ago- just lucky to still have all the pieces. with standard pieces, you can build all these alternates and many more. that's why i don't particularly care for the new castles (like vladek's). they make building so difficult and duplicate pieces are so limited. here's an old shot of the castle in the city that it use to guard. we played for hours back in these days,

0 the original knights displaying their bright colored shields and breast plates (and a good wash helped to brighten them up).

0 imperialjohn, on dec 29 2005, 05:11 pm, said: i've tried this once. remember? normal white sticker sheet in an ink jet and the transparent plastic on top !! p.s. the one on the right is the homemade one!! so you're using two layers (stickers) doesn't that make it very thick?

0 here's a shot of a custom forestman. these really work well: i'm using just regular sticker paper. how do you stick transparent plastic on top?

0 i guess it's easiest to put the entire shield on a transparent sticker and cut the edges. i would also do that with the white stickers, because now you can still see the gray edges of the shield. perhaps you can make a bigger black, or brown in the other case, outline. you also wouldn't be able to see if the sticker is exactly in the middle...

0 wasn't this the first castle lego released?

1 as stated in the first post, over 2 years ago, yes, it is. this is a wonderful review, the brickster, and this would truly be a great set to own. *wub* ~peace

1 great job on this review of a unique and rare set luxorv! considering the year it was released, this must have been a cool set back then. even up to now with all the specialized pieces and advanced building techniques, i could still appreciate the beauty of this brickbuilt harley-davidson police motorbike. the various elements are instantly recognizable and it even has the unusual 'partly-stacked' plates technique for the motor. overall, i'd say this is an above average set that is a must-have for any hardcore lego collector.

1 great review! the set is really nice, i love that the front of the motercycle can turn and the engine is just beautiful, with its half stacked bricks like kieldaman said. the price used or new is quite a bit, but there is a good variety of bricks here like the bricks inside the wheels. did you get this set from your father? great review luxorv!

1 thanks for the feedback guys! indeed this is a great set, and i'm very attached to it. as far as i remember, i got it for say my 2nd birthday, i think but it is not my first lego set. you'll learn more on this in my next planned review

1 luxorv, this is a well written presentation on this lego vintage review. i never knew the existence of this set and even though the design is not part of the modern lego design concept but the overall appeal back in the 1970s certainly appeal to many. i could not mind to own such vintage lego model and put them on display and potray as if it was a chart of evolution of lego motorbikes. thanks for sharing and i can't wait to find out your next review.

1 rare classic sets are always a priceless part of any lego collection, and it's a good thing you still have this first set of yours luxor (or did you purchase a new one?). excellent review btw, it's always a pleasure getting a closer look at these classic sets which i wouldn't have known to exist had i not seen this review. overall i think it's a really good set at that time, of course judging this one by modern standards won't be fair but at the time i'm pretty sure it was a 'cool' set to have (though less cooler than having the harley davidson set).

1 thank you very much for this wonderful review! this is the oldest lego set in my collection. i received this model from my grand parents many years ago - i'm not exactly sure who in my family it used to belong to, but it has a home with me now. it's a very simple but attractive looking vehicle, and functions pretty well too. overall, very nice.

1 thanks for the great nostalgic review! great pictures, i love the shiny glow of 37 year old bricks! sets were simpler back then, but not less exciting in their own way. i wasn't even born in 1973, but one of my first sets was the 1982 update of this, 6630 bucket loader. almost 10 years later, but the very same bucket assembly, only the colours have changed.

1 ah, the good old days........thanks for the review 'yoshi648' - cute and cool at the same time. it's interesting to see that the same front end parts had been used from the early 70's up in to the late 90's ! nice again to step back in time and keep on bricking everyone !

0 well, it's not exactly a large shuttle, but still a nice set: 442 space shuttle year released: 1979 piece count: 79 minifigs: 1 vehicles: 0 list price: unknown this little classic was my smallest classic space set. believe it or not, i still have the box: here's the back: the instructions are pretty tattered and missing a section. i had to download some from the web: but the ship is again intact, missing only one grey 1x3 plate: i've always liked this computer piece: here's the under side. this set included the small classic jet engines: a close-up of the sloped printed space brick: and the complete set with minifig: this set was a great little space ship that made a nice addition to the blue space theme. as small as it was, it could hold two-three figs (one standing up). i don't even think the mars mission recon drop ship holds three figs. in any case, it was a must-have for blue space fans, and probably only a few bucks back in the day. swoosh!

1 and again those tears in my eyes. with original box...! i really love those classic space stuff. looks like i need to clean my stuff this summer.

1 this was my first space set ever!! 1979, 1980... don't know anymore, but i do remember i got this together with 897 for my birthday when we where camping... with a little luck i may even have an old film from my dad, opening the boxes... well what to say... it looked soooooo aggressive with those two engines! but i never knew why you needed two steering wheels on it... they probably just thought a symmetrical model was better .... i can't blame them... what a nice set.... it would even sell today, no doubt... looooots of swooshability...

0 indexed everyone remembers their first time. for me, it was in 19*cough*somethingsomething*cough*. we were at her house, and her mother was gone for at least an hour. she slowly unzi... uhhh. sorry, wrong story. um, yeahh. anyway, i do remember my first time. it was 1977, in late summer. our neighbor, who worked for a department store called famous-bahr, said that the main store had a travelling lego display. so my family filed into the car and drove into downtown st louis to see this display. to tell you the truth, i don't remember much about the display itself, but i do remember that my parents bought me my first lego set. set # 456, the spirit of st louis. set #: 456 (also sold as set # 661) name: spirit of st louis theme: legoland / large vehicle year: 1977 pieces: 49 minifigs: 0 price: $5.00 usd? (bricklink misb start @ $175.00 usd, used complete ~$35.00 usd) links: peeron, bricklink, brickset packaging box front: the original box that my set came in was most likely trashed 5 minutes after returning home. this image was lovingly stolen off of the peeron page for this set. i feel lucky that i even got this much. similarly, i have no pictures of the plastic baggies the set came in. truth be told, i can't be sure that there even were plastic baggies that the parts came in. the set side view: well there she is. my first set ever . actually, i seem to recall the real spirit of st louis was silver colored, not black and yellow. if you need a history lesson, the spirit of st louis was charles lindbergh's plane when he made the first trans-atlantic solo flight. more details can be found on the wikipedia page. the overall shape is pretty close, at least. the cockpit window could stand to be moved forward one stud, but everything seems to be relatively close. the tail piece isn't the right shape, but it is likely the only tail piece lego produced at the time. if you look closely, you can see the various bite marks that my brother and i inflicted over the years. i know some people would be aghast that there are bite marks, but brick separators wouldn't come out for another 10 years. besides, we were young. we didn't know any better. i certainly had no idea that it would become my obsession. there are some interesting part choices here. everything is brick and plate built, as you might expect. the same set nowadays would have lots of slope, wedges and wedge plates to round things out. but lego was all about the brick in '77, so bricks are what we got. the black inverted slopes worked pretty well asthetically as the wing struts. the wings are simple 4 x 10 plates, nice and square. there were no minifigs in this set. if i remember correctly, 1977 was just about the time when minifigs made their first appearance. i know i have one other set from '77 that does include a minifg, at least. i don't have a lot of comments for the following photos. i'll let the pictures speak for themselves. 3/4 view back back 3/4 top front parts interesting pieces i have no idea if there were any extra pieces that came with this set. i kind of doubt it. instead i took a photo of some of the interesting parts to the model. that translucent white piece didn't photograph so well, but it is a technic axle 8. that's right, sets from 1977 contained technic elements. the two black parts are the forerunners to the 1 x 2 technic brick, as well. everytime i hear someone on the forums complain about technic elements in system sets, i think back to this set. the round brick is special as well. here is a closer view of it, complete with bite marks . round brick as you can see, the stud is closed. it is only one of two closed stud 1 x 1 round bricks that i own. they stopped appearing in sets in 1981, for those that are interested. the dss you thought you were going to escape this heading, didn't you? surprise! yes, even in 1977 lego sets had stickers. the oldest printed elements i can remember were in the classic space sets that started in 1979. again, when people in the forums complain about dss in sets, i can only help think of this set. and chuckle to myself maniacally. the sticker has held up really well considering it's been stuck on the brick for 32 years. no discoloration, very little curling. i think if all stickers held up this well over time, there would be less dss complaints. the ratings playability: 6/10 - the set is quite swooshable, and the propellor spins. outside of that, though... minifigs: n/a design: 6/10 - the overall shape is quite good, especially given the era. the color choice leaves a lot to be desired. price: 1/10 - it's been retired for 30 years. it's going to cost you to get your hands on it. overall: 13/30 - this set is for true collectors only. i can't imagine anyone wanting one because they want to play with it. it was a great set back in the day, but the design feels really dated. and if you're wondering, mine is not for sale. ever. all the photos, plus more, can be found in the gallery.

0 i'm sorry you had to move this topic, white fang. when it was in the reviewers academy, the teachers agreed it belonged in other themes. *shrug* i guess it ended up where it belonged eventually.

1 here is the spirit of st louis. just go there (washington) and have a look of this legend : cavannus, on jul 15 2009, 09:40 pm, said: in 1977, trans or yellow slopes existed already, and using them would have made the plane more realistic. i don't think so. there is no 45Â° slope in the original plane design ... and no front cockpit window. quote a third rear wheel would have enhanced playability and design, rather than this ugly black round brick. except that it wouldn't have been the spirit of st louis. this set is a great one and i wish i'd bought it in '77. it is the spirit of the 70ties ...

-1 daoudbazaar, on jul 15 2009, 05:26 pm, said: [...] there is no 45Â° slope in the original plane design ... and no front cockpit window. [...] except that it wouldn't have been the spirit of st louis. oooops, you're completely right, the spirit of st-louis didn't have any front window nor rear wheel. anyway, i think a standard ryan m-1/m-2 plane would have been a better choice. less a legend, but more a flexible plan for multiple uses!

1 i really like the design, it has an aesthetic value lacking from most official lego planes and follows closely to the real thing (minus the colours), something that can't really be claimed for more recent sets.

1 wooow! what a set!! not all that large, most defenitely not as sophisticated as the message intercept base from 10 years later, but in those, this was all a kid need to have hours of fun. soooo many great parts on this one.... technic hoses, computers, rocket parts, trans yellow parts... the perfect outpst really... it was actually my sister who got this one, but it only took an hour before i claimed it... edited by snefroe, 14 july 2008 - 12:36 pm.

1 hey eb'ers, i got my market street on monday and finished building it last night. i know it?s not such a nice review like *yoda* did the last times, but i hope you enjoy some of the pics. first a pic of the complete building: the 3 minifigs: and i pic of the stairs (one of my highlights at this set): more pics you can find here my opinion about the set: i like this set very much, it was really fun to build it. i?m happy that that i got some more cherries and a croissant now *sweet* , a funny idea is the salad in the one box at the front. i think normally it?s a hairpiece of an exoforce fig. i also like the colours of the house, the dark blue is sooooo nice. i think i have to take more of this soon. the lighter blue is also nice. this set has really nice details like the stairs, or the owl at the entry of the market, or the balcony. i paid 89,99 eur, a fair price for a really nice set!! greetings sandra

1 thanks, i love the look of this set! i love the mix of colours, it breaks up the model rather than being a single monotone colour. he's used several complimentary colours in order to make up the model. i agree i think the chimneys on the flat roof is weird ontop of the garage, but not so weird one you place it ontop of the building. i guess he's done it to give us the choice of roofs and chimneys. you can always remove the ones you don't like... he also seems to have screwed up a bit on the tiling for the sidewalk on the side module. on cafe corner (and the building module of this set) the sidewalk has the pattern light grey 1x6 at the front, then dark grey 1x2 next, then dark grey 2x2's. however on this he's put the 2x2 tiles first then the 1x2's at the back. easilly fixable though. overall i love this set, thanks for the pics! compliments cafe corner perfectly.

1 thank you legocastlegirls for your quick review! *y* it?s the first time i realize the back of the market street. the tan bricks are a replacement for some windows i?d guess? i do love that building, especially the top floor with the neat balcony. *wub* of course you are (again) left alone filling the interior. but i just had some food parts ordered at bricklink... x-d one thing i?d like to know: this is an online-exclusive, right? can i order it at a lego-store (k?ln / oberhausen) and get the sum rewarded on my voucher booklet? *sweet* i heard it here, but i?m not sure. 8-| if anyone is looking for how to fill it with interior: go read the latest brickjournal #8! there?s a whole chapter written about designing the rooms. interior on!

-1 thanks for the pics legocastlegirl! one thing that i find strange is that tlc doesn't use a female mf head for those two females mf in this set, but a female mf head is available in ldd and pab *wacko*

1 thank you very much for that nice review and those lovely pictures, legocastlegirl! *y* a very interesting set with a great color scheme and some "sunny side" feeling indeed. *sweet*

0 it was the same thing in france in the middle-age... happy that today this taxe is gone! :-d

1 starwars4j, on jun 27 2007, 04:48 am, said: very nice *wub* how'd you get a hold of it? evilbay can be your friend >:-)! here?s the text from the back of the box: quote for much of the galactic civil war, a mysterious agent of palpatine code-named blackhole carefully sifted through countless streams of data, distilling it into useful information for imperial intelligence. blackhole had an impressive amount of resourses available to him, including a entire star destroyer and its complement of troops and fighters. per his orders, the stormtroopers under his command had their armor cast in black to match his own particular eccentricities. the armor modification had practical benefits as well. the stygian-triprismatic polymer afforded the stormtroopers increased sensor-stealth. *wub* - pure poetry x-d! blackhole on copmike

1 very nice copmike!! i can't wait to get my boba now! those ebay prices aren't to bad. hmmmm... :-d

1 wow, if the tru 6212 is to be believed, the luke marque costs $50. but that looks so cool. definitely a keeper.

-1 the lightsabers are strangely skinny. do they light up or something? or was the transparent plastic too expensive to make thick blades? :-/ :-p

1 well, now that i have some money, a trip to toysrus was obviously in my future, especially since my local tru has much of the summer 2007 lineup. when i got there, almost all the smaller castle sets had been sold out, but there was one left: the one i am now reviewing for both eurobricks and bzpower. ;-) the box: well, for starters, the castle theme boxes are beautiful! the blended clear and stormy skies give a great ?clash of the titans? effect, and the action poses help as well. ;-) the back is equally nice, featuring a photo showing kids how to use the crossbow, and the brave axe wielder taking a swipe at the skeleton (foolish soldier, that won?t work on skellies! see later on in the review to find out why). and of course, we have a small box with the link to the official lego website, where tlc can advertise even more lego sets! :p the contents: after opening the box, a single bag of pieces (with a couple loose ones), the instruction manual and necessary catalog ( :-p ), and a new wider rubber band holder spilt out. the instruction manual is clear as a bell. no color trouble here, folks! also, it?s worth mentioning the nice background with the mountain and king?s castle silhouettes. :-) sorry that there's no picture, but i'll take one if someone wants to see it. ;-) the pieces: for being a 5 dollar set (well, seven in my case. darn your above average prices, tru!), crossbow attack features a lot of nice pieces (as does the entire castle lineup). notable elements include two large brown spoked wheels, two brown modified 1x1?s, a pearl gold slope end, and six dark blue modified 1x1x2/3 slopes! the bulk of the pieces, however, are nothing special. i?ll let the picture do the talking for this. the accessories are by far the best parts in this kit. two different helmets in a beautiful shiny silver are my favorite, but i also really like the scythe (looks good for mocing) and the round shield ( *wub* ), which are both brand new parts. and can anyone not love the classic axe and crossbows? oh, and there?s a black lightsaber too, but that?s rather boring compared to the other parts. :-p the minifigures: can you say, four figures (including the horse)?! that has to be a record for a regular 5 dollar set, at least in the present age of limited figures per set. we?ll start out with the two crown militia: a regular soldier and an archer. both have old faces, but they look spiffy with the shiny helmets and the superb torsos. i?ll name the soldier bravo the stout and the archer angler the precise, for future references. now we come to the skellie. although some people dislike the new skeleton design, i personally prefer it to the old ones, since the arms are now poseable and the face much meaner. the only problem is that the arms hang too low, but it?s not too noticeable when they have weapons in their hands. and last, but not least, here?s the elusive skeleton horse. i for one am very happy that tlc took advantage of that awesome prototype piece and made it into an official mass-production mold. however, the horse is unfortunately one piece, but since regular lego horses are as well, i don?t have a problem with it. i do have a problem with the pose, however. the legs are in quite an odd position, and i wonder why tlc didn?t make the front and back leg poses symmetrical. ah well. the finished set: i have only two pictures here, since this set is so small. first, here?s the completed crossbow. i must say: finally! no more ridiculous horse mounted catapults or crazy fire wheel launchers! now we have realistic siege weapons, including the one included with 7090. plus, it actually launches okay, although not the best. here?s the other main attraction: the completed skeleton rider and horse. i think it?s rather dramatic with that pose and the dark background, don?t you think? ;-) playability: okay, so there?s not much in this set, but a bit of imagination brings plenty of possibilities. to show you what you can do, here?s a little story made only with this set. ;-) overall rating: presentation: 9/10 pieces: 8/10 minifigures: 9/10 finished model: 8/10 playability: 8/10 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ final score: 8.4/10 crossbow attack is a fine introduction into castle, so i recommend it to any lego fan, whether they are a castle nut or just want a cheap change of pace. tlc has a knack with making great small kits these days, and i more than ever support them in their amazing rebound from their dark ages (between 1997 and 2004). ;-) edited by kimt, 10 august 2008 - 01:33 pm.

-1 thanks for this review, and that great little comic! about the skellies though (x-d), you have to admit that besides their long arms making the skellie legs look out of proportion, that they're just made poorly. they're sticking straight out, as opposed to every other fig, which have a slight bend to make them look more natural. also, as i'm sure you've noticed, the pegs are on angles! that makes it impossible for them to hold their weapons straight, and they can't even put their arms over their heads without stressing the plastic some... i mean they're dead. well, at least undead, they're not supposed to be stiff, and personally i like the ragdoll look more, it makes them seem more dead :-p

1 nice review, and great little story. :-d *y* look at the normal horses, their legs are positioned like that too. only the skellie horse's legs are touching, so as to strengthen the middle, otherwise it could easily snap in half. also, i think the new skeletons are nice, their head is awesome, i just don't see why tlc couldn't make the bent droid arms with the hand facing vertically, instead of making a new arm design completely straight.

1 nice review and a great story also grevious, this is a great set and a nice little army builder one at that. the only thing that saddens me about the line itself is the new arms on the skelies, they just look far to big when placed next to a normal fig. for me the old versions of the skelies were far better, why tlc changed to this is beyond me. still i shall be buying alot of these sets just to increase my army.

0 thanks for all the comments, guys, and thank you, joem16 and iamded for pointing out the reason for the skeleton horse leg positioning. ;-) well, i'll be gone on vacation until the 16, but i may pick up a set or two while down in tenessee, so if i do, expect a review and another story when i get back! ;-)

1 great review, i love this set.

0 i've searched high and low accross england to find this...and it's nowhere! i'm too stingy to buy off s@h and so i'll wait my turn. ok, now ot the set: let's say i buy 3, for ?12. that's 6 soldiers, 3 skellies and 3 horses. considering each fig is worth ?1 and horses 75p, that means 25p for the catapult! awesome! there's no lego castle anywhere in england! :-/

0 thank you very much for that interesting review, ickelpete. *y* well, the color scheme?s pretty bad and the design of that dino?s a bit to blocky for my liking, but the two alternative models you?ve built?re quiet nice. at least there?re a lot of possibilities coming with that set.... :-)

1 ickelpete, on jul 9 2007, 11:19 pm, said: first lets start with the box which is much larger than it needs to be!! pete no lego box is too big my friend x-d ;-) nice review *y* as for the set... i don't like the colors myself (surprised? x-d ), and it seems a little blocky. otherwise, the set is cool. i really like the head.

0 mutex, on jul 13 2007, 10:16 am, said: by the way , i added a nice cool feature on my site , you can download the stickers for some sets that i own. before building i always scan the stickers, we never know it could come handy. check this out on my site (you need to go in the lego lists on the left): [vtx] classic games that?s a good idea and very nice, thanks mutex. *y* nice review.... hmm, now i?m pretty sure that i?ll have to mod that cockpit a little when i get that set.

1 great review *sweet* maybe i will buy this one... but not this month... buying lego in billund has left me totally broke :-x :-$

1 i like the dropship kit and got this. now that i built it i see so many things i can do to tweak it to make it a moc. i think this is a set everyone mm fan should get.

1 nice review!

1 the dropships looks neat, and your review is good. it isn't my theme, but it clearly is a fantastic set for the space lovers under us. mars mission is really a good step in the right direction for tlc.

-1 of course, right before i post this i see that ickelpete reviewed this set earlier in the week. sorry for being redundant but it is already written so here ya go: monster dino reviewed by dunamis set 4958 792 pieces $89.95 from lego online store build time 3.5 hours here we go with another offering from the creator line. i?m kind of fond of these sets as they are pretty imaginative and usually have instructions for multiple models. i like the reusability of all the pieces and the varied things you can build. the box: the box that lego shipped this thing in was absolutely huge! when i first got this in the mail, i thought i had won the lottery and they had shipped the ucs falcon early. once i opened the shipping box, i was surprised to see an unusually large creator set box. the box itself is pretty standard creator type box but this one shows off the power functions prominently on the right side of the box. the back of the box shows some of the motorized features as well. opening the box is a matter of breaking two seals. we?re back to the reusable cereal box type tab system for those of you who stay up a night wondering about lego?s next box design. inside the box we have a bunch of sealed bags. immediately the power brick, remote and motors stand out as they are each in individual bags. also, there are three manuals. the manuals: the three manuals are 76, 76 and 56 pages in length. they are laid out well and are pretty standard with all the usual trimmings: - piece call outs for each step - parts inventory at the end of the primary model build - page numbers color separation in these manuals were fine for me. interestingly, the instructions for the primary build took a full manual plus about a quarter of another manual. random manual photos: parts list i?ll explain a bit more below, but it would have been nice to have some written documentation on all the functions of the motors, remote and receiver. such as motor load guidelines and specific explanations of all the remote control functions. it is severely lacking in this area. the pieces: obviously, the pieces we?re most interested in are these new motors and wireless remote control. note that before you fire this bad boy up, you had better byob. since this is prominently a european community, i had better clarify my acronyms. over here across the pond, byob usually means ?bring your own beer?. in this case, it still means bring your own beer (i?m on my second heineken right now) but in addition to numerous bottles of beer you will need a total of nine batteries to get through this set. i kid you not: anyway, there are two motors (a small and a large) each with its own very unique name according to the manual; the smaller one is called ?motor? and the larger one is called ?xl motor?. very creative indeed! the battery box takes six aa batteries and there are two compartments to hold them. here is the first: that seems pretty normal. however, the back side of it holds the other three batteries and it seems to be very poorly designed: note in the photo above where the bottom battery is placed. compare it to the previous photo and you will see the difference. i played around with trying to get that bottom battery out and you better pack a lunch (or byob) because it is no small task! why couldn?t they make this compartment just like the other side? there is a single power cord connector and a three position switch. the middle position turns the power off and the other two positions seem to provide the same functionality in either position as far as i can tell. perhaps a little blurb in the manual would have been nice to clear things up a bit. the remote takes three aaa batteries. it is fairly small and lightweight even with the batteries installed. it has two thumb controls which could be levers if you insert technic bars or even pins. the two controls are color coded and match the plugs on the receiver to control two separate motors. in addition, there is a four position switch which i assume changes the channel. finally, there are two tiny levers that seem to have no function. i?m not sure if they are a trim control or variable speed control. i messed with them and didn?t notice any difference in the motor speed. again, some documentation from the incredibly verbose lego manual would have helped. as far as the rest of the parts, it?s really a mixed bag. there are a lot of varied parts in this set to the point that there is almost one of everything. lots of technic gears, pins, studded beams, studless beams, axles, wheels, etc. also, lots of little 1x1 slopes in various colors, teeth, horns, etc. you can?t really say it is a parts pack because there is not enough of one thing to make it a parts pack. a couple of notes: it seems the quality control issue on the axles has been fixed. i initially reported this back when i reviewed the 8285 about a year ago. all the axles worked fine for me. the color quality control issue is still alive. check out the different shade of red in these two parts: also included is the sound brick. this looks just like the other sound or light-up bricks we have been seeing lately. it does have a load dinosaur ?roar!? sound embedded in it though so hide the younglings if they are a bit on the skittish side. finally, i?ve never seen one of these before (although someone will no doubt rattle off a dozen sets where you can find this part in about 5 seconds): no, i am not referring to the studded beam, i put that in the photo for scale. the build: the build was fun and was fairly straightforward. as i mentioned, there is a lot of technic parts, so if you are not a fan of the technic line you should run, not walk away from this one. there were no gotchas to speak of, but you need to pay careful attention to the placement of the wires that go from the motors to the receiver. they kind of sneak them around a bit so watch closely. otherwise, it was fine. here is what is left over: so far, i have only built the primary model. as seen on the box, there are instructions for two more models. both of the other models seem less complex than the primary model and are likely quicker builds. the dino took me about 3.5 hours which included some time to screw around with the motors. i?m an old school technic fan from way back in the 80?s so i had some familiarity with the old technic motors. obviously, 25+ years has improved some things and these seem much more powerful. the design: if you have built the 4507 prehistoric creatures then some of the design will feel familiar, especially the head and tail. it is almost like they took the dinosaur from that set and figured out how to motorize it. this is not necessarily a bad thing, just a comment. the set does a good job of showing off the features of the new motors and remote. it is nice to see how one motor can perform multiple functions. in this case, the small motor makes both arms move and opens and closes the mouth of the dinosaur. when the mouth is completely open, it pushes the activation switch on the sound brick which emits the ?roar!? sound. pretty cool. the ?xl motor? handles the walking feature of the dinosaur. there is both forward and reverse. forward works really well while the reverse just makes the dinosaur look like he is doing a michael jackson moon walk. (wow, i never thought i would use michael jackson?s name in a lego dinosaur set review!) it is almost like the dinosaur can?t get traction going in reverse. however, as noted previously forward works really well. this guy actually gets going at a pretty good clip. as you might expect, he kind of waddles like a duck since there is no articulation in the knees. it is a bit awkward but it works. the ?xl motor? seems to kick out plenty of power. overall, the design seems to be a mixed bag. the way the tail is attached seems to be an afterthought. the arms look to be too small. however, the walking mechanism and legs/feet are pretty cool as well as the head and mouth. i guess it is a reasonable effort to get people introduced to the parts and we?ll see designs improve as time goes on. here are a few views of our new friend: but what about the at-at??? of course, the real reason you are reading this is that you hope i will have some epiphany on how all this relates to the new walking at-at. judging from the box on the at-at, it looks like we get one motor. i don?t see the remote which is a disappointment as i hope it is not controlled by a switch on the body and you either turn the at-at on or off. if that is the case, the first thing i am doing is scavenging the receiver and remote from this set to add to the at-at. granted, it could be that it comes with a remote but is just not seen on the box. also, the at-at box looks like one of the images shows that the head turns. i sure hope this is controlled separately as it would be really lame to not be able to control this independently from the walking feature. i?m kind of skeptical on the walking feature of the at-at. i suspect it will be rather cumbersome but hopefully i will be pleasantly surprised. needless to say, this is all speculation but those are my initial thoughts based on this set. overall thoughts: it?s an ok set. kind of pricy but i suspect a large part of that is due to the motors and remote. i haven?t built the other two models (they seem less interesting to me) but at least it has some variability. also, you get a ton of different parts which can either be a good thing or bad thing depending on what you are looking for. the dinosaur is average. the color selection is marginal (black and lime green?) and the tail section is just lame. i appreciate it more for the mechanical functions and how the motorized parts work. it does do a good job of waking up my dog who seems pretty irritated by it. it is a nice set to show off to the neighbors or the endless caravan of my wife?s friends that seem to materialize out of nowhere. people are quickly impressed by it and then promptly move along once you start trying to explain how it all works. i?m a bit disappointed that the manual did not explain more about the remote and motor functions. i suspect that there is more than meets the eye and i?ll just have to play around with it to find out. it would be nice if lego had a website that showed all the cool functions of the motors and remotes so we fully understand the capabilities. final rating: 72% build 9/10 (pretty quick and fun. the mechanical part is cool) functionality 6/10 (it is a creator set so you have multiple builds. as far as it being a dinosaur, it?s just ok. motorized parts are cool though.) design 6/10 (partly cloudy. some things are cool, others are lame.) parts 8/10 (new motors and remote are cool. lots of varied parts included but nothing to write home about.) price 7/10 (it is kind of expensive) edited by whitefang, 23 may 2009 - 06:23 pm. indexed

1 great review dunamis i hope you have as much fun with this as i have. one point yes they are new axles they have appeared in a few sets this year.

1 tks once again dunamis for a great in-depth review ;-) i really look forward to your supped up and moded at-at :-p i am really not found of the design but i think its still a nice parts pack, especially with all these nice "power function" elements ;-) *yoda*

1 awesome reveiw, thanks! i gotta get this one!!! *y* *wub*

0 paulc, on nov 4 2007, 02:21 pm, said: i kind of like the design of this, but more importantly i really want to get my hands on the power functions motors and ir control system. i'd prefer the 8275 technic bulldozer, but there's no way i can stretch to the ?100 price tag, so i was thinking i would have to see if i could get a 4958 monster dino cheap in the january sales. if you really want the power functions the bulldozer is better value as you get two large motors, two small motors and two receivers compared to the one in the dino set alos watch toysrus and argos both have had the bulldozer for ?70-75 in there pre christmas sales usually for a week only i am hopeing they will be on sale soon as i want a second bulldozer to get some more motors.

1 this is both my first set review and post about a star wars set- (even though i have been collecting them since '99). i got this one early this year so i thought i would post a review on it. please bare with me- i am not a great photographer. so with that in mind, here goes! front of the box: 75083 at-dp box-front by whitesidewjw, on flickr back of the box: 75083 at-dp box- back by whitesidewjw, on flickr shot of the bags: 75083 at-dp bags by whitesidewjw, on flickr the sticker sheet (i normally don't apply them, but for this i am going ahead and putting them on): 75083 at-dp sticker sheet by whitesidewjw, on flickr minifigs- i really like the two at-dp pilots, but the best agent kallus really does shine. of course we get an extra stormtrooper: 75083 at-dp minifigs by whitesidewjw, on flickr no new molds in this as far as i can tell, however these printed 4x4 domes are really great. i can see lots of uses for these in space mocs. 75083 at-dp new printed elements by whitesidewjw, on flickr bag#1 complete- nothing earth shattering here- an easy build: 75083 at-dp bag #1 complete by whitesidewjw, on flickr bag #2 complete: 75083 at-dp bag #2 complete cockpit seats by whitesidewjw, on flickr cockpit assembly: 75083 at-dp cockpit assembly by whitesidewjw, on flickr bag #2 complete 75083 at-dp bag#3 complete by whitesidewjw, on flickr "foot" assembly"- i like how they positioned the slopes 75083 at-dp "foot" assembly by whitesidewjw, on flickr complete at-dp 75083 at-dp complete by whitesidewjw, on flickr complete at-dp-side view 75083 at-dp side view (complete) by whitesidewjw, on flickr complete at-dp- over view 75083 at-dp complete- overview by whitesidewjw, on flickr complete at-dp rear view 75083 at-dp rear view by whitesidewjw, on flickr extra pieces 75083 at-dp extra pieces by whitesidewjw, on flickr the verdict: minifigs- 5/5- we get a total of four figs. i like the two at-dp pilots and agent kallus is a well done minifig. i can complain about another storm trooper either parts- 3/5- other than the dome pieces i commented on before, there is really not any new parts in this. if you build space, star wars, or machinery, this will still be a welcome assortment. experience of build 4/5- this really was a fun build. it came together fast but was challenging enough for its target age group. playability 5/5- this thing is much more sturdy than it looks. the legs take a little bit of effort due to the double locking hinges but hold together very well.this is a very minor complaint. value 4/5- typical- $49.99 for 500 pieces- i must admit i paid a little more than msrp due to shipping but i can't complain about the value. overall: 21/25- i really believe this is one of the best walkers that lego has designed. the only changes i would make would be adding real control panels in the cockpit and it would be nice if lego made a real widow to fit in with these types of builds rather than a transparent tile over another plate. all in all, i would recommend this set and i hope the rest of the 2015 star wars sets are on par with this.

1 great review! thanks for doing it. i'm a big fan of this set, the minifigures are good, as is the parts selection. i like the piece used in the cockpit to secure the minifigure in place. i would've liked to see some panels in the cockpit though rather than translucent red pieces, that said however they are useful pieces.

1 great first review! as a huge walker fan its great to get one thats not a redesign, or one of those tiny battlepack vechicles.

1 awesome! i am really looking forward to buy this, but is it really $50.00 us? i was hoping more around $30.00. also, i was wondering how the hip section for the legs work, does it have a stiff turning axis to it?

0 namioik, on 25 december 2014 - 08:53 am, said: i mean, it fits the 10 cents per piece count and has 4 figures so for a licensed theme you can't beat that. but i guess lego can never satisfy everyone this is true. i just had that price in mind when i saw the first images of it. it did not appear to be this big or complex, but new sets are getting so much more advanced than what they used to be.

0 thanks for the early review! how tall is this next to the most recent recreation of the at-at? i'm picturing the two of them standing next to each other looking silly due to the scale differences.

0 it's a different helmet. ezra's is an imperial cadet helmet (the same one he wears in "breaking ranks).

0 thanks for the review and pics. this is a really nice looking walker. one question - how snug are the at-dp drivers sitting in their seats? the cockpit looks good. actually i'm not crazy about the at-dp helmets on the show but i dig the minifigs! good stuff. awesome facial hair for kallus!

0 hi, i need some help...when i atach the pod to the place where the legs are placed, the small piece that unites the pod to the legs is loos from the bottom, so the top of the walker just moves around freely, wich is different from every video review that i have seen (where they can rotate the pod but its not loose) the small piece that serves as the axis isnt staying locked on the bottom piece and i have reassembled it all and still its the same :\ help! edit: sorry, i found out what went wrong...didnt push hard enough :d edited by mrpinache, 05 july 2015 - 12:10 am.

1 super outstanding review! i am outside at this moment and this review is certainly great to read while you are on the move. i am looking forward to get this upcoming new modular. it is definitely fun to play and real awesome indeed. thanks oky for this very fine review.

0 how was the pool table legs made?

1 great review oky! i managed to pick this set up a few days ago and i must say, it might be my favorite modular yet for the feel alone. the pool hall, barbershop, and the detective's office itself are all wonderfully designed!

0 nice review, thanks a lot. managed to improve my opinion of the set a bit, but i'm still getting two to build larger buirldings as soon as we get the next 2x vip points special

-1 thelazychicken, on 01 january 2015 - 06:14 pm, said: great review! the intro was great, but i'm still not convinced on this one. the height seems too small for comparison with the rest of the modulars. the play features are ok but i wish it would have been taller. totally agree with you, the height does seem rather small. also 2x buildings on a 32x32 base-plate with a lots of spare studs behind the buildings are these buildings 12 studs in width?. it still looks great style wise, however this might be a set i buy and look at it after i have built it & regret the amount of $$$ i have spent on it. $239 for us aussie's . edited by snaplock, 01 january 2015 - 07:42 pm.

1 amazing review! very thorough with lots of details

1 thank you for the amazing and really well-readable review! makes me want to get the set even more!

1 thanks very much. i love it *wub* . it needs tweaking, but isn't that half the fun? incidentally, when people were calling it rhino, i thought it was just a reference to captain scarlet. seeing the stickers in the middle made me realise my mistake. buy! buy! buy!

0 seems like they infuse system sets with more technic bars. must be that technic isn't selling too well and they want to educate ppl how cool technic can be. :-p it's quite apparent when even the small bike needed technic frame.

-1 i wish the wheels would be arranged like the turbo tank, this one looks too movable.

0 say, i was looking at your pics and then at the instructions and i just realised : haven't you put the stikers on the shield thingies in the middle upside down? i think you did :-d i don't know if i like those new sets, though... i mean they have great shapes and potential, but at the same time, they seem so holey... they're really huge and big but full of empty air and space as well... well, this one not as much, and indeed it is the best looking set of the lot, though... but i don't think i'll go into that line...

0 i managed to get two sets for my twin girls for christmas, and would have to agree with your ratings (the anna and elsa figs are indeed excellent)

1 very nice review, mostlytechinc! once i saw this set i was interested in it for the colours and pieces...thanks for this review to shed more light onto it!

-1 isn't getting parts in new colors a good thing? it is a shame there is only this one set, i think tlg could make a whole subtheme out of frozen. i do agree that they overuse lavender and magenta, i don't see why every girl set has to have these sort of colors instead of what would be accurate to the source material .

1 thanks for the review mostlytechnic. i too wish they had done a real castle for this set, it certainly deserved it. my sons and i figure they could have used the old rock monster mold from rock raiders in white for the missing snow beast. i will pick it up though for the figs and unique pieces.

-1 yep, my family all thinks they should have made a bigger set, added figs, and just been printing money. this feels massively rushed into production. which is weird, the other princess sets that just came out look worlds better.

1 i'm literally of the exact opposite opinion to op here. i love the structure and the parts (this is a fantastic little parts pack that i'll be snagging more of when i find it again)...but i've no use for the figures (not a big disney princess fan). it's all about the parts. this set is freaking amazing! :d

1 thanks for the review. this will end up being a must buy for my daughter.

1 this seems to be one of those sets that lego really should have released a month before christmas, it likely then would have been toy of the year 2014,

0 what's up pups? i have written a review for 7786 batcopter: the chase for scarecrow on my website: brickzone.net as usual it involves fabuland figures involved in a crazy story. enjoy and feel free to let me know what you think. thanks! x-d click on the picture to read the review...

1 thanks for this review, i love this set *wub* that batman is great, and i've always loved that awesome scarecrow fig. that new pumpkin is fantastic, i can't wait to get it in the set...how many come with the set? i hope more than two :'-( i love both of those vehicles, this set is a definite buy for me!

1 that was a great review with loads of excellent pictures. the set is better than i thought. i want to buy one of the new sets as i would love a blue batman, but they are so expensive for australians. i love the new pumpkin heads. the story involved more mini-fig cruelty; excellent! i also liked the scarecrow/crow joke. :-d (one request; please don't say lines like "to the batcopter" next time. that is the old tv series and i hated that. >:-) feel free to tell me to stick my request up my m#g@bl*cks.)

-1 great review! funny as allways! the comic was just a hell lot of fun. it really had me laughing. i would love to have this set but the price is just to high here, far worse than i had expected. i'll be better off buying the battank, which is much better priced. actually there is almost no price difference between the batcopter and the battank here *wacko*

1 tks mate for this brilliant review :-d i loved your batfabuland story !! always fantastic to read like always *sweet* i really love this set and i shall buy 2 copies: one to build as is, and another one for my town loool: regular biplane for the tarmac, and my swat copter ;-) btw, i would have a request: could you post pic(s) of the parts inventory please ;-) many tks in advance !! *yoda*

(they are 60 aud and 120 aud.) i am still not sure if i will buy either... :'-( edited by sinner, 18 july 2007 - 11:47 am.

1 thanks for the review. i'm definitely getting this, mainly becasue it's batman. i love the blue bats, the scarecrow is good as ever, and those new pumpkins are just *wub* . there's a few things i'll mod, but nothing really major. i'll have to wait till i get this to decide properly though.

0 you're second post on this forum and already you bring us this great review. thanks for making this !!

-1 what's up kernow!!?? nice review. thanks for sharing. welcome to eurobricks, i hope you have fun here! :-d x-d that qui-gonn thing is weird. come on lego! someone is just asleep at the wheel over there with quality control. missing pieces, injections molds, slipping quality, ice cube trays...imo, that's a huge thing to miss. the mini-fig on the box doesn't come in the set=false claims. anyway, the ship looks beautiful and i wanted this set when i first saw it and your review confirms that it is very cool. thanks again! x-d x-d

1 thanks for the review! i'm glad to see lego including details of everyday life, like the food (though a plate would have been nice). steve

0 brick miner, on jul 31 2007, 07:46 pm, said: as for the set, the thing that jumps out at me most is the use of dark blue for water... im so used to seeing the classic blue for water, that the dark blue seems weird. i don't like it. - bm indeed, i only noticed this when i saw the s@h images. i guees that they're on dark waters. you can always put some trans blue and trans clear 1x1 round plates, no? i tried that technique to make the lava (using trans red and trans orange plates), it looks neat. regarding the human soldier thing yoda mentioned, it's quite weird. like him, i'm going to swap the legs, so they're coherent with the soldiers from the other sets. third note: is it just me or did you attach the two black gate pieces too high? shakar

1 not sure i like this one much. i like many of the new parts but the boat isn't that great and i would rather get each seperately so i can avoid the whole skeleton army. nice review though!

1 asuka, on aug 1 2007, 01:47 pm, said: no, i think this is correct. the upper plate with clip for the door is a little high, on top of a dark gray 1x1 brick. so if you want the door to operate well you have to place it like that. i just put the clip under that brick, a very easy fix, so my door now is lower which looks better imho, and no sneaky skelly can crawl along under it.... x-d exactly. asuka is correct. also keep in mind that the picture was taken looking down on the model that is sitting on the carpet. it makes the gap appear a little larger. in addition; for those of you that recommended ironing the sail, it worked great. i set the iron to low and used a t-shirt to protect the sail. it flattened it out perfectly. in fact, it worked so well, that i did the same with my old ww weapons wagon cover that has gotten wrinkled over the years. the iron worked perfectly.

1 yes, that was definately an optic illusion. looking at it again, the gap looks a lot shorter. thanks. :-) shakar

0 @ mr tiber: they have them at the toys'r'us in eindhoven. in the new shoppingcentrum west of the bijenkorf. and the bijenkorf is west of the central station.

1 ok here is the set alot of us star wars fans have been waiting for! the 7666 hoth rebel base! *wub* first the box now the great minifigs! that stunning k-3po fig! now the snowspeeder! aaaaggghhhhh these parts are all stickers! now for the turret! the 2 cones on the side press in to fire out 2 blue lights saber blades :-d now for the small crane thingy. yes the part under the engine on the snowspeeder is another sticker 8-| echo base!! (well the front door anyway :-d ) the main control room? :-d again these are stickers on a tinted clear panel and on the slope |-/ i have no idea what this is meant to be! :-d finally 2 shots of the full set! *wub* well over all i really like this set and think it is great value for money. the minifigs alone would set you back more than the cost of this set. the build time was a good 2 hours or so and was good fun! the snowspeeder is not as good as the second snowspeeder and no where near as good as the first in my opinion, but i did love that first one. the k-3po fig is perfect and it is good to be getting more droids that aren't r2-d2 and c-3po. it is a shame about the stickers but that is the price of keeping the cost down i suppose (the only printed part in the whole set is the snowspeeder/x-wing windscreen). i will definately be getting atleast another 3 of this great set. 9/10

1 i love it.... depending on the australian price! (if it comes down here that is.) incidently, i have no idea what that other yellow thing is either! thanks for the review.

1 sam89, on aug 2 2007, 02:59 pm, said: thanks for the review! that's to put the snowspeeder on (there should be a 2x4 plate underneath the snowspeeder that fits in that gap). :-d oh yeah!

1 all i can say is... wow... can't wait for my local stores to stock this! nice review btw :-) does the snowspeeder actually fit through the door? thanks! edited by supernova, 02 august 2007 - 02:06 pm.

1 wow you are so lucky to have that sett ! , men ! tlc dont let me wait! , ?hh i mean tru

1 great looking set ... how much was it ?

0 ?40 i think.

1 excellent set. the snowtroopers are just amazing (most lego imperial troops are really good). however, it's sad that except from luke, all the rebels have the same face which is what is more the most unexpressive that you can find. for the rest, the quality looks excellent. the snowspeeder is far better than the first they realized (but only one thing: it looks a bit too white to me. i think i remember they were grey and orange rather than white in the film) and the echo base door is really cool. really nice set. edited by lord beckett, 02 august 2007 - 04:14 pm.

1 great review - now i want it even more! ?40??? that sounds reasonable in comparison to our recent experiences!

1 outstanding review jim, congrats ! love the pictures, so clean and crisp . hope to see many more of your reviews. as for the set, after seeing this review i kind of like it, if i will find it at a decent price, i will get it for sure.

1 jim, great review as always. you convinced me to get this one of these days, although not a to priority. any comments on which functions can be converted to pf and how well they work?

1 great review with fantastic pictures. as for the model, i'm glad that they chose to make it less pretty - real le mans prototypes are rarely a sight to behold. it is function and aerodynamics over form. i would, however, have preferred more realism for the sake of learning: - the front shouldn't open like that - instead it should be easy to remove the whole front cover, leaving the suspension easy to work on. - the aero seems to be realistic, except for the rear end where there's no indication of a venturi channel. this should have been easy to include. - there is no fuel tank, nor fixed fuel connector right behind the cabin. - there are no air jacks! seriously!? this is one of the most unique features of a race car like this... and lego forgot about them. instead they automated two functions which are manual on a real race car. - the top cars at le mans are hybrids with ingenious systems. i would have loved to see the front wheels connected to some kind of spinning apparatus indicating a kinetic energy recovery system. if i get this set... i'm going to make some modifications.

1 great review jim.. i have been sitting on the fence about if i will get this set for a while but i saw one built for the first time at a local brick show on the weekend. it definitely looks better in real life than any pics. i have decided to buy one

0 awesome review jim! i love the pictures. i don't like how lego did this model though. too many compromises edited by omikron, 13 march 2015 - 07:24 am.

1 excellent review, thanks! what is the cost in us? not released in my area. the shovel is obviously my favorite area, it looks detailed and strong. i love the treads, because i need them to move the 4 x 4 barrels on my super-scaled turbolaser turret. very good pics too. what color are the treads? i never had them. they are plastic or rubber? edited by grand moff viceroy, 03 august 2007 - 12:34 am.

1 ickelpete, on aug 2 2007, 08:45 pm, said: the treads are dark grey i not too good with naming colours. the treads are the same as in the snowmobile set released earlier in the year they are a hard plastic. thanks, you have proved yourself strong enough for the dark side.

0 thanks for the review, it really looks cool. too bad it's soo expensive. :-/ i must admit that i prefer the 8421 mobile crane for more or less the same price, the design is more "sexy". *wub*

1 thanks for the great review of this set. i've been looking forward to it as well and i am excited about the wireless controls like the dino. i too am curious if this set has been released here in the us. i was told that it was a sept 1 release. i agree about the battery life. my dino set lasted about 4 hours too.

1 thank you very much for that neat review, ickelpete! *y* your pictures?re very interesting and your video?s really good. that set looks very beautiful to me, a formidable new technic set that quickly?ll turn into an everlasting classic for sure. :'-) i?m just a little sorry for those quality problems.... well, i hope that tlc?ll work on that matter and fix it soon. 8-|

1 hi, many thanks for this review, photos and videos. i can't wait to put the hands on mine, since it is already ordered and should arrive before the end of the month. :'-) could you post a scan or photos, from those last pages in the building instructions where the parts included are listed? thanks edited by conchas, 04 august 2007 - 07:19 pm.

1 nice review! i must have this set!!!

0 eyesonly, on aug 6 2007, 09:11 pm, said: what i really want is for philo or someone to test it's power and such. *sweet* edit the power of the motors that is. its getting late. *sing* i just noticed that he has done that in brick journal 8. check out page 56-61 for great info and a comparison to the gear motors. to bad it didn't include the nxt-motors since they are very similar.

1 thank you ickelpete for that great review. i give you two *y* up. i am not a technic fan, but this set definitly looks *sweet* . i see great potential using this set as a model for a smaller dozer for my town/train layout. i really *wub* the crawler tracks they used. i have been thinking about buying the snowmobile for the tracks. but if possible, i just might buy this set instead. i could definitly use the other parts for moc's. model on!!

0 lham, on aug 9 2007, 12:00 pm, said: could you please please post the instruction boolets' number codes (located on the back in tiny print)? so that we can download them from lego.com and have a look for ourselves. when i read this i first though you meant set number but this model can't be found there yet and now i realize that you mean something completly different. what is this code you're after?

1 a very nice review of a very good little set, thanks sinner! *y*

1 sinner, on aug 5 2007, 06:52 am, said: overall this is a remarkable achievement for the low price. i bought it for the boom piece as i want to improve the crane that came with 7998. i highly recommend it. great review sinner! i'll be picking up this set for sure. probbly a few just for the parts. but one question. what crane are you refering to that came with 7998? that is the new heavy loader, and it didn't come with an any crane> 8-?

-1 thanks for all the feedback you guys! robert8, on 12 april 2015 - 11:25 pm, said: i can't help but think the minifigures are the weak part of the set. snake and apu are great but the rest.... i don't know. they kinda redundant now. they could at least give us new torso printing, like homer wearing his jacket or bart wearing his blue t-shirt or marge wearing her coat. or, as i said in the discussion thread, i'd have included jasper in cmf series 2 and a frozen version here. overall, the set looks kinda smaller than what i thought. i agree, but so many people were complaining about how the simpsons house should have included the most common versions (mostly because the eyes or whatever), so i think lego played it safe and just included the normal versions. it makes sense, since series 1 is gone forever, and the common versions were in there, and this set is bound to be in stock for a very long time like the death star. i never really agreed when people were complaining about the alternate eye prints personally, but i guess this is a good business choice based on previous feedback. edited by just2good, 13 april 2015 - 12:06 am.

1 hello everyone. excellent review! english is not my native language, but i want to express my opinion. simpsons house was the first of its kind, and i can say without exaggeration that this is the most impressive set that i'm going (my collection http://brickset.com/sets/ownedby-celeb ). i look at the video from the kwik-e-mart, and is difficult to say how good it is compared with the house. the main disadvantages that i said to myself, is this: build the walls of the large panels, next is access to the roof (gray parts in front of the back door (i think they represent the stairs)) is not on the level with doors on the roof and when you open them, you can see the white block is openly trash, my points of view. boxes on the left of go to the store and powersauce box, i want see make real and not just a cube, f.e. such as in the unreleased star wars set. about minifigures, i fully agree with robert8. two more of the same homer, marge and bart?! personally, i put my set as a scene and all the replays minifigure are inside the house that was not identical characters next and also absolutely terrible bart`s accessory this set is made parking for bikes and it looks very cool. but damn, it is hoped to see the bart or lisa's bike, instead of useless balloons with paint. the walls are made with convex inside panels, why so? can anyone know? have not seen any pictures with such walls in tv show. why did not they turn? i personally really like how realized roof, but my brother says that it is terrible :) garden could do more in the series there were almost jungle i do not know how to be considered here, maybe anyone can express any opinion or idea? i look at the simpsons house, and then look at the photo of this e-mart. i can not understand, in the house we have a garage, two floors, cool floor, a lot of furniture, all the rooms and walls, collected from cubes, many additional accessories. and where is all this detail here? it looks much smaller (maybe even poorer). if they still will release next year comic book store, it will be even less? of course it is difficult to estimate without seeing it live, we have it will be sold only in may. at first sight it does not look so impressive as the house. can certainly the case in the limit on the amount of detail, but why it was impossible to add $ 50 to the cost and make jasper, the more detailed the roof, the walls of the smaller elements, that it was not convex. sad. thanks all for attention. edited by celeb, 13 april 2015 - 05:10 am.

1 thank you all for the great feedback! arslock, on 13 april 2015 - 02:19 pm, said: can you post a pic of it next to the simpsons house? just curious about size comparisons... soon, but my area with the simpsons house is very messy, so i will have to make room for it first. gooker1, on 13 april 2015 - 04:10 pm, said: great review!! thanks for paying a little extra to get it now and review it for us!!! you must be a youngin'...those phone booths thingys are called "pay phones" :) j/j they're tough to find nowadays. lol!

-1 i have sooo mixed feeling about that... i loved the simpsons house (save for the terrible wall in the homer and marge's room), but this so far is inferior in almost every aspect. the walls made of panels is a bummer. i expect a d2c set to be better that this. 60+ stickers? the same thing. same price for less bricks and smaller build then the house. strange coloured bricks on the outside wall (some ugly mix of yellow + tan) panels again with their fronts facing towards the inside of the shop so we and up with those squares all around. the walls are yellow, this was so nice, lost opportunity to make it in some other less common colour. then again the set overall looks is good. the roof is a nice detail. the shop looks actually like a real one, not just an approximation of one. the roof tiles are in dark orange - we got new/rare colour here the car looks interesting to build (just like the pink one from the house) lots of nice references to the show it's the simpsons! definitely a must buy... but for a discounted price. i'll try to find one with maybe damaged box or after-display copy. edited by mestari, 14 april 2015 - 01:15 pm.

-1 that's actually not bad sizing, imo. sure, it looks like you get a lot more with the house, but the kwik-e-mart has a lot more of those little references that make it simpsons. i agree with some of the complaining; a real jasper behind a trans-blue panel would have been cool. you could always bulk up the roof with more foliage... i think it has a great foundation as a set, but could do with a few mods to make it better. thanks for the pictures; i greatly appreciate being able to see reviews like this before dropping $200 on a lego set.

1 great review just2good, honestly i love this set lots of great details and references.

1 i like this set a lot better than the simpsons house, but 60+ stickers is just incredibly disappointing. it seems quite a few of them could have been printed parts

1 did anyone else have a problem with the piano against the wall of the simpsons house? it just kept coming off way too easily and i was getting really frustrated with it sticking out and not fully going on so i had to put the two tiles that hold them one place over away from the wall for it to sit properly without falling out, i think i might put snowball ii behind it since cats love to hide underneath or behind things lol but just curious to know if anyone else was encountering this problem with the previous set.

1 nice review of a surprisingly interesting set. *y* those windows are great, and no doubt difficult to get. classic coffee maker, simple yet exactly right. that baseplate was in a few other sets, but never with that pattern. would have made a great base for some of the classic 80s houses lego used to treat us to. in tan was part of the adventurers egypt sets. as recently as 2001 it was a base for ogel. versatile plate that hopefully hasn't disappeared completely. parapink is apparently "light pink" on brickshelf, so i guess it's just lighter than normal pink (and stopped appearing in 1995. just so you know, that monkey is drinking too much and likely to fall in the pool ... ;-)

0 photoshop?s your friend... *skull*

1 great review! i loved the pic of your sigfig buried under legos :-d it's too bad lego did not continue to make more of this style of set.

1 that?s really a great and overall nice playset with a very cool mrs. puff and a fine new spongebob! *sweet* the boating school?s indeed very nice with a beautiful color scheme, and so is the lighthouse.... i?m really tempted to buy a second set just to "complete" these buildings.... although it?s a little too expensive for doing so, and it wouldn?t even fit with the style of the other sb sets. x-d wet highway to the poor puffer fish? privat hell on! :-d

1 i like this one better than the other one for parts and such, plus i'm generally a sucker for any different minifig, but yeah, that price is steep. great review though!

1 one more sb face - yeah *wub*! being a lighthouse freak i really like it, the trans clear blue ones rocks *y*! i?m getting it - period! sb on copmike

1 man, that sponge-bob head cracks me up! hilarity.this is a cool set, although i much prefer the chum bucket set. i don't see what's wrong with the course, then again i can see why afols wouldn't like it. it's just playability really. i like the breakable wall though. the building is cool, a few modifications (i.e. making it more realistic, real chairs for a start) and it would make a cool little wharf for your lego town. and to sw4j, mrs puff's legs are connected at the feet, if you look closely. so, thanks for the great review, *yoda*!

1 very nice review *yoda* !! though, i think you should review the "course" because it looks very interesting.

0 it looks like a good set but i would rather get the neighborhood one.

1 the lizard looks the best to me - put him in a town and you've got a monster terrorising the residents. dr. s.

1 a very fine review of a very fine set, thanks sinner. *y* the variety of cool colors in that set?s just formidable. one more beautiful creator set indeed! roaarrrr on! :'-)

1 sinner, on aug 16 2007, 04:01 pm, said: i just love playing with the new princess! you will be seeing her shocked and dismayed for a while to come... shocked and dismayed? when you give her flowers last week she was also shocked and dismayed. i think she's just allergic for both flowers and animals. i hope she's not allergic for skeletons too. :-p :-d by the way: great review, you made a nice warm, soft place to sleep for hinckley. x-d

1 great review sinner i regret not buying this set when i saw it cheap in a local sale :-(

0 sinner, on aug 16 2007, 05:46 pm, said: nothing but the best for hinckley. :-p :'-) thanks buddy. you're such a good friend. another excellent review!

0 i was really kidding, of course you want to keep it. who wouldn't? ;-) i was going to buy it off of bl anyway. x-d now, if lego made a theme about creator animals, that would be great. *sweet*

1 mediumsnowman, on 03 may 2015 - 05:20 am, said: thanks for the review! i really like this set. i love the acu minifigures and the dinosaur is really nice. i think the helicopter has great potential for a shield helicopter. only suggestion is that some of your pictures are a little bit dark. (especially the box front one) but really good for your first review! thanks a lot! thanks! brickg, on 03 may 2015 - 07:49 am, said: this set is imo average. love the dinosaur... i love the dinosaur too

0 nice review! although, that picture of the ad reminded me of how some of the things surrounding jurassic world (lego, that is) seems hastily put together. just look at that the minifig. he is star lord's head and hair, indiana jones' torso with different arms, and city legs. to me, that seems a bit weak, especially for a video game.

1 yesterday i went to toys 'r us and bought the dilophosaur ambush. beside that the shop had a display of the jw polybags. for €3,49 i picked up two of them. now here is my little review of this pretty nice set. first some data: line: jurassic world year: 2015 pieces: 29 price: €3,49 packaging: polybag ok, lets start with the polybag itself. it is a standard size and had plenty of room for all the parts. the front depicts the whole set with a little hexagon on the right with a seperate picture of the dinosaur and its name. in this case the celophysis is called gallimimus. weird choice next is the instruction sheet. it is a doublesided paper with every building step in clear sight. the part selection is nice. there are only a few but all of them are pretty usefull for all kind of builds. there are two parts which stood-out. both are printed tiles. the first one is the yellow/black warning tile in 1x4. you can't have enough of that. the second one is a 2x2 tile with the jurassic world logo on it. that's pure awesome. the bigger sets seem to have only sticker for that, so this little set is a perfect way to get hold of this nice tile. the leftovers. nothing special. here is the complete trap. it is a basic build and functions pretty well. in the end the parts are more interesting as the build so it will definitely end up as a parts-pack. now on to the star of this bag. the celophysis/gallimimus. i don't know why lego decided to call this dinosaur mold any different, but i think it has to do with movie-connection and the will to not produce a new mold. nevermind, this figure is great and the colour is very bright and totally stood out. pretty beastie. a comparison between the 2015 gallimimus and the 2012 celophysis. the final set in all its glory. final verdict: it is a great little set. the parts used a nice and usefull. the printed tiles are the secret stars of this set and the dinosaur is fun two. with a few packs of these you could easily build a celophysis pack with lots of jurassic world signs on their way. highly recommended.

1 lego 31036 creator toy and grocery shop thanks to eurobricks for making this review possible! for years, lego has offered a house of some sort in the creator line each year - with the standard creator 3-in-1 instructions, that's given us a very wide variety of housing. in 2014, they added a business option with their 31026 bike shop and cafe set. this continues into this year's toy and grocery shop set. these shops are smaller than the very detailed modular buildings, but that should help them fit in better with the other city sets, and this also lets them get into more kids' cities with their lower pricetag. name: toy and grocery shop set number: 31036 pieces: 466 price: $39.99 minifigs: 2 theme: creator year of release: 2015 links: bricklink peeron brickset the box the front of the box shows the "a" version model out of the three, plus insets of the b and c versions. i like the sorta-european looking backdrop; it goes well with the styling of the buildings. interestingly, the main model is shown opened up for play, while the two insets show those versions folded. the box top on the top of the box, lego helpfully shows that with 3 of these sets, you can make a whole street. the box back on the back, you get to again see all three versions together, but this time, folded. it's a little creepy though with those clones running around :) the manuals yep, three actual, printed manuals. there's nothing indicating them as being a, b, and c models, but it's pretty obvious looking at the designs which is the "main" model and which are the alternates. the contents bags of parts and two plates. nothing terribly exciting to see here.... the minifigs nothing new here, but two nice figs none-the-less. well, bricklink does say that both figs are unique to this set, but there's not any new parts to them. the closest thing to rare is the female head - it's only in this set, 2013's dragon mountain castle set, a uk store grand opening set, and one of the 2014 holiday freebie sets. the faces aren't that unique, but i guess this exact combo of two faces on the head is. i love the kid torso with the spaceman on it. the minifig backs no back printing on anything here except for an alternate female face. sorry. i do like that her two faces are so different though. that's much better than when a head has a "scared" and a "more scared" face. the "c" build enough with the basics; let's build. i'm going to review them in the same order i built them, backwards. since you can tell immediately looking at the 3 designs that they're going to use different numbers of pieces and so forth, i figured i'd build the smallest first lest it seem like a letdown. all three have some basic similarities - the two plates are hinged to give a building that opens for play. they also do have interiors, which you can see starting to form here. the "c" build, front it's a pretty quick build, so it's done already. here's the front of the building with it opened up. like this, it appears to be two separate stores, a newsstand and some sort of shop you can enter. all the printed tiles help give the newsstand a detailed appearance, but i'm not sure why they've got a $100 bill lying on the ledge... the "c" build, rear from the back side, the interiors are pretty plain. the shop half has a plant in a jar and a weird chair, and the newsstand just has a register. the "c" build, sides here's the two sides of the folded building. on the hinge side, there's a bunch of windows in a disjointed wall with random colors. on the other, why did they put in a huge window when the set does include a trans-clear door that could have gone there? and you get a small patch of plants, like so many sets seem to have these days. the "c" build, extras that's a lot of leftovers there. and not just little stuff - multiple doors, stairs, etc. and unused sand green is always a little sad.... the "b" build, 1 a pretty similar start, with the hinge and little garden and some tiles along the ground. the "b" build, 2 now we see a big windowed wall, some details like lights, and how it has the usual alternate model "weird part usage" - like a 1x4 brick with side studs being used over the doorway, even though those side studs will not get used. the "b" build, front the finished building gives us a nice little post office, with a letter-carrying bird on the roof. hope that's not their normal method of delivery! something about the colors just doesn't work for me though. the combo of white / light grey / dark grey / black / sand green plus tan is just too much. the tan window and door frames i don't like. the "b" build, inside on the inside, things are weird. the counter on the left is ok, but the light above the door (with a yellow clip? ugly!) is too big, and everything else over there by the door doesn't make much sense either. the "b" build, sides i like the front side here, except the colors are still too much. the bench, greenery, mailbox on the corner, and streetlight are all nice. the boy is a little creepy though - binoculars in hand plus a telescope on the roof of the post office? why? the hinge side shows more of the weird colors you get in the wall, but that's going to be hidden when the set is open. plus we even see that on big modulars at times, so it's not so terrible. the "b" build, leftovers again, a lot of leftover parts. it's obvious this was another alternate, but it'd be nice to see more of them used to make a bigger building. but let's move on to the model that does use them all... the "a" build, 1 the first half starts like this. maybe it's just my bias, but it already feels like a more detailed build. bottles on the wall, the yellow and red awning over the window, etc. the "a" build, 2 the other half starts off with detailed work too. i think that's a red vending machine. the stairs are also very solidly built. i also appreciate the effort to get that diagonal base where a door will be - it's such a nice touch to have sections of a building that aren't right angles. the "a" build, 3 not too much has been added, but i wanted to showcase the tiny toys before they get hidden by a wall. that robot and train are just fantastic little micro builds. the "a" build, 4 things are coming together quickly. the walls, windows, and doors get the first floor nearly done. i'm still not big on the sand green and tan combo, but i do really like the red and yellow awnings. the "a" build, 5 it appears the shop owner lives upstairs, since we've got a bedroom forming here. the bed is a little plain, but the table and lamp on the other half are great. and my big fingers did not like putting all those railings on the balcony, with the telescope posts and tile tops. knocked quite a few off before i got them all done. the "a" build, front and it's done. all the details make this set really feel like a mini-modular. the roofline has great greebling, and the shop contents, and on and on. it's not perfect though. the tiny car above the toy store door isn't nearly as good as the toys inside. and the kid's yellow scooter? the wheels aren't even on the ground, much less able to roll. the scooter looks decent though, so that counts for something. well, at least as long as you are at this angle, since the boy's only got 1 foot on the 1 stud wide scooter. the "a" build, inside most of the interior has been seen already. the roof though does a nice job of being interesting for a roof. a skylight, the edge rails, etc. and you can see there's not much "wrong color" in the walls. the "a" model, sides an interesting building when folded up. very tall and skinny. you can tell it's not really meant to be displayed this way - it's meant to be open. the good - lots! i like the awning, the diagonal door, the flowerbox under the upper window, the folding gate on the balcony that lets it be used in open or closed mode, and the green / white / blue colors. the bad - well, the stairs end short of the upper door, i still don't really like the tan doorframes (i think black would have been better), and why don't the upper floors match up in size? the "a" model, leftovers ah, that's more like it. just a few small pieces left as spares. the errors you might have to click through to the full-size versions, but i did catch a few weird errors in the manuals. first, in the photo of the newsstand, the map in the front corner is on there sideways. the map does have a clear north arrow printed on it. on the second image, the boy's feet are hanging off the edge. just unusual to see an alignment error in the manual like that. the comparison here are this set and the modular detective office side by side. there's a huge difference - as you'd expect. but is the difference more than you'd expect? this set is 466 parts, $40. the do is 2262 pieces and $160. 5 times the parts, 4 times the price. looking at them side by side, i'd expect a bigger difference in both. the conclusion so, what's my conclusion on this model? i love the main model, but the alternates are meh. it's a nice set for someone looking for a town building other than police and fire stations, but who isn't ready to move to the modular line. compared to the modulars though, it seems overpriced. part of that is because the huge modulars are actually a great deal compared to other lego sets. i'm also a little surprised that it's so small, when you compare it to the city sets like a police station. those are generally designed with much more open space, letting them be more of a playset. this one is small and cramped, so it'd be tougher to play in. it's not really a city set though. the ratings value: 7/10 - it's under the 10 cents a part mark, but that's largely due to having a ton of tiny parts. all those flowers and decorative 1x1 round studs add up quickly! design: 7/10 - good and bad on the colors, and there's a big difference between the quality of the main vs alternate models. having so many leftover pieces is one thing when the creator set makes 3 very different models (ie a boat, plane, and truck). when it's 3 buildings, it seems wasteful to have so many parts leftover. minifigs: 6/10 - i'm not sure they both fit the set. i suppose the boy is going to the toy store and the woman is going to the grocery? but there's no storekeeper in either. the woman doesn't look like a storekeeper to me, so that's why i assume she's another shopper. i love the boy, but the woman is just so-so - except that i do appreciate the head having two very different expressions. but again, that doesn't fit the set. i can't see her scared face being used. playability: 6/10 - the shops are detailed with registers and so forth, but it's all so tiny it'd be hard to play with the figs in it. parts: 9/10 - tons of windows and doors, plus nice sand green bricks. but some things (the large blue curves used on the roof for example) are weirdly specialized and would be hard to use in another building design. overall: 7/10 - i'd recommend doing what i did - build the alternates first, then the main since that's how you'll want to leave it. i'd really like to see the price a little lower compared to other sets (again, the part count is inflated due to so many tiny parts) and the finished building is tiny, but it's loaded with neat details.

-1 a terrific, very comprehensive review - but i'm not at all impressed with this set. it feels like a mishmash of bricks with no clear design aesthetic and as such blatantly underdeveloped (i.e. designed to hit a price/brick count point rather than provide a solid set in the creator town tradition). compared to other creator sets at this price point (31025 - mountain hut, for example) it feels utterly uninspired and ugly. edited by johnny6666, 04 may 2015 - 10:02 am.

1 reviews for this set really should picture them next to the bike shop & cafe, which it's intended to be compatible with right down to the size of the baseplates and grey tiles around the edge. it doesn't look that great on its own, but if you add the two sets together you get something that begins to look like a street scene.

1 thanks andy_0306uk, your very clever strategic decision to serve us with blurry pictures allowed me to glance at this review without ruinating that whole wonderful advent surprise too much.... :-p *y* but although i loved the last year?s one, i think they could do another theme (or perhaps even two calendars), because right now castle?s pretty hot imo.

1 informative review, thanks! *y* as usual, it makes a fairly good parts pack. wish i could pick up a few on deep discount, but at full price one is fine. i do like the 'stewards' and some of the workmen. overall, i think i'm looking more forward to the belville calendar, just for it's assortment of unusual parts. ugh. belville. still, parts are parts, and it's got some. phoinix summed up one of the most common complaints i hear about all of the lines in 3 simple words ... "no girls....again!" good job, now get lego to listen. ;-)

0 whoa! it's out already! *places order* i guess i should thank you andy, because i might have missed this one just like i missed last year's calendar. now all i have to do is wait two weeks and pick it up at the post office across the border.

-1 thanks andy for the review! i prefer the city advent calendar 2006 a lot! those mini sets are nor good for me! the "road subtheme" sets are nice, but the others, not so good! the 05 version waf ok, the 06 version was better, with bigger sets, and more building ones! and the 07 is poor! it's just 2-3 pieces to put together on 2x4 plates... where are the gardening accessories? where are some nice small constructions that you can put in your layout like a mailbox or an orodator? and the chrismas tree looks :-x imo! and no santa... *y* for andy *n* for this calendar

0 nice review :) but... you paid how much? this set is priced around 7 euros here in germany, which is a very fair price for what you get in my oppinion. it?s a little disappointing though, that i couldn?t think of any alternate builds for this set, and there are no inspirations on the box or the ef website.

1 this is a really great set! when i first saw it i thought "oh a silly small plane who needs that" and then i got it and i am very happy that i did! this is one of the best designed lego creator sets! and it was designed by the designer of the cafe-corner!!!!

1 a fine set, a great review and good additional pictures. thanks lasse d and sinner. teamwork on! *y*

0 lasse d, on sep 21 2007, 05:09 am, said: thank you sinner for bringing the pictures of the hovercraft. i think it is a really cool model, but the steering wheel doen't work too well. i agree. errr... sorry if i have annoyed you by posting the pictures. looking at your brickshelf folder you had taken photos of the hovercraft as well and i seem to have stepped on your toes. :-$ feel free to beat me up, or i could do it myself if you prefer... 8-| (i prefer bigger pictures as i get tired of clicking, waiting, clicking, waiting. if the pictures are all there all you have to do is click then wait! :-p )

-1 thanks for the review! i really dislike this set but i thought much worse of it when we saw the first pic. i think it was a good idea (mech transporter) pursued in a horribly wrong way! :-x thanks again! :-) batbrick away! >:-)

1 i so need to buy this! where did you get it from? it says limited, so i guess it?s only available in certain stores, as the bridge walker was, or supernova or golden guardian.

0 i like how the back is a prison, but aside from that it looks like spare parts to me! thanks for the review though. *sweet*

1 hahah, entertaining and informative, a great read- thanks for the review! on a side note i thought fant-four-stic was....ok. on the poorer side of ok. the exposition felt like it was from a 3 hour film because it was so long and towards the middle it started to drag. the ending was terrible. edited by mutant orc, 12 september 2015 - 09:53 pm.

0 overall, i wish marvel in particular would have more playsets in its theme (batman has several great ones in the dc theme). but then again, if this is the best playset to date for marvel, maybe it's better just to leave well enough alone. i would definitely like to see them attempt something in the $100+ (us) price range because i think it could be good; marvel needs an equivalent to the arkham asylum set. regarding this set, i saved myself some money and bought the 4 minifigs i needed (all but spidey) on bricklink for less than half the set price. edited by dmarvin, 17 september 2015 - 06:25 pm.

1 thanks for the review.i'm not a big fan of spider man sets, but this set really impressed me. this must because of the design of this set and the minifigures that included in this set.

0 this set seems to appeal more to the non superhero crowd. it is one of the only marvel sets i bought. mainly because i thought that the building was a nice return to the old style of city sets. i would love to see this sort of backdrop for a more realistic agents theme... i also liked that most of the figs in this set were easier to merge into other (non-super) uses... thanks for the review! god bless, nathan

1 super-cool! any text on the boxes of these ones? the stormie's left arm seems really long and slightly odd, but that's just because i'm jealous you've got one. :-d shorter than i was expecting though. dr. s.

1 ooh, i want one. i don't care which but i want one. perhaps *vader* ... thanks for the pics.

0 the arms of the stormtrooper are a litle long i think.

-1 got some info about my boba maquette yesterday >:-(: quote dear mikael , due to an unexpected delay by the vendor, the scheduled shipping date of the following pre-order item(s) has changed, the new ship date is as follows: swlfllmbf exclusive lego star wars boba fett maquette ships jan 2008 well, i only ordered it ........... - feb 17 2007 |-/!!! sucks bigtime on copmike

1 will follow this impatiently ;-) really like the start of the review *y* you always seems to pull it of nicely, in comparission with the exasperating *yoda* x-d :-p build on! play on! on on!

1 the manual: the gigantic manual measures 17? x 12? and is almost an inch thick. it is spiral bound with a cardboard like front and back and it is 314 pages. interesting decision not to break it up into multiple manuals. it is almost unwieldy at this size and thickness. unfortunately, the manual is not available electronically from the lego website. hopefully, it will be soon. missing were the little instructions at the beginning telling you to not build this beast on shag carpet and to sort out the 5,000+ pieces before you get started. i guess they figure if you got $500 to spend on this thing, you can build it however you want. as usual, we get the regular lego manual features: - piece call outs for each step - parts inventory at the end of the manual - page numbers - photos of all the other 2007 sets at the end of the manual manual (paperback book provided for scale) various manual photos (8x8 plate provided for scale) i'm about 2 hours into building and sorting. i'm trying to stay a day ahead in my posting. the build has been easier than i thought so far. despite the massive number of pieces, it has not been too hard to sort and find what you need. build photos will start appearing in tomorrow's entry.

0 very expecting indeed. waiting for your kind photo ... :-)

1 nice idea, reviewing the set while constructing it. this is the top of the bill for any lego-collector (also financially speaking..) and i like the look of all those thousands of pieces. the manual is incredible, i thought i had a really thick manual coming with set 8479, but this one exceeds it with ease... review on!

1 good review. *y* me, i can't build it before saturday. :'-(

1 great review so far! i am looking forward to additional posts! as for the number of pins - from the peeron inventory for the set, there are over 400 technic pins of various lengths! (insert the "my fingers hurt from building" emoticon) keep the pictures coming!

0 the minifigs: as you can see, the minifigs are really nice. they even throw in an extra fleshie head! no doubt these will fetch quite a bit on the bricklink and ebay markets. i?m keeping mine. continuing the build this photo shows how well this model is put together. notice that they use four of the three-hole beams per side to hold this together. i remember reading that you can hang this model from the ceiling. i don?t doubt it. these right angle technic pieces are used to reinforce the structure of the model. you can see them used here: i was shocked at how many light gray plates are in this set. i have two tubs full of these: the infrastructure is now complete: i got hung up for about an hour looking for one of these: turns out, lego gave me an extra left wedge and shorted me a right wedge. so frustrating! i had to stead one off my 6211 star destroyer. it is not a very common piece by the way?

1 hey nice review, im up to about the same point as you (page 70 to be exact) , tho i didnt have that missing piece thankfully! i think lego have done a much better job at packing the lego this time, i remember it taking me much longer to find pieces on the ucs isd build

1 thanks for the review, and tons of pics! i've been wanting to pick this one up since i saw it. i thought the 4956 creator house was nice, but this model town house is in a completely different league! i also like the alternate models that you can see in the catalogues.

1 a beautiful and humorous review with very fine pics. *y* a fantastic set, full of neat details and in a wonderful color scheme. great for every city builder for sure. i guess we waited for sets like that. we dreamed about them. i?m glad we got them now. :'-) edit: congrats! it seems you?ve got your bucket back.... :-p

0 i found the use of parts well done by the designers. i made a car and then tried to make a house from a different instruction book. i could not as several pieces were already used in the car. nice to see them using all the parts like that rather than having a lot of "extra" bits. moral of the story: one instruction book at a time. *sweet*

1 awesome review! luckily you have two cute little friends and one beautiful lady to help you out! :-p i likewise love *wub* this set and your review does it credit! i laughed outloud a lot as i read it. i especially love you trying to look through the windowless back :-d :-d :-d great job, now sort that out and start building for our competition! x-d

1 excellent review with great pics and cameo appearances by some of our eb favs *y* definitely a set that was on my 'to get' list already, and this only confirms that. might make me want two, just because i love tan so much and i'd like to see if something could be done to bulk up that car. great job as always! :-)

1 thanks for this review sinner! i love this house, with the nicely made tiled corners, the colorscheme and the garage. the only thing i dislike about this set is the way the windows are attached in train windows (so they turn inwards a little) instead of the usual frames with shutter-attachment-ability. but that is something that can be fixed in the blink of an eye. i will certainly buy this house some day when i find it at reasonable price.

[shameless self-promotion /off] ;-) i was actually considering adding a link to your moc anyway. thanks! :-p paul_delahaye, on sep 29 2007, 07:38 am, said: i too have bought this set and the only thing i notice which is a bit odd, with the exception of there being no floors in the house is the lack of a steering wheel in the car! once again, i think this is just a sign of all style, no substance! :-d paulc, on sep 29 2007, 05:19 pm, said: the mixed rough and smooth roof bricks would annoy me on a model like the mtt, but here it looks as is if the roof is quite old with some parts being worn and pitted and some parts being replaced with new roof tiles. i quite like the effect. fair point. what confuses me though is the (cg) cover has the rough ones shown... :-|

1 sinner, thanks for this outstanding review! i am glad that i had read this review in advance, before making my purchase on this set earlier with my girlfriend. we built this set for a total of 3 hours, to complete this beauty, in about 2 hours ago. there are stars circling around my head at this very moment, when i post this reply. i must admit from the bottom of my heart, that this is an wonderful piece of house, that simply shows the beauty of it, with the european kind of houses, where there is a garage. furthermore, there is a lovely blue car. i am seeing stars right now, in the middle of the night, and i must drop a thanks to you personally as well. although it is empty from its interior unlike the 4996 beach house, but this set has the majestic look which simply place a "wow" factor in front of it upon completion. at the moment, we had plans for getting the second set next month, to build the other design as well. hopefully, i will be able to share with you guys, all of my different creators sets, with its alternate designs as well in the near future.

1 nice pictorial review, i always like this little set ! a little more text would have been nice but that is ok as it is . ps: you should have mentioned in the title that this topic is picture heavy - i was wondering why it was loading so slow on my mobile

1 i actually bought this set last monday as it was reduced to 14.99.....it actually not a bad little set considering the size and part count, has a decent array of functions. its a nice little set....the b model looks just as good so i might buy a second set, as you get the bucket left over and i need that bucket for another set. edited by richard dower, 19 october 2015 - 04:42 pm.

1 very nice review! seems like i'll be getting my first castle set soon.. *wub* grevious, on oct 10 2007, 09:33 pm, said: most of them are old pieces recolored, but the ball on chain (what’s the actual name, could someone tell me?) that would be a flail. ;-)

1 thanks for this nice review. nice comics presentation, too. *sweet* makes me want to get some new castle sets even harder, now. :-$

1 that was a fun review, i picked up a couple of these on holiday in france and it was one of the main reasons i went all-out and bought the rest of the castle range! dr. s.

1 great review grevious!! *sweet* *y* nice job, thanks for sharing. great comic and i especially love that you gave us an alternative model, something lego neglects to do anymore... |-/ thanks again! *wub*

1 that's a superb review if i ever saw one, and another great story! *y* it's a good review even though i got the set 4 months ago. :-p this just reinforces my like for it. :-p

1 nice review, i like this set alot. *y* :-)

1 it's that time of year again when the days get shorter, the nights get colder, and children all around the world stare longingly into warmly lit toy shops and prepare their wishlist to send to santa. this is also the time when the lego group releases their latest winter village set which has been an annual tradition for the past seven years. these sets have been very popular, especially among afols, and are always highly anticipated. however, while some entries in this series have been more popular than others, none has been as controversial as this year's set, the winter toy shop, which is a re-release of the first winter village set, 10199 winter toy shop from 2009. it seems that many think that this set didn't need to be remade and would have preferred a new set instead, or that it is not different enough from the original and will be redundant in a completionist's collection. does it deserve all the hate? let's find out. disclaimer: i don't own the 2009 version, so i can't compare them visually, but i will do my best to let you know what is different in this version. if you do need a visual reference, you can refer to svelte's excellent review of the original. set number: 10249 name: winter toy shop theme: creator year of release: 2015 pieces: 898 minifigs: 8 price: £59.99 / $79.99 / 69.99€ s@h description: quote welcome to the winter toy shop! the holiday season has arrived and the toymaker is busy finishing off his latest creations! outside, children ski and snowboard, and a freshly built snowman sparkles in the light that shines from the toyshop tower. help decorate the huge tree that stands at the center of the square, play with the curious kitten on the cozy wooden bench or join in with the carolers beneath the ornate streetlamp. this charming set also features a ladder, trees in various sizes, jack-in-the-box, a toy biplane, helicopter, rocket, train, race car, truck, robot, tugboat, teddy bear and a wrapped gift. have fun building this enchanting winter wonderland! includes a snowman and 8 minifigures with assorted accessories: a male caroler, female caroler, a woman, 2 men, 2 boys and a girl. s@h bricklink brickset the box the box art of this set is similar to that of the original, but there are some notable differences. the christmas tree is on the right side of the image this time while the park bench is on the left and of course it features this year's design for creator boxes with the dark blue stripe along the right side and the "expert" logo in the top right corner. there's also a small picture of the back of the toy shop and the background looks less cartoony than on the original. the back is also very similar, showing a different angle of the toy shop along with some close-ups, although this time there is no minifig lineup. instead, the minifig lineup is on the right side of the box. it also includes the accessories that each minifig comes with and some of the toys. on the left side of the box there is a thumbnail of the box art and the set name in six different languages. they also want to make sure that you know that there are batteries included by saying it in dozens of languages. the top of the box features the inventory and a 1:1 scale reference with the female caroler. on the bottom there is a picture that reminds you that there is a light brick included in this set, in case that wasn't clear from the front of the box, and it confirms that yes, it is a bad idea to put it in water, in case you were planning to go swimming with your winter toy shop. the contents inside the box there are two instruction booklets and two groups of bags, one for each instruction booklet. while two groups of bags is not as many as there usually are in other sets of this size, it's still better than the first version of this set where the bags weren't numbered at all, so this makes the build a bit easier. the large bag in group 1 and the two large bags in group 2 have a white stripe going down the middle of the bag and only have one group number printed on it along with some other number and some kind of scan code. i have no idea why they made this distinction for these bags or what that code is for, so if any of you know the purpose of this, please let me know in the comments below. here is a random instructions page. as you can see, the building steps can get quite challenging as they sometimes include many different pieces in one step, especially when it uses a lot of brown pieces which are very dark and hard to see in the instructions, living up to the set's status as an expert-level set. most of the time, though, the instructions are pretty clear and easy enough to follow. there are some parts in new colors in this set that weren't in the first version or any other set until now, such as that large, flat technic arch in dark green, the jester hat in orange and blue, one of those new 2z2 round jumper tiles in brown, a golden frog(!), and a snowboard in dark blue. there are also some rare friends parts that make their creator debut here such as the skis in azure and that new clear 1x1 round tile with a tiny tube coming out of it which is usually used as a stand for friends accessories and is a very useful piece, especially for snot techniques (and no, i'm not talking about the type of snot that many people usually have stuck in their nose around this time of year). there are some printed parts as well, such as the clock tile, the letter tile, and the register slope like in the first version of the set. we also get a new face print for the white cat which is more in line with other modern cat designs. but the best part is the shop sign which is printed this time around. it features a lovely wood pattern, the words "toy shop", and a toy soldier on both sides of the sign. which is ironic since the shop doesn't seem to sell any toy soldiers like this, but it looks so good on the sign that i won't sue them for false advertising. the minifigs let's start with the most unique figures in this set, the carolers. these two were also the highlight in the first version of the set, but in the original they both had the same head (this one -> ) which featured a very questionable facial expression that could easily be taken out of context. in this version, they have unique faces which look much better and help distinguish their gender. the male caroler uses lord vampyre's torso which looks quite snazzy on him. maybe this is lord vampyre before he became a vampire? the female caroler is easily the best minifig in the set, though, because in addition to her exclusive head, she also gets an exclusive torso and skirt print! a huge improvement over the generic unprinted one in the original. she also gets the queen hair in dark brown and aragorn's lined cape instead of two combined regular capes. this set truly is the return of the queen! the snowman is technically not a minifig, but as you can see here, he is exactly as tall as one and he is the first thing you build after the minifigs, so i included him here. he has mostly the same design as before, except this time he has robot claws for arms instead of levers. which is good since they allow him to hold accessories such as his broom. his carrot nose is included separately again. the carolers both have back printing while the snowman looks no different from the back than he does from the front. here you can see the black side of the female's cape. this lined cape is so much nicer than the solution they used in the original. next up we have what i assume is a married couple who are likely the parents of at least one of the kids, as well as the toymaker who i will call geppetto. the man in the pinstripe suit was not included in the first version of the set, so he's a bonus minifig! these guys are fairly generic, but they have some detailed torso prints, so they look pretty nice. geppetto seems to have gotten younger since the release of the original set since his gray hair has now turned dark tan and he doesn't seem to need glasses anymore. the men both have back printing, but the woman is the only one in this set who doesn't get a back print. why you gotta be so discriminating against women, lego?! last but not least, there are the kids. one of the boys wears dark blue pants, a green jacket, and a wool cap. he looks a bit like a lumberjack, so let's call him lumberjack boy, or jack for short. the little girl wears an outfit that wouldn't look out of place in the friends theme with a lavender scarf and pants. i'll call her lavender. the second boy is wearing an octan jacket and a sports helmet which makes it ironic that he is the one not doing any winter sports on the box art. i'll call him president business junior, or pbj for short. all of the kids have fairly detailed back printing which makes up for the fact that much like the adults, they are made out of mostly common parts. pbj's helmet and scarf cover up the back of his head nicely which is important as you will see in the next picture. what's also great about these figs is that half of them have a double-sided head. here you can see pbj doing his best macaulay culkin impression. i also removed his scarf so you can see the printing on his torso better. but he's not the only one who seems to be easily scared. the mother also has a very alarmed expression. maybe she got surprised by the jack-in-the-box or maybe she just realized how expensive toys are nowadays. you can see the female caroler's back printing here. her alternate expression is a non-singing face which is very nice to have and i wish the male caroler could have one too. she looks quite cute with those rosy cheeks. but the most adorable out of all of them has to be the little girl. she comes with a pouting sad face that will melt your heart. please, don't cry! i'll buy you any toy you want, just stop looking at me like that! the build the first half of the build is dedicated to the surroundings of the toy shop. it includes the christmas tree, the park bench, the snowman, the toys, the carolers, jack and lavender. the large bag contains two smaller bags with small pieces, a white box that contains the caroler's cape, and the jester hat in its own little bag. the first thing you build after the minifigs and the snowman is the toys. this version of the set has a lot more toys than the original which is good because i always felt that the first toy shop was a bit light on toys. also, the ones that were in the original have been updated. for example, instead of the two pairs of skis, you now get one pair of skis that use the new ski mold and a snowboard. the jack-in-the-box is mostly the same, except it now has an orange and blue color scheme instead of the red and blue from the original. this change was probably not necessary, but hey, at least we get a new jester hat out of it. and instead of the brick-built teddy bear you get the new teddy bear mold. i have mixed feelings about this change because i actually kinda liked the brick-built teddy design and using a specialized mold seems to be going against the spirit of creator sets, but on the other hand i can't deny that the molded teddy looks better than the blocky old one. meh. the new toys include a tugboat which has some rounded technic pieces as its hull, a biplane, a rocket, a helicopter, and a truck that cleverly uses roller skates for its wheels. these are all quite brilliant designs that feel like micro versions of lego city sets and make a great addition to the set. here is a back view of some of the more complex models. as you can see, the friends accessory stand has been cleverly used to hold the biplane's fin in place and to provide a stand for the helicopter. the jack-in-the-box has a hinged lid. the only thing that bugs me a bit is the t-piece on top of the helicopter that holds the rotor in place, but i can't think of any better way they could have done it. next is the ladder that is used to decorate the tree which is exactly the same as the first version. the supports are on a click-hinge, so they can be adjusted or folded away. then, you build the tree itself. you begins, of course, with the stand which is mostly the same design as before, but this time the plates at the bottom are brown instead of white and have golden studs as feet. next, you build the first layer of branches. the main difference in this version of the tree is that this one actually has a brown stem rather than just a technic axle on which you stack the layers of branches one by one. you wont be able to see the stem in the final result, but i like this change as it makes the tree more realistic. then you add the second layer of branches. this one doesn't have lights/candles and attaches to the lower layer at an angle using the four trans-yellow studs close to the stem. the third layer is added. this one has lights again. each layer is similar in that they are all made out of green plates that are built around a 4x4 ring plate, but they get smaller each time and are constructed differently enough for the build not to feel repetitive. with the addition of the fourth layer, we get close to finishing the tree. lastly, you add one more layer and the tip of the tree. now it's time to decorate the tree! however, it's not as fun as it sounds since that requires you to add lights to the two chains/ropes first which can get a bit repetitive. the clips holding the lights to the chain were white, but this time they're pearl gold which looks much nicer in my opinion. the next part of the build is the park bench with the streetlamp and the little tree. this is a fairly quick build with not much to it. the fishbowl helmet parts are a useful piece that you don't see too often, so it's nice to get them again in this remake. the design is pretty much the same as in the original set except for the wreaths on the streetlamp which use a green life preserver instead of a round 2x2 plate. this is another instance where they use a specialized piece instead of a brick-built solution, but i'm okay with that because unlike with the teddy bear, this part was not originally intended to be a wreath, so it's still nice part usage. the second half of the build is dedicated to the toy shop itself and includes the couple, geppetto, and pbj. please note that there is a fourth 6x10 plate burried under the parts. you begin by tiling the floor, setting up the walls, and adding the interior items such as the fireplace, the cash register, and the toy displays. next, you add the walls, windows, and the door and the ground floor of the shop is finished. so far, the build is the same as the old toy shop, except this time they decided to have the white stripes on the marquees be the longer ones instead of the dark red ones for some reason. i don't know why they did this and kinda would have preverred to get dark red 1x1 plates instead of white, but it doesn't detract from the look of the shop, so i don't really care. now we begin with the upper floor. this is where things start to look a little different. can you tell the difference? the difference is that this time they attach the roof using clip-hinges instead of bulky technic constructions which gives you more space on this floor and allows it to look more like an actual attic. they even tile the floor next to the frog clock. aftter adding the roof, the build is finished. the main roof feels a bit loose since it's only attached to the building by one side. i'm not sure if this was an issue in the old toy shop, but it's not a big deal. i just wouldn't pick the set up by the roof. what i do like is that they used double cheese slopes on the awning on the outer wall of the tower instead of singles which makes it a bit easier to build. i like how the supports under the tower roof now match those of the main roof. the wreaths have also been updated like the ones on the streetlamp. and those technic arches under the roof look a lot more like garlands now. on the original, they were dark gray, so i didn't even know they were supposed to be garlands and assumed they were part of the architecture. the shop sign looks a lot better now that it is printed. the old one just looked like a white flag. i also like how the small plates under the marquee give it a wavy look and they included two trees in different sizes on the right side of the shop. the back is nice and open and allows you to see the rest of the toys, the robot, train, and race car, all of which have just as much of a simple and clever design as the other toys. the clock looks much nicer with the new golden frog. because golden frogs make everything better. spare parts there are quite a few small parts left over, including a roller skate and one of those friends accessory stands which will come in handy. the complete set here you can see the full set together. it looks quite nice and festive with all the little details and there are many scenes that you can play out with it: you can have the minifigs decorate the tree, have the kids play in the snow, have the carolers sing by the bench, have the toymaker build some toys in his workshop, or have the parents buy presents for their kids. it's a festive, toy-filled winter wonderland! the fireplace looks cozy and i like the brick pattern going up the chimney. the entrance of the shop looks a bit empty aside from the cash register. i feel like they could have displayed some more toys here, but oh well. being a set targeted at teens and adults, there aren't really any play features aside from the light brick which is attached to a hinge, so you can either activate it by pressing the button with your finger or tilting the brick upward so that the button is pressed against the roof. however, since the roof is not connected in the middle and only attached on the sides, it tends to split open a bit when you do that, so i'm not sure if attaching the roof this way here was such a good idea. nevertheless, it looks quite nice when the light is lit. ratings design: 5/5 - this set is as gorgeous as it was back in 2009! the small updates that they made are mostly good ones, although the absence of a brick-built teddy is a bit disappointing and the new way the roof is attached, while not as bulky as before, makes the roof slightly unstable, but those are just nitpicks. build: 5/5 - there are some interesting building techniques here, such as those on the tree, the roof, and the toys. the fact that the parts are only split into two groups and the part callouts can get fairly complex makes it a challenging, enjoyable build. minifigs: 5/5 - they did a great job updating the figs in this set. while only 3 of the torsos in the original had any printing, all of the torsos have printing front and back in this set, even the skirt and cape of the female caroler. you get two exclusive heads and half of the heads are double-sided, plus you get 8 instead of 7 minifigs. you really can't ask for more in a creator set. playability: 4/5 - this set is more meant to be displayed than to be played with, but there are plenty of things to play with if you want. all the different minifigs, accessories, and set pieces make for endless possibilities for play. it's especially fun to swoosh the micro vehicles around. parts: 3/5 - there are lots of good parts here. most of them are fairly common, but there are some rare parts and some even in exclusive colors. price: 4/5 - this set costs $20 more than the original, but considering that this set has nearly 900 pieces, including some rare and exclusive ones, as well as more minifigs with much better printing, i think $80 is still a fair price. overall: 5/5 - so what's my opinion of this set? for a remake, i think it's great. they managed to make a good set even better. are the changes minor? yes. are they an improvement? mostly, yes. were they necessary? perhaps not, but it's good that they made them instead of just re-releasing the exact same set. so if you didn't get the first winter toy shop, i can highly recommend getting this one. if you do already have the old version, this one might still be worth picking up for the hugely improved minifigs and rare parts alone. as for the controversy over re-releasing the winter toy shop, i can see where the haters are coming from, but i find their complaints to be quite petty. i can understand if you're disappointed because you already have the first winter toy shop and were looking forward to a new set this year, but there's always next year. if you're a completist and feel like tlg is forcing you to buy a set you don't need, you're wrong. nobody is forcing you to buy anything but yourself. if you decide to buy every set in a theme no matter what it is, that's your problem, not lego's. so put down your torches and pitchforks and just be glad that they improved the set design and gave us another chance to buy this classic set. there are far worse things that can happen in this world than lego re-releasing one of their most popular sets. sorry for that little rant. so what is your opinion on re-releases like this? please cast your vote in the poll above. i hope you enjoyed this special eurobricks reviewers academy review and would like to thank the lego group for the opportunity to review this set. happy holidays everyone!

1 thanks for a great review first of all. i do like the upgrades and changes made from the original 2009 set, more colours and parts are offcourse available today than back in 2009. it does look like a great set and i would really realy have loved to get it myself if i had the funds. however their are so many other sets thats first priority for me this december and next year, so sadly i might have to pass on this if its not that i can get it redicioulusly cheap at some point. and yeah, we should appreciate that lego does keep sets coming, even if its just upgrades from earlier releases. town is known for a new police and fire station every year, cant see why a new toyshop is so upsetting. once again thanks for a great review. and happy holidays to you as well.

1 regarding the reason for the different designs on the inner bags, i think that the white stripe is the new version, with the non-stripe version being old. i suspect the reason some sets have both versions is simply that they're still using up some of their supply of older bags. good review. i didn't realise there were quite as many changes as you highlighted (tree, roof etc).

-1 thanks for the excellent review! unfortunately it only highlights how minimal the upgrades are (though they are nice). definitively a pass for me. let's hope lego does continue to make the more realistic winter village sets (versus santa). i'm not opposed to a rehash, the post office could use some improvements for example, but this one is just a wee bit minimal.

1 i missed out on the first one, but i love the improvements made in this version, like the tree having an actual brown trunk so it looks less like an artificial one, and the carolers as well. i may pick this up, but i'm sorry to those of you who already have one.

1 review - 42044 - display team jet introduction the smallest of the 2016 sets, is the display team jet. it doesn't seem to have lots of functionality, but maybe the landing gear is retractable. this set kind of reminds me to the 9394 - jet plane, although it's obviously a lot smaller. as you can read in my review of the 42052 - heavy lift helicopter basically anything flying is +1 for me, so let's find out if this set also fits the bill. note: all images can be clicked for hi-res versions. set information number: 42044 title: display team jet theme: technic released: 2016 part count: 113 box weight: 193 gr box dimensions: 15,4 cm x 13,8 cm x 5,9 cm set price (msrp): € 9,99 price per part: € 0,088 links: brickset, bricklink the box being a small set, it obviously comes in a small box. the display team jet is an aerobatics jet, used in air shows. on the box it's flying rather high, but at least it's at a safe distance from the crowd. front side shows the main model, together with a small section indicating you can use digital building instructions to build this model. back side the back side shows the b-model, a stunt plane. and again a reference to the apps for digital building instructions. more on the stunt plane later. content of the box the box contains: 2 instructions booklets (a- and b-model) 1 sticker sheet 3 technic liftarms 2 bags instruction booklets both the instructions for the a- and b-model are included in the box. sticker sheet a lot of stickers for such a small set. apparently no panel is left untouched. liftarms three liftarms unsealed, nothing out of the ordinary for a small set. bags two bags containing the rest of the parts. highlighted parts this section describes the new and/or otherwise interesting parts. yellow 5l axles the 5l axle in yellow has never been released before, so it's one of the new parts for this year. black 7l flex axles for the layman this seems a common part, but the 7l soft axle actually has never been released in black before. combined with the re-release of the 19l soft axle in black, this will open up lots of possibilities. for those of you thinking you've read this text before; you are right, the new drag racer contains these new 7l flex axles too. white panels this small set comes with a whopping 10 panels. great for the ones who like panels. not so great if you think tlg is using too much panels lately. rudder this part, the small bionicle wing, is the same as the one used in last year's 42033 - record breaker. part list this set contains 113 parts, all listed below. the build this is the collection of parts, used to build the jet. it sure looks like we are getting a landing gear. the build is fun, but pretty straightforward. there aren't any special or cool techniques used in this set. it almost took me more time to apply all the stickers than to build the actual model. finished model the finished jet does look cool though. the white and yellow color scheme, combined with the stickers, work really well. i have seen people refer to the plane as being orange, but it's definitely yellow. technic (or lego in general) tends to have some color variation when it comes to yellow. i do concur this is the warmer variant of yellow, but it's not orange. the back of the plane looks nice too, although i am not a big fan of the rudder part. it looks too detailed, compared to the other panels. it's not a big deal though, and maybe it's just me. parts left only three common parts left. features and functions this set has a single feature and that is a retractable landing gear. it's operated by the black 12t double bevel gear near the cockpit. in the following picture you can see the landing gear retracted. this image shows the landing gear when the plane is ready for landing. hopefully the pilot will roll the plane before landing, but you probably know what i mean video here's s short video demonstrating the display team jet. b-model this set also includes the building instructions for the b-model, a stunt plane. the building experience for the stunt plane is more or less the same as for the jet. well, what do you expect when both models are planes with a limited number of parts. for an alternative model the stunt plane looks fine. there's not a lot of functionality in this plane, but it's worth mentioning that the tail wheel allows the plane to roll on a flat surface. the plane also has working propellors. both functions are demonstrated in the video. unfortunately, the landing gear of the stunt plane is not retractable. parts left a couple of extra leftover parts, but it's nice to see that most of the parts have been used in the b-model as well. actually, there's probably an extra yellow technic smooth 1/2 bush left. i just found it on my desk, but it could belong to one of the other sets. video here's a video demonstrating the stunt plane. summary two nice planes for 13 bucks, that's basically what you get. both models look good and the set has some interesting new parts. especially the 7l flex axle will be very popular. it comes with a decent collection of white panel, although they are very common nowadays. both models have limited functionality, but each of them has at least one function to give the model some playability for kids, other than the swooshability that is. okay, it might lack some proper functions, but i still think kids will love this set. i can see kids running around with one of the planes in their hands. all in all i think this set delivers what you'd expect. score let's see how this set flies! remember that the grades are based on it being a small set. obviously a set like this, cannot be compared with a mercedes flagship. 8 design for a small set, the model looks very authentic. 7 building experience no surprises. 7 features just the retractable landing gear. 8 playability it has swooshability, so i see kids running around with this model. 7 parts lots of panels, if you are into that. 8 value for money can't go wrong with these small sets. 7,5 fun for kids more image can be found on my flickr page. thank you for reading. i hope you enjoyed it.

-1 while i can see kids enjoying this, i'm not sure i would buy. the flex axles are nice, and it is a decent number of white panels but i think i would get better return out of a larger parts set. fantastic review though, and your pictures show off this tiny model better than the box art does.

0 it says 5l in the parts list.

1 love this model, awesome swooshability, interesting parts, and a nice little model to put on my desk at work :)

1 good review, as always jim when i first saw this set i thought that it would make a great parts pack for me, as that i have about 20 white pieces in my technic collection (all from 42043) and this set has some really useful ones, all for a cheap price. those 7l flex axles will be extremely useful in my current build i'm doing

1 nice review, even with the missing demonstration video of the a-model! looks like this is an excellent panel pack for the price, and those soft axles will go down a treat. will this set be the dark horse of 1h 2016...?

1 i am definitely getting set for the panels!

0 set is only interesting for the panels, that's all it is to me

1 i just built the a model, and i rather like it. it is much bigger than it looks from the box - about 30 studs long. there is only one function - the landing gear - but it works very nicely. apart from that, it's a very solid build, and achieves an elegant shape with an absolute minimum of parts. i don't usually get excited about small sets, but this one appeals to me. i like the feeling that every single piece has a purpose.

1 boulderer, on 27 december 2015 - 05:44 pm, said: my favourite of the 2016 sets i've built so far. i'd go so far as to say this is the best "budget" set in years. i would have loved this when i was a kid ... great "swoosh ability" ?????? good to hear that, im gonna check the toy shops in my lunch break tomorrow, see if they got their shipment in yet, if they have, ill definitely buy one of these little sets

1 thats a cool little mod, two small nigles though, 1, your navigation lights are flipped on the main wings, 2, the panels on the tail i *think* were supposed to be the intakes for the jet engine, by using them to close up the tail you've turned it into a glider cant wait untill i find one of these on shelves!

1 review - 42046 - getaway racer introduction starting with the 42010 - off-road racer and 42011 - race car in 2013, tlg released two sets in the first half of each year, using a pullback motor. the pullback motor allows the model to be pulled back, followed by forward motion. usually there's no apparent relation between the two set, other than the ability to combine them into an alternate build. this year there seems to some sort of cops and robbers scene going on. a getaway racer and a police interceptor. that can't be a coincidence. makes you wonder who will be victorious, the good guys or the bad guys. let's find out! note: all images can be clicked for hi-res versions. set information number: 42046 title: getaway racer theme: technic released: 2016 part count: 170 box weight: 302 gr box dimensions: 26,0 cm x 13,8 cm x 5,9 cm set price (msrp): € 19,99 price per part: € 0,118 links: brickset, bricklink the box the box has the same dimensions as previous year's pullback motor sets. in the lower right corner there's a visual explanation of the pullback mechanism. the dark model with it's decals sure looks like a cool hot rod. content of the box the box contains: 1 instructions booklet 1 sticker sheet 2 technic liftarms 1 pullback motor 3 bags instruction booklet just a single booklet. unfortunately no booklet for the alternate model. sticker sheet the sticker sheet contains a lot of cool stickers with flames and skulls etc. pullback motor and liftarms the pullback motor and two liftarms are found unbagged. bags a total of three bags containing the majority of the parts. highlighted parts this section describes the new and/or otherwise interesting parts. actually, this set is the only set of 1h 2016 which doesn't use any new parts, not even parts in a new color. tires the getaway racer uses four low profile tires (tire 37 x 22 zr). rims the rims are wheel 30.4mm d. x 20mm in pearl gold, found in 12 other sets. panels this set contains three #3 panelsand three #4 panels in black. part list this set contains 171 parts, all listed below. the build this being a small model, i won't show any building steps. let's skip right to the finished model. below you can see the end result. in my opinion the model looks great. it's got that hot rod vibe going on and the stickers add darkness to the vibe. slight problem with this set is that it really needs the stickers to finish the look. otherwise it's quite dull, with black and dark grey liftarms and panels. the rear view shows the pullback motor connected directly to the rear axle. in this image you can also clearly see the exhaust pipes on the side, which are very well executed. the 3x3 technic discs with stickers, used in the rim, result in only seeing a part of the rim. this works very well with the golden rims. the bottom view shows the chassis of the car. nothing really noteworthy, as you would expect from a pullback set. video the following video gives you an overview of the finished model. parts left these six parts are left after building the model. seems about right. features and functions this being a pullback motor set, it only has a single feature. the video below demonstrates the acceleration of the vehicle. my girlfriend was kind enough to catch the model before it fell to the ground. or did it hit something before it fell to the ground?! video this video shows the pullback functionality. b-model the alternate model is a combined build with the police interceptor, which you can see on the back of the box. unfortunately the instructions for the combined b-model are not included, so i didn't get a chance to build it. this would make for a fun challenge, building the b-model without the instructions. summary pullback sets are not the most technically advanced models, so you can't expect any other functionality than hitting the walls in your house. however, i think they are very appealing to kids. the fact that this year's pullback sets form a duo adds to the fun. in my opinion tlg hit the nail on the head with the getaway racer and police interceptor. the getaway racer looks very badass, which is something you don't see every day in a technic set. score how do i grade the bad guy in this year's duo. 8 design it looks so cool, but it does need the stickers. 7 building experience nothing out of the ordinary. 7 features limited to the pullback-and-drive functionality. 7 playability combined with the police interceptor, kids will love it. it does need it's nemesys though. 7 parts collection of common parts. gold rims could be interesting. 8 value for money pullback sets always deliver a certain value. 7,3 hit it! more image can be found on my flickr page. thank you for reading. i hope you enjoyed it.

0 one hero will now have just enough of that pullback motor to create one ultimate machine, thanks to this.

1 what a nice, tight an clean design! usually not too keen on the pull-back models, but this one is great.

0 the instructions for the extreme police interceptor combo model is now online....will someone do a review of this b model? https://wwwsecure.us...tselector=true#

0 allanp, on 01 december 2015 - 04:18 pm, said: i thought that was the best compliment a salesman can get . seriously though, even though i am not quite sold on the helicopter your reviews are very well done. you put a positive light on it whilst still being completely honest. hehe you have a point thanks for the compliment though

1 thanks for the review. i wonder if the design inspiration came from the russian ka-32 helicopter.

0 thanks for the thorough comments! i agree that the set has some limitations, both in construction and realism, but i think they're acceptable given the pricepoint and size. the antenna is definitely ludicrous - i really do suspect they had a surplus of the swords to use up! and yes, the way the steering knob is mounted is loose. i also noticed that the u-joints to the claw are not in the right spot like you mentioned, but didn't include it since it still works fine. that axle coming forward to the claw has a very long unsupported section that does bend a bit when you raise and lower the claw. it works, but is a bit of a cheat that i'm kinda surprised they let through. i just checked and the bucket from 8043 is a couple studs too wide for this set. i'm betting that was seriously considered, but it'd have meant scaling the whole thing up and that would have put it into a higher price point. or they could have pulled the mold for the 8x14 bucket back out and remade it for this set... i really like the model you built! and that's interesting about the cabs being basically flush with the top but sticking out the side. in image searching as part of my research, i found both that style and ones like this, with the cab sticking up more (like the photo of the caterpillar one in my review). i wonder if that's a us/european difference, or different types of mining, or what, because both styles definitely exist in the real world.

1 excellent review! worth waiting for. the set itself is very interesting. looks like it may have one interesting build techniques. thanks for the review, andy ad

1 think this is the only 1h set i'll be getting. guess i'm waiting for 2h for the rest of the construction stuff! this set looks okay to me; it includes the instructions for both models, which is cool, and includes some great parts. i like that it's not just another bucket loader and that it actually tries something different, too.

-1 great review! one thing reaaaaaally bothers me about this set, both models have the engine connected to one wheel, the other wheel on the "powered" axle is just left to rotate freely, and that really bothers me, as it did in 42022 (on 42022 even more tbh, since its main feature is being a frigging car). looking at the pics it isnt even a space issue (as it was in the hot rod, where they "needed" to route the steering through), so they just cheaped out and didnt bother fitting a diff in there (or even a live axle link) im not very interested in this set (not into construction stuff), but i think this is a worrying trend :(

0 definately a quirky set, i think i'd have prefered a bucket on the front with a complex lift and tip mechanism, but a grab is different. as for the b model, i may prefer it's functions to the a model, certainly something different we have not seen before.

0 looks like its using the z60 turntable that's on the mercedes and the crawler crane 42042

0 some mods "all wheel drive" v6 instead straight 2 cylinder bucket instead gripper back lights and oldschool worngear mechanics instead of linear actuators edited by efferman, 26 december 2015 - 05:52 pm.

1 nice mod there, effe, might inspire me when i get one and start modding it

-1 cool mod by effe. but the original model out of the box is one of the poorest models tlg ever released. looks from front to rear as a cheaped out set with really lazy design effort. a shame for the responsible lego designer parts assortment seems to be ok but this should not be the most important criteria sry jim, i really appreciate your always very well done reviews and offen i agree with the overall judgements/verdicts and of course tastes are different but especially that review sounds like gushing praise in my ears.... just my 2 ct edit: ooops just saw the review isn't done by jim...<blush>... so sry jim... now my final comment belongs to mostlytechnic edited by kumbbl, 27 december 2015 - 07:33 am.

0 the instruction is done. many thanks to martinsch https://www.dropbox....loader.pdf?dl=0

1 again, great review with superb pictures. the white and blue certainly works very well with your dark backdrop. thorough review for such a small model. small in size but great as a set. tell me, why did i let you review this one?!

1 excellent review! i am glad that you did not rush this or the mine loader review. could it be that the fan in the back is like a turbo prop propulsion.... just reaching here. andy d

1 here is a video review via jang to add to the review: i like both a and b so will buy both.

0 majklspajkl, on 05 december 2015 - 11:45 pm, said: my opinion on the frictionless axlepins is that the flex axle might be easier to stick in them than in regular/blue axlepins... didn't actually try it though :-) frictionless pins have accurate round hole, while blue friction pins have something squarish. flex axle will fit in both, but using tan pins doesn't require strength. conncetion with tan pins is weaker too.

1 nice review, thanks nice little set, i might buy me one

1 review - 42038 - arctic truck introduction arctic vehicles aren't new to lego. back in 2000 the town theme already had several small orange arctic vehicles. in 2014 tlg again released a number of arctic sets in the city theme (formerly known as town). some of these sets are actually pretty big, containing over 700 parts. looking back in history it seems that arctic sets may have found their origin in the technic theme. although these sets were white instead of orange, they are unmistakenly arctic. the 1986 technic arctic sets contained the infamous technic figures. unfortunately the 2015 arctic truck doesn't contain any technic figures, but nonetheless it's great to see a new arctic vehicle in the technic line, not counting several snow scooters. let's see if the new arctic truck lives up to the expectations. note: all images can be clicked for hi-res versions. set information number: 42038 title: arctic truck theme: technic released: 2015 part count: 1219 box weight: 2110 gr box dimensions: 47,8 cm x 28,0 cm x 7,2 cm set price (msrp): € 79,99 / us$ 84.99 / £ 59.99 price per part: € 0,088 / us$ 0.093 / £ 0.066 links: brickset, bricklink the box the box measures 47,8 cm x 28,0 cm x 7,2 cm and weighs around 1385 grams. the box actually feels pretty heavy which means it's filled properly. this seems to be a trend in the technic theme. slightly smaller boxes can save shelf space for retailers. the front the front of the box shows the main model and in the lower right corner there's a image with the dimension of the model. it's 40cm long and 18cm wide. the back the upper part of the back of the box shows the functions of the main model. the lower left section shows the b-model, which looks very promising (more on that later). the lower right section shows the motorization options for the main model. the crane (partially) and the bed can be motorized. besides motorization some leds can be added as headlights. the side on of the sides shows one of the newer smaller style panels. this is the first time it appears in orange. when you take a look at the sticker you can see that it's not symmetrical. not sure why tlg "cut of" one of the sides of the stickers, since the position of the panel is very suitable for a continuous sticker. content of the box the box is pretty densely packed, which is better than semi-filled boxes. it feels like you actually bought something which matches the box size. the box contains: 2 booklets 1 sticker sheet 8 bags booklets & sticker sheet unfortunately the instructions and sticker sheet haven't been packed with cardboard protection, which results in a curved sticker sheet and slightly bent instructions. in my case this wasn't so bad. at least no real damage. highlighted parts this set proves to be a great parts pack, especially when you might have missed some of the 2014 sets. black link treads usually the link treads come in dark blue grey, but this sets includes 96 black treads, which is great if you'd like to replace the dbg ones in your mocs, or other official sets. undercarriage and suspension several parts are included to build the undercarriage driving the treads. four large tread sprockets and eight small tread sprockets, which are used as return sprockets. also included are four steering portal hubs and four steering portal axles for driving and steering the vehicle. several frames, including two c-shaped pivot frames and two steering ball joints to create an undercarriage much like the 4x4 crawler. the set even includes two h-shaped frames (a.k.a. dog bone frames). new changeover catch parts this year (2015) three new parts have been introduced to improve the changeover catch. more on these parts later. new pin connector another new part for this year (2015) is the "1l round pin connector", which looks like a pin connector, but acts more like a bush. new pins furthermore this sets includes quite a large number of three (relatively) new parts. 17 x pin with pin hole, 14 x 3l pin with 1l axle and 11 x 3l pin with 2l axle, which have been introduced this year (2015). when the new 3l pin with 1l axle was introduced in 2014 it was only a matter of time before the new 3l pin with 2l axle would appear. both new pins are a great addition to the parts portfolio. panels last but not least this sets contains a fair number of orange panels, including the 3x11 panel in orange, which is the first time we've seen this part. part list below is the entire part list for the 913 parts. as usual this part list can be found at the end of the second booklet. the build the build immediately starts with some of the new parts, used to build the compact gearbox in the center of the model. notice the two 20 tooth bevel gears. one would have been enough to drive the 12 tooth bevel gear, so the second seems to be useless. tlg probably used it in the a-model, because they needed it in the b-model, which you can see later. the front and rear suspension are almost identical. the front side also has the 13l gear rack, used for steering. the picture below shows the steering rack on the front suspension in more detail. at this point you have more or less finished the chassis. the gearbox is in place and the majority of the functions has internally been connected to the right gears. the small turntable shows where the crane will be attached later on. at the end of the first booklet, some of the bodywork has been attached to the chassis. the orange-black color scheme never fails to please me. throw in some cool stickers for the extra effect and we have a winner. if you decide to motorize the model, using pf, the top of the cabin can be lifted to accomodate the battery box. the chassis uses lots of orange (and some black) panels to give the model it's distinctive look. the protective black bumber/railing is a nice addition which adds something to the exterior. the dumping bed at the rear can tilt to empty it's load. it's operated by a mini la. the treads, which look very cool in black, are driven by a large tread sprocket and returned by two small tread sprockets. the front and rear sections are identical. building the undercarriages feels a bit repetitive, which is a problem for most tracked vehicles. finished model adding the crane to the model finishes the build. your model should look something like this. when you take a close look at the finished model, you realize this is something else. it's trully a unique vehicle. the color scheme is brilliant and the fact that it's an arctic truck is really neat. it's a welcome change for the technic line to see a vehicle like this. this picture emphasizes that's it's a very cool vehicle. imagine this beast plowing through the snow! as far as i know it's not based on a real life vehicle. if's probably a combination of several vehicles and some imagination. i can be totally wrong though. the rear of the vehicle shows the crane and drum, placed on the tipper bed. from this angle you can see some of the internals of the model, the gearbox behind the cabin for example. the crane can be partially motorized (rotation and base), while the boom is operated manually. what i like a lot is the protective railing around the vehicle. left over parts some leftover parts, nothing noteworthy. features and functions this set has several functions/features: steering driving suspension crane tipping bed steering as you can see in the image below the steering mechanism has quite a bit of negative caster (please correct me if i'm wrong), which causes the treads to rotate a bit upward/downward instead of only to the left and right. driving you mention driving as a feature?! yes i do and let me explain why. normally i would ommit this as a feature and take driving for granted. however, driving this vehicle (on a flat surface) causes it to simply slide over the surface. for other arctic vehicles this would be a plus, but with a tracked vehicle it limits playability. this is one of the main drawbacks of these tread, they simple don't work properly on smooth surfaces. suspension the suspension is working properly. you do need to apply some pressure, but all things considered it's not too bad. crane the crane has four degrees of freedom: base rotation lower boom upper boom hook it does what it's supposed to do. base rotation and lower boom can be motorized and switched using the gearbox, while the upper boom and hook are operated manually. tipping bed the tipping is operated via a mini la. conclusion while the set does offer various functions and features, driving and steering is a serious issue. therefor this set is more likely to be showcased than to be played with. b-model instructions for the b-model are of high quality. looking at the image below, you will see what i mean. here's the finished b-model, a tracked jeep with a communcations device. this alternate model looks so good, it could easily have made it as a main model. one thing that does pop in mind; how would this look with tires?! more on that later. when you are in the artcic region it's imperative to have proper communication channels. since there's no internet backbone, you will need a big antenna of some sort. this b-model actually features a small trailer wagon with a transmitter/receiver. here's more detailed image of the b-model, without trailer wagon. i would buy this model in a heartbeat if it were a main model. simply gorgeous. the side view doesn't give away that this in alternate model. the stickers also work really well in this model. and again, nothing to complain here. the model even has a small crane at the rear, operated by the mini la. here you can see the arctic fleet, comprised of both the a-model and b-model. i bet these two can get some work done!! a bit of a messy picture, but this should give you an impression of the size of both models. leftover parts not too many parts left, which is obviously a good thing. alternate model with tumbler tires just like me, you probably have been wondering how this model would look like with (tumbler) tires. well, here it is. as i imagined it does look great. admittedly, these are not the type of tires we ought to use, but to be honest; i don't really care. again, the negative caster results in quirky steering. the tires are a bit too big, so they hit the chassis when you compress the suspension. while this has absolutely nothing to do with an arctic vehicle, i really love this picture. summary we're almost at the end of my review, so what do i think of this set. let's start with getting the elephant out of the room; this set lacks proper driving and steering. does that make it a bad set?! definitely not! it's a great set, but it lacks some playability when it comes to moving the vehicle. the crane and tipper bed do work properly, so there's still some playability left. does this set look cool? definitely! i think it's one of the coolest (no pun intended) and most original models of recent years. the orange and black color scheme works great and the stickers are well designed. the b-model is of very high quality and some might even prefer it over the a-model. and if you are not interested in either of these models, this set provides you with a variety of great parts! all in all i think this is a great set! maybe not to play with, but it scores high on all other criteria. pros original model great color scheme lots of interesting parts great b-model cons steering and driving don't work too well repetitive build of undercarriages (minor con) score below are my scores based on different categories. 8 design original and good looking model. 7 building experience fun to build, albeit a bit repetitive. 8 features packs quite a few features. 7 playability some features work, some don't. 9 parts comes with interesting parts. 9 value for money two great model in a single set. 8 cool! as a bonus, here's picture of the main model with tumbler tires. why? because we can!

1 very timely review jim. my wife has just surprised me by giving me this set a few days ago and i have just built the a model two days ago and b model yesterday. i agree with all that you wrote above. i don't have tumbler tires but i have 9398 tires. driving is smooth but steering + suspension will be bad as you said due to negative caster and tires hitting the chassis. anyway, tonight i will destroy the b model and rebuilt this http://www.busterhau...8-c-model.html.

-1 the set is a looker, you've got to admit it, but what it gives in looks does not make up for what it lacks in functions. i really wanted this set, badly even, when i restarted my adventure with technic about a month ago. than i learned more and more about what a good model can do, mostly thanks to this forum and yt. right now i'm a bit disappointed with the arctic truck - smaller sets offer more functions and teach you much more. jim it was a great review nevertheless edited by pgplay, 14 december 2015 - 11:22 am.

0 i could be wrong but i am 100% sure that i've seen this review before.

1 until i saw photos of this set i wasn't convinced i wanted it. now after seeing all the combinations (a+b and tumbler tires!) i am definitely buying two copies. i need orange parts and black treads anyway. the only problem i have with this is that it's going to encourage me to buy many copies of the drag racer just to get enough wheels to play with.

-1 jim/anyone....i built this set a few days ago, i dont like the way the crane arm section has no knob to turn the mini turntable. you see the 20 tooth gear?....there is a pinhole located next to this....i would like to add something here to make it easier to turn the winch section.

-1 i have the 42038, nice set but i found the tipping of the bed clumsy. it was a pleasure to build and i do like the build with the tumble wheels

1 you wrote a very accurate review of this set, jim. it's a pretty good model (with some obvious problems) but it's an even better parts pack. your pictures with the tumbler tires are great. what is the material of the gray background? nerdsforprez, on 15 december 2015 - 01:26 pm, said: lets not forget the c-model made by buster haus. pretty sweet c model..... thank you for the mention.

1 review - 42001 - mini off-roader introduction technic mini models are sometimes regarded as models not worth buying. i don't agree with this opinion. whether it's a special part or innovative building technique, almost every mini model has something that makes the set worthwhile. this time i will be reviewing the 42001 mini off-roader. this model is not a smaller version of an existing model, so there's no real comparison with a bigger brother, or sister if you will. nor does the model resemble a real life brand or vehicle, so it is what it is, a mini off-roader. note: all images can be clicked for hi-res versions. set information number: 42001 title: mini off-roader theme: technic released: 2013 part count: 100 box weight: 165 gr box dimensions: 15,5 x 14,0 x 4,2 cm set price (msrp): 9.99 eur de / 7.99 gbp / 12.99 usd price per part: de 0.100 eur / uk 0.080 gbp / usa 0.130 usd links: brickset, bricklink the box the box measures 15,5 x 14,0 x 4,2 cm which is obviously not very big. the weight of the box is approximately 165 grams. frontside the front of the box shows a though four wheel drive off-roader challenging a fierce rocky mountain trail...now does it?! what the box actually shows is mini off-roader challenging a small foam rock formation, much like rocks used in star trek the original series, yet smaller the box also states that this model is for the age of 7 till 14. more importantly, the 2-models in-1 logo is clearly visible, which means this set can be used to build two different models. backside the backside shows a picture of the alternate model and a smaller version of the original model. the conversion arrow and the 2-in-1 are printed to clarify that the main model can be converted into a secondary model. sides one of the sides shows the 2-in-1 logo and a picture of the main model. another side shows a picture of one of the wheels in actual size and again, a picture of the main model. contents of the box the box contains: 2 booklets 2 bags 4 tires booklets this set contains two booklets which is not very common for a set this size. both models share the same chassis, which is why the build has been divided over two booklets, one for the chassis (8 pages with 10 steps) and one for the bodywork (34 pages with 23 steps for the main model and 20 steps for the alternate model). bags the box contains only 2 bags which is to be expected from a set consisting of 100 parts. one of the bags is filled with liftarms, panels, rims and two elastic bands. the other bags contains all the other parts, like pins, axles, connectors, etc. opening the bags results in the following collection of parts, with the exception of the tires. no abundant number parts that will add real value to your collection. nevertheless, there are some interesting orange parts and elastic bands. tires the tires are provided seperately (i.e. not contained in the bags). from the picture you can see that these tires have a front and a back side, so you should pay attention when fitting them to the rims, which have two different sides as well. highlighted parts this section describes the unique and/or highlighted parts. very small smooth technic panel (#21 and #22) these two small technic were new at the time of release and this set was only one of two sets containing them in orange. the other set is the 42007 - moto cross bike. at the moment of writing there's a third set containing these parts, the black champion racer. side a side b small rubber band i was under the impression that these white rubber bands weren't that common, but it seems that these bands are as common as dirt. but hey, you can't have enough rubber bands! thin liftarm 1x5 with axle holes like the panels, these liftarms were also new at the time of release. looking at the the frequent usage in other sets, this part has proven to be a most useful mammal. thin liftarm 1x3 not a very rare piece per se, but if you are not into bionicle, this liftarm part can be hard to find. your other option would be to buy the 9390 - mini tow truck, or the 8305 - dual bikes from a while ago (2000). long pin with center pin hole this relatively new kid on the block is currently used in many technic and non-technic sets and has well proven it's worth. axle pin connector hub with 2 axles like the previous part this newish part is also quite helpful in certain situations. part list here's the complete list for all 100 parts. building experience the build starts with the chassis of the off-roader. after connecting some liftarms two elastic bands, one on each side, are attached to the towball pins. this is all there is to the suspension, plain and simple. the two elastic bands contract the l-shaped liftarms, which results in the long ends swiveling downwards. the video below demonstrates the suspension. the simplicity doesn't do it justice, because it works like a charm. the suspension is very smooth with the right amount of stretch and resistance. this great working suspension adds a lot of value to this set. to quote john hurt in the movie contact: "why build one when you can have two at twice the price?". i have purchased two sets so we can simultaneously see both models and make a proper comparison. below you can see two identical chassis which will be used for both versions of the build. at this stage we have arrived at the end of the first booklet, which only took about ten minutes. not surprising, since the first booklet only has 10 building steps. progressing to the second booklet, you need to choose between building the main and alternative model. that's a choice i don't need to make for this review, so let's start with the main model. main model when building the bodywork there's a rather peculiar building technique, which you wouldn't expect in an official lego set. the axle and pin connector hub with 2 axles only protrudes halfway into the double bent liftarm. the thin 1x4 liftarm which is added in one of the following steps makes sure the hubs stay perfectly in place, but i was still surprised to see this technique. the finished bodywork for the main model looks like....uhh...well.....i don't know exactly. it doesn't bear any resemblance to a real life model, which makes it hard to judge. one thing's for sure; it's not the best looking technic mini model. the bodywork can be attached to the chassis by using a 7l axle and two bushes, one on each side of the chassis. alternate model unfortunately the alternate model doesn't look much better than the main model. it's even a stud less wide, while you would like to see slightly more body, matching the size of the tires and chassis. attached to the chassis the body is even more out of proportion. it's not really ugly and the color scheme is great (obviously this goes for the main model as well), but the body simply doesn't match the chassis. i can only imagine that this model is supposed to have a chibi look, much like the microfighter star wars models. comparison the following section shows a selection of images from different angles to compare the main and secondary model. the main model has a bit more volume, while the alternate model has a more sporty look. front view the main model has headlights which are attached at a higher point, while the alternate model has headlights which are placed more closely next to each other. rear view a slightly different setup in both models, where the main model again has higher placed rear lights. side view the side view shows that the panels are used differently in both models. the main models uses them as doors, while the alternate model uses them as engine cover (bonnet). top view the top view reveals that the main model might have room for a minifig parts left the left image shows the parts which are left after building the main model, while the second image shows the parts left after building the alternate model. as you can see, the main model uses slightly more parts than the alternate model. features besides the awesome suspension, which we already have discussed, there aren't a lot of features in this set. there's actually a single feature, which is only present in the main model....opening doors! wow, impressive! well, maybe we can't expect too much functionality in such a small model. summary the off-roader is a fun model which is fairly easy to build. the suspension is simple, yet very effective. the model could do better in the design department, but the suspension offers great playability and that is what this set is all about. the orange parts are not very common so they are an added bonus. all things considered this set is definitely worth the few bucks you need to spend on it. pros great suspension fun to play with some (semi) rare orange parts great color scheme cons no resemblence to an actual off-roader not the best looking model score below are my scores based on different categories. 6 design not the best looking technic model. 7 building experience the suspension makes it fun to build. 7 features the suspension makes up for the lack of functionality. 8 playability the model has car-swooshability. 7 parts some interesting orange parts. 8 value for money great present for the younger builders. 7,1 elastic hope you enjoyed it! thanks for reading and please rate this set at the top of this topic!

0 the poll doesn't allow you to select 2 from 1-5. it instead says 1, 3, 3, 4, 5. but besides that, your review i give it a 5 because 1) shows the set in all angles 2) shows the characters 3) comment on the little creature comforts of the set 4) added a comic (playability) 5) showed true enthusiasm *y* *wub*

0 the poll is for the set, not the review :-d . but thank you anyway! and it appears mister phes made the mistake :-p !

1 nice review, funny little story, and a 4 from me. a useful little set indeed. *sweet*

1 it's mine *wub*! just got my luke today from tru in in merrilville, in... ;-)! so here's some pictures and thoughts: still in the packing with the box pieces out in the fresh air put together, ready for some serious vader vacking >:-)! if you this close you're so dead!! it's yet another lovely maquette *wub*! the only downside is that the lego sw sign doesn't even resemble (ok, i've exagurating a bit :'-)) the ones from the other maquettes! check out this one from the blackhole trooper compared with the luke one: the luke one is has a massproduced look over it with just a printing |-/ , the other has depth & a painting on it. now i'm waiting for the long overdue boba one! here's the other maquettes reviewed: darth vader & stormie blackhole stormie maquettes on copmike

1 very nice, thanks for these cool pictures! *y*

1 beautiful...i'm really trying to resist these. any word on who's next after boba fett? a c-3po/r2-d2 pair would probably push me over the edge.

1 verry cool, love it, what was the price?

1 thanks to this information. it's interesting for me. :-)

-1 ah yes, i saw a whole shelf of them in my tru(touched it too!) too small, and way overpriced. waste of miney. the luke is 6" high! what is that?!?! great review! edited by ~vbbn~, 22 november 2007 - 11:19 pm.

-1 not my thing, but a very nice review, thanks for sharing it! i was seriously considering this one when it was originally announced as a 6212 copack item at a particularly good price and then everything changed. i do, however, seriously ache to get my hands on one of the more traditionally lego looking 2ft+ vaders they use in the official stores (at least they had one here in orlando). *wub*

0 while it isn't my style, it looks pretty cool. thanks for sharing! *sweet*

0 can you swap head? and coler on the saber?

1 during the annual thanksgiving road trip to the relatives, i stopped by the tru in portland, or. lo and behold, the new mars mission sets! obviously, i bought them. ;-) the box: not much to say. standard box art for mm sets, nothing new. the parts: some good parts here. even if you don't like the set (which i highly doubt after i've had my say :-p ), it's a decent parts pack. i noticed that some old parts have been renewed. i know the wheel has been used in the '07 sets, but the cockpit and hitch i haven't seen in a while. the vldss (very large dss). grr. new part. at least, i think it is. someone slap me if it isn't. *wacko* the figs. i know i've seen that head before, but i have no idea where. does anyone know? i was hoping that the aliens would have new arms, at least. i was sadly mistaken... on the upside, i finally discovered that they glow in the dark. :-$ the alien has a jetpack. if that's not the silliest thing i've ever seen, i don't know what is. the build. simple build. a block. so easy a caveman cou- oh, never mind. geico's used that one enough. then, we have this jobber right here. not sure what it is, but it looks like some crystal scanning device. it's starting to look pretty nice. it almost looks practical. the cockpit is suffering from a bad dose of over-stickering. on the upside, we have a new piece there to hold the cockpit on. part 1 complete. it has a nice little radio antenna, which is ruined by the use of a random missile that looks like it's going to shoot the antenna before it shoots the alien. still, i never say no to a good missile i can use for something else. the trailer: fairly simple, but it works. it features stabilizing arms, a handheld saw, and an extremely random mini-bot who's purpose escapes me. the whole meal deal- erm, general pics. overall, i thought this was a good set. in fact, it reminds me of this:

1 cool review, thanks!! :-d i personally think the minirobot is awesome, and (dare i say) cute! this was described on amazon to be a mobile lab, i'm not seeing that. i do however see a crystal hauling vehicle. *sweet* pretty cool, not as bad as previous sets. ~peace

1 a wonderful set and, perhaps, as close to classic space as possible. *y* also there?s a great amount of very useful and interesting parts too like these round 'stabilizer' parts with clip.... :'-) there?s a complete different feeling with this new sets compared to the first mm ones.... 8-| beside the a little more realistic aspects of it with the more enclosed cockpit (nearly with some controls.... ;-) ) it?s the overall more solid feeling i guess.... the other sets look pretty neat and fashionable at the surface, but their internal structure is much more hollow and useless with some studless technic beams and such stuff.... very shining, but hard and boring to mod, just aimed for maximal cool looking box art and the rest went down for saving costs.... (beside that already pretty good 7692 dropship that is). the only thing i don?t get with that is why the minirobot?s a one-armed one.... ach, pirates on mars i suppose.... x-d

0 hmm, not actually a bad set. not high on my 'to buy' list, there're other things up there first, but definitely a possibility somewhere down the line. thanks for the review.

1 thanks for posting the picture of this new mm set. when i first saw the mars mission sets i was a little apprehensive about the design and the aliens (they could have at least make movable arms :(), but anyways when i bought the small fighter i was totally hook. my fave set from the line is the mech.

0 *wub* thanks for another great review. *sweet* i am also glad that it is a very different alien fighter design as i already have three varients of the old type! the fighter transforms better than i thought it would; i was expecting just the wings. i should be buying this set as well... mr. mandalorian, on nov 26 2007, 03:45 pm, said: without "anti-grav" support, it would fall forward on it's nose each time it transformed. well, since anti-grav doesn't exist, and will never exist, there has to be another option! looking at it in tank mode it does have a vague aerofoil shape so i think it should be able to work as a lifting body. all it needs to do then is move fast enough to start taking off and then it can extend the wings... 8-|

-1 hmm, its actually a nice bit better than i expected, and great review, thanks! but think ill pass on this one. i quite like the alien fighter though, heh. and loved the way you described how he sat in the cockpit.

1 i really like the transforming aspect of this! the one thing i wish mm sets would include would be baseplates. i liked that about the classic space stuff because it really helped create the environment. some "red rock orange" mars baseplates would be great!

0 lasse d, on nov 26 2007, 04:54 pm, said: i'm not sure it would nose dive when transforming from tank mode. i guess it would pick up speed and transform quickly since it doesn't seem to have any downwards pointing thrusters. the one thing you'd have to make sure of, though, is that it was fairly light and the wheel base had a fairly large surface area (actually, that's two things), so as to make sure it didn't dig into the soil. if that happened, transformation would be harder as the wheels would dig into the ground and drag through the soil. then it'd nose dive.

1 john cleese, on nov 25 2007, 10:56 pm, said: cool review. i'm actually liking that new missile part as it seems to combine a bar with a pin. but it's a real eyesore if you ask me. a needed solution to those blasted flick missles from falling out while swooshing. *sweet* wonder if the range might have an issue seeing it's held in there but who knows, maybe they now "pop" out with a greater velocity than a mere finger flick? i had resorted to technic 1/2 bushings (smooth) to lock in the missile's technic axle (with stud).

1 great review, mr. m! *y* i *wub* those green flames, and the design of the ship is pretty good. thanks for the review, and great pictures! they are clear. big, and describe the set just the way they should.

1 thanks for this fantastic review hinckley, i can't wait to see the comic! :'-) i really love this mech as i am a fan of non-bipedal mechs (though i am terrible at making them), the purple is great and i can't wait to see what mocers will use those awesome new spike peices for! 3 robots in one mech is a really good deal too, and that spider droid just adds so much more to the set. and thanks for taking the time to do this! *sweet* not to sound like a smartypants though, but the grill peice in purple is not the first time this has happened, two were included in the 06 joker helicopter ;-) thanks again! to the brickmobile! >:-)

1 this one is much better than i thought; i didn't expect the gun and the "turret" to be geared! i agree that a lot of the details sux (hollow inside, lame cockpits...) but as an overall package it looks quite good. the best part is.... no shooter! is the nightmare finally over? :'-) the bonus robot is a much better idea. the large amount of blue pieces make this a must buy for me as impartial needs more raw materials! :-p how well do the tracks work? the last tank was too light and it didn't roll well at all. :-/ thanks for these photos as well hinckley. *wub* so far the 08 exo-force sets are looking good! *sweet* hinckley, on nov 28 2007, 04:48 pm, said: and actually i did feel the same way you did about the flying module, until i put sinner in it and started to play. :-p wow! it's big enough for my big walrus head! *wub*

1 thanks for this great review hinckley! :'-) i know you're loving this attention! x-d :-p i actually like this set, and like it a lot more now that i've seen this review. i'll most likely get, mostly for the figs and parts. i reckon it would look a lot better alongside the rest of the 2008 ef mechs. anyway, thanks for the review! to the brickmobile! >:-)

1 thanks for that good review, hinckley. *y* a really interesting set and a turning point for lego. minirobots instead of shooting crap, pretty cool. i hope the kids?ll like it too. for the design, i love that asymmetrical look of the front part and the sleek guns of the flyer. it?s smart that the gatling gun moves along with the tank, too. the set idea with two vehicles in one?s not new, but very play- able and the treads/big wheel design?s cool. i don?t like the use of studless technic beams, but well, they do their job i guess. and keiken?s cockpit should be easy to improve....

0 i think this is probably my least favourite set of next years selection, but i still might get it, partly because of this review (thanks, btw). i quite like the mini-robot, and while there are a few problems (the front cockpit, the exposed axles) i relish the idea of moding them out, and correcting them. and the change back to the original figs is welcome. i didn't really get any of this years sets, only last years. makes it easier from a mocing potential, anyway.

1 thanks for this new review, hinckley *wub* for me, it was love at fistr sight with this little set :-p it's simple but nice, and way better than shadow crawler for a spider-like mech *y* you sure will be very busy these days, and your characters will get breakdown before they finish filming all the comics x-d luxorv

1 mister phes, on dec 8 2007, 07:47 pm, said: it's not a bad thing to vote sabre island 1 if someone feels that it's genuinely worth 1but t'would be interesting to know why. i do see your point mr phes, but 1? i would like to know why he/she thinks sabre island is worth so little!

1 i gave this one a 5. it's one of the little pirate sets i had during my youth and i loved it for several reasons. first of all, it contains 2 of my favorite minifigs! it can be used as a small independent base or in combination with one of the bigger sets (eldorado or trading posts) as a lookup or outer defense. besides all that, this set just looks beautiful. i love the colors (blue baseplate and the white/yellow tower). one of the best little/medium sized sets ever made by lego!

0 lord of pies, on dec 6 2007, 07:24 pm, said: the top of the tower is rather plain and simple which in some ways is good, as it keeps the whole set detailed yet not crowded, but i feel a little something should of been added to the top though. perhaps a catapult? steve

0 col. whipstick, on jan 3 2008, 12:37 am, said: did i hear right? a catapult in the 16th/17th/18th and 19th centuries? *wacko* perhaps it's an appeal for lord of pies to have his own personal catapult to pelt the pirates with whipped cream pastries should they try to sail past. but this begs the question... why waste perfectly good pie on those scurvy, mangy, mutt-faced villians! what a wonderful idea.... :-p a pie catapult! although it is a waste of a pie....we have ourselves a dilemma!

1 its a fantastic set, cant think of anything wrong with it to be honest, even if the island is a bit small, the plate itself is still useful, and the rest of it is also very useful, walls can go toward a bigger fort, cannon can extend your ship, soldiers extend your army, boat extends err your boats, and the island prin is just cool

1 indexed i'm going to have to start dodging cannon balls soon if i don't start making some pirate mocs. *pirate* anywayz, i've had my shell service station set # 6378 built exactly by "the book" and sitting around for the longest time. with the recent twinning of my "town" with dr. sinister, i needed a gas station that could handle a lot more traffic (especially military traffic and these new 6-wide vehicles x-d ). here be a thumblink to the original station at bl: i love this station so much, but it really needed some modernization. the reopening of this station received a lot of attention, even the local police stopped right over. one big upgrade to this station is the selling of propane tanks, which is generally a rare commodity from the lego towns i've seen. x-d also at this service station is a propane tank refilling station. the milkman is our first propane customer. the interior has also had an addition and many upgrades. for instance, this building now has florescent lighting, a big frig in the back, and more shelf space. *y* oh look! there's the officer purchasing a mountain dew. now that there's more shelf space, we can sell more than just 1x1 round yellow bricks and levers. we now have available 1x1 round plates and 1x1 round cones available in multiple colors! :-d with this upgraded gas station, hopefully this town will bring in more business and customers into my small town. x-d p

1 great moc! it seems you did the math when doing this one and hit the nail on the head (which pierced a megablock causing it to self destruct) ! stauder

1 nice station phred, love those fluorescent lights! *wub* but...start dodging cannonballs now, boom, harr! :-p

1 lol! those star wars heiroglyphics are awesome! were those in the movie? or is this just a joke by the lego designers? that would be the first time tlc showed any kind of reference humor! the rest of the set is great too, even the skeleton and the stickers. yes, that's right, i actually like those things. i like the new skellies because of their posability (i'm a big supporter & user of stop-motion) and i think there's nothing wrong with stickers. i mean seriously, why does everybody hate stickers so much??? :-| sure, they are a pain in the megablocks to put on and, sure, they come off after a while and are never usable again, but hey, you don't have to put them on, even better, you can save them (like i do) and use them for your mocs! could somebody tell me, please? i'm just curious. however, as i said, nice set! i might even get one. gotta love that marion with the carot torch x-d and that arc is neat too! by the way, are all parts on it golden? some more pics on it would be nice as soon as your camera is recharged! ;-) thanks. peace out!

1 wow! i took a peak at the pics in your photobucket, thanks very much! this is a wonderful set, full of details! awesome! :-d *y* *y* ~peace

1 thanks for that fine review, big pete! *y* a really adventurous set with a good playability and neat traps! that mayaesque sticker?s also very decent. i think that the box art of these indy sets is pretty cool too with all these 'action scene' pics, nicely done, tlc. overall, a very lovely set indeed.... tomb raiding on! :'-)

1 thank you very much for another great review, big pete *wub* this is a good set, but i probably won't be able to afford it with all of the rest of the lego coming out in 2008 |-/ oh, i watched this scene a few weeks ago, and the pilot is fishing while waiting for indy to escape. thanks again you lucky lucky man :-p

-1 no hovitos? no! ah well, if i get more pirate sets next year i'd use the islanders as hovitos. in the video game they have the same torsos. i'd really like to get this, maybe in june i'll have luck. :'-)

0 this set is pretty nice i love the idol id probably buy the set just for that :-d lol is it just me or in the earlier concepts of this set we saw a native on the box? i wonder why they removed it :-( *wacko*

1 great review and nice touch putting the minifig in the mixer *y* and i think you are the first to review this set so all in all good work. steel...

-1 aww man! i hate that face. it doesn't match any of my other lego heads! in my opinion, it's not even lego-ey.

0 thanks for the very thorough review! looks good, but i see they didn't include the new 4x4x1/3 circle piece. ah well, did you see/buy any other impulse sets? ~peace

1 thanks for the review pspguy. i think this is a very nice little chopper... but the biggest reason why i will probably get this is for the handcuffs! :-d are the side windows flush like the old ones or recessed like the new ones are supposed to me?

1 thank you for the review

1 tks sandra for these sweet pics 8-? this set is a true thing of beauty ;-) i love the vehicles and all the sweet details added to render that gklorious 50's atmosphere ;-) i love thge town hall, its very cleverly built and looks great 8-? my favoprite part of the whole bunch has to be the movie theater wich is superb *wub* i guess its pocorn time :-p ps: @ tedbeard - do tone it down youg man !! if you're not happy with sandra's work, do provide one yourself instead of bitching on how you view a review and on how sandra's post is veryt far from one (according to you !!) *yoda*

1 thanks for the review legocastlegirl - excellent work *y*! i agree with you, the best part seems to be the movietheater!! that?s perfect because i just love to watch movies in the theater, so far this year i?ve seen 46 pictures (and had some pop-corn to ;-)). this is a must-get-set!! town on copmike

1 nice review - thx for all the pics. they certainly made me consider getting this set. kimt btw: which set would you recommend: market streeet, town plan or cafe corner? just curious. they're pretty expensive and i might only afford one of them.

1 kimt, on jan 4 2008, 10:25 am, said: btw: which set would you recommend: market streeet, town plan or cafe corner? just curious. they're pretty expensive and i might only afford one of them. definitely the coffee corner. it?s a hard desicion between coffee corner and town plan, because they are both really great sets. the market street is no "must have" in my opinion. but the other two. maybe you should start with the coffee corner, it?s the older set. the town plan is newer and will be available longer then the coffee corner. i hope it helped you a litte bit :-$ regards sandra edited by legocastlegirl, 04 january 2008 - 10:43 am.

1 this is a great set, lots of detail and that service station and gaspumps do it for me! *sweet* thanks for the review legocastlegirl! *y*

1 thanks for the review. i really want this set because: 1. it looks fantastic 2. has harder to find colors 3. is a 50th anniversary commemorative 4. some of the models are based on the 50s sets (i love the old stuff) the tanker truck is a perfect recreation of the old ho 1:87 scale esso tanker truck. i have one, and you can look at it for comparison if you would like. lego ho vehicles i'd like to modify the truck from this new set to look even more like the old esso truck, getting rid of the green and adding some decals.

1 thanks will! this really is a nice set! your new camera and the backround looks great, the pic quality is very good! thanks!! *y*

1 thanks for the review, mr. mandalorian! this set looks very nice, and it's good to know the nose cone stickers are 2 separate ones, so they don't cross bricks. :-d that camera is working out great for ya'! thanks again! ~peace

1 this is a brilliant review of a brilliant set! *sweet* thanks a lot! i know this may be a bit much to ask but could take some pics of the whole instruction booklet? please!!! if you can thanks a bunch. but if not do know of a place where i could find the instructions?

1 ok i thought it might be to much to ask. i will try *vader* 's review. and again thanks for the review *y*

1 darn! if i would have known noone has reviewed this i would have! thanks! *sweet* *y*

0 blah. i wanted one of these at half off but i forgot and missed out. thanks for the review though :-$

0 they released the battle droid commander in 2000 :-|

0 trudop561, on jan 5 2008, 04:21 pm, said: they released the battle droid commander in 2000 :-| while there was a yellow-marked battle droid officer in the 3343 minifigure pack released in 2000, the battle droid commander from 7670 is different. the new 7670 commander has a torso made of all yellow plastic, whereas the 2000 battle droid commander had a tan torso with yellow printings, and a tan head with yellow printings. so, while we have had a bd commander before, the 7670 commander is "new."

1 yeah finally *yoda* got his sw :-d i got 2 of them after x mas - they are really cool - especially the spider droid! 2 of them on! & happy *yoda* on :-p edited by aayla-secura, 05 january 2008 - 10:38 pm.

0 you thought the bat tank was bad, the tie crawler has 81 for each of the sides *sing*. and don't get me started on the sand crawler! :-x

0 great review mate as usual, for me the highlight of this set has to be the new spider droid. even though it's made up of some strange parts it really appeals to me, i would love a few of those babys. the hellfire droid is also well put together even if it is a little small, but hey it looks fun. i really like the look of this set but the price tag really puts me off, why oh why did lego price it so high.... :'-(

0 my hailfire droid is gonna be coming in the mail soon, as well as the battlepacks.

1 nice review yoda i dont think i have ever read one with as much cursing of stickers! :-d i love these two little sets, the colour scheme the little different wheels on the post van and of course the new postmen uniforms! would have been nice if they had included little satchels like in the new indiana jones sets, oh well! ;-) postman yoda on! *yoda*

1 thanks for the takes on these two sets, yoda. stickers or not, i still think these are charming sets with all the essence and nostalgia of the older sets back in the 80/90's. am i the first one to notice the new doors used in the back of the van. not only is it using the popular new frame, but the old container doors have been redesigned to fit with the new frame as well. pity they're not yellow, though.

1 these little sets are really nice! they cought my eye the minute i saw them! it would have been so great if there was a post office to go with them! there are so few buildings in lego city the design is very classic and i am ofcourse considering to get them but it seems that i have a lot of small cars and planes on my desk! :-$ recently i took a flight with cyprus airways from thessaloniki to cyprus and the two promo plane sets were there! i was so tired though that i couldnt stay awake to buy them! im taking a flight again on tuesday and i hope they are not out of stock!! thanks for a great review yoda! a fine job as always! cant wait for your next one

1 5150 lego, on jan 6 2008, 11:08 pm, said: well first off, thanks yoda for the great review. :-) hmmm... well, i have to say, i'm not at all impressed with any of these sets. i mean, there nice and all, but the van just seems way to small. it would have been nice if you could fit more than one package in it. i guessi'm one of those that are more of the fan of the 6 wide trucks. i see your point that more cargo capacity would have been better. nevertheless, my personal preference is for smaller "classic" scale city sets. the mail van is nice and small, and should fit well with my road plates and 1990s cars from the 4561 train. on a side note, did anyone notice the message on the back of both sets' boxes, "designed for easy building and instant play"? it surprised me a little, since these sets seem no less complex than any other city set of late. they look like quick builds, sure, but not as though the designers went out of their way to simplify them.

1 beach house reviewed by dunamis set 4996 522 pieces $29.95 from target build time 90 minutes yet another interesting creator theme house. this one comes fresh of the 2008 line of sets and promises 3 different models. packing 522 pieces (albeit a lot of 1x1 plates) for only $29.95 it was hard to pass this one by as i was foraging for the new 2008 star wars sets at the local target. plus, i was itching to do another review since i had finally fully recovered from my marathon ucs falcon review which took the better part a month to complete. the box: the box is pretty standard creator type box which shows off the three models (beach house, caf? and ?towering? apartment building.) the back of the box shows some of the features of the three models. interesting features of the three models prominently displayed on the back include: - food counter complete with coffee (espresso) maker and food warmer (with chicken leg!) - home office complete with laptop (and the ubiquitous coffee cup.) - flip up roof granting access inside of beach house. note the satellite tv dish and even rain gutters along the roofline! opening the box is a matter of breaking two seals. we?re back to the reusable cereal box type tab system that we saw so often in 2007 sets. note the parts inventory is on the side of the box as well. this is a nice feature. once inside the box, we are greeted by eight sealed bags plus two yellow 16x2 plates and a green 32x16 baseplate. thank goodness there is no dss (dreaded sticker sheet) but alas there are no minifigs. in addition, there are the three manuals (one for each model) and they were stuffed into my box with the care of kid trying to put 10 gallons (or liters if you prefer) of candy in a 5 gallon bucket. but hey, we?re not collecting manuals here so who cares if the manuals are all bent and warped? the manuals: the three manuals are 74, 72 and 48 pages in length. they are laid out well and are pretty standard with all the usual trimmings: - piece call outs for each step - parts inventory at the end of the primary model build - page numbers color separation in these manuals were fine for me. plus, we get the usual verbose lego instructions on not dumping all your pieces outside in the grass and not to dump all your pieces into a single pile. thanks for the tip, tlg! parts list the pieces: pretty standard stuff here and as i mentioned, lots of 1x1 plates and tiles (at least 100.) however, we do get quite a few windows and a couple of doors. a majority of the color is black and yellow. i did see a few pieces that i was not familiar with so i?m going to show them below. keep in mind i?m not a parts jockey so bear with me if i think a part is brand new for 2008 and it was actually released with the classic space line. 2x2 window (fixed) and 4x3 window that opens: the follow photo shows the window glass (same as in corner caf?), door glass and new black parts. turns out these black parts are used as wheels. i showed the window glass because it still contains the molding circle just like they did before. it is hard to see from the photo, but it is there. the door glass i think might be new: i don?t recall seeing these 2x2 round plates with clips before and i thought i would show the mail only because it is printed and not a sticker: i know these are common, but didn?t they have four studs on top? these only have two: how about this sloped 4x3 window that opens: overall a nice assortment of parts with nothing juniorized. the build: the build was fun and was fairly straightforward. once you figure out which of the three models to build, it goes pretty quick. here are a few shots: see how the inside is made: look at the detail with the flowers and even the outside water faucet! outdoor seating area: upstairs being built: upstairs with opening roof (notice the satellite tv dish): check out the patio on the upstairs complete with outdoor light and rain gutters! here?s my favorite, the bbq grill. at least we know where those new parts go: finally, check out the tree. no juniorization here! here is what is left over: so far, i have only built the primary model. the others look interesting, especially the caf?. the design: the design was well done. very rich in detail. i love how there are no juniorized parts. the house is accessible by taking off the top floor (like caf? corner and market street). there is an internal staircase as well. there is no interior to speak of in the beach house, but there is in the other two models. the only real negative is that it is kind of small when you get it done. it would be nice if it was about 50% bigger. here are a few views of the beach house with a few minifigs thrown in: check out the close-up of the caf? which i think looks great: also, here is a photo of the interior of the apartment building where you can see the office and computer: overall thoughts: it is a really nice set. a tad on the small side but it has some great detail and lots of features. quick enough to build all three models and would fit real nice into an existing town plan. is minifig scale, but does not come with any. lots of window parts and black slopes. is a nice diversion from the onslaught of clone wars ships that we can?t remember seeing from the movies. final rating: 84% build 9/10 (pretty quick and fun.) functionality 9/10 (it is a creator set so you have multiple varied builds. diverse enough to keep the kids entertained.) design 10/10 (excellent and well thought out. outstanding detail for such a small model.) parts 6/10 (fair, nothing earth-shattering but lots of slopes and windows.) price 8/10 (price ratio is good but you get a lot of little parts. would be better with minifigs.) edited by whitefang, 23 may 2009 - 06:38 pm. indexed

0 i didn't know that the other models in this set came with interiors. this changes everything!

1 great review, thank you. i have this on order for my youngest's birthday next month as our first venture into creator. looking towards the town house thereafter, and then perhaps town plan or the town house.

1 another great review from dunamis thanks! i will get it if i can find it on sale!!

1 thanks for this great review! i love this awesome set, the creator line never disappoints. this is definitely a must-buy for me, just like the other creator houses. batbrick something! *wacko*

0 i got this set on tuesday on the sunshine coast (i was on a holiday) and since kmart were having a 15% off lego it was only $40 *y* . im modifying my summer house (its pretty small) .so far i've put a small kitchen,toilet,fridge & freezer downstairs and up stairs i will try to fit a bed and computer also im going to attach a small garage for my minifigs car. 8-?

1 thanks for the review dunamis, this is a great little set! i'm also very impressed with takuto20's mods. i've been trying a few of my own. i liked the tower block design, but a lot of stuff needed fixing. firstly i added a 4th wall, and made it so the storeys could be lifted off like in the other models. i also added flowers on the windowsills and doorways out on to the balconies. still to be added is an extra door for the top floor which i'm going to get from the new doors and windows pack. i added a chimney that goes all the way up the back of the house, and has a fireplace on every level. each floor is fully furnished with a fireplace, wash basin and bed on the upper levels... ...and a corner sofa and coffee table, plus an extra large fireplace on the ground floor. finally here is my idea of what to do with two copies of this set! all the parts pictured are from 2x 4996, except 5 extra fence panels and the minifigs. the house on the left has it's garden at the rear.

-1 ah great review kanal-k1 (and welcome to eb! :-d ), i was waiting for one of this set. not that i was expecting anything good, i won't buy it. i agree with thr playability, it does seem weak. what can you do with it. swoosh it? :-/ big step backwards lego... :-( dr. brick

-1 review gets *y* *y* , ugly plane gets :-x. thanks for the review!

-1 thanks for the review, but its an utter pass for me on this one - i already have a huge juniorized plane from the airport set - one is enough for me! :-$

1 hello and welcome to another redman set review! well, actually, the first redman set review! i'm your host, redman, and today i adorn my medieval outfit to tell you about the impulse set simply titled "the knight". this is a great set, with 14 pieces, 2 of which are spare, and a minifig with 2 weapons, 2 helmets, and some shiny armour. all this is packaged in a tiny box, just short of 10 cm? (or 3? inches?), with a neat little instruction manual that folds up to the size of the weapons rack included in the set. as you can see, this set only costs a measly 7 nzd. (disclaimer: redman not included.) here we see the box, clearly showing what the box holds. on the top we see a 1:1 scale picture of a minifig, for those new to lego, or who have forgotten how big a minifig is i guess. :-/ x-d the instruction manual, showing the nice and easy built, with me for size comparison. :-d (*sorry about the dark image, i had to lean over the light to get a birds eye pic. ;-)*) here we see the 2 different soldiers you can make with the set; a knight, and a guard or standard troop or soldier or whatever you want to call him... (note, each set comes with only 1 minifigure, and additional accessories.) of course you know i'm in the picture just for the sake of it, i'm not really one of the soldiers. x-d the neat little weapons rack, or rather equipment rack, as it holds not only a weapon but a shield (except the ovoid ones), helmet, and armour. nice and easy storage, so your equipment won't get dirty lying around on the ground. :-d one of the spare parts is another of those robot hands, so you can stick that in place of the shield and allow the rack to hold 2 weapons. just thought you'd like to know that. :-$ and here we see the nifty little structure of the thing. it can even support a whole minifig! note the grey stud on the bottom bar is a spare part, i just find it better used there to hold the armour. :-) huh? i don't remember this picture... 8-| it appears i drifted off, and these guys don't look too happy i overtook their weapons equipment rack. :-$ i should go... x-d so, in conclusion this is a great set for army building, at a reasonable price, with nice equipment, and it can be picked up as a little extra with your normal shopping. x-d that's all for today folks! *sweet* [/redman] so, what do you think? should i continue with these redman reviews ? (:-p), or just stop now? x-d comments and criticism welcome! :-$ ~peace

1 an excellent first time (?) review iamded! *y* well, atleast a first time redman review anyway. i really enjoy redman, i hope to see him pop up more often. your pics are great now that you ditched the phone :-p , and you've shown the set from many different angles and perspectives. thanks for this brilliant review, you have certainly convinced me to get a few of these, and then some x-d redman on! edit: btw, is it just me, or does my new avatar make me seem a bit creepy? 8-| batbrick is back! >:-) edited by batbrick, 18 january 2008 - 12:39 pm.

1 great review iamded! lots of pics, all the details. wish i could find some of these sets locally, but so far no luck. :'-( i fully intend to steal your use of a character to do the reviewing, should i ever do one like this. x-d oh, and if eb news presents ever needs someone to do a commercial, we'll be sure to get in touch with you. *y* batbrick, on jan 18 2008, 07:36 am, said: btw, is it just me, or does my new avatar make me seem a bit creepy? 8-| are you sure it's the avatar doing it? 8-| :-d ;-)

1 thanks everyone for your positive feedback, it's really appreciated! :-d you'd be surprised how long that 'redman presents' thing up the top took me to make! x-d so, it appears people do like redman, expect him to be reviewing the good wizard and battle arachnoid in near future! (i know those have already been reviewed, but new zealand never gets sets first, so i'll just be reviewing the sets i get. x-d) thefrisian, on jan 19 2008, 04:44 am, said: nice review, very detailed. *y* as for the spare parts, mine didn't come with any. both dark grey 1x1 round plates are used on the weapons rack (one for the armour, one for the helmet) and i only got one robot hand for holding weapons. that's strange, maybe i'm just lucky. x-d i also got 2 spare orange viking horn pieces in my battle arachnoid. :-d ~peace

1 awesome review!! i like the turkey leg hanging in front of the troll x-d yea the back looks a little....empty 8-| well overall i enjoyed the review! see ya soon!

1 nice review. *sweet* this is a must buy for me since i *wub* the new sand green giant troll! now i just have to wait until it's available in the us :'-( general tarful

1 thank you for the review, vader! that set looks worth buying! 8-? i think you gave me a good reason to buy it... ;-)

-1 great review, vader :-) as i've said before, this is a nice set, but doesn't really come with anything that doesn't come with the other sets of the line. for this reason, it will be somewhere at the bottom of my list for 2008. also, i like torso and helmet of the dwarf mining orcs much better. the colours make the torso look rather dull and boring, while the other, more brown one, looks much clearer and more exciting. i think i like the *knight* helmet better too, looks more covering and threatening than this one, although i'll save my judgement until i have one in my hands. thanks again vader ;-) edit: forgot to mention, hilarious pic in your sig, vader :-d edited by tinypiesrus, 19 january 2008 - 08:28 am.

-1 a troll driven by a turkey leg, what a wonderful little detail!!! :-d :-d thanks for the review vader. very clever, using a flag to hide that crazy firing device. i find it rather odd they used blue pins for this. black or gray would've been alot more discrete. about the big trolls, i think using different colours is good. i don't think a troll force would be very organized, so different colours would make the effect complete *y* . as for your troops, looks quite fearsome! definitely compared to my pathetic number of soldiers.. :-$ a nice set, but i would rather get the attack on tower though.. no matter about the price difference.

1 vader, on jan 19 2008, 12:45 am, said: here's a few quick shots of the 2 larger trolls we have so far, i prefer the sand green one. nice comparison shot, judging from these pics, i think i have to agree with you that green suits the troll better. especially since the orcs are sand green as well, indicating some relation between the two races (if they are indeed separate races). great review, very detailed and with lots of pictures. i was already interested in this set, but after reading your review i want this set for sure! *y*

0 thanks for the review of a set i would otherwise probably have passed on. out of curiosity how did you 'know it was for you'? you seem to be building quite a collection. why castle now? was the fantasy element all it took? just curious. thanks again and god bless, nathan

0 5150 lego, on jan 20 2008, 11:50 am, said: great review! my only grip with this set is you can only fit one pallet in the truck. it should have been the same size as the trailer so you can at least fit 2 pallets. seems like alotof wasted space. if i'm going to transport cargo, i want to use the maximum amount of space aviable!! x-d that's a fair gripe. someone else mentioned it above as well. i thought the same thing when i went to load it.

0 hollisbrick, on jan 20 2008, 04:38 pm, said: edit: $7!!!!! geez i thought $6 was bad :-x oh, my bad! i forgot to say that's 7 nzd, not usd or euros or pounds or anything. :-$ don't panic! thanks for the comment! batbrick, on jan 20 2008, 04:41 pm, said: yay! another redman review! you are an excellent reviewer iamded redman, your pictures show all the details included in the set and your thoughts bring new light to features and bits i hadn't noticed or thought about before *y* i love this little set, i will get two i reckon, because i want all the wizard bits in a minifig box as well. nice little humorous pic at the end too. one improvement i think could be to include the pics of the back of the box and other side of the instructions anyway. honestly, there isn't much to improve, you are an excellent reviewer :-) redman on! batbrick is back! >:-) thanks batbrick! :-d i sometimes flick from the minifig view of things to a person's view of things, but no one seems to notice, so it's okay. x-d and i didn't include pics of the back of the instructions and box because they were included in some one else's knight review, and there's no change. but i will include them in future, in case someone hasn't seen any of the other reviews of the set i'm reviewing. x-d expect to see a review of arachnoid stalker (or battle arachnoid) in the near future! ~peace

0 tinypiesrus, on jan 20 2008, 05:05 pm, said: nice review, your camera is much better now. i look forward to more of your reviews :-) i just went to toyworld today and got a wizard and 4 knights :-) and on top of that, they were having a 20% off sale *sweet* i might go back and get some more tommorrow. thanks! 20% off, what a bonus! if only toyworld's sales were nation-wide. :-d i wish i were in wellington, the guy at the toyworld their is really cool, and into lego to! the guy at the martin's toyworld here in rotorua is quite professional, too much so for a toy shop. still, he tells me when they get stock in. anyway, i'm getting off topic in my own thread! x-d ~peace

1 thanks for the review of this nice little set. for it's price (3 euros here in holland) it contains quite a lot of useful parts. the only thing that could have been better in my opinion is the wand, i always liked this one:

1 iamded, on jan 20 2008, 06:29 pm, said: the stuff in the set include a little stand for the owl, and a table utilising the new 4x4 round piece in frown, with the crystal ball in the middle, encasing the yellow gem held on by a 2x2 circle piece in blue. why blue, i'm not sure. wait, isn't it light bley, not frown? :-$ :-p although i would much rather have a brown table :-$ more on-topic, i love the wizard's legs, even better than the evil wizard's ones. the hip piece looks very nice on dark blue legs *y*

1 sweet plane looks much better than in the catalogs *sweet*

0 lt. veers, on feb 4 2008, 11:42 pm, said: i do admit the amount of cargo is rediculously small, but it still looks good. say, how much can the plane hold? thanks for the review! *sweet* that's all the space you get. now, it might be possible to rip out that rear bulkhead at the back of the wing and fill the middle area with tiles so cargo pallets could slide up the fuselage. but that would definitely prevent the undercarriage folding internally if that's what you wanted to do as well. dr. s.

1 cardinal brick, on feb 5 2008, 08:49 pm, said: thanks for the review, i like the looks of the set but i'm not sure about it still. is it work ?35? would you recomend buying it? well, i can only speak for myself - i like it. worth ?35.00? well, it's a big box for that amount of money, but full of big parts of course. i dunno - could do with being cheaper, but then i'm sure we all think that of our favourite hobby. ?30.00 would be nearer the mark imo. dr. s.

0 nice review, dr. s! i have been thinking long and hard about the scale of the planes in my town. i would like to keep my passenger planes in their classic 4-wide fuselage style, but i really don't mind the new plane hull pieces if they are used as an enormous transport plane like the ilyushin-76. unfortunately i can't afford this lovely new green one at the moment (which would be perfect to go with my green army) as i took too much of a hit buying the new 2008 star wars sets! but i have modified my white one to take huge cargo loads, in fact my apc is designed specifically to fit inside. unfortunately i'm a bit busy to take pics at the moment, but hope to put some up soon.

1 dr. s: i was not planning on buying this set after my disappointment with the other large airplane, but after looking at this image review, i just might buy. the green color is really the aspect that makes this airplane stand out. i think it looks great! thanks for the review.

-1 thank for the review doc! the only thing i like in this set is the small car. so i will not buy this set just for it! i really dislike those new planes, toooo bbiiiigggg! with this size, this cargo plane can carry just fiew things! what a shame! i think that the way tlc has made the wings is not very good... like the rest of those big pieces... just my thought. the positif point of this it's that it makes me saved some money :-d

1 an excellent review dr. sinister! *y* i really like how tlc is using the new crate mold in different sets! the transport car is really neat as well as the lifting thingy plus i love the green color! *wub* p

0 at my local wal*mart there was most of the 2008 sets including the indiana jones ones :'-) i picked up this one and the motorcycle chase! name: 7621 lost tomb price: $20.00 parts: 277 figs: 3 *box art first off we have the great indiana jones box art!! i must say the designers did an excellent job on it! i love the little temple design with skulls! as well as including indy in the right hand corner. the back of the box is just as cool showing all the neat play features of the set as well as an advertisement for the indiana jones game *figs first off we have our hero, indian............. what the hell? why is there a freaking cw anakin head on indy!! there was a production slip up as instead of indy's head i get anakin's! :-| |-/ i open the box up and there staring me in the face is his ugly face!! tlc is defiantly doing to here a gnarly complaint from me!! >:-( ok now here we have the " real" indy fig that is supposed to come with the set :-d i just noticed that his fedora hat goes down in the back! bonus picture time, here is a jacketless indy with his sleeve torn off, like he looks in the temple of doom *sweet* the next figure up is our lovely marion *wub* *wub* *wub* plus her head is reversible with a scared face x-d love the new hairpiece in black!! finally we have our undead skellie with second style head and poseable arms *the well of souls the set itself is a nice model and playset! the anubis statues are very cool and i love all the hieroglyphs on the walls 8-? here is the sw link with artoo and 3p0 x-d the ark in its resting place the ark removed, its very cool indeed, but tlc should have made the whole thing in chrome gold |-/ not metallic gold with brown and yellow!! the closeup of the anubis statue, yes the eye is a sticker but at leasts a gold color! *playability first off you can pull the pin on the anubis statues which send them falling and taking out the walls. behind the wall a skellie swings out! there is a lever in the back of the model where you push down and the snakes shower down upon the figs hehe with the snakes all around, marion is both modeling with the new carrot torch and fending off viscous cobras :-d in the meantime indy uses his whip to scale the wall and avoid all the snakes which he is afriad of. in the meantime leaving marion behind to fight them off. :-p the whip is bendable but it will always snap back into a coil, its some type of bendy hard plastic *scoring figs- 9/10 model- 8/10 playability- 8.5/10 overall satisfaction- 4/10 (would be 9/10 if it wasn't for the stupid anakin head error!) in the end this is a charming set and could easily fit in with the adventurers! it has the cool anubis statues as well as the ark. plus indy, marion and a skellie, great selection of figs but sallah would have been better since he actually removes the ark with indy however i am still wondering the point of the anubis statues, this set does seem pretty silly :-p p

1 thank you for this review! it is a brilliant set! i am definitely getting this set once indy is released in new zealand hurry up tlc! >:-( ps:could i have pic of what indy looks like with an old classic whip?

(sorry if i did something wrong with +/-, i thought that was the quote-button! :-$ ) let us know how your indy head adventure turns out, darthperson. i hope you'll get the indy face. edited by mr spielbrick, 09 february 2008 - 05:46 pm.

1 i got mine today! x-d i too got an anakin clone wars head, although i'm not really complaining since i already have an indy head from the motorcycle chase set. it is really odd that they would pack in such a different looking head though. also, for those that think the head has no use, try placing it under one of the braided new brown dwarf beards. it looks pretty nice, i think! *y* on the set, it's wonderful! the hieroglyphic stickers are wonderful, marion (especially her head and hair) is wonderful, and the anubis statues are nice too. there's also lots of nice tan parts, such as 20 round 2x2s, and 8 1x8 bricks. all in all, it's a great set for the price, and i can't wait to get race for the stolen treasure and temple escape now! *sweet*

1 dammit indy, you weren't supposed to open the ark!!! i really like this set, i only brought it for marion but its a nice set and fun to build.

1 welcome to: my sigfig sgt. joey sh. will lead trough this review of the new city 7743 police surveilance truck. first of all the box: front back the minifigs: 3 police officers and a bad guy now the vehicles: the cute little atv *wub* the main part of the set: the surveilance truck a shot of the interior the trailer back of the trailer the truck back side the little building: front the interior and last but not least: spare parts and not needed stickers that?s it! hope to see you again at the next episode of sgt. joey?s reviews.

0 thanks for the review, stealth hunter. *y* that truck looks better than i expected, and it?s for sure a pretty playable set. nice, but still too much police mayhem to me. i think the new police station?ll satisfy all my safety needs.... :-)

0 it looks to me that the little building is supposed to be like some sort of customs checkpoint between one nation and another or like a toll facility on a highway. i like the little checkpoint but i think that should be part of a separate set and 7743 just having the police mobile command center truck.

1 thank you very much for a fine review, batbrick. *y* what the.... i never realized these cool grey barrels till now.... that?s pretty interesting. :-) the whole chopper looks very good, with a well fitting power function. it?s for sure a rewardable work to change that baby into a real mf version with accessible cockpit. :'-)

1 i am definitely getting this set. thanks for the nice review!

-1 i wish i could just get those grey barrels alone, the rest of the set doesnt really intreigue me much :-$ thanks for the review.

1 thanks everyone, heres part 2: the second instruction booklet includes instructions for both alternate models, which is good, i hate having too many manuals: here she is, the plane: its very nice and well proportioned, but where did iamded get that laser? overview, the landing gear is very sturdy and nice, and the wings are surprisingly good: top view, iamded's head fell into the propellers, i was trying to save him, honest! a view of how the motor on this one works, by pushing the orange button you can make the prop spin. it is well integrated like the chopper, though the prop only spins for about 2 1/2 seconds. still, its a nice feature: the tail is also well made, simple, but lovable. oh, and check out that tank! the prop spinning, agh! is that my hand? final view, there seems to be some sort of explosion here 8-| well i think i got iamded more than me atleast. the second model is also great, though not as good as the chopper. the lack of space to fit something into the cockpit brings it down a bit, but it is a very nice model overall. i recommend it, though unlike the chopper it will be hard to mod into minifig scale. so far so good with 4995, here are the leftover pieces from the model: enjoy! batbrick away! >:-)

1 i really like this set... even though i was hoping for a mini-motor! :-d chock full of great parts too. thanks for the review. *sweet*

1 thanks for the review aayla, i love this set and its great to see another person interested in batman. now all you have to do is start watching the movies, then the cartoon series, then the comics, then the......... x-d i really recommend two-face's escape as well, a great set for a great price. and btw, the green dude as you call him is named killer croc, he is a killer with a freakish skin condition. batbrick away! >:-)

1 very nice review, lord of pies! thanks for taking the time to put this together, and especially for all the detailed pics. *y* i very much regret that my dark ages occured when they did. basically, i missed out on all the cheap and easy troop building sets, and this one is certainly no exception. the big sets are nice, but these are the ones that always make me wish just a little harder for a return of lego pirates... :'-) i gave it a 4 out of 5, just because i'd buy 4 out of 5 sitting on the shelves today, were it possible.

1 i bought one of these new from bricklink a few months ago as part of my pirate splurge i went on. i really enjoyed this set because of the amount of figs in such a small set, though pirates were always pretty good about their fig count. also the neat little hut is nicely done for its purpose. great review, btw!

1 great small set that can help you add to you minifig count. the little boats are always cool, and the den isn't that bad either.

1 another first-rate review! it's a nice little set with a big number of minifigs. and 2 flintlock guns is also a nice bonus.

0 woow :d this was my first lego set ever!

0 a nice review and a nice little set for anyone's pirate collection. a 5/5 for the review.

0 well since this topic has resurfaced, i would add my 2 cents about my appreciation of this set. it was the first and (unfortunately) the largest pirate set i owned as a kid, but i played the wazoo out of it. some of the minifigs have lost almost all their face printing after so many play sessions! theres just something about the hut that appealed to me more than the cheesy skull-face islands we keep getting.probably that it wa kind of neutral, good for my pirates, settlers or islanders. though the palm leaves were rather fragile and used to break off the studded parts. it would be nice to get more of these "beach village army builder" sets. edited by ardelon, 21 september 2014 - 03:40 pm.

1 hi guys. i picked these up the other day, but it's taken me this long to get round to posting the reviews. so, here we go: tub comparison with a minfig (thanks brainbox): the lighting changes a bit throughout the photographs, as it was going dark outside, so i only really had my desk light, and i kept getting in the way. 4837 mini trains now the box i really like. it's no different to those of last year's sets, but the colour here is simply fantastic, and really seems appropriate for the theme. so this is what you get inside. all the pieces are still inside the bag, the optical illusion was accidental :-d . no pieces of particular outstanding interest, but the dark green cheese slopes are rather nice. look out for those later. 1 2 3 this is the main model, and uses all the pieces in the set (bar these two, which according to the inventory are spares, but as with all my other creator sets, i'm cheating and leaving them in). this is far and away the best model of the three, and evokes the iconic version of a steam train. the green looks superb, but i'm not sure whether that's due to the model itself or the actual colour. moving on, we get to the second model: 1 leftovers (yes, i admit, i was using a piece of paper) this isn't actually a bad model. i don't think it's quite as nice as the previous one, but it's not bad. it's different from the first model as well, which is good. too muich of the same can be a bad thing. finally, we come to the third model: leftovers now... i'll be honest. i don't really know what this is. it's not that good a model compared to the other two. that's all i can say, really. and of course, all the pieces fit into the tub. overall: i have to say, i do like this set, despite the weak third model. the strength of the primary and secondary models make up for any weaknesses in the third, and i can imagine the pieces being fully usuable in building other trains. while the basic idea of these tubs isn't quite as good as the x-pods with regards portability and general 'niceness' they aren't bad. and for a fairly cheap price (?3-4) as well. 4838 mini vehicles this is one of those set boxes that you see because of the ridiculously loud colours. sound marketing scheme if you ask me. i've managed it again. there are pieces outside the bag. or are there? now these i like *y* . 1 2 (i don't know what the clip is for, there isn't one on the other side) 3 4 5 this is the main model of the set, and again all the pieces are used bar these three, the spares. it's quite a nice model, although the car's a bit odd. still, i like the ramps, and the colour scheme reminds me just a little of g1 ultra magnus. hmm, i think that boom arm could do with refixing... 1 2 leftovers this is actually quite nice as well. it's that classic breakdown truck, and the boom arm itself is quite nice, with quite a bit of movement. another solid model. 1 leftovers i'm surprised by the amount of detail here actually. not only have tlc included a spare wheel at the back, but also what looks like a trailer hitch, which all adds to the 'realism.' another nice model to round out a nice set. and in the tub. overall: i'm not sure which of the two i like better. when i bought them, and on the way home, i much preferred the train set. but after building this set, i'm not sure. this is another good set from the year when tlc seems to be giving us so many. there are some good pieces in here too, and while there's nothing unique, they're still good. so, thanks for reading, hope it helped someone, and if there are any requests, i'll see what i can do. that's requests for pics, not songs ;-) . edited by whitefang, 23 may 2009 - 06:56 pm. indexed

1 so here it is finally, my first ever review of a lego set..oh wait, it's actually 2 sets. so i don't really know how to do it right, but i'll try the best. (sorry if some pictures are a litte bit dark, but i'm not really into photography and i got bad light here) let's start with the dwarf's mine defender: theme: castle 2008 set name: dwarf's mine defender number: 7040 pieces: 86 price: ?9,99 (eur) first, as always, the box: the back, a few instructions on how the defender works, for those how don't know ;-) : and the instructions: we continue with the minifigs, sorry i forgot to make a closeup of the dwarf: and finally the mine defender itself, i personally think it isn't as bad as maybe some people think. the chain for the catapult is great i think: i kinda love those controls, the mechanism with the rubbe rband actually works pretty well, but only on a not-glossy underground. that's pretty much all of it, it's small but i like it a lot. so let's go on to the tower raid now, which would be my absolute favorite of those new sets. -------------------------------------- theme: castle 2008 set name: tower raid number: 7037 pieces: 364 price: ?29,99 (eur) again, first the box & instructions: we got 2 sets of instructios here, one for the tower and one for the siege tower: the minifigs, we got one archer and one soldier here, both with the torsos of the 2007 sets: now thw orc side, starting with the great leader, with the new armor and the golden helmet (i love those pieces!): closeup of the armor & helmet: then we got another orc-knight: and the prisoner, with handcuffs! the crownie tower looks great overall, though there is something i don't really like about it, but later on that. now the back, and that is what really bothers me, there areno walls on the first floor except the one with the wall-piece and the door, and theprison also is open at the back. the orc easily could jump out there: not sure what these are all about, they really don't add much to the set: enough rant now, let's go on with a pretty sweet detail, the golden crystal on the little table: the wall piece on the first floor you can ram in: and finally the very best thing of this set, the amazing orc siege tower! from the front: the great working ram, you can pull it back very far and it got pretty much power: here we got another sweet detail, the siege "platform" that moves out by pulling a cord in the back of the tower: finally a picture of a bit siege action: if you ram in the lower wallpiece, the brown shelfs of the prison-floor collapse and the prisoned orc is finally free! summary: likes: as i mentioned before, i really think that's the best ever produced siege tower, it's got so mich details and works extremely well, also the overall look of it is magnificant. the destroy-mechanism of the tower is pretty cool too, the brown door is a fine detail too. nothing much to say about the mine defender, i like this little set, and there's nothing really to bother about it. dislikes: the back of the tower. that's really the only thing that's a bit bad imo, they could have put there 2 more walls on the first floor and something to lock the prison easily. final thought: the tower raid for me personally is the best of the 2008 sets so far, it's got great playability and looks simply good. my opinion: buy it!

1 tks for these cool reviews metalandi !! i love these orc sets !! i am so going to get these ;-) i'm happy to see that scared face again (i love it really !!) and the use of that handculfs !! that new armour looks really cool that tower is really nice and i wont mod it that much which os cool and the battle ram is freaking sweet !! tks again for sharing ;-) *yoda*

1 great review, pictures and all! thanks for showing all the mechanisms of the tower, i didn't notice them from either the pics we had or the instructions--it didn't hit me that when you knock down the wall the second floor breaks. that is a genius idea. this looks like a superb set, unfortunately my priority right now is the troll warship. still, if that really is u.s. $80, i might skip it and go for this instead, which is only $20 us. one note, though. i think there might not be a back cage on the second floor of the tower so that the mechanism can work. did you try to see if the second floor ground still falls if you add it a fourth cage wall? also, you could just pretend that the tower is built against a mountainside. it would fit perfectly and add more defense to the knights. great review! :-) vk

0 tks for those so much!! :'-) *y* nice reviews! i love that tower raid, and the defender, and will buy them both. quote really don't add much to the set: oh, but they do. more pieces= higher price. ;-)

0 thanks for these fantastic review. it's the first time i take a good look at these sets. there is a good chance i'll buy the dwarf's mine defender, especially for that price.

0 this set didn't come with the new jail door piece? i'd have guessed it would have, since there is an orc in prison. nice review. i'm looking forward to picking up these sets. steve

1 thanks metalandi! these are 2 great sets, i'm definately looking forward to seeing these in new zealand stores! the collapsing floor/prisoner freeing mechanism on the tower is wonderful, a great touch. some slight modifications, like, some walls, will make this perfect. and the dwarf's mine defender is a sweet little set, with some neat minifigs. thanks for the reviews! *y* ~peace

1 thanks for these great reviews! *sweet* the dwarfs mine defender looks interesting, the figs though are *wub* the only thing missing is a weapon for the dwarf and some shields the battering ram and tower are awesome! 8-? the troll king with new torso, helmet, and body armor is simply amazing i like how the troll is handcuffed :-d the tower shows nice detail except for the poor "brig" . i love that gold crystal! the battering ram is a thing of beauty! $30 for the tower and ram and $10 for the defender are very well priced! i still want the battle wheel more though! damn exclusives! :'-( >:-( p

1 well, i don't think orcs are that sturdy, seeing that they'd have to jump from the second level of the tower, i don't see survival as his chief objective! :-p awesome review! i'm loving these sets more and more! the tower raid is definitely the best and the cheapest set there! >:-) oh, and pirhana, it's not really a 'king', it's more like an officer. remember, the wizard rules these goblins! edited by trooperdavinfelth, 22 february 2008 - 02:49 pm.

1 *sweet* wow!! another excellent review! haha, that tower does reminds me of kk ii of mistland tower =x well, overall, i love these 2 sets very very much *sweet*

0 thank you for the nice review. pity the tower is not designed better, but i still want to buy these 2 sets. if only there were 2 dwarves in the dmdefender.

0 yeah, the open towers are kinda funny, although they were also typical of (for instance) 90s pirate sets. the trolls' vehicles are cool though. they look evil. i can't wait to start collecting '08 castle sets...(i didn't buy any castle in '07, i only got one set for xmas, so i'm catching up on the '07 stuff first before it's all sold out)

1 green grocer reviewed by dunamis set 10185 2,352 pieces $149.95 from the lego store (glendale, ca) build time 6.5 hours holy guacamole! almost exactly one year after caf? corner was released we get the third installment in the increasingly popular lego exclusive town series. combined with the famous 10182 caf? corner and its trusty companion 10190 market street this trio makes the foundation for an amazing city block of lego goodness. for those new to this series of sets, check out my reviews of the two previous sets in this line: cafe corner market street i would not necessarily recommend reading too many of my reviews in one setting as you might experience loss of brain cells and/or drowsiness. you have been warned. so, how does green grocer stack up to the two previous sets you ask? well, follow along kind reader and i shall attempt to unravel this question. the box: the gigantic box is pretty standard and looks amazingly similar to the caf? corner box. the back of the box shows some of the features of the green grocer as well as a lot of the cool interior that was absent from the previous sets. in addition, we are shown an image of the three sets together and a small insert image showing how they connect together (as if we could not master that difficult maneuver?) opening the box is a matter of breaking two seals. as it seems to be the norm now, we have the reusable cereal box type tab system that we saw so often in 2007 sets. however, upon opening the tabs we are pleasantly surprised to find a cardboard tray! have not seen one of those in a while. as you can see in the photo, we have two 32x16 green base plates, three instruction manuals and a bunch of bags that are broken into four groups: group 1 has 12 bags and goes with the first manual and builds the first floor. group 2 has 9 bags and goes with the second manual to build the second floor. group 3 has 14 bags and goes with the third manual for the top floor and roof. and one bag that is not numbered and hence you can open it whenever you feel like it. there are no stickers ? yay! moving right along, we get to the three instruction manuals. the manuals: the three manuals are 55, 47 and 47 pages in length. they are laid out well and are pretty standard with all the usual trimmings: - piece call outs for each step - parts inventory at the end of the second manual - page numbers color separation in these manuals was fine for me except dark bley and black. we get a nice photo of all three sets together: plus, we get a nice tip showing how to split up the bags and what goes where. those additional pieces you see in the photo just below the numbered bags are the pieces that come from the single un-numbered bag (along with the base plates). parts list random manual shot the pieces: upon opening the first set of bags, one thing is clear; there are a ton of little tiny pieces! the minifigs are included in this first section as well. interesting to note that there are a handful of printed pieces and as i mentioned previously, no stickers. we also get a host of new and exciting pieces to add to our collection. keep in mind my scope of lego sets is generally centered around star wars, technic, creator and the occasional racer set so what is new to me might have been around 15 years. at any rate, here are some of the more interesting pieces: again, note the printed tiles. this time around, lego has decided to include 33% more minifigs than the caf? corner and market street sets. yes, we get four minifigs instead of three! here are the cast of characters: pictured (left to right) is sir top hat, miss jenny blue overalls, patti o? furniture and little timmy cub scout. i?ll leave it up to the minifig aficionados to decipher which torsos are new and to tell us all about the hairpieces. i can say with reasonable certainty that the four yellow smiley heads are not new (somebody check that?) don?t forget the lovable little cat named ?tom?. he is the arch-rival of the mouse ?jerry? that lives downstairs: overall, there are a lot of pieces, large variety and wide range of colors. the build: if you have either of the two previous sets, you will feel right at home here. just like in the previous builds, it seems like the first ten build steps are consumed with laying a bunch of 1x1, 1x2 and 2x2 tiles everywhere. almost feels like 30% of the pieces are used up right away (see below). there are several sections where you build various parts of the interior. take a look at the cash register/counter below: and the beverage cooler: and the produce stand and everything that goes in it: looks like someone has mail: looks like someone just had a baby: this set is incredibly well done and gives inspiration to go back and add similar items to caf? corner and market street. as before, the average builder is introduced to some new building techniques like using the hinge plates to make the angles on the front of the building as shown below: also the top of the roof shows some interesting ideas: overall, it is a really fun build that kept me entertained the whole way. the design: this is a great set with lots of little details. i especially like the little mouse hole in the wall leading to the jerry the mouse?s area. they even included a little slice of cheese! it seems the designers can?t get away from the ?usual? staircase which i always feel is way too big. maybe future designs can incorporate a spiral staircase to save room for other things in the model. one welcome addition is the fire escape as seen below: i?m going to show a bunch of examples of various items in the set so you can get the feel of the amazing detail in this design. take a look at the lamps (torches?) just outside the door: and the streetlight with fire hydrant: brickwork and archway: awning: here is the back side of the building. note the trashcans and yard tools: here is a close-up of the railings on the second story balcony and the second photo is the finished product with curtains in the window. nice use of cups to make the banister on the second floor: here is the fireplace on the second floor: second floor staircase with tom?s hiding spot: check out the radiator on the third floor: more third floor: nice grandfather clock and rug (third floor) check out the deck that is up on the roof. complete with two chairs, table, umbrella, flower pots and grill: interesting use of minifig hammers on the roof: finally, here is what is left over when we?re done: a couple of shots of the front: a shot of the back: and here are all three together: overall thoughts: this is an incredible set and the best of the three in my opinion. it is hard to top caf? corner but i believe green grocer just did. i absolutely love all the details and building techniques that went into making this set. there is a ton of different parts and wide color selection. as usual, we get a bunch of tiles and small plates, but that goes with the series. also, we get four minifigs and lots of minifig accessories. i?m giving this set a score of 100%! i thought about it and i really don?t know how they could have made it any better. in short, run don?t walk to go pick this set up! final rating: 100% build 10/10 (excellent - lots of nice interiors, details and accessories to build.) functionality 10/10 (outstanding. raises the bar with interior and detail. think caf? corner on steroids.) design 10/10 (excellent ? can?t say enough good things about it.) parts 10/10 (great selection and diverse colors. great minifigs.) price 10/10 (price ratio is excellent but lots and lots of little parts. well worth the price.) as alway, feel free to comment, complain and question what you see here. i'd like to hear your feedback on this amazing set.

1 very nice. very nice, indeed. lots of lovely, little details, even at the back. this review hasn't changed my opinion one bit, i'm still looking forward to when i can finally pick up mine at the post office. i'm crossing my fingers that there will be more buildings following after this one. i'm guessing that lego's just testing the waters to see how far afol's are willing to go regarding price vs. details. green grocer is still epic, though.

1 for some silly (and quite delusional) reason i thought that i had a chance to review this first... :-d but yours is at your house, and mine is (hopefully) winging it's way to me... :'-) thanks for the review! it will help me survive until mine arrives. i love this set. *wub* hopefully there will be many more stunning sets like this to come. *sweet* xwingyoda, on mar 8 2008, 08:03 pm, said: i didn't know green grocer had a rodent infestation !! neither did i and i have looked through the instructions at least three times... :-$

1 man, these sets are so awesome. incredible work done by the designers there, must have took a long time to get all this ogether. if they weren't too expensive i would go and buy them all 3 right away *wub*

1 damn it ! what a great great review ! i definitly love this set !!!! burn credit card, burn ! you're the must in there dunamis ! many thanks !

1 like the set, this review also deserves a 10/10. i've ordered this set yesterday on s@h. seeing and reading this review, i'm convinced it will be worth the money. so, bonaparte is finally entering the city theme !!!

1 a very fine review with great and informative pictures, thanks dunamis! *y* and what a wonderful set, a masterpiece and far beyond everything i would?ve expected just one year ago.... the amount of details is exceptional, from the different railings to the mousehole and the radiator.... sheer brilliant. :'-) and two female mfs (or hippies, you never know....) and a child.... only one adult male character who nearly looks like.... well, anyways. it?s simply a milestone, and a very creative and inspiring beauty. *wub* easter parade on! and, sweet gg.... will you marry me? :-$

1 o. m. g. i must have that set!! :'-) *y* *wub* i remember you telling me that you were going to do a review of this set, and i was so anxious! i love these reviews! thanks so much! great pictures. *wub* *y* *y* this will dent my wallet. 8-| i am so envious!

1 great review. thanks for taking the time to do this. this has been a great line. at the risk of abandoning my castle/adventurer loyalties. i've got to say this is rapidly becoming my favorite line and this set looks to be the best of the lot. while it still hurts to shell out $150, i think i'll still be happy to do so. steve

0 cp5670, on mar 10 2008, 05:53 am, said: the old tubes also grip the nozzles much more firmly and if you aren't careful when removing them, it's actually possible to rip off the nozzles completely. x-o i actually noticed that while taking it apart but didn't really pay any attention. i just thought that's because it's an old part. well, thanks for the information!

1 i bought it some years ago for the b-model, and like it so much :d

0 this was my first pneumatic set

1 yeah. if i rebuild and wash a model i will record it. glad to see you liked it!

1 this set is really cool. i might actually get it!

1 nice pictures. i also sort out the pieces the same way if i'm rebuilding a model. *y* this set packs a lot of functionality into a fairly small size, but was rather expensive for its size ($70) when it was still available, compared to other sets of that time. you can also rig up the technic flag sticker that it comes with to the main model. i've done that on mine. you may want to reinforce it with tape if you're going to leave the model on display though, as it will break up over time due to uv exposure like many stickers do. i had to do that with mine after it started to crack, although it still looks pretty good.

0 hmm, seems like the wheels are recycled into the harley truck in the 2008 batman set!

1 bernddasbrot, on mar 10 2008, 05:56 pm, said: you've just motivated me to go on a "senseless-preliminary-design-errors-hunt"...! man..., this set is a disaster what were they thinking! :-d :-p i just remembered one other fun aspect of this set: the crane hook can be attached to the underside of the rear bumper, to hold it in position while driving along, but when things are like this and you try and wind up the cable the winch is strong enough to break the (original provided lego) rope.... it 'worked' with my copy. :-d so this set is capable of demolishing itself.... but still, one of the best technicsets i have, with all stickers intact. i'm not so sure about that flag though, must check on that.

1 wow, that first picture is great! you must have a very wide angle lens with the capability to focus very close (macro). the perspective makes the model look huge. nice work. i think the suspension on this set is my favorite of all technic. it has such large travel and is so.... what word should i use..... "bouncy". hey, why do you only review sets which are red? :-d eric

0 bernddasbrot, on mar 10 2008, 01:41 pm, said: at my school leaving examination i made a model in blender3d and explained to the board of examiners how to build a car and how to animate it. it needed a color, so i took red "because all beautiful and fast cars are red..." my physics teacher contradicted. :-) did you use ferrari to prove your point? any physics teacher would have to admit that a really fast car, approaching the speed of light, will always look red as it drives away due to red shift!! x-d on the other hand, 8880 looks pretty fast and it is black, although i have seen pictures of one that someone built in red. yellow might be good too. some cars even look fast in green. eric

1 i can remember that i've seen a few color variations on brickshelf and on ebay (they sold well). it's new and familiar at the same time. that makes it more interesting!

1 i also happened to receive this set this weekend, virtually misb (the seals on the side of the box were loose, however everything inside was untouched). this little beast a joy to build and even more so to play with! as indicated by eric on the technicopedia page, it's crammed with functions for a medium-sized set. i think i love it even more than my son does

1 hello, my dear friends! here's something new. i am actually making a review with pictures! yes, i got a new camera for christmas. now i was testing to see how the camera would reflect, so some of the pics are a bit blurry. i have based this review from dunamis's reviews. he is my inspiration.so, without further ado, i bring you the review! set #: 7693 name: etx alien strike price: $19.99, ?12,99 pieces: 246 box: okay, so as you can see below, the box is pretty simple. as always, european versions won't have the piece count, name, etc, just the number i believe. mine, having the american version, has the info on it. as you can see, it has the classic mm logo, and the red planet, as well as the set in a pose itself. very nice. i linked it because the pic wasn't resizing. http://www.brickshel...ke/dscn0017.jpg below is the back of the box. it shows the other sets and some features of this set. contents: next we have the contents. this set includes a medium sized dss (xwingyoda), a bag labeled one, and huge bag labeled two, the 1 bag contains a smaller bag, and the two bag includes two smaller bags. 5 bags in all. also pictured are the instructions. i have linked it due to the non-resize. http://www.brickshel...ke/dscn0019.jpg figs: included in this set are three figs. two jellies, and 1 astro. the jeelies are fine, but i pefer the lom ones. but they glow. those new alien commanders for summer look promising though. the astro is nice, and includes an extra gold visor. moc on! astro miner: in all mm sets there is a human and alien set. the astro par of this set is a mini-miner. here is a pic of construction and that wonderful space logo sticker. not much of a cockpit. :-/ finished miner(the set number, too): overall i like the miner, and it is nicely designed. i feel the cockpit is lacking though. aliens: the alien vehical is the main part of the set. this pic shows the beginning steps. solid and sturdy. but those four axles/pin parts(blue) are pointless. no support, and they don't get used at all. nice tlc. :-| now we get cooking! this pic shows the tail added on and the more bulk being built. we get a little repetitive and build the craft up in this pic. and this pic from the instructions shows how the alien craft transforms for battle. the completed set and extra bits. parts: 8/10 figs 8/10 price per piece ration: 9/10 playability: 9/10 overall: 85% the alien craft is great. the attack feature is nice and there are a ton of trans green parts. the alien falls out of the cockpit when turned upside down. i love this set, and it's perfect for mm fans or beginners.it has nice parts, and read the above part for more details. gallery when moderated. keep an eye out for future reviews! please comment. :-)

1 sweet first pic review! *y* i got this set for a birthday present last year, and it is pretty fun overall. the alien ship in this set is actually one of my favorites. it just looks cool, and the way you can fold it out is really clever. the only negative for me is the cockpit of the mining unit. not really because it isn't detailed, but because mine is top heavy, and keeps falling forward. it's kinda funny if you think about him driving along and then falling forward...but not funny at all when you're playing. |-/

1 cool review. makes me want to get the set. *y*

1 holodoc: i agree with you. and the buety of being a custom parts maker is that i can recolor these... :-) *y* athos: sure, buddy. they have moving arms, legs, (a real mf!) the arms and legs are the same just flipped. :-) edited by ~vbbn~, 14 march 2008 - 01:12 am.

1 hi! this is my forth (old-school) technic set review! since blakbird pointed out that all my technic reviews are red, i chose a yellow dune blaster for today! just kidding. this set is red as it should be! (don't worry my next reviews will be yellow and black... uhhh forshadowing... ;-) ) i will start with some facts! 277 elements and released in 1994 that's enough. #1: the box: #2: the parts: #3: building instructions and catalogues: wow! no folds, no wear marks - simply: *wub* "was lesen coole kids?" - "klick! das super magazin fuer coole kids!" (how obvious...) #4: building: no differential. i really love the way the 1x8 technic bricks on the sides will be positioned later. fun fact: the engine contains no 2l-technic axle. ...and finished. a real quick build. #5: spare parts: ...for the alternate model. the yellow technic handle should be from 8412. maybe a bonus feature from the seller! #6: random shots: #7: final thoughts: this is my second 8829 and i also noticed that the engine turns very hard. the alternate model is really (sorry to all those of you who like it) crappy. i mean- a nice idea, but not with this wheels! :-| anyway: a really beautiful technic-set! *reminiscing* (this word exists, does it?) thanks for viewing the pictures, i hope you enjoyed it! please comment if you want to! edited by bernddasbrot, 21 march 2008 - 02:09 pm.

1 that looks like a very nice set! :-) in your opinion, how does it compare to the current dune buggy? -toa of justice

1 wow! this buggy was my very first lego set. i like this review - it remembered my childhood. i also liked its body with those 8 studs long bricks on sides. i can also remember trying to build engine in such way that it works smooth without success. anyway i think its "studless version" - set 8048 is much better.

1 finally, after a very frustrating incident with the internet explorer 7's 'back' button, i present to you my very first review. this is a review of set 8158 speed racer vs snake oiler, it's also the first review of a speed racer set on eurobricks. also you should know that i didn't put the stickers on as they can be quite valuable later on down the road, so i'm sorry for the lack of stickers. :-$ so without further ado i present to you my first review. he he, that rhymes. :-d edit: i just finished resizing the pics and uploading them to brickshelf after having a heated argument about when my bedtime is with my mother. so, i will be doing a complete redo of the picture portion of my review of set 8158. i'm going to work on that as soon as i finish typing this message... edit 2: review fully redone now, *sighs*, that took forever. edit 3: almost forgot to put in a new link to its brickshelf folder. this is v.2 of my review of set 8158, enjoy... theme: speed racer set:8158 speed racer vs snake oiler price: $19.99us pieces: 242 minifigs: 2 first off pics of the box, instructions, dss, minifigs, and new parts: there are so many stickers they had to number them! x-o so's sunglasses are chrome gold. 8-? close-up of the hemets. new parts include, first system lego hubcap, new more curvy fenders, curved windshield, and a s-shaped connector piece. now onto the build, first speed racer's mach 5: back part of the car. the cockpit of the car. they connect with the new s-shaped piece. front part of the car. front and cockpit also connected using the new s-shaped piece. side view of the car, so far. underside of the car, so far. adding more detail. ground level front view of the car. side view with added detail. underside with newly added axles. demonstrating how the new hubcaps are put on. now on to building snake oilers orange-ilicious racer: back part of the car. the cockpit of the car. they are connected using the s-shaped piece. front part of the car with seemingly random color choices. *wacko* the front and cockpit are also connected using the new s-shaped piece. adding orange-irific fenders. side view of the car so far. adding more detail. smoothing things over. ground level view with lime green "eyes" and white "fangs". side view with more detail. rearword view of the car with newly added cuve-acious windshield. no hubcaps!?! :-| now onto finished views of both cars, first the mach 5: side view with sweet hubcaps. up close and personal with the mach 5. a rearend shot. "i got hubcaps, i got hubcaps!", speed racer. now so's snake racer, yes thats what i'm calling it. :-p :-d beautiful! blurry, :-$ rearend pic. "watchout it bites!", snake oiler he's ready to take on sr, hubcaps or no hubcaps! >:-) racin'! now for some comparison shots: hope you all like v.2 better then v.1, i know i liked it better. x-d seriously though i even learned a thing or two doin' this last version. ;-) now it's time for my summary: overall a very well designed and executed set. it's only downfalls are that there are way too many stickers, 32 to be exact, :-| and there are no cool contraptions on the cars to take out the other racer. a great buy for $19.99, i reccomend this set to everybody because of the reasons i staed above and because even i, who is not a big fan of speed racer, x-o was drawn to this spectacular little set. price: 10/10 pieces: 8/10 too many stickers. minifigs: 9/10 needed some accessories. playability: 8/10 needs some cool contraptions on the cars to take out the other racer. overall: 35/40 general tarful edited by imperialshadows, 01 june 2008 - 12:07 pm.

0 mr. builder, on mar 22 2008, 06:01 pm, said: you're wrong. lego has made a hubcap before! here it is: look at the wheels (click). ok, but they're still the first system hubcaps. :-p x-d ;-) general tarful

1 sinner, on mar 23 2008, 11:55 am, said: yes, i have a few of them. great pieces too! i don't think i've seen them in a set for years though. it's good to see them back. but... 32 stickers? that's more than any of the first wave of ef ever had! still, the set itself is very nice, with some nifty new pieces, and the minifigs are pretty cool too. i may not be familiar with speed racer, but i still may get this. i'll go and see the film as well, to fill in the background (of the set).

1 i definately prefer 8159, in terms of minifigs, and useful parts colors to me :-$ but the cars are all the same basic design. thanks for the review. and i actually love the stickers. this means i won't have to rub off all the print, and if wanted, i can use stickers elsewhere :-$

0 nice, but not my cuppa.

0 as i mentioned elsewhere, i couldn't see a review for this and though it's only small, let's strive for completion! here's the box: the contents: the parts: leftover bits: and the set: not much to it i know, and not much of a review, but there you go...quite a lot of stuff with the copper though. dr. s.

-1 legobear, on mar 23 2008, 09:05 pm, said: big or small we all love our legos, and for that i thank you for the review. i would have had liked to see your opinions though, about the price, the playability, or anything else you'd care to share about it and perhaps how it fits with your collection. i've always been hesitant about getting this set because to me i feel like i have it all already, but i'm missing that dog, radar gun and, 50 mph sign :-/ it's too pricey and the playability only really kicks in with other sets - there's already a speed gun with the recent police car release so this seems a little redundant, but it goes well (of course) with the very large tabletown pd. maybe worth it if you want dogs. dr. s.

1 a very neat and useful little set, thank you for the nice review. *sweet*

0 hi! this is my forth pre-old-school review. as promised: a yellow-set ! my 8862 arrived today, survived the washing machine coaster and actually was real fun to build! #1: information: this set contains 664 parts (only! i thought i’d be far more!) and was released in 1989 in the technic theme. be sure to visit technopediaif you want to know more! #2: building instructions: wow these instructions are used! i'm not used to this after all this sets with unread instruction booklets... the pneumatics page: the last step for the alternate model: #3: the parts: wow! look at all those technic beams, gears, pins...! (a few parts are missing in this photo!) #3: building: the left worm gear is for the outriggers, the right one for turning the “rear boom” the three 12l axles: left one: outriggers, middle one: steering, right one: erm… rear-boom-rotation. the two worm gears in the front part: left one: lifting the bucket, right one: dumping the bucket. the turning-mechanism for the “rear-boom” is finished. once again a toothed 10l axle. the boat weight 2x6x2 is hidden underneath the radiator grill. okay… many hoses and a nice, comfy seat have been added. now you can recognize the backhoes real shape. only with a little violence it’s possible to lift the bonnet (?) through the pneumatic pump. yeah, outriggers. same technique that the 8854 uses. the finished “boom / jib / scoop thing” (=bjst) :-| x-d the finished loader bucket. and to end the building process: the same picture from the introduction. (off-topic: “it is all part of the miracle of nature! - the circle of life!” #4: functionality: this time, i tried something new! i hope you can spot something - if not: technopedia! okay, here we go. #5: random shots: i’ve got way too many pictures this time, so i refer to my brickshelf folder. until it’s moderated you can follow the multilingual links! eins deux three quattro fem zes sédem osiem #6: final thoughts: definitely worth buying! as a child i thought it looks hideous - but today i’ve found out it’s totally fun to build and freaking functional. three things i want to mention though: the bjst can only be slewed (a new word!) if the outriggers are deployed. it is also possible that the bjst will reach the ground (danger of grinding or sticking) even if the outriggers are deployed. the two mechanisms for the loader bucket can actually interlock, and the 14 tooth gears might break / disentangle from the axle. thanks for viewing the pictures, i hope you enjoyed it! please comment if you want to!

-1 bernddasbrot, on mar 24 2008, 05:08 pm, said: there are ~324 axle nuts on bricklink with an avg price of $0.89. but i wants it cheap! *sing* and i would still call 324 quite rare. and i also want to just tack it onto another order. *sad*

0 yeah, i meant they're rare. ;-) but i can imagine that a normal axle with the old half bushes will help. sometimes these are really strong; if you put 2-3 in a row? edit: i just tried it: a normal 10l axle with 2 interlocking old half bushes type 1 on each end. (i chose those who only can be moved very hardly along an axle.) i slewed the bjst / back arm a few times tried the pneumatics parallel to it and it didn't loose. edited by bernddasbrot, 24 march 2008 - 06:06 pm.

0 quote how long of a shutter speed did you use? 15 seconds. quote by the way, don't forget to build the alternate model of 8862. i will review it too and post it in this topic! quote "slewed"? i think that's a word. how about "slewn" or "slain" or "slewifacated"? i think "rotated" is best. actually i took it from your site! x-d quote white is pretty rare. unfortunately i don't own 8480 but i think 8824 is also a very good (though small) white set! 8462 rocks as a blue set. i just got it a few weeks ago. let's see... 8462 also is one of the last technic sets i would call old-school. 8479... okay too, but 8458 is imho not. 8868 and the totally mysteriously black set will follow...! quote i was thinking you could somehow attach a 16-tooth dark gray gear (the one that spins freely around axles) to the nut, which would make the axle move in and out when the gear turned and convert the gear's rotary motion to linear motion in a fairly compact package. did you had something like this in mind? if the toothed 10l axle rotates the axle nuts want to rotate too but they can't because of that 2x4 technic plate. so they'll decide to move along the axle. the 1x6 bricks on each end make sure that the axle won't move in or out. thanks for your feedback!

0 @ black shovel: i just tried a black shovel but i can't / don't want to determine which looks better. front, on mar 30 2008, 11:40 pm, said: a great review. i only have new sets, so looking at old ones like this is great. i would suggest multiple pictures

1 some time ago i sort of complained about the fact that there was not much technic represented in the eurobricks community (this was the topic, if someone is interested). i am glad to see someone took that complaint serious and started reviewing technic sets on large scale to show us how fascinating the theme really is! this review is once again an excellent one, i really enjoyed reading it. i must buy this set sometime soon because i always liked the three-way pneumatic system it came with and the overall look of the machine. for many years it seemed out of reach, much to expensive and hard to come by as a kid. now as an adult there are many ways to acquire this wonderful set. keep on reviewing! *y*

1 great review! i personally do not like the stickers very much. it's great that you show us the cars without stickers. hehe, it look nice! was thinking why other characters do not have a visor in front of their helmet

1 iamded, on mar 24 2008, 02:32 am, said: 29 times! great review, these are some sweet lookin' rides. :-d very similar to the other set, but still great. *y* thanks! ~peace curses! you beat me to it. :'-( anyhow, i saw it 29 times as well. i'm probably gonna get the truck and the grand prix. racer x was a letdown; i expected a kickass awesome unique head and all i get is bruce wayne rubbed in my face again. *sing* (that is me screaming) anyways, these sets look cooler and cooler! more reviews! i must see more! *y*

1 a very good review, thanks generaltarful. *y* that´s an interesting set for sure, and especially the red car looks really fine. air intakes, very nice.... :'-)

0 thanks for the review. and for giving me directions :-p i think the design of these two cars looks to be better than in the other set. the drivers are positioned lower compared to the windscreen and the design of the front on th red car is really nice. i'm missing details of motors and cars this big could use a working steering mechanism.

1 crap, now i want these sets!! great review!

1 a mighty fine review you've created slyowl! *y* after some sleep i shall immerse myself more fully within it.

1 yay! pictures! thank you for the review. you made me actually consider looking it up on ebay, but i already have so so many things to get on my want list. drat my easy ability to get sold on something lego!

1 it's a great set and one i have yet to add to my collection despite my large number of islander extras. enchanted island, aside from having so alluring a name was good value for money in that you only needed this one set and you had a good representation of the islanders both in the size of the set and the number of minifigs. the flipping rope bridge and the river give it a great rainforest retreat sort of feeling and one is inclined to think of this set as more inland than directly coastal for me. whilst the islanders were never seen in the same light or popularity as pirates and imperials they were an obvious and colourful addition that to me added a whole new depth to the pirate system and one was now able to play a 3 or 4 way war adding a greater political element to the sets. enchanted island is probably the 3rd most appealing of the large land bases for me after port royal and eldorado fortress. good review and glad to see the set recognised!

1 i was just going into my dark ages when lego began the islander themes, so i've never really cared for them. but this review actually made me want this set real bad. i guess this is what reviews are for then - good job on the review

-1 judging from your pictures there seems to be many interesting torsos and new fleshy heads but i don't think this set is for me. fueling my dismissal of this set is that i saw the trailer for this film at the cinema today and it looked pretty terrible! :-x thanks for taking your time to review this set though ricecracker! ;-) edited by casewindu, 29 march 2008 - 10:18 pm.

0 well...... thanks for your posting, but i couldn´t care less about fleshie minifigs or movie-accurate cars - or the cars at all. this set would really only go into my parts bin. therefore i need to know what parts are in there and if they are "cool" enough to go into an exo-force collectors parts bin.

1 speed racer is the action film.and he has formula 1 car but he is intersted in art of the race.

1 ah, thanks sommuch again for that great review! *y* *sweet* man, i am so happy they made this set. the new one seems too boring. ;-)

1 a great review, thank you. i do not know these old sets like this one, but it is very cool to see how they were made. i have an un-opened 8421, maybe i should do a small review of that when i get to build it. btw. boxes are expensive, so at a given price point, it's a choise between more bricks or nicer boxes. i have no doubt what most people would chose. front edited by front, 06 april 2008 - 10:21 pm.

1 thanks for the review. *sweet* for it's size and parts count this is a remarkably featured set. i don't think i've never seen the alternate model before. personally i prefer 8421 because i think it looks much better and i love the six wheel steering. i also love the three segment boom and the transmission; they fit it all in so neatly. i realise that it has trouble even holding up itself, but ultimately it doesn't matter as it's not like you are really going to construction work with it. what bothers me more about 8421 is the design change in the boom from chainlinks to strings. i would try to mod mine but all i have is the prototype picture to base it on... and i don't have enough links anyway! :-p bernddasbrot, on apr 7 2008, 07:29 am, said: yeah, somehow i wonderd why only vbbn (thanks!) responded... indeed! i have been very busy the last few months and i kept meaning to reply... at last i managed to find the time to reply today. bernddasbrot, on apr 7 2008, 07:29 am, said: another reason for the 8460 as favorite set? it's got a "real" alternate model, not just a different erm- crane. yes, that really sucks. somebody (i haven't got the time to look :-$) on brickshelf has made a quite good alternate. lego have been a bit inconsistant with alternate models lately. the recent tow truck had a good one; i even made both!

1 great review! while i admit i wasn't into technic at the time this came out (i was a mere child, give me a break! :-d), i can see now why it was featured so much. from the booklets to display stands at toy stores and at my local lego center (when it was still around), this thing was everywhere! with your review, i can now truly appreciate all the details of the set. i got to admit, i can see the appeal now! that comparison shot you took is amazing. i love not only just how it included the little details such as the stabilizers, but also looks incredibly fun to play around with. great set and an even greater review!

0 set ref: 7624 name: jungle duel number of minifigs: 3 number of pieces: 78 price: 11,90€ it’s the smaller set from the last indy movie, “the kingdom of the crystal skull”. here we go! a general view of the set: we have a tent, some food ( a chicken leg is always welcome!), a fireplace, the things with all the swords, a bench with a broken table, 3 ants, a map (printed tile) and other accessories. don’t make that girl hungry or... yyyyaaaaaaaahhhhhhh! ho no! our diner, a giant ant, has gone away! those giant ants are made in a smooth plastic, in dark red and trans black colour: and here a closer view on the two new hairpieces: the new girl hairpiece is really cute, and i’m a bit disappointed by the new man hairpiece…those hair lake some volume… but i’m really happy to see that tlc has made some new moulds for hairpieces! it’s the good part of the theatre lines! so, it’s a really interesting set because you’ve got a lot of useful pieces for a city mocers, with the two new hairpieces without spending a lot of money! edited by imperialshadows, 01 june 2008 - 11:59 am. updated stats/title

1 thanks for the review! must...make...ant...army...

0 i have no idea why they dont use that female hair piece on trixie in speed racer. it would be perfect! greta review!

1 i love this set! thanks for the reveiw!!! probably the only indy 4 set i'll get..

1 front, on apr 16 2008, 10:15 am, said: they must be ants, but i'm pretty convinced that what you think are the antennae, are the ants mandibles. or not. there are six legs, 2 antennae, and 2 mandible. and they most definately are ants, to those still in doubt. thanks for this great review, alex, this is most definately (well, in my opinion anyway) the best set. lets face it, in motorcycle chase you really only got 2 bikes and 2 crates as the big parts of the set. in this one, which is the same price, you get those ants, a neat tent (hurray!), a [b]printed[/i] map, a chicken leg, a castle sword, ef sword, and pirates sword, a dagger (now in light bley) and a silver frying pan. this set is packed with useful pieces, i'm definately getting this one. and i for one love mutt's hair piece. i sense my sig-fig will soon have a new hair style. thanks again alex for the sweet review! ~peace edited by iamded, 16 april 2008 - 05:07 am.

1 i was already thinking of buying this set, and you've totally convinced me. thanks for the review, alex btw, i think they are ants, having that shape; moreover, we already have spider molds, and they have already been used in theatre themes (see spiderman ). luxorv

1 great review; i will definitely get this, if not only for the hair but the ants, melee weapons, and new faces and torsos!

1 great review

1 thanks for that great review! this is a very interesting set filled with nice parts for customisation. somemore, the price is not that steep. i will need to get ready for the second wave!

1 quote set ref: 7625 name: river chase i swear it is supposed to have stickers on the side of the car, boat, oil canister and windscreen? i like this set, looks brill!

0 shoc, on apr 15 2008, 10:31 pm, said: is that a laptop it's on? does it come with the set? yes it's a laptop, and it was in the set! when i opened it, i understood why this little box was so heavy! asus is my official sponsor, so i have to show the logo! i have to add that i don't have put on the stickers...

1 a very fine review of a really great set, thanks alex! this set has everything, a croc, very nice mfs, a neat tree trap, a cool zodiac and a marvelous and very detailed amphibious car in a beautiful color scheme. the only thing i´m not colpletely sure is the design of that jerrycan (thanks for the right word and the interesting link, kingboy ). although the use of the revolver´s pretty clever indeed and fits well too, it´s still clearly, well, a revolver.... very unusual and interesting for an official tlc design.

1 just like 7626 this is a must buy in my opinion. i just the amphibious vehicle,very nice for army building.

1 this set looks good. about the jerry cans, i like how they give me more pistols. this may be the only indy set i get from this batch. i'll just have to deal with the fleshie heads... (exchange them for yellow.) like stealth hunter said. this will be good for army building. silent help

1 set ref: 7626 name: jungle cutter number of minifigs: 4 number of pieces: unknown price: 39,99€ a general view of the set: we’ve got 5 giant ants, two russian soldiers, a general, indy of course, 3 trees, a small entrance of a cave, and the debroussaillor vehicle (i don’t know the english name of it…). you can’t enter into the cave, because there is a spider web with its spider…unless… unless you know how the mechanism works and the spider web go up… and reveals a case with diamonds and accessories. a closer view on the mechanism (which is simple but works well), and you can also see the difference, or maybe the same, size of a spider and a giant ant! and i’ve always thought that those spiders were very big compared to the minifigs! so those ants are really giant! poor small frog! the three trees with the entrance make a nice jungle layout! don’t speak too loud, you will wake up the soldier… don’t worry for him, he will be waken up by the vehicle before being eaten by those giant ants! a front view, making the vehicle really menacing! a back view: push the red part from the back and there are two parts that fall down from the vehicle. i don’t know why… the movie will clarify this i think… and here you can see how the two big circular blades turn when you push the vehicle… simple but effective! run indy, run! this set is really nice. the playability of the different elements is great, the colour scheme is nice too (i like those dark green tree parts!). the vehicle is really impressive without being too big and its very well details! in general the designers of the indy sets have made a really nice works, with a lot of efforts in all those details everywhere! i’ve got some project for this set, to integrate it in my city... i’m a city mocer, and not an indy fan. so i don’t have bought the temple, the bigger set of the series, because it has nothing special for me in term of part selections or in the design, in relation with the town theme, and because my supermarket doesn’t have it yet! so, we are waiting for a member to review it and make the part 4…

1 oh, man, thanks for the review! imo, this looks like the best set in the new indy line! do you have any better pics of the colonel?

1 excellent review alex. thanks for sharing. i can't wait to buy this set once available. i really like the dark green leaf pieces. i like the cave/temple which will look great in my jungle diorama. blending the dark green and light green works well for the vehicle. overall, a neat little set.

1 this is a great set!!!!!! it is probably my favourite indy so so far! great reveiw! although the set is great the price is greater have to get it on sale..

1 a great, detailed review for an excellent set! i love the jungle cutter vehicle itself, and all the dark green! it's great to have the trees and cave entrance; you can never have enough extras! the figs are nice too; two russian soldiers, the cool-looking general (i think his name is dovchenko or something) and the repeated-but-still-nice indy with rpg. thanks again, looks like i'll be picking this up along with jungle duel. (by the way, i think this set is called jungle cutter).

0 wow those trees look so weak compared to those enormous blades. anyway, a high-possibility-and-appeal-to-us-compulsive-lego-shoppers set, so, i'll try to get it, which means i'll obsesively look until i find. deforestation of puny trees, on!

0 here some close-up pics of the russian soldiers and the general : and i know that you have seen that i don't have put the stickers on...

0 xwingyoda, on apr 16 2008, 05:37 am, said: great review again alex !! same question (in case you didn't se it in my reply to the other set): where did you get those new sets ?? i really love that set !! its called jungle cutter the trees are really cool and make a great adition to it imo. that temple entrance or monument is really cool !! those bionicle parts do make fantastic vegetation !! you mean the spiny dk. green things that hang from the holes around the secret entrance? they were in the indy: temple escape. i totally forgot about that green frog !! thats cool , those are so cute !! 5 more ants is great !! the vehicle look really sharp (ah ah ah). 2 more commies yeay !! that officer is really freaky actually !! could have been a high rank under pol pot's regime in the s21... yeay looks more asian than russian imo yeah, tlc's really cranking out the new molds for both food and wildlife! so let's see... if i get all five sets... i get... 11 russians! and six are basic soldiers, although two are duplicates and triplicates. yes, that officer definitely has an italian look to him; those cheekbones are a little too high. now its time for my gripes: * same bloody rant about indy !! * i haven't read the instructions before but once again there are so many parts in crap colours that need to be changed look at all the crap red and yellow in there !! i will need to look for those parts before buying the set like i always do !! mod while building on !! same rant! any chance we could see the rpg? i am really soimpressed with that indy line !! i sincerely hope it will have a long and healthy life !! agreed! responses to the yodameister's review of alex54's review of the jungle cutter are in red. now to my opinion: great review! more reviews on!

0 trooperdavinfelth, on apr 16 2008, 02:30 pm, said: responses to the yodameister's review of alex54's review of the jungle cutter are in red. whats that funky name trooperdavinfelth, on apr 16 2008, 02:30 pm, said: you mean the spiny dk. green things that hang from the holes around the secret entrance? they were in the indy: temple escape. yep indeed and i have that set if i remember correctly the first line to use it as vegetation is aqua raiders tiger shark attack (7773) trooperdavinfelth, on apr 16 2008, 02:30 pm, said: any chance we could see the rpg? why, its just a flick fire missile in a wrench i'll use my brickarms rgp which is way better ok so i just finished reviewing the instructions and look at the parts you need to just change the horrendous colours !! damn its really getting worse and worse

1 this is the 3rd review, that i had read. it's very tempting to fly over and get those sets from there. because, i may need to wait for some months before it arrived. it seemed we will have a new small little creature to add into the ranks. these "red ants" is cute and of course looks nasty too. haha. i love those trees, foilage and plants very very much. it can be used for my moc and is good for any "green" project related expansion. i love it. about the vehicle, i find it abit wierd. it seemed too big in the set-up. hehe, but still i love this set. mainly, i will get it for the green parts

1 thanks every much for the review! i remember having this set, and making really terrible stop-motion movies with it. very playable. this brings back lot's of fond memories! thanks! majisto on!

1 agent rick: you're definately the dragon master around these parts. what a great little set. i really like the classic dragon which reminds me of a similar style used for the lego crocodiles. and the dungeon is pretty slick too. i like the use of the large gates plus the doors. plus the set contains the blue wizard. awesome! great review.

1 this was the last castle set i got before my dark age.. really liked it although the big rock parts looked really bad ( i am kind of used to them now) unfortunately i lost the little wand.. and i never understood who is "good" and who is "bad" does the wizard own the dragon? well they dont seem to be enemies but isnt the dragon supposed to be evil??

1 i own this set and i think its a great for a smaller fortress building. there is a good selection of mini figs, the burps do detract somewhat from the set, but they do make it feel as if its in a large cave. the cloth flags that are included are really nice and mine have lasted a long time.

1 a very good review, thanks, sinner. that´s really a pretty cool model, very detailed with useful parts too.... hmm, perhaps that one´s gonna get the first technic set i´ll buy, beside that 4481 hailfire droid.... um, thank you, sinner....

0 best review of a lime green technic dirt bike ever! really, it is. i just don't understand the allure of the bike very much. where does the fabuland fig go? anyway, very insightful review. thanks for taking the time and effort to review it for us. i'm not really interested in the set, but wanted to support my buddy since i know how much work you put into these. now i shall go read the cherry picker one. i look forward to it because there's a walrus in it. lasse d, on apr 22 2008, 04:55 pm, said: it must be cold in that room. nice shirt, but the vertical hold is broken...

1 thank you for that fine review of a pretty cool and nice set with a very good amount of functionality and, um, playability, for sure.

0 thanks for the review! i think i am going to get this set for it's many technic pieces. i could really use those for a rig i'm going to build.

0 looks like an interesting set. i didn't realize the motor controlled two functions through a transmission switch. that's always good to see. i'll probably pass it up though until the price falls a bit. the overall design is a bit too studless for my liking (i think the 8275 bulldozer has a much better balance of studded and studless pieces), and the wheels somehow look too small to me. i also have something of a backlog at the moment; i still need to pick up that bulldozer along with the 8421 mobile crane (on ebay).

0 thanks for reading my review guys! ~vbbn~, on apr 20 2008, 10:58 pm, said: great review! i never have been interested in this set. i am saving my money for a grey technic set or thatt technic ferrari set... if you mean 8145 ferrari 599 gtb then i recomend it, but i think it is overpriced. mine was almost half price... and about to fall in the sorting bin! holodoc, on apr 21 2008, 04:23 am, said: i´m not that much into technic building because i´m lacking the inspiration to build something different with all those technic elements. so i´ll pass on this one and stay to classic bricks. i have enough now to be able to build something... and i really should soon or i'm going to find it hard to justify to my wife buying the other 2008 sets! imperialscouts, on apr 21 2008, 12:58 pm, said: thanks for the review! i think i am going to get this set for it's many technic pieces. i could really use those for a rig i'm going to build. i didn't know you liked technic. i look forward to seeing this rig. cp5670, on apr 22 2008, 02:35 am, said: the overall design is a bit too studless for my liking (i think the 8275 bulldozer has a much better balance of studded and studless pieces), and the wheels somehow look too small to me. i also have something of a backlog at the moment; i still need to pick up that bulldozer along with the 8421 mobile crane (on ebay). i'd buy the bulldozer or mobile crane over this set. as i own both already i bought this! i tend to agree with the wheels, but i think it doesn't detract from the model. hinckley, on apr 23 2008, 08:14 am, said: wow, it's a smarty set with drive shafts (we are everybody!) and technical junk. the specs and stuff kind of lose me but the walrus looks really cute in the cherry picker! i imagine he's saving a kitten. thanks for your foray into technic land. i tried to fit him in the cab as well but he kept falling over.

1 set: 7627 - indiana jones - temple of the crystal skull pieces: 929 price: $aud149.99 out of all the indy 4 sets, this one seems to cop the most flak - which may account for the fact that the other 3 were reviewed weeks ago and this one has sat, unloved and alone, waiting for someone to turn their eye upon it (or, y'know, buy it). luckily i'm a sucker for spooky old temples, filled with devilish traps and hidden treasures, hissing fountains and overgrown foliage, creepy skeletons and crumbling stonework, so here it is: indiana jones 7627, temple of the crystal skull. part 1: the figs first off, the figs - 6 humans and 4 skellies (or should that be skullies? ) indy, mutt, irina, and that sneery russian guy that's in the 2 smaller sets. nothing new here. aha! what have we here - two natives. i wonder if hair is a sign of power in this culture, since one guy is completely bald and the other one has the most extraordinarily luxurious black mullet. somehow i doubt the movie will answer this question. back view - as you can see, the scalp tattoos are also popular in this tribe. fashion conscious! (note in the background the paws of the fearsome black jungle panther, ie my cat, curious as to see what the tribe was up to.) also, don't ask me why these guys are carrying axes rather than, say, spears. and what everyone's been waiting for, the skullies - three of 'em and a conquistador skellie - very cute. note the backs of the crystal head have a plume-sized hole - or maybe that's just where they injected the blue brain-plastic. spooky! i love these skulls, i wasn't sold from the initial pics but they have a very creepy smile and the head shape is just... weird. with the large eyes, it's kind of homer simpson-esque. and here we have the token vehicle in the set - a weird little tank thing with treads. kind of looks like a cross between the amphibious boat and a mini-tank. i'm sure there's a military expert around here who can tell us exactly what it is supposed to be. the treads are nice, but the rest of it is a bit thrown together. you can tell they wanted to keep the dark green colour scheme but the budget only allowed them 5 parts to do so . all in all, a mixed bag with the figs. 4 repeats from the cheaper sets which means we have one new native figure and the crystal skullies. there are heaps of the old-skool skele heads scattered around the sets so those that prefer can replace the skullies with ordinary skellies. bizarrely, the top of the box which has the line of 1:1 figs pic (you know what i mean) doesn't have names for any of the characters, whereas all the smaller sets do. part 2: box, parts front of box: back of box: two instruction books: parts. this set has come under criticism for being overpriced - myself included - but the official piece count is 900 plus, which is pretty good considering it also contains the baseplate. 6 big bags and 2 of those 12x12 bricks in dark tan. (note: set does not contain live black jungle panther™) the dss, helpfully comes pre-scrunched thanks to tlc. even in a $aud150 set they can't get that right... sigh. the dark tan baseplate. say what you like, i'm in love. i know some people don't like these, but they were such a staple of castle/ pirates for so many years that i don't consider them a juniorised piece at all. this one, recycled from the 05 police hq and 06 hospital, is much better in design than the king leo's castle one as the different heights and asymmetry make it look much more like a natural piece of ground. perfect for mocs. and it's dark tan - how could anyone not love such a huge slab of dark tan? note this love doesn't extend to applying the stonework stickers which are, frankly, crap. random instructions page: part 3: temple of doom - or just a doomed temple? the complete set, front view. isometricish view: back view: top view: first impressions? it's very dark tan, isn't it? and green. and bright green. and dark green. and dark red. and normal tan. and dark bley. and pearl gold! in fact, it's a bit of a mish-mash of colours. i'm of two minds about this. i kind of prefer the palette to be a bit subtler, but i can see that a playset designed for kids isn't going to sell bucketloads all tastefully done in shades of tan with lashings of dark-green foliage. there's a huge amount of dark red in this set, which is always a welcome colour, but i'm not convinced it quite works with the 2 shades of tan on offer here. on the plus side, there's also a huge amount of dark tan in ordinary 2x2 bricks, tiles, plates and 1x1 and 1x2x3 slopes, which is great for anyone wanting to stock up. let's take a closer look. i'll do this roughly in order of the build itself: a) the big scary face. this is a simple, fun build and very effective at projecting menace at the temple entrance. it actually detaches very easily from the temple (as pictured on the box art) to allow easier access to the inside. the eyes are flick-fire missiles, with scary face's hair conveniently providing ammo refills should you run out. all in all, from me. (b) the back spin the skelly head and stone steps appear - we haven't seen this feature in a while. nice to get these pieces in dark bley. a conquistador hides under the stairs - this is a bit useless as the stairs can't fully extend while he's there . moving right... a trapdoor - what could possibly be behind it??!!??!!? answer: not much, really. a little red stair. i really like these 2 stickers though - very intricate. the staircase leads to what i like to think of as the crystal skull transmogrification chamber. now, i know nothing about the movie except that it's supposed to be have a kind of 50s b-movie plot rumoured to feature (look away, spoiler-haters)..... aliens. these weird, creepy gold chairs look made from the bones of aliens if you ask me, with their strange vertebrae and silver claws. it wouldn't surprise me if bringing these aliens back to life was part of the plot of the movie... hence the crystal skull? i guess we'll find out may 22. in any case, transforming aliens clearly like a disco whirl as when you pull the handle, the whole of this assembly spins giddily around. a very clever and simple trick - it's basically just a wheel under the platform but the effect is great. also under here is a bottomless pit (stickered)... i would very much expect a villian to be thrown down it at some point. "so, do you come here often?" "i don't know who designed this club. these chairs are really uncomfortable." nb. i am really, really over those pearl gold 1x2 roof corner slopes which started popping up in the 2006 castle range, infected exo-force and have now spread here. can we please have these in a different colour? or a different pearl gold piece? pretty please? ( c) left tower (looking from the front) a small tower with a trans clear gem. (d) right tower waterfall with booby trap. i like the sticker, it's very cartoony, which fits with the set somehow. when you turn the wheel, flick fire missiles spray out and hit whoever is on the stairs. both towers have a trap where if you move the skull, another one pops out from the dragon mouth. (e) central turret thing this thing is kind of annoying and doesn't really sit or work well. it's kind of like a laser beam sending messages to space, i guess. as the central dome rises, the two plates peel away. i find it is a little bit tight to work smoothly and the two plates doesn't really sit well together at the top. maybe i just need to rebuild it. i'm sure this will also be explained in the movie. (f) final trap - the stair that isn't there the final trap is at the front - as indy goes down the staircase, you can push the red heads and all the 1x8 bley bricks come tumbling down. simple and works well. (g) alternate view here's how it looks as pictured on the box with the head removed. as you can see, this allows better access to the centre of the temple. as you can see, sadly there is nothing actually interesting there except a staircase to the turret and 2 dark tan slopes which are just stuck there and look a little out of place. i mean, come on, everything else has a splash of dark red and gold! your destination: nowhere! part 4: in conclusion so after all those endless pics, what about the set itself? cons:as a playset, 7627 doesn't quite make sense. admittedly, the traps that are there are well-designed and unobtrusive. on the other hand, there's a great big whopping entrance at the front - but i wasn't sure if the figs are supposed to sneak in through the backdoor and go up the spiral staircase and past the waterfall (as shown in the box art) or if they were meant to end up in the golden skull room. the middle area doesn't really connect with anything, nor does the giant space turret. it may be that some of these questions are answered in the film, but whereas with 7624, 7625 and 7626 i could at least picture a story myself (eg with river chase is fairly obvious what's happening - a chase down a river with a croc and a communist staking them out)!, the temple set is a little all over the place. the design feels a little off to me - not really bad but not really great either. pros: on the plus side, the natives and crystal skulls themselves are great. at 900+ pieces, this is also a great parts pack for dark tan, dark red, plant pieces, gold oddments etc. i especially love the baseplate in that shade. i like the overall shape of the temple - a big staircase with secret nooks and crannies. the build is reasonably interesting and there are some clever tricks with the traps. but upon reflection i shouldn't have to sell this set - it should be able to sell itself! as i said before, i'm a huge fan of dark, mysterious old temples so for that i have to give it some love. it reminds me of the big old adventurers sets and the whiff of nostalgia is itself a powerful intoxicant. however, for the price lego is selling it in australia/ europe/ canada i couldn't recommend it as a must-buy for full price when the smaller sets in this series are themselves so good. review done - woo! edited by imperialshadows, 01 june 2008 - 11:59 am.

1 the figs look great! the natives and the skeleton conquistador are my favorite figures in the set. the set itself is very good. the interior sort of reminds me of an older style lego set for some reason. it could be just me, but it has a classic feel. this will a great set to add to my list! great review! (so far, anyway. i only saw the back of the box!) edited by general zen, 01 may 2008 - 02:17 am.

0 damn, you've convinced me to get it now, thanks for the review, tan is my favourite colour in lego! batbrick away!

1 thanks svelte_corps for the great review, if it's out in aussie then it should hopefully be reaching nz soon. i can't wait! this looks like a great set, for me at least. i too am a great fan of spooky old temples, they are such fun. i love the look of the base plate, but the stickers don't look all that great. i wish they printed it like they always used too. i have to get this set. and the other ones too. thanks again, you have brightened this sad day.

1 i was going to review this on monday but my camera ran out of batteries! anyways, great review! as i have the set built, it's a really fantastic set. the waterfall is a reall cool sticker, and the flick fire missiles are quite interesting. another point of interest: there are seven of the new flick fire missiles overall, if anyone cares.

1 nice big set ! thanks for the review. the skellies seem to me as the only really big plus of the whole lot. i agree on the homer simpsons' paternity to them...

0 nice review! although you need to use the macro setting(a.k.a. the flower setting) for better pics. are you using a digital camera? you really need macro... the idea is, turn it on and hold down on the 'take picture' button halfway until the pic focuses. then press it down all the way to take the pic. i'm glad this one also comes with the new uzi; i wanted an extra...

0 nice review wilhelm screamer! very thorough. the pictures are a little dark and blurry, though. i made a tutorial here for amateur photography tips. i also edited your first post to include a link to alex's review. great job!

1 very good for a first review! i bought this set and jungle duel at target the other day (i was going to wait and buy them when i go to downtown disney this summer, but how could i pass up saving four bucks that i can spend on store-exclusives? ) and i have to say i absolutely love them. the amphibious vehicle (don't they call it a duck in the movie?) is definitely my favorite lego vehicle i've ever built. everything about it is wonderful- the size, the colour scheme, and it's accurate to the one in the movie. and irina spalko's hair is to die for. on a side note, i don't get why they made marion's arms white in the set. the shirt underneath her vest in the movie is obviously blue. i switched the arms out for light blue ones and it looks a lot better, and it makes marion's eyes look great. -ryan

0 ahhhh... back in the days when shell was the racing fuel of choice before that octan company came to town, bought off the old shell execs and ran them out of town on a rail... but i digress... i always liked the look of the set, but at the time could not work out where i would be able to fit it into my town...

0 wow simon you got two? yummy!

0 thank you for the nice review metalandi, and thank you for the nice story and selfpromotion simon willems. the racewaytracks were always nice dioramas in the catalogues of the eighties.

-1 hello all, i don't believe there has been a review of this set yet, so i wanted to take this opportunity. up for review today is 8160 cruncher block and racer x as part of batbrick and iamded reviews: here is the box, i have to say i love the art on it. it's very colourful and makes the truck look a lot less crap than it does on the box. plus, you have to love the "missile launching action" bit right, am i right? why are you all staring at me? and here is the back. pretty generic, but shows some nice details and so forth. oh dear! in turning around the box have i killed myself and iamded!? okey dokey, up first is the best part of the entire set: the minifigs! racer x is wonderful, though coming with a boring bruce wayne face. but it is cruncher block, his lady driver taejo that really shine. look at those awesome suits! the cool faces! taejo has a ripped shirt! now up is the first building part of the set, with me and iamded looking rather slick in x's car. while i'm not a big fan of yellow, it is very nice, and slopes in an underused colour is better than no slopes at all: front view, the new windshields are fantastic: while a very cool car, it is rather silly of tlc to give us the exact same one we got in the smaller set. i didn't get the smaller set with this car, so i'm still happy, but it is a bad marketing move: sorry iamded, i know it's your birthday, but......vroom! now for the second part of the build and my favourite, the front of the truck: annoyingly enough, this part opens up to shoot a pointless rubber projectile: to do this, you open the roof (a nice detail btw) and pull back the mechanism, here: thus blowing the front part open and launching it.....well, not far really the wheels and covers are pretty cool, and the front is nicely designed, the red looks good and the rear vision mirrors are a great touch. and now for the most disappointing part - step three, the trailer: (note - clicky joint piece not part of set, just used to hold it up!) that's right, almost the entire thing is open, even the "filled in" side has holes! i'd certainly be cared to be back there, one bumpy hill and back you go! i didn't put the lame computer stickers on, and the control area is pretty lame in general. not to mention taejo (who is depicted on the boxart as standing at the desk, would most likely just be sucked out the back at those speeds! there are some pluses too though, like the ridiculously awesome minifig paintings i'll be using for wayne manor. also note the "control" on cruncher's desk that when turned, turns the gun at the bottom. it's an alright feature: here is an example, i've shot iamded on his birthday. what? it's a love ray! haven't you seen the care bears? and though i'm not a massive fan of stickers, this is just too cool. the little aquarium is very simple but very clever, using a printed piece between two clear windows to create the illusion of a tank: it looks much better in real life, trust me, and here is a side view to better explain: now, to connect the two is a good thing, i like the way a simple technic piece assumes the job. oh, and behold my hand! the completed truck, which, while a mixed bag, still doesn't look too bad (i guess): now the completed set, which, despite its unbelievable large flaws, still looks cool. (warning, the kickass iamded and batbrick figures do not come with this set): more pics here: http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=3147324 all in all: minifigs: 5/5 - racer x is beautiful, cruncher block and the driver too, and taejo has a ripped shirt, damn! design: 2/5 - pretty poor considering the best part is available in a cheaper set, and only the front part of the truck looks cool, but still not truly awful. build: 3/5 - despite having a bad trailer, it was a fun build and sometimes you need something that doesn't take ages to make. price: 2/5 - overpriced easily, but rogue shadow is worse! fun: 3/5 - the mere concept of such an open truck kept me playing with this baby for hours! total: 15/25, not as bad as it would seem. overall i'm really glad i bought it as the minifigs are fantastic and the paintings and fish tank are cool. it's fun, stupid and downright ridiculous, but while not a great set by any means, certainly isn't as bad in the brick as it looks in photos. until next time, batbrick away! edited by batbrick, 13 june 2008 - 12:20 pm.

-1 awesome review batbrick! i don't see any appeal at all really in this set, but that's okay, as i want to stick to castle anyway. the car is the best part imo, which you can get in a different set with another cool car and for a cheaper price. but the main downfall to this set is the fact that the truck's trailer is half blown up and the survivors are magically staying inside and not being sucked right out of there, as you have mentioned. i would have thought tlc would at least included some sort of cover that you could take on and off easily (kind of like the modular buildings). having said all that though, the front of the truck does look incredibly cool, and those minifigs are sweet. too bad they all have flesh tone printed on them. so, while this may not be my set of choice, i can see the appeal... well, really i can't, but it's just my opinion! i'm sure there are plenty others who would love to scoop this set up. ~peace

0 nice review. good pictures, thanks. i think i may get a couple of the smaller sets, as i think these will become collectors sets in years too come, not sure this range will be that popular? love the minifigs though.

-1 batbrick thanks for the sweet review. you give me great insights into this set. hehe, i agreed that racer x is nice, but i believe we can get it in the other set for a much lower price. for me, the trailer which does not have a cover is bugging me alot. that's why, i holding my reservations against this set. at most, i will consider the other 2 smaller sets for collection purpose. nevertheless, batbrick great job

1 thanks for the great review! it seems like the most awesome part of the set is the sticker sheet, which is a reversal of the usual situation!

1 i bought this set a few days ago and agree with what you have said about it. the trailer is fun to play with but just so plain. overall great review.

0 i enjoyed the review. some cool fleshie heads and parts, but it does seem a bit lamer even than i imagined from the box (the "airy" truck is rather slyly disguised on the box art). i would like to get it if it is ever on sale, 50% off would be nice :) speed racer lego doesn't seem to be selling too well in local shops here.

1 good review. a must have for my batman collection. are these sets already out in germany?

1 the batman minifig have a detailed and cool torso. thanks for the review brickbitz. edited by darkrebellion, 16 may 2008 - 07:31 pm.

0 that is a very nice and quick review! thanks for giving us a quick summary. not much comments on this set, as i do not really go into batman theme yet. however, the ice cream truck in the set interest me. apart from that, nothing much yet. who knows, maybe i will change my mind in the future.

0 oh wait, is that torso dark grey or light grey?

0 trooperdavinfelth, on may 16 2008, 11:11 pm, said: although i know you don't take many pictures in your reviews(imho, ) but can we see a little more about the tumbler? i'll get some set up tomorrow in better light. to be honest there isn't a lot to see, most of it is just basic technic blocks underneath with all the slopes built up on top.

1 the tumbler is massive! i'll struggle to fit it into the cave, but never mind. the figs are nice, the tumbler is pretty accurate (or at least, it will be after i've moded it), and joker's tainted ice cream van is so very joker. thanks for the review, btw.

0 hey brickbitz, i love how your review is not biased 10 ups. in the end, you said, "overall slightly disappointing." most people post reviews only with praise, but i'm glad you take both sides . enjoyed the review just like others have, thanks so much

1 general grievous reviewed by dunamis set 10186 1,085 pieces $89.95 from lego shop @ home build time 3.5 hours it is the start of summer here in california and along with the weekly deluge of new action films we start to see some of the next wave of star wars lego sets. the latest offering from our favorite building toy company is none other than the infamous general grievous! no doubt you all know the story of grievous; two parts technic and one part human and his hatred of the jedi. follow along as we get a close-up view of the mighty general. no doubt the observant will wonder why i purchased this set from shop @ home instead of my trusty lego store in glendale. well, it’s really as simple as two things: i’ve been traveling a lot and didn’t have time to drive to the store to get it and gas is now $4/gallon and i would likely spend more in gas than the $9 shipping cost to get it to me. so there you have it. the box: a gigantic box (much larger than expected) held the mighty general. we’re back to the perforated tabs on the side and two stickers on the front that let the box lift open: inside, we have 17 bags, two manuals and three stickers on a relatively small sticker sheet. the manuals: the manuals are not terribly thick in fact the second manual is noticeably thinner than the first. they come in at 75 and 31pages. interesting to note on the back we see the next (and more interesting) wave of sets later this summer. nothing new to report on the manuals as they provide the lego standard of high quality and features we expect. - piece callouts - models divided into sections - large images - page numbers since there were links posted to the .pdf files of the instructions online, i’m sure you can all get an idea of the manual and the parts inventory. however, for those of you without access to the internet here are photos of the parts inventory pages: random manual image: features page: the pieces: the short answer is you get lots and lots of little pieces in white, gray and black plus some big pieces in white, gray and black. mixed in the set is a fair amount of oddball pieces like minifig tools, jedi hood and trans yellow dome. fear not, despite the eclectic collection of parts, it all comes together in the end (not unlike a typical day at work for me…) it is probably worth noting again that there is a heavy amount of technic parts and pieces here. the build: the build starts off with a rather in-depth build of the stand in which general grievous stands on. once you think you are done, you keep adding on to this (rather solid) base. i bet there are 250 pieces just in the base alone! it is quite nice when you get done with it though and really adds to the display. i’m glad lego didn’t skimp on the base as it completes the model. once you get through all that, the rest of the build is a real thumb-bruiser. anyone who has built a decent size technic set knows the feeling of your thumbs being sore when you are done. you get the same effect here. it is actually a fun build and i really liked seeing how the designers used all the various pieces to recreate a fairly accurate model of grievous. the model is built from the ground up as seen in a few of the progress shots: here is what is left over: the design: the design is quite good and is very accurate. some might be disappointed that since this is a technic set we don’t have more articulation in the shoulders and have the ability to separate two arms into four as seen in the movie. however, it would seem the real intent is for display and not functionality. here is a shot of the torso and the detail involved: here are grievous’ organs: careful observers will note that my model is lacking two “arrow” stickers from the two white chest pieces. i failed to see these on the sticker sheet and only grabbed the large grievous sticker. so, note that there are actually three stickers and not one. chest protector and respirator: head and arms: i was a little disappointed that we got two yellow blades and no green blades on the lightsabers. note how all the lightsabers have different hilts which is a nice touch: here are some shots of the completed model with a few other sets shown for scale. he is actually pretty tall: you have the option to remove the top two arms and put in shoulder plates if you so desire: detail on the back: overall thoughts: i’ve been saying for a few years that we should have a technic grievous set and we finally got one. designed more as a model and not a fully functional swooshable figure, grievous is a tad flimsy. you won’t want him to veer too far off his massive and sturdy base. it would have been nice to have is cape with him (like the technic vader set). i do like the size of the model and it is impressive to look at. lego star wars system fans will likely want to think twice before purchasing but technic and ucs fans should be satisfied. final rating: 75% build 8/10 (very good – fun, relatively quick build. technic fans will be more pleased than others.) design 8/10 (very good – some nice snot and technic techniques. a bit flimsy but the base is kind of cool.) parts 7/10 (a mixed bag of stuff. probably can’t get too many diverse builds from this except for other robot type models.) price 7/10 (just ok – a bit stiff at $90 usd for a nice display model with limited functionality.) as always, let’s hear your thoughts and feedback.

1 thanks for that fine review, dunamis. i really like that set.... gg´s an interesting and well designed movie character and that lego version of him´s indeed well done and very detailed. and although i would wish for a some more functional (or playable ) feature of move- and even splitable arms i guess it´s an already very cool ucs version of that grumpy old kaleesh....

0 welcomestranger, on may 17 2008, 06:14 am, said: luckily for me i have access to the internet to read this review in the first place lol, i was wondering if anyone would get my lame attempt at humor

1 this is a very nice, i never gotten to chance to own or buy one of the sw big sets. i'm definitely getting these one.

0 nice review i hope to get this set for my birthday!

1 hi all again. another one of todays special deliveries. i think personally this set is great. mars mission is really finding it's feet. 7646 etx alien infiltrator

1 thanks for the sweet review, brickbitz! that really is a neat little set, that walker is fantastic, most likely the best part of the set. though the alien craft does also look neat, and it's cool how it can fold down into aa walker. or rather, a sentry turret, seeing as it can't really move while in that mode. still, it's nice. my favourite part is the mini mining robot though. so cute! ~peace

0 thanks for the review!! that makes me wanting this set even more!!

0 thanks for the review brickbitz i don't normally come into the space forum but this set it tempting me, on the basis of you review i think i might aquire one at some point.

1 excellent review as usual, brickbitz. i really love this set. the moonwalker is amazing, and the alien craft is really nice too. i might get this someday...

0 my first impression upon seeing this set was "no thanks", but now i'm warming up to it. still, i'll skip it if it interferes with my hypersonic operations aircraft fund. :p

0 that's a great review for your first one. i think the jet pack if far to bulky it could do with some minimising but that’s life. i assume that you can’t fit a standard hand in the chainsaw arms are the hole would be to large but would you be so good as to confirm this for me? overall i quite like the jet ski and the ability to lower the arms to much doesn’t both me. how much was it just so i can get an idea of the price? finally thanks for posting this review so quickly.

1 this is much much much more promising than the 2008 batman set for $10.00. the vehicle looks like someone took time to design it, but the batman one looks like . lego dear lego, where is the quality for batman??!?! i really like the new cyborg arm, and the propellers on that thing : ), it is a really promising line although i would get rid of all those bionicle pieces.

0 thanks for the review. i'm looking forward to some of the new parts and ideas in this line. the figures look great. the actual sets themselves don't really appeal though.

0 this set looks wicked! thanks very much for the sweet review oky wan! the pics are perfect, great quality and the perfect size, well done! this sets got everything, a new hairpiece, tank treads, a gem, well, i could go on but you can all see everything from the great pics. thanks again oky! this is one set i'll definately be getting! ~peace

0 omg omg omg. im coming to the us in just under two weeks, really hope i see them somewhere! does anyone know what ny times square toys r us is like for new sets?

0 thanks for a very good review! agent line seems better all the time... looking forward in seeing review on mission 2 gold chase (and new pictures of the jet) really soon!

0 hmm, interesting set. great review! i might pick this one up for the wonderful parts. ~vbbn~

1 what a lovely set, thanks for that fine review, oky wan kenobi! the mfs´re wonderful, that helipack looks solid and well done and i especially like the slightly asymmetrical design of the neat snowmobile. a very playable little set for sure, and the most interesting part´s for sure that new cool mf arm....

0 thank you.

0 thanks for the review! do i see a little indy hint on that map? oh and btw., the map looks like it actually is printed am i right?

1 mmm this set looks amazing. lovely pieces. and i actually like the minifig faces. that jaw helmet is cool aswel . are those stickers on the crocodile heads or is it printed?

1 thanks for the review, this set is wonderful! u love the two dark green crocodiles and awesome minifigs, especially break jaw that bike is awesome and the base, like all agents sets, comes with great pieces, like the barbed wire, orange anything, leafy pieces and brown log pieces. thanks for the review, i'll definitely get this one! batbrick away!

1 wow, great review for a really great looking set. the pieces, like the minifigs and crocs are very nice, but that map is reeaally cool for an aztec/maya/inca fan (like me)! i will definately buy this set when it is available in england. grevious, on may 21 2008, 10:04 pm, said: btw, anyone else notice the possibly accidental reference to alpha team? agent charge is back, it looks! yeah, i thought that. then i thought, "nah, he looks different", but i remember that the characters in alpha team did change their looks a lot throughout the years (being spies and that). edited by shoc, 26 may 2008 - 10:37 am.

1 i always joked that our house would have a moat around it with mechanical alligators. now i can build the house in lego! thanks sirnadroj for the review and pictures. this is definitely my favorite agents set.

1 thanks for the review. i the bike and the bad guy's helmet.

0 why do all of the reviews that we have for agents sets have the agents getting hurt? is this a new trend? plus unibrow man doesn't have a unibrow. his eyebrows are really close together and bushy!

-1 agentrick57, on may 23 2008, 09:17 am, said: why do all of the reviews that we have for agents sets have the agents getting hurt? is this a new trend? no, it's an old trend. and it's because villains are cooler. actually, it could be long-simmering resentment towards the not-highly-regarded alpha team/ dino attack sets bubbling forth. see dr lucky's hilarious post here for an example of what i mean... i'm sure the new agents will learn to fight back soon

0 very nice review riddler!

0 thanks for the review... ill probably get one copy of this set. mr. freeze and his cart look neat. i dont like the huge wing on the back of batman's buggy so ill probably mod that out.

1 grevious, on may 23 2008, 09:54 am, said: indead. the only reason to get this set is if you couldn't afford the batcave back in 2006 and want a mr. freeze fig for a cheap price. and anyone who did get that kit really have no reason whatsoever to get this. i'll get it, i admit the vehicles are extremely poorly designed, i mean really poorly designed, but the mr.freeze fig is fantastic, and i would buy two of this set just for him, as his head and gear are very useful for mocing. it also comes with some nice pieces, like the grappling hook, little wheels, exhaust pieces and such. still, a pretty bad set build wise, but it has atleast inspired me to make my own batbuggy thanks for the review theriddler, appreciated. batbrick away!

-1 like many others, i'll buy this just for mr f, quickly recycle the parts, and pretend this set never existed. the flame detail is indeed terrible. the bat is back - and he's flatulent! this third bat-wave isn't really doing anything for me. i'll get the penguin set as well for pretty much the same reason - although the sub on that is pretty cool - but skip the others. maybe batbrick can make us all nice alt-mocs to improve these sets... thanks for the review though!

1 thanks for the review ???theriddler???. this is a neat little set, a bit overpriced in my opinion, but for a new suited batman and a mr freeze fig in a set other than one of the most expensive bat-sets released, it's worth my money. ~peace

1 that's a great set. it'd be even better if it were sold as two separate little cars. they remind me of the dozens of little lego cart vehicles i got as a kid. those were always fun, quick builds that resulted in lots of cool play. i think this set is aimed more at kids and, in that respect, it's a pure winner. it doesn't hurt that you can get freeze and the newly designed batman both in this set for a reasonable price.

0 thanks the penguin, and more pics on monday!

0 the pics as promised. extra part:

1 can't wait for the review the car is ly!!!

1 i love it ! fun, playable, cool looking, and killer minifigs! sweet!

1 thanks for the review deino! i love going back through the old "agents" thread just to see how wrong we were about these awesome sets! i actually really like the gate, those portcullis pieces people may know i always find nice uses for, and i really, really, really want that awesome sound brick. the figs are a bit disappointing in numbers, but agent chase is very cool, generic henchman are great, and spy clops is one of my favourite minifigs ever! the helicopter is wonderful too, i love that it is customised for spy clops to winch him down. the colours as usual for these sets are fantastic, the dark blue, orange and chrome silver! the car is the best though, i love all the functions. how does the ejector seat work though? batbrick away!

0 deinonychus, on may 23 2008, 09:12 pm, said: the rear has two cones sticking out. i'd like to think they're smoke nozzles or oil-slick sprayers. according to page 14 of my brickmaster magazine, the left cone is for smoke screen and the right cone is for oil slick.

0 es.jpg 47.94k 110 downloads the ejector seat a long technic axle runs the length of the front of the car. it comes in to the seat area here and nests into the gray joint which is attached to the small gray technic beam. the beam is attached to the ejector seat (bottom white 3x2 plate) with a technic pin. the seat, in turn, is attached to the side of the car with a technic pin. the result is, when the axle is pushed forward, the gray joint and beam tilt the seat and "eject" a minifig. after about 20 shots the minifig only went outside of the car 3 times...the rest of the time he just bounced around the inside of the car. so they get an a for effort, but an f for execution

1 thanks deinonychus for another great review. i must say i do look forward to people uploading reviews of new sets, it really helps me decide if i want it or not. if it's a good set (imo) then it adds to the excitement of picking up one myself! this, i must say, is one of those sets! the only concern for me, like alot of others, is the price. i will just have to wait and see and continue to look at these photo's deinonychus has provided for us!! so much for thinking the agent line was going to be weak! i wonder if the exoforce style code brick number plate is a hint from tlc as to what will replace exoforce at the end of this year? jb

1 thanks for the great review! i'm really liking these agents sets the more i see them. the car seems to have alot of features. its to bad the the ejection seat doesn't work as well as one would hope. oh well. makes me want the big rig even more now!

1 great review and fantastic pics, deinonychus. and a big thank you to whoever pointed out that you could use the sound brick for arkham asylum, my addled brain didn't make the connection. the car is just beautiful, and with a good use for the most expensive part of the gate, this is on my wish list for sure, just have to see how much cash is left over after buying the new death star in a month or two. agents has to be the biggest surprise from lego for ages, without any pics it sounded so-so, but they've done a brilliant job with it, love those metallic coloured pieces!

1 great w, im totaly gonna buy this set

1 thanks for the review whitefang. i love these sets, and i wish they were available in nz. so far, it seems they may never come here... but i can sit and hope. i like the look of them after your make-over, a real skeleton army there! did you say you've bought 12! tht's lots of skelies. are you planning a big moc or something?

-1 whitefang, on may 25 2008, 06:14 am, said: for a single battlepack like this, with an attractive reasonable price. you obtained a series of 5 skeleton mini-figs with tons and tons of useful castle accessories. to me, it's a very very great buy, and it's a must to stock up for my army building! i wish these battlepacks had a reasonable price click here to see the canadian price of these battlepacks, 18 dollars thats 6 dollars more than the starwars battlepack yet you get the same amount of lego (or less then a starwars battlepack). how the megablok does lego price its items . i'm gonna have to skip this set, and a few others that i wanted because of this bloody outrageous. back on topic thanks for the detailed review, whitefang i also like your little changes to the set they really make this set look better.

1 thanks, whitefang! castle battle packs.... simply wonderful! finally a dream came true, well done tlc!

1 thanks for the review whitefang! your additions look great, i like your mace much better than the use of a small technic cog, your looks much sturdier. and that helmet looks really great on skellie soldiers, i never thought to use that before. very cool indeed! ~peace

0 for those of you who buy so many of this and the other battle pack with crownies, what do you do with all of them? is this simply to create a large-scale army, or do you plan to build large castle scenes with all the figs. i'd love to see some pictures (on the "share your castle army" thread).

-1 i don't think these new skeletons do it for me, but thanks for a good review

1 great review for a great set! man i loved the adventurers although the new indy sets are good they will never match up to johnny thunder! most of all no stickers great review!

1 i've always wanted this set, ever since it came out in '99. i have never seen it close up (unless you count driving over it in lego racers 2), so thanks for the pictures and the great review. voltio, on may 26 2008, 04:43 am, said: el conde: "you are too beautiful a woman to be wandering alone in the jungle, miss storm. please, allow me to accompany you." gail storm: "i'm with johnny, and i have a cutlass." el conde: "i'll be on my way." hehe.

1 a real classic, thanks for that nice and funny review, voltio! a well designed set, very playable with a lot of nifty traps, a very good use of that raised baseplate and really nice crafts. the mf characters´re excellent too! and although the color scheme´s great and original, especially with all these neat printed pieces, it´s perhaps the only part of that set that looks a little out of date today.... nevertheless, the set´s plain charming and shows clearly that tlc don´t need licenses to do some distinct adventurer sets.

1 great review. i saw the instructions of this set, but never atracted me until now a great set an a excelente review.

1 great review! i just barly missed the jungle series, growing up with half a year of jungle and mainly orient expedition and dino island. i like egypt more, but this set (despite the 4x4 palm tree) is practically perfect. i love the detail and vibrant colours. gotta say, i've got a thing for pippin reed myself. by the way, what does "vhtf" mean? edited by sdpirate, 28 may 2008 - 01:06 am.

1 vhtf= very hard to find. to answer some earlier replies... no, there are no stickers in this set. while some adventurers sets of the era had stickers (the 5956 zeppelin had tons), all of the interesting mesoamerican designs from this set are printed. also, simonwillems was correct; my mechanic is missing his hat, which should be a black kepi. they're extremely expensive on bl, though (proving once again that this set has some awesome parts), so i ordered a replacement from lego. it's in the mail and should come soon.

1 i absolutly love this set. this is in my opinion the best adventurers set. it has it all; the falling bridge, the falling skeleton, the spear trap, and the classic trapdoor. it is a must-have set. thanks for providing such a nice review.

1 thanks for the awesome review voltio. el conde is the man!

1 i got this as a birthday gift when i turned 7 years old or so. i can still remember the big box with the brown bridge in its display! so many hours of fun. one of the most amazing sets i own. a lot of play value. a true classic!

1 haha, i love seeing reviews where sigfigs and minifigures from the set present the set! i'm looking foward your next reviews! :d

0 so i just piced up a new digital camera and i thought what better way to try it than doing a review of my newest set. the new 7738 coast guard helicopter! itsmy first review, so go easy on me! lets start off with the small stuff. first the mini figs. you get 4 figs total. two helicopter pilots, a diver and a civilan to rescue. the torso's are nothing new on the pilot and diver. same ones as in the last coast guard line. but i like the colors alot better in this coast guard line than the previous generation. the yellow and blue really work well together and the coloring on the badge looks great! the civilian looks to be just a dock worker with an overall torso and a beenie. the diver has nice vented helmet and a pair of flippers that suits his duty perfect! next we have an absolute work of lego art. the rescue raft! the orange flaps can be moved back for easy entry to the raft, as well as the white "support" beams with the caution tape. i put support in perenthaces cause they really don't support anything. just there to fill in the gaps. at the top of the raft is a red locator beacon, ccommunications antenna, and a cargo loop for lifting the raft. lets move on to the interior of the raft. not much here. but you can see the techinc beam that attaches to the top loop,and to the floor of the raft. so far this has proven to be very sturdy and has supported the full weight of the raft quite well. you can also see the white box that holds the equipment of the raft. here you can see the life saver tube. here's a shot with our dock worker peaking out the side. the raft says max ocupants 4, but with the storage box, that might be a tight fit. now lets move on to the helicopter! in my opinion this is one of the best helicopters tlc has come out with to date. i really felt they captured the look and proportions of a real coast guard helicopter. it uses a lower hull and tail section of the new airliner, and cargo airplane. it really seems to work well with this application. the engines have good detail using new "cheese graders" as vents, as well as the new engine stacks that come in the new speed racer sets. the rotors also appear to be new as well. lets move on to the cockpit. we have two seats for our pilots with a sticker sheet for intruments on a flat 4 wide plate. there's also an antena being used as a flight stick. another shot with our pilots at the helm. now lets moveon to the high lihgt of this heavy lifting machine. the med bay, and lifting winch. http://www.brickshel...icopter_020.jpg here you can see the winch arm at rest, along with the medical strechter. the bad part is that the med. strechter doesn't include the ussually included fold away wheels. here's a shot with the winch arm extened ready for rescue! in the second shot you can see the drum that the wire coils up in. it coils up via a recently new power functions "pull" back motor. to operate, just pull out the winch cable, hook on your load, and presse this orange button on the side... the bad part of the new power functions winch is that although its very smooth in its operation, its not very strong. it will only lift the raft a couple inches before it runs out of torque. it also has a tendency to want to pull the crane arm backin while its lifting. it doesn't matter if its a light load, or heavy load. the bay doors open on both sides for easy postioning of the figures and accses to the strechter. here we have our diver looking over his rescue-e. nice and roomy if you don't mind a crane arm being in your way!! at $39.99 and a peice count of 445, i felt this set was a great good considering what your getting. the raft construction is very creative and is probbly the highlight of the set by itself. the helicopter is probbly one of the best, if not the best helicopter tlc has ever came out with if you can get over its size. in a scale of one to five.... price- peice count- playability- design- overall- .5 i would have given it a full 5 out of five, but since the winch can't pull the raft all the way, it didn't fell it right. even with this minor flaw, i still highly recomend this set!

1 nice review. a must have for my city collection.

1 great review! this does look like an excellent set; great chopper!

1 great review! i will get this, but i will wait for a sale. edited by ~vbbn~, 28 may 2008 - 10:54 pm.

1 thank you for that fine review of a really excellent set, 5150 lego. i never saw a little 'juniorization' done that good before!

0 thanks everyone for the nice coments! its nice to finaly have a camera that can take some decent photos! makes doing reviews much more enjoyable! klaus-dieter, on may 28 2008, 09:17 pm, said: thank you very much for the nice review, 5150 lego! the helicopter is - apart from that it is very, very big and that it does not include any interior - a very nice set . the most i like the life raft becuase it is simply . nevertheless i don't know if i buy it (probably not) - but it's very nice! two questions : -where can you fasten the stretcher on to haul it up and down? -is the motor working with batteries? klaus-dieter there is no real way to lift up the stretcher. due to the crane arm being in the way there really isn't any room for any kind oflifting straps. the set does include a 1x2 plate with a hinge for the diver to stand on so at least he can hold on to someone, the crane lifts them up and then he can put them in the strechter. thats my guess at least. as far as the motor, i don't believe it uses bateries since you pull out the motor, and all the button does is recoil the winch line back in. i have to say it does a very good job of that, and is very smooth. (as long as you don't have anything to heavy) one detail i forgot to meation is the shark. its nothing new, just the basic shark lego has had around for nealy 2 decades, but it was a detail nothing less.

-1 i could tell from the pictures that a lot (maybe all) the designs on the raft were stickers. in the whole set are there any printed parts besides the torsos or is it all stickers?

0 that's a very nice set. i'm having my doubts about getting it though still. the overall shape and size of the helicopter remind me of the real-life ch-53 military cargo helicopter. a very nice review. you've got the photography down very well i feel. perhaps a bit of nitpicking but at the end where you assign a rating, if you do a rating with faces (which is fine by me) you may want to seperate the faces by a line. otherwise it may become too crowded to the eye.

-1 i'm rather fond of helicopters and have built many different types. this doesn't really remind me of any particular model, other than perhaps an eh. 101 merlin and even that resemblance is very superficial. just for the record: this is a sikorsky sea king and this is a sikorsky mh-53 (a derivation of the ch-53). the only resemblance i see with the former is the colour scheme and with the latter the fact that it's got a fat rear-end, sponsons and six blades. it doesn't matter though, because i really like it. the colour scheme is great, the shape is nice, it's got quite a bit of detail and i just have to get my hands on the cockpit window and those new rotor blades. when i first saw the large aircraft pieces a few years ago i figured they were very much single-use parts, but the tail end doesn't look too bad. pretty clever. i like the raft too. it really does look like the real deal. that the helicopter can't lift it really isn't an issue, because in real life they wouldn't lift the raft either. they'd use the rescue hoist to lift the occupants of the raft into the helicopter one by one (or perhaps in pairs). imagine a storm with a helicopter hovering over tall waves with a big fat raft strung from a cable underneath it. the raft would catch a lot of wind and flop around quite a bit, causing it to loose all its occupants and also yanking the helicopter around, possibly causing the pilot to loose control and crash. bad idea! cheers, ralph edited by ralph_s, 30 may 2008 - 11:09 pm.

1 i will certainly add this one to my collection, i already own every other rescue helicopter and i have a feeling this will be the best. just love how its completely enclosed, thanks for the review.

1 this looks like the best of the new bat sets. it was also in the movie; don't know why they didn't make it sooner.

0 thanks for the review riddler. your pics are a bit blurry though, if you want them a bit better you should sit your camera on a hard surface so you don't wobble it as much i love the tumbler, though it is quite massive, but either way i'll be glad to get it. the figs in my opinion are really bad, joker should atleast have a different suit. oh well, it's worth it for that awesome van, and instance where the stickers are totally worth it. thanks again! batbrick away!

0 thanks all, but so little replies , but my hq is sent now, i'll hope and think the set wil be arived tomorow! who want's the second riddle?

1 great looking set, loved the review, pictures were good... sometimes blury but i think i will pick this up after i get the rest of the kotcs sets. riddler a tip i learned in photoclass is to take a breath in and hold it while pushing the shutter so you don't accidentally move while breathing. i thought it was silly, but it does work. again great review! looking forward to more...

0 i am gonna have to pick this up, what a grand representation of the tumbler and it would be my first joker minifigure. my lego bat-life is looking up! )tnr(

1 nice review m8. shame that most of the pictures are blurry but nonetheless. just wanted to say that out of all my lego sets, this one, 7888 is the best. the tumbler is so cool once it is put together! those four huge wheels at the back make it quite unique! if you do not have this set i highly recomend it. edited by 4olic, 30 august 2009 - 02:59 pm.

1 thank you for clearing that up i felt that it was ok to review an old topic, as stated, rather than just go ahead and start a new one. a shame that this set, as all other batman sets, have gone up so highly in value but still all things considering (general after market lego price hikes) it is still a wonderfull set even with its market value today (that is if you can ignore the mrsp).

0 cp5670, on may 28 2008, 08:52 pm, said: first time i've heard of that. what are they going to do for the train couplings? new couplings are going to be available soon. there is a thread with pictures of the new couplings here.

1 joebot, on may 28 2008, 07:31 pm, said: kinda sad to think that with tlc's recent ban on magnets in their products since when is that? the new train couplings have magnets, only with a special casing. anyways, m:tron is one of the greatest space factions, with mega core magnetiser as my favourite set of these guys (even though i do not own it ). the only thing that bothers me is the lack of (reachable) controls for the minifigs to drive their vehicles (but iirc it is the same with a lot of other space-sets as well)

0 thanks for the review, maybe i can pick one off ebay.

0 sinner, on may 29 2008, 05:20 pm, said: no, but we (especially imperialshadows) are working on new indexes. supposedly the space one was my job... okay, just don't forget this when it goes up, i like self promotion. i have about 10 old space sets coming in from ebay and gonna review them soon as well. so that should be some good additions to the index when it goes up! thanks!

1 i really enjoyed the nostalgia review of the m-tron mega core magnetizer. this was the first wave of space lego i didnt get when i was a kid, though i remember looking at this set in the shops. i stopped with blacktron1 and space police. i look forward to more reviews once your ebay stuff arrives cheers isc

0 i've heard that the alien moon stalker was called the thunderfoot launcher somewhere. ah, yes. here. http://news.lugnet.c...n=51449&t=i&v=a edited by iron moose, 30 may 2008 - 02:05 am.

1 this super set contains many of the city sets you can get for your mini city hospital. the smallest set is the 7902 car with a doctor. i thought it looked a bit too slow. here is a car you can build with the same bricks. the instruction manual for the ambulance does contain a picture of an alternate model, but it is actually quite hard to build something significantly different. this sets lacks some snot-bricks, so i had to be a little more creative and came up with this ambulance. it is more a hearse than an ambulance. the helicopter has a lot of slopes, so i built a speed boat for those special emergencies. unlike the first two sets, i used far from all the bricks in this. this set does really have some great parts. the brickshelf gallery with some more pictures. is anyone up to the challenge and build some alternate models of the last set in the super pack - the hospital?

0 thank you very much asuka, but i get the hint. last.

0 why must you taunt us?! just kidding, can't wait for the review and to see a detailed view of ms. harley quinn! ryan

0 why!?

1 i bought this set too, didn't get a chance to put it together yet. but the harley fig is awesome! anyway, looking forward to your review.

0 thanks all, i hope my hq wil arive today, and deinonychus i don't wanna do stupid to you but must i do also a review of the hq set, i want to do that also a review of hq without the blurry pics. who want's the second riddle?

1 this set looks really fun! the figs are sweet, can't wait to see that jester in the flesh. of course, the jester i'm talking about is the castle one but that doesn't mean harley isn't a sweet fig! thanks for that awesome review, deinonychus! ~peace

1 thanks for the review deinonychus! this is an awesome set, it may just be my first batman set

1 yay, another technic shooter!! whew, i need a spare one in case the 14,348 other ones that i have all happen to break. seriously, do lego set designers get some sort of bonus for incorporating catapults, technic shooters, and / or flick-fire missiles??? anyway, thanks for the review. looks like a cute set.

1 thanks for the review! i love this set, i didn't think it was much at first either, but i really love it. another cheaper robin and penguin is great, and those nifty mini penguins are awesome. the spare pieces are even nice! i love robin's little scuba jet, those green engines are very nice and i love it compactness. penguin's sub is even better, at first i was annoyed at getting two subs but now i realise it means i can have a fleet of them i'll be sure to mod over those cannons though, but the details are very slick. thanks again. batbrick away!

1 thanks for the great review, brickadier general! the sub looks very nice, and i like the idea of a raising periscope (did the batcave sub have that feature?) and the details on the sub look very nice. the inclusion of the penguin, robin and two of those great brick-built penguins really confirms that i'll be getting this, considering that i didn't purchase the batcave. however, i am rather dissapointed that this set is so similar to the vehicles of penguin and robinin repectively in the batcave set. i feel that it only really caters to those who havn't bought the set, and i would've much appreciated different vehicles. overall, a very nice set, perhaps the best of the 2008 wave, despite it's lack of originality. thank you very much for the review bg

1 set: 8635 - agents - mobile command center pieces: 1154 price: $us89.99 those dedicated agents. they've fought chainsaw-armed villains, battled radio-controlled cyborg crocs, chased pallets of badly-stored golden loot and wrestled killer sharks with vicious, toothy grins. finally they've caught the notorious dr inferno and imprisoned him in their cavernous mobile command center. but dr inferno won't go down without a fight! can the agents stop the evil dr 'disco' inferno fleeing? will spy clops laser gun burn through the door in time, or will dr inferno simply use the lovely agent trace's enormous ponytail as an escape ladder to freedom? more importantly, will there be a riot in the streets of lego city as afols go apopletic at the thought of a 12 wide truck roaring through their ordered town layouts? stay tuned! part 1: the box, instructions, parts as the largest of the agents sets (so far), the box is easily the biggest. trainee agents, examine the following three pics and see if you notice anything odd. box front: box back: box middle: spot it? that's right. the printed cardboard which has supposed to be the bottom half of the fold out middle section is on the back, slicing the ultra-large set image which would form the foldout in half . the way the cardboard is printed as one piece before it's folded i think this would be very hard to do 'accidentally' so suspect a major stuff-up somewhere along the production line. i bought this set off bricklink so would be very interested if anyone in the states who has seen these boxes actually on the shelves can tell me if this is common or rare. basically i want to know if i should be annoyed that the bricklink seller didn't list this in the set description, or are they all like this? the instructions come in 4 booklets. the parts list comes in at 5 pages, which is a lot even at half-size pages ! large images of the parts inventory are in this folderwhen moderated for anyone interested. here's also some cute agents-type artwork at the end of one of the books. instructions show piece call-outs and are divided into sections according to numbered bags. as you'd expect for a set with 1100+ parts, this baby comes with a lot of bags. it's a treasure trove of dark blue. as well as the obvious large slopes and wall panels which make up the body and the roof, there is a wealth of smaller navy blue pieces as well - small 1x1 bricks, 2x2 bricks, 1x1 plates, 2x2 tiles, heaps of 2x plates, some slopes, 22x cheese pieces... basically anyone wanting a lot of dark blue should think about this set. the roof panels alone, for example, could provide a dark blue sea for a modernised pirate moc. 2 dsss (dreaded sticker sheets). quelle surprise - stickers! the grey parts of the stickers here are metallic silver ink, which is a nice touch. actually, as sticker sheets go, they're not too bad. fairly subtle for the most part and the navy blue actually matches the bricks themselves. however, after looking at the sticker sheets i thought i was missing something. what about the pieces used for the projection screens showing dr inferno and the sharks - why weren't they on the sticker sheets? there must be another one! frantically i checked and rechecked the box and flipped through all the instruction manuals to find the elusive 3rd sheet. where was it? ten minutes later i noticed something which had honestly never occured to me - there were actual printed pieces in this set! so obvious and yet so unthinkable. it's horrifying how years and years of exoforce and speed racer set releases can mentally condition people's thought processes. tut tut, lego. what have you reduced us to? here they are, folks - actual printed pieces. (yes, i do believe this news deserves the caps.) i also noticed this nifty modification of the usual 2x3 cupboard - you can now fit drawers in it! very clever. this may have been around in belville sets for years for all i know, but it's new to me. the drawers slide in and out very well and the top one sits on slight indentations in the middle of the cupboard. part 2: the figs! our trusty agents - charge, chase, trace and fuse. (high powered agents don't have time for names of more than one syllable - that's why the bad guys always lose ). chase and fuse have the mutt hair in black and dark orange. the lovely agent trace has an exquisite new hairpiece in dark brown, perfect for 'rapunzel' themed mocs. as you can see, her ponytail is loooong. makes it hard to sit down, the poor girl. i feel sorry for all these female figs with such intricate hairstyles that they can never relax in an ordinary lego chair. however, at least she has two breasts unlike the recent harley quinn fig. compensation indeed. seriously though, it's great that there's a separate torso print for the female character and this attention to detail is typical of the set as a whole. three of the agents have reversable heads - nice touch with the headsets and i like the id cards on their pants. obviously the agents security system is based on some kind of crotch measuring device. this would make sense considering the conspicuous bulges in the pants of dr inferno's men (see the other agents set reviews.) the villains - spy clops, dr inferno, gold tooth. dr inferno's hair in all it's glory. this is a great piece, although the orange colouring is a little rough on the front. it's so 3d, it deserves a back and side view (and indeed eb thread) all of its own. as mentioned elsewhere, this is different plastic to the normal minifig hair, but it doesn't quite feel as soft as the exo-force hair. it doesn't fall off as much, anyway. the figs get 10/10 from me. awesome hairpieces in great colours for the agents and a sleek navy blue/ neon green uniform. the villains' faces are great and they are all very distinctive. the attention to detail is outstanding and it's great to see a lego in-house theme with characters as memorable and cool as figs from the licensed themes . part 3: the build the build is divided into three stages - the small vehicles, the front of the truck, and the massive command center section. (a) small vehicles first up, all the small vehicles. we have a small flyer, 2 buggies, jet ski, and a speed boat - all in glorious navy blue with little bits of silver detailing. top view. these vehicles are all simple, small and well-designed. probably the weakest is the flyer, only because the cockpit looks a little large. in fact, the small flyer is probably the weakest element of 8365 overall, which tells you how good the set itself is! in various threads here, this set has been heavily criticised for being way out of proportion. there's a reason for that, as we shall come to. however, the existence of these small sets should appease some people. with the new coast guard sets, for example, all of these save the flyer wouldn't look out of place on a city beach with a little modding. here's an example - agents beach party! (spongebob couldn't help but crash.) the villains only have one small vehicle, but they've been well-served in the smaller sets, and this one is a unique and clever design. i love the triangular shape and the simple but clever technique of making the arch slopes meet up around the propellers. it's sort of insectile in black and orange, and looks very different from the usual assortment of helicopters etc. (b) truck front this thing is a beast! seriously, look at it. it's chunky and mean looking. you don't want to mess with this baby. the build is really nice. like a lot of star wars vehicles, it's all based on technic beams pinned together. unlike a lot of mars mission sets, underneath isn't all technic beams with some plates slapped on like a facade. the majority is a lot of plates and bricks which all fit together solidly. you can see from the detailing of 'cheese grater' slopes and silver pieces on the front how effort has been made to give this vehicle a distinct feel different to other lego sets. sure, the silver slope mirrors might be a bit too much for some, but this baby is all about attitude. you can imagine it roaring down the road en route to dr inferno's diabolical lair! after all, these sets are 'agents' sets - nobody said they were *secret* agents (c ) command center - whole assembly here's a view of the whole thing assembled - inside and cool details to follow at the end. it's kind of hard to show here as it is extreeeeemely long. this is indeed a big set. the build for the trailer part of the command center is fun and very satisfying. yes, there are large pieces but there is also a huge amount of detail. it is also solid as a rock. i remember being annoyed building the big ferrari truck a few years ago - everytime you looked at it, an 8 x 16 plate fell off. the mobile command center is solid - even with the hinged roof and special features, it is not delicate at all. kudos to the designers, again as it is mainly a brick build rather than a technic one. i also like how the command center part connects to the cabin - it's not a special piece at all, just a technic axle going through two circle plates, but it works and it's solid. (please note i've been selective about which stickers i've applied during the build.) top view: the rear: here's an example of why i like the build: (a) the designers have enough sense to put a ladder so a minifig can climb up to the interior when the command center is open (b) notice that although the ladder clips at the top, there is an *extra* clip there in the middle purely to hold it in place so it doesn't flap around and holds firm. i don't know if most designers would even think to put a ladder there let alone go the extra mile and put a mechanism to hold it in place. pure class. oh, and notice the greebly detail stuff to the right there too. the other side. this is probably the other weak part of the build - the bricky gaps at the top where the hinge to open the roof sits. it's a little gappy but the set is so big you don't really notice. (d) and now for the fun stuff - inside and neat details! ok, so we've built the thing. it's big. it's blue. the top of the trailer itself would make a good warehouse moc for a harbour layout. but what about inside? is it any good? what about all those small vehicles from the start of the review? where do they go? well, i'm glad you asked. because the solution is superb. the small flyer folds slightly and slides into place here: lift off the roof and you're away! the large buggy and the speedboat go under here: the jetski slides out of the rear here, attached to its own little platform: and the small buggy goes inside the main cabin. there's even a crane so you can lift it down. so now we know why this set is so large! to fit everything in! it's amazing that this functionality doesn't affect the aesthetics of the set as a whole. but we still haven't finished on the details. the front section has a very easy-to-swing-open roof section and missiles: there's also a command section underneath the bit where the flyer lifts out: and now for the interior. i have to say i really like this space. not only is it packed with great stuff, there's also enough room for minifigs to move around. i hate bases where the figs only have about 2 studs to actually stand and walk. aquabase invasion is a nice set, for example, but the actual functional space inside the base is teensy. claustrophobia! you know within a week they'd be fighting to toss each other out of the airlock. no such problems for these suave agents, who have plenty of legroom *and* the ability to launch missiles from their ceiling. the whole of the interior: zooming in: moving from left to right. first off, the medicine cabinet. looks like someone's been leaving secret mission dossiers lying around. the projector area for mission briefings. dr inferno recently changed his hair colour from purple to orange, it seems. why are all these minifigs so obsessed with their hair? the projector folds down when the trailer is open. push the button and the light glows on. now dr inferno's hair is orange again! this is one of my favourite parts of the set. it works a charm. the batteries for these lightbricks can also be replaced - instructions are in the manual. agent charge considers shark-fin soup for dinner. did i mention these projection panels are printed? the detail is very fine too. the tool section. laptops sit in the middle compartment. you get some flippers, yellow scuba tank and various implements. i'm so impressed that the helmet is pearl silver with a different coloured visor too - there's so much variation in the parts in this set, you don't get the sense the designers are using the same thing over and over to save money. it all feels luxe and top-of-the-line, just like the command center itself. two laptops - yay! the aforementioned rooftop missiles: the dr inferno cage. nasty electric shocks! bzzt! (you can see my reviewing skills are burning out now - sentences.... truncated...) another example of detail - nowhere else in the set is a 1x1 transgreen tile used - they could have used a 1x1 trans green cheese wedge piece as there are others in the set, but they didn't. how does dr i get out? flick that lever on the right hand exterior and the door pops open. spy clops the loyal minion awaits his master on the other side. and there we have it. take a bow, guys! there's a lot of spare parts. a suspicious amount of dark blue small slopes but i checked the instructions and didn't see anything missing. i have to say, i do like the new policy (since speed racer i think) of including these small slopes as extras. part 4: overall rating if you've made it this far, you've got more stamina than dr inferno's army of cyborg animals themselves! as i said earlier, this set has drawn criticism for the size of the truck. however, large vehicles do exist - i grew up in a wheat farming area and as a kid the size of the lorries that thundered past carrying grain was probably intimidating to me as this monstrous espionage machine is to the good citizens of lego city! on top of that, it *does* contain a plethora of 4-wide vehicles inside ! criticism of this set on the basis of size to me also seems misguided as this is basically a playset - and it is a very good one to boot. as you can probably tell, i love it to pieces and wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone, whether for parts or for play value. check out the parts list in this folderwhen moderated and you can see just how many excellent pieces it contains. a light-up brick, a flood of navy blue, metallic silver bricks - we're spoiled. 8635 is also an enjoyable build, with fantastic figs and top-of-the-line detailing. in a year when i've found city a bit disappointing after the run of great sets in 2006-2007, the agents line has been one of the surprise hits for me and i can't wait to see what the designers come up with next. edited by svelte_corps, 02 june 2008 - 12:46 am.

1 yay! i was waiting for this to be reviewed! can't wait to see how it is, i love the look of this set edit: wow! fast going on the review there svelte-corps, i love the look of the instructions. batbrick away! edited by batbrick, 31 may 2008 - 06:10 am.

1 must. get. two thanks so much, this review has truly shown this set as a brilliant one. even those who hate this theme must admit it is greatly designed. i love the way the mini vehicles fit. i love the light brick. i love the truck front. i love the trailer. i love the missions bay. i love holding cell. i love everything! edit: and i second dragonator's response when i say thankyou svelte-corps for this grand review, you have convinced me utterly to get this! batbrick away! edited by batbrick, 31 may 2008 - 10:49 am.

1 wow. like others have said i was unsure about these when i first heard about them but then looked at the first leaked pics and thought they actually look pretty neat. now i have seen all the reviews i have to have all these sets. at first i was thinking they would be great as parts packs but the more reviews i see the less i want to use them as part packs and just keep them as built (or buy 2 so i can do both !!) can't wait till they hit the shelves in the uk...... thanks for the review

1 wow! great review of what seems to be a great set. i love that ponytail. this looks to be a must have set! (it probably won't stay together for long though...) thanks very much. (i fixed the header for you; that's two you owe me. the other is for making me think that this set was in australia... )

1 thanks for another wonderful review, svelte_corps a very fine set indeed, i absolutely love the way all of the vehicles fit into the command centre, very clever. the projector is really cool, it looks very nice. it's great to see these light and sound bricks in the agents sets. all of the little nooks and crannies in the centre are great too, i really love the amount of detail featured, mixed with all of the playability of this set. the minifigs - as usual - are brilliant, the uniforms look fantastic. dr inferno looks especially great, i love his white suit with hints of orange, and who can forget his hair? i'm really tempted to buy this beast now, though i'm not sure my wallet will forgive me for it. i suppose i'll have to cut back on indy and castle multiples for now... thanks for the truly great review, svelte_corps, nice work

1 wow, excellent review, thanks. that set sure looks fantastic. it's incredible how much features they've managed to pack in while keeping it roomy. i'm really impressed by the quality of the design. tlc is sure getting back on track with great design. ow... 2008 is going to be expensive...

1 wow...i can't believe i thought this line was false...oh crap...sweet! i need to get this!

1 7645 - mt-61 crystal reaper piece count: 600 price: $aud79.95, 49.95 euros (in most countries), 39.99 gbp, usd 49.99 it's happened in the wider world, and it had to happen to lego - yes, the 80s are back. space invaders, holograms, compulsory seat-belt wearing legislation, and the return of classic space. ok, we don't have a fully fledged classic space theme back yet, but if 7645 is the way of the future, i think lego is ready to do it properly. i wasn't a huge fan of last year's mars mission sets and only picked up a few on clearance, but this set is light years (excuse the pun) ahead of 2007's offerings. this mining vehicle is solid, compact, and well-designed. it looks impressive, and even better, it has fantastic power functions operability! behold 7645 - mt-61 crystal reaper! (ps i wasn't joking about the holograms or seat belts.) part 1: box, instructions, dsss (dreaded sticker sheets), parts front of box: back of box: 2 x instruction booklets: dss numero uno - for the reaper dss number two - apologies for the blurry pic but i wanted to capture the sweet shimmy of the metallic holographic background on this sheet the way it catches the light really makes a difference to the small alien craft and makes it look much more interesting from the plain stickers of last year. there's heaps of spare silvery stuff once the stickers are applied for those who use the leftover sticker material for customising. parts bags - 4 numbered with one extra with larger pieces parts everywhere - woo! i know the lego instruction books scold me if i mix bags, but i'm a devil-may-care kind of guy. in your face, tlc. i love mixing all the parts together before i build, it reminds me of my youth when the days were long, anything was possible, and i didn't need strict instructions not to build on grass or poke my eye out with a technic shooter. interesting parts - these may or may not be new, my technic knowledge is not that detailed. the little scoop parts are so cute and have a heap of potential uses. i love 'em. they're like smurf hats at miniland scale. these technic wheel things in orange are also cute. they kind of remind me of marigolds. giant fabuland marigolds! the track pieces - you get 70 of these - here's the section of track for one side - as you can see it's about 52 studs long. these hold together better than the small ones on the hailfire droid/ jungle cutter. part 2: minifigs, small mining transport, alien ship i have to confess - i forgot to take an individual snap of the astronauts . it's the usual bunch though - scaredy face guy, sunglasses in space man and a third one i can't remember. you don't really care, though? you're only interested in the alien commander and his matching arms/ legs combo deal. as brickbitz noted in his review of the smaller set, the glowy eye is just a 1x1 cylinder. the set also comes with 2 normal jellies - one pictured here for size. you'll see what happened to the other one soon enough... the alien craft is nothing exciting, apart from the gorgeous glinting stickers. here's the road safety angle. the commander actually clips onto a 1x2 plate with handle so he can't fall out! then the lime tentacle thing descends on top of him to keep him firmly there, like a baby seat. not very brave for an alien commander, is he? i mean, did darth vader ever use a seatbelt? tssk. with cradle up: this part of the build also includes the small astronaut mining buggy - small and effective. (please note in this build i've applied stickers to everything bar cockpit pieces.) this comes with radio and saw piece. part 3: the reaper! the first part of the build is the detachable shuttle. i really like the retro aesthetic of this with the angled wings and the side hoverpod things. it is much better than the comparable vehicle from 7699. the new flickfire piece is a waste of space - it's fairly limp. i prefer the simple flickfire technic pin to be honest. there's also a very nice little side workshop as you can see. i really like how the control unit is 'plugged' into the wall via 5 1x1 round plates (third pic, it's a bit dark). great detail. [the technic pins on the back are there to connect the power functions battery box. it's odd they're included at this stage of the instructions - maybe the intention was to release it originally with all the necessary motors etc but the price point was too high and they scaled it back] the base. the shuttle sits on that bley technic axle in the middle when the reaper is fully assembled. the little vehicle scoots down the ramp at the rear, which folds up to hold it in place when the reaper is in motion. you can see there's a crystal container here as well - another nice small detail which i found the 2007 sets lacked. there's also an alien here - thankfully not in those horrendous trans-orange tubes so prevalent last year. the complete assembly. isn't it snug? it's just the right size too - not massive but large enough to be a serious mining vehicle. the ominous black treads contrast nicely with the white/ orange colour scheme of the vehicle itself. the trans detailing - blue for weapons, neon green for energy - is carried nicely through the whole set. the blades and the scoops whirl nicely as the machine trundles along. top down view: tread detail: whirling blades of death! the buggy descends: probably the most disturbing aspect of the whole set is this pic: the jelly has an orange pump plugged into its heart which is connected to an energy supply on the left hand side! this vehicle runs on alien jelly juice! either that or it's milking the jelly in some equally disturbing fashion. how amoral is that! i know there's been debate about this - the jellys aren't innocent, they're evil energy crystal thieving maniacs etc - but i find it a bit odd that the humans respond by chaining the jelly up to the bowels of their mining vehcile and suck energy from its heart. people debate about violence in lego as represented by realistic minifig weapons, but i think the moral lesson here is even worse - it's ok to exploit foreign life forms for our own gain if they treat us badly first! (who-fans, i think the ood should have a word with the jelly commander ) that aside, this set is well-designed and fairly good value at $aud79.95. it's definitely a notch above last year's mars mission sets overall, with improved detailing and more useful functions. the holo-stickers are fab and it's nice to have an alien commander, even if he is a bit bulky and his fingers are identical to his toes. however, if all these reasons by themselves weren't reason to recomend this set, the following is.... part 4: power functions the best part of this set - and the reason i bought it, really - is the integration of power functions. bizarrely this isn't mentioned at all on the box and i only found out about it from the instructions when they were posted on eurobricks! (instructions for book 2 which has the power function stuff available here.) this is a great idea and hopefully we will see more new sets take this kind of approach (especially with the new train sets). luckily i got monster dino 4958 on sale for half price earlier this year so already had most of the necessary motors etc - the only one needed was an extra small one. what you need is listed in the instructions below with redirections to shop @ home to buy the motors. note there's actually a mistake on this page. the 2 small motors you need are both 8883 not 8882 (which is the large xl motor). way to confuse the kids there, lego! attaching them was a dream and only took a few minutes (in contrast to 4958 where it was almost impossible to remove motor elements without dismantling the model). basically the back platform and some plates and orange slopes come off, you attach the motors, and then the smaller plates go back on. these parts are now left loose: overall the look of the reaper isn't badly effected as you're mainly viewing from the front anyway: sadly i can't show you how it moves, you'll just have to trust me that it does ! the way it is steered is demonsrated in the instruction pages above. basically each motor is controlled by a corresponding switch on the remote. move them both forward to move forward, move one right to turn right, move both back to move back etc. it zips along! it's a speedy little thing! personally i wouldn't want to be in it's path as it comes roaring down the martian canyon! (my cat was scared as it was.) it is oodles of fun and definitely worth trying if you have the motors or can get them cheaply, and adds a whole new dimension to the 'play' aspect of 'playset'. it is also as i said very quick to switch between modded and non-modded reaper in contrast to the more fiddly dino creations. the only problem i had is that if it moves too fast, the weight of the battery box at the back tends to pull the whole thing back and it rears up. it does correct itself though. i only trialled this on carpet last night so it may behave differently on other surfaces - i will need to experiment! part 5: summation this is a great set made even better with the addition of power functions. at $aud79.95 it's well-priced. buy it! buy the motors as well (k-mart still has stock of 4958 at $89, wait for a 15% off sale)! you won't regret it. buy 2 and make competing battle machines! the only thing is... just don't torture that poor jelly edited by sinner, 24 june 2008 - 03:25 am.

1 wonder full job, but now my wallet aches in misery.

1 im not that into mars mission... but this set reminds me of the jungle cutter

0 nice review the power functions is a nice idea and i ownder if it will appear in any other new sets? regarless if i get this (i decided to just to get what ever looks good in the shops from now on ) im defianltey picking up some of the white visors off bricklink

1 wow, this thing is very cool. definately no lack of details, and is quite cheap for the bang of the set that you get. for some reason i really love the bay in the back of the detachable ship. quite an improvement from last years line. thank you for the review.

0 asuka, on jun 4 2008, 09:26 am, said: did i miss something or is there really only one (and probably improved) shooting device? no, you didn't miss anything. there's only one, and it's the less obtrusive new piece the range is pretty poor, though .

0 this should be reported to the news .

1 svelte_corps, on jun 3 2008, 12:09 pm, said: the only thing is... just don't torture that poor jelly i smell another "dont hurt the dragons/jellies" or something group nice reveiw i dont realy like the mm sets [we want more starjustice/space skulls!!!!!!] but this one looks ok i guess suprised they dont say that it has power functions on the box

1 really nice review! i love those sweet looking power functions on it, if only the orange bits could be replaced, then you could have a futuristic and motorized jungle cutter anyway, the alien bit was disturbing, but the overly-tall new commanders look very, very cool! all in all, a great set, but i won't be able to buy it, because, in a few days, s@h will become 600$ richer and my wallet will writhe around in pain on the floor.

1 i appreciate your review mr. mandalorian, but why the negativity?. i'd try to find more positives about the set instead of kinda criticizing it after each picture. i personally think it looks freakin' awesome!. the size is very impresive and i nearly fell of my chair when i saw the first pics earlier this year. it's quite unlike anything i've ever seen from lego. edited by radiant7, 04 june 2008 - 08:27 am.

-1 thanks for the great and very detailed review. i love the new holostickers! i'm still not sold on this set though. i'm not sure why... i think it's the big wing piece and the too-technicy build (from looking at the instructions). the platform seems kind of out of place. and for the size of the set, the functionality doesn't seem as good as it could be. it reminds me of 7699 armored drilling unit - looks impressive but doesn't seem to do that much. i do think mars mission has improved this year though. bar none, this is the weakest of the new mm sets i think.

1 thanks for the review mr. mandalorian. the alien craft is a bit small in my opinion could have done with being just a little bit larger. the main craft however despite its few minor flaws looks very good. while space isn’t my normal theme i’m certainly being tempted this year.

1 i don't understand why there's so much negativity... this is actually my favorite of the new mm sets. the finished look is very sleek and not very gappy at all. the deployable landing pad is great, and it'll make it easy to put on a shelf without taking too much room. lots of greebles... although i will concede that it's just begging to be modded. still, though, i'm definitely buying this one. :) it has a really great look to it!

0 sinner, on jun 4 2008, 03:44 am, said: having a name like that is a good start! my screen name largely sums up my interest in lego, but is not soley limited to space. thanks for the warm welcome.

0 two more questions: 1 - how stable is the entire craft when balanced on the platform? is there a chance that it will just collapse? 2 - what are the total wingspan, height and depth measurements of the model?

0 wow! i'll definately have to check this one out. i always tried making a big mining deployment ship, but it always turned out crappy. edited by maiq the liar, 04 june 2008 - 10:52 pm.

1 thank you for that nice review, mr. mandalorian. wow. somehow it´s almost like classic space´s back indeed.... it´s a great star ship. it looks stream lined, original and impressive and even the huge plane wing part looks rather cool and smooth on it. it´s equipped at least with some kind of engines on top of the wings and although they´re made with only two a little 'juniorized' parts it´s better than nothing. there´s a lab or some sort of engine room with enough space inside to allow one or two mfs to play scotty.... yeah! the two cockpits´re nicely detailed with a cool use of these orange 1x1 round plates and to detach one or all two of them reminds a lot of the playability of the good old space sets. it seems even like it´s easy to attach them to some kind of cloud city twin-pod car thanks these hinged wings. looks like some solid fun to me. of course.... the cockpits aren´t airtight and even this reminds unfortunately of the post blue, grey and trans yellow era of cs. anyway, there´s no real fun without some moding i guess. another great advantage of the set´s that it´s not overpacked with shooting things. one technic shooter, cool in grey and only one trans orange prison pod too. well, i can surely live with that especially since it´s nicely asymmetrical. the drill rover´s very charming, a little like a rebuilt oldsmobile convertibe stranded on mars. sweet! and that platform feature´s plain nifty and well done too, very playable and useable for a lot of things. hmm.... recently i complained a lot about the dense use of studless technic beams for the inner structure of vehicles like these exoforce tanks par exemple which makes moding (in an economical way) pretty frustrating.... but the beams here´re used in a very proper way. it should be fairly easy to mod, let´s say, the back of that lab section up to perhaps even the cockpits to create a larger airtight area that could be boarded from the platform.... just to fit this certain spacers need for, um, realism.... there´re many more nice details too like that 'satelite t.v.' thingy and that cylinder with trans blue 2x2 dish for the knob or these cylinders with cones on that handle, and that alien craft´s pretty nice and detailed as well. like i said before.... i really feel like classic space´s back.

1 i think this thing is compensating the poor lab with the bar army.

1 sorry mr. mandalorian, i guess i was just getting a bit defensive because when this set first appeared here, there were literally 2 pages of people just bagging out the new mm sets (but then the thread took a turn and people started to warm to them, much like the agents). i do agree that it definitely needs some mocing, but with that work i think it has the potential to be a really amazing set in terms of what you could cram into it. the lab is a little disappointing, i've always wanted an enclosed cabin space in a vehicle this size because then all the little space guys can have a true meeting place! the drop-down landing ramp is my favourite part, it has lots of potential uses. maybe it's even possible to integrate pneumatics :d

1 thanks for the nice review - it was one of the first ones i got when emerging from my dark ages . i bought two of these, just for buckbeack - i thought he would make a good statue in a persian temple type moc. i also liked the minifig head pumpkin and plant part in bright green - both new pieces to me at the time. all in all, it was a good castle or forest building set with a nice selection of pieces for rocks, grass, plants and trees. the dark bley plume piece also now appears in the 10185 green grocer set as detailing on the roof of the turret.

1 guys, thanks for your comments! glad you find this review useful! and be sure to watch out for more old sets reviews. mr spielbrick, on jun 12 2008, 12:28 am, said: this draco is the best tlc has made, if you ask me. the new one (also doubling for belloq and "guards" in the indy line) doesn't look quite as hautain as this one. buckbeak looks cool. looks like his neck/head can be moved, right? rather similar to lego horses. well designed. mr spielbrick, thanks for pointing out some important highlights for the review. i have overlooked it earlier. i strongly agreed with you, that this draco is the best tlc made. i pretty like the face compared to others. furthermore, i used my multiple dracos, for my castle armor guards instead. one could not have too many dracos. buckbeak design is well made. the head can be moved upwards and downwards. the mechanism is similar to the horse design. in addition, buckbeak wings can be removed. similar to the typical green or black dragon wings that we used to see in the past. well, the main reason for me to buy this set was in fact buckbeak. you don't often find a griffin lying around except in harry potter sets. mr spielbrick, on jun 12 2008, 12:28 am, said: the orange brick doesn't have a pumpkin face on it, right? unlike the one from philosopher's stone in the set with the troll. sorry to said, there is no print on that pumpkin face. it's pure orange.

1 i bought about 5 or 6 of these sets when they were on sale in mid- 2006. i still have a few of them laying around unopened. i think i payed like under $5 for each and thats a great deal for all the variety of neat parts you get with this set.

0 nice review. i like the treemaking pieces the most of this not very expensive set. the buckbeak fig is very nice and can bow his head like the horses. i was annoyed to get another draco without some other not made figs (pansy parkinson for example). about the dark bley feathers; in the second version of hogwarts there were several of these feathers put in little 1x1 cones like it was a feather to write with it. i bought 2 sets of these and when they were for sale i just bought +/- 6 more of it. only annoying that i had then even a bigger army of draco's.

0 i see a lot of good reviews on this site, but this one is superb! good job. tom

1 yay! the monster book of monsters! now i want this! i also love the buckbeak figure! it looks very realistic for a lego version of something, usually they are much worse (look at the goblins, for example)

-1 where is my soap????!!!! haha, anyway, nice review as always, batbrick! i too have the set and hate the wall jutting out, catapult, and missing wall. but hey, review.

0 great review batbrick, i was curious as to what the interior of the building looked like, i still think that there should have been a few random chains or something lying around as they may add to the abandoned feeling that the ware house had. though i have to admit that i really like the roof dock and minifigs as some of them make good average civilians that are somewhat hard to come by in todays sets . great comic as well it seemed to add a lot to your review, hope you can review another spider man set soon . btw as adam mentioned i believe you owe me a bar of soap, for reading your review ... edited by mack, 14 june 2008 - 12:59 am.

1 great review. the hippy and the "story" at the end were hilarious. i think this was easily the best of the spiderman 2 sets. you're right though - it wasn't movie acurate, as the actual movie dock was far shabbier and more trashed than this. ah well, i guess tlc couldn't do everything.

1 very good review! i always wanted this set, shame i didn't get it.

0 a few years late, but great review! i really want to get this set!

1 nice review! i would have snapped this up back in 2006 if i was not in my dark ages!

1 thanks for the review; i've always liked that one but haven't had a chance to get it. now i'm sold- or the set will be sold- to me !

1 hmmm i must rebuild my sw ships [a-wing,jsf & v-wing just to name afew] nice review this is probable one of my favourite sw ships i cant belive i broke it for pieces [just to make small crap mocs] next time my friend comes over we will rebuild some of my sw ships [he always asks me if we can rebuild them so i finaly said yes ]

1 yes i recommend this set it was my second star wars set ever and i must say it was a stunner for me commanderfox

1 here's the 3rd of the whole batch of complete reviews done back in 2006. hope you guys enjoy them so far. product: 6206 tie interceptor theme: star wars no of pieces: 212 release date: february 2006 rrp: sgd39.90/usd19.90 availability: lego shop@home, target, toys 'r' us (us & europe), bricksworld (sg). lego.com said: challenge the rebels! blasting out of star wars episode vi: return of the jedi, the tie interceptor is the fastest fighter in the imperial fleet! open the cockpit canopy and fold down the instrument panel to put the tie pilot inside and recreate your favorite classic star wars battles! includes tie fighter pilot! cockpit opens and instrument panel folds down! it does seem to have more pieces than the average tie fighter, but this is actually cheaper than the 7263 tie fighter. of course, there's no light-up feature in this set. :sweat: yesh!! finally... a... tie interceptor!! this is probably the most anticipated for all set for all lego tie collectors worldwide, since the fighter, bomber, advanced, and even the expanded universe droid fighter had been released by the lego group. this set is near movie-accurate, since the bottom part of it ain't. :p the cockpit and pylons uses the same design as that of the tie advanced piloted by darth vader. except for one minor change, that is the aft interior of the cockpit is strengthen this time. and this is indeed good news, since the older models had a problem of hard hinge and loose brick connection. there's no landing gear for this set, but it doesn't require it anyway. this tie interceptor balances perfectly on its wings. standard instruments panel and, of course, standard imperial pilot. the "swoosh-able" or play factor of this set is definitely very high... just take a look. :d *camera view from own craft* *camera view from tie-advanced* *combat simulation of endor's battle from the archives* no bomber, since i started late in re-collecting. :p to conclude, for a typical lego fan, this set is a 60/40, 60 due to it's good design, and for a typical star wars fan, this is a must-get. the only flaw for this set is the same flaw for any lego set in sg, the price. :doh: comment(current in 2008) being a starwars fan... no... being a typical toy collector, space is definitely a premium... so much so that i turned to lego starwars to sate my appetite for more starwars products when i already have no more display space. for the next few non-lego pictures, they are the crown of my starfighter collection in 1/18 scale. so just view them for fun, eh? and no, i haven't had the chance nor the time to do up a scene of my lego starfighters blowing up spectacularly since the pieces would be very hard to put back... hmm... then again, isn't that what lego is about. "doh".

0 why have you uploaded this twice???

1 great set, but i scrapped it since im not big on space. nice set though, and a good review jifel

0 skipper 24, on jun 15 2008, 08:02 pm, said: why have you uploaded this twice??? because this review is very good! thanks for all the pics! i want to buy that set too! they are so big! but why did lego made them in these strange black/d.blue colors? this set is very old, i saw it one time in my local toyshop for 69 euro and now it's gone, pitty. will look on ebay.

-1 i picked up this set mainly because of the many (5+spare) glow in the dark parts and the promise of 2 racers and one helicopter for the price of a little more than two racers (90kr. vs. 2x40kr.) the box the back of the box shows the two alternate models you can build if the polybags rip. there are 3 cheese slopes and two 1x2 tiles that glow in the dark, where the tiles are exclusive for this set. the total parts count is high at 142, but there are no really big pieces among them. inside the box you will find the building instructions, a sheet with some odd sticky labels (thrown away) and 3 polybags marked by the bag building difficulty. the models the lime colored car doesn't bring out anything new. we have seen racers built like that before, but it does contain some nice bricks for the collection. the police cruiser surprises with an interesting design along the sides as seen here. it is harder to build because of the greater level of details: the helicopter is without doubt the hardest vehicle to build in a bag. i can't finish it because it's larger than the bag. you can't put on the top blades nor the tail of the thing, so it beats the forklift from 7733 where the top bar is the new kind that doesn't completely fit. there is also instructions for the alternate models, but it requires the bags to be opened... the vehicles are pretty standard for the racers theme with the police car being the highlight of the set conclusion i like the difficulty curve between bag 1 and 2, but the last bag should be labeled 1000000 instead of 3. it requires some inhuman skills to build that helicopter in the bag... ? lime colored car: 3 - we have seen it before, but it has some nice pieces... and lime. police cruiser: 9 - it has a massive diffusers, rare parts and a high level of details. it is a shame lego relies so much on stickers. helicopter: 6 - if you see it as a set for one fourth of the price of the cars, it is quite amazing, but you can't bag build it and i would personally prefer some more detail instead of the big size. overall it is a nice little set, but the police car is the main attraction. i wouldn't get the other vehicles if they were sold separately. brickshelf gallery edited by whitefang, 23 may 2009 - 07:03 pm. indexed

0 it's called challenging one's self :-p plus you can resell it as misb since it's still sealed in the polybags lol

0 now now, don't judge people who do this. there have been bigger sets that were done in the bag. to each his own :)

0 ahhh bag building... that takes me back. i suspect that if i didn't do my bag building topic my eb life would have turned out very differently. for the negative nancies, i suggest you try it. i bought a set just so i could, and i found it fun. (not fun enough to do it again though!) thanks for the interesting review.

0 adik_sa_lego, on jun 17 2008, 10:02 am, said: now now, don't judge people who do this. there have been bigger sets that were done in the bag. to each his own :) you make it sound like i did something deeply socially deviating... like being an adult playing with lego but back on topic. open the bags? if they were meant to be opened, why did lego close them in the first place? bag building is not for everybody. some might become very frustrated with it and let their anger out on the set by lining it up on a mini golf course.

0 i bought a tiny turbos set(a no-no for me) after i saw this "bag building." it's actually pretty fun. i built it faster than i would if i had opened the bags!

-1 seeming as there were no reviews of this set in the index i have uploaded mine from jabbas hutt . here is my review for lego set 10178 motorized walking at-at because i live in the uk i got this set with 6 free duracell batteries which was great! (it's just twice as expensive as the us) heres the basic set that is from the instructions. this is the cockpit but please note after i took this photo i realised it was slightly built wrong. heres one of the feet in proportion to a minifig to give you a general size. this is luke skywalker swinging on a wire trying to destroy the at-at i really wish lego didn't make so many luke's because i want differnt minifigs. it would also be nice for a thermal detonator piece. underneath the at-at you can see the shaft that moves the back legs, the motor and squeezed in on the righ t the massive battery box. a load of cogs that move the legs. these are the included figures snowtrooper, general maximilian veers, at-at driver/pilot or whatever you want to call him and luke all whithout there wepons. please note veers should have a dark stone snowtroooper torso with 4 red and blue badge things not 3. these are the figures with weapons i gave them and the included ones snowtrooper has new style blaster, veers has standard light grey pistol like the ones from the old adventure sets, at-at driver has old style blaster which i call heavy blaster and luke has shiny handle blue light sabre . the shiny blue light sabre was included with the set which is a bonus because i really dont like the grey ones. http://www.brickshel...sc00521.jpg.jpg this is the switch which is attached to the battery box on either side of the at-at underneath the lift up side panels. you push the forward to walk forward and backward to walk backwards simple eh . a front veiw with the the panels open. here are the drivers controls which are simply a cotrol panel and 2 exo-force robot hands which are joystick things seen in the film if you look closley. the almost useless carry handle. this is the weird back piece. looking down the at-at from the back where you can see the the battery box and switch. troops decending from ropes and cables and vader leading the assult for this i hadnt got any more imp's so i used clones pilots. (i now have a whole load more snowtroopers) solo and chewie sabotaging. more troops to squash rebel scum huzahh! a very bad picture of everyone packed up inside. the size incomparison to its predecessor overall i would give this set 9/10 because it should come with more snowtroopers or it could be and endor version with loads of strormies and scout troopers. aswell as this you can really sit any one down because of the battery box but i stilll find space to put all the shown figures on this review in the interior as you can see on the above image the chains and ropes are hanging down a bit. tjis set is now limited to 5 per customer in the uk and now no longer comes with free batteries. the walking on this is a bit wonky and dosen't really walk like they do in the film as it moves two legs at a time. i am currently attaching a motor to the head to make it move independently.

1 great review indexing it, as i write this. how come you think the ctt is the at-ats predecessor? do you mean the motorized at-at or at-at's in general? i think this is a great set and i am very fond of mine. it's one of the few sw sets of mine that is on "parade" at all times. most are packed away in the attic. kimt [btw it's not alone, the older version of the at-at is keeping it company]

0 vader had a red pole because i think it makes him look bigger and in the films i doubt it is but i think his saber might be bigger.

-1 i never got the set. it looked way to skinny. i came close to buying it for the figs but then decided not to. if you compared this one to the later one there is a big difference. this one just didnt seem proporshined with the legs and its body.

-1 thanks for the review kimt - it comes at a... confusing time you can take off the top disk and lift it like the millennium falcon from the top now. i actually don't like this set that much. it takes about 5 hours and 15 minutes to build if you do it in one go, but the repeating sections makes this built the most tedious i have experienced. it has way too many holes from which you can see the colorful skeleton and is overpriced compared to the older 10030 isd. i remember thinking it was too expensive when it was 50% off at s@h! even the snowspeeder was "kewler" to less than half the price:

-1 hmmm, ive still got this set and i must say, i think you did a good job of reviewing it. but... overall, i hate the set, probably the worst ucs set so far (apart from the naboo fighter but that hardly even counts as ucs) from my experience. unless you really really want it and have nothing better to spent your $$$ on, in that case go for it. but in my case, it was a very repetitive build and final model was quite... well, bland, not must variety to it, if you know what i mean.for the price, i would really reccomend the ucs star destroyer, because thats a much better story..

-1 even though i never liked ucs, i absolutley hate this one. sure, its great on display, but the build looks extremley boring to me, just stacking plate after plate. and as you said, its going to break a little if you touch it. the only intersting part for me is the firing laser. although i do have to say the proce isnt too bad, i still wouldt buy it. and no minifigs so thanks for the review, but ill pass on this one. the new minifig scale ds looks awesome though, and this might have hyped some up who are buying the new ds,

-1 i also don't feel this is a very good set. but is that old grey? in which case it would be a nice part pack... dr. brick

-1 thanks for the review kimt! honestly, like the others have said, i don't find any appeal in ucs sets, especially this one. it's just a big, incomplete, grey ball.

1 kimt, on jun 25 2008, 08:34 am, said: i don't agree that the isd is better - imho they're exactly them same - big and grey this is a question of personal liking - which is the coolest ds or isd. not comparative. here are some advantages that makes isd win for me: - a lot more fun to build with less repetitions - it is easier to build alternate models from it! (how many alternate models of the ds2 have you seen?) - the bricks are more varied. - you get magnets! - it is a larger set if you look at the size

1 kimt, on jun 24 2008, 03:22 pm, said: 4: zero swooshability i think its very swooshable, assuming you swoosh it at the same speed it moves in the movie. :d while i would never do something like this, i bet if you packed this sucker with a bunch of m80 firecrackers it would make for a fantastic end to a stop motion movie. with it being as delicate as you say it is i bet you wouldn't destroy any parts. edited by gotoandlego, 03 april 2010 - 02:57 pm.

0 you should have posted the entire review up! i am about to look at the gallery for the rest of the pics. edit: as soon as i post the images came thats weird. nice review, is there more it says i'll be back? good first review! edited by skipper 24, 26 june 2008 - 09:11 pm.

0 sorry about that skipper, i added the topic after the first pic was uploaded just to make sure the pics would be in the post. you probably posted while i was editing it. and i had to go to visit my grandparents, im at their house right now. sorry if you got freaked out!

1 that's a neat little set. i like the design of the fighter. thanks for the review - it's been keep it up kimt

0 yesterday i buy this set,and i'm waiting for a pack! this review is very helpful! jimbutcher, on jun 27 2008, 08:34 pm, said: ill try to do the sith infiltrator this weekend. i wait!

0 trooperdavinfelth, on jul 2 2008, 03:15 pm, said: it's all good... but!(i know, you expected a but ) it's a rat. or maybe a very large mouse

1 quote in addition, the flick missile really works. use a little bit of force from your finger and flick it, the missile will fly. well, it certainly does not impress me at all with such playing feature. something to toughen up kids fingers! thanks for the review, cant wait til i get this comes to oz!

1 thanks for the review . not a bad price (of course, its impulse) for a fig, a little cleaner thing, and two accesories. the brush, fig, and spade i dont have yet, so i might just pick this up.

1 glad you guys like the review. brainbox, on jul 3 2008, 06:19 pm, said: looking at this is making me want to build one of the favourite sets of my childhood, 6649 street sweeper (might do that today actually). cheap. good pieces (despite the lack of a bin lid... that's just inviting disaster isn't it?), nice fig, and one of those blue brushes, which i've always loved but never managed to use. the 6649 looks lovely, and i hope you managed to restore it. indeed, a bin without a lid is inviting trouble.

1 wow, what a great little impulse set! i relly dig the face as well as a chance to get some cool accessories like a broom, bin (no lid....sigh) and a mushroom top (hat). a really nice review and story too whitefang, i think this guy will be joining my set of lego when he shows up in australia. cheers isc

1 whitefang, on jul 3 2008, 03:18 am, said: this set is simply wonderful. you know, that's exactly what i thought. i love it! it's simple, well designed, and cute. there are some nice pieces in there as well, and i really do quite like the fig- the new coastguard torso looks great. thanks!

1 thank you for the nice review. the set is nice, the pieces are nice. and the grey helmet is great for an additional star wars rebel technician.

1 hello all eurobricks members, this will be my last impulse set review for the second wave. hope everyone of you will find my reviews useful and helpful in your purchase. name: crystal hawk theme: lego system / mars mission year: 2008 pieces: 26 minifigs: 1 an image of a 5619, crystal hawk alpha 3 in sector 5, reporting to base alpha 3, crystal hawk, reporting for duty, sir! may i present mars mission, latest scout craft, code named "crystal hawk". this spacecraft looks very sleek and cool with its usual white and orange color combination. i am not a fan of mars mission, but these white mini-figs simply attracted me for it. in fact, i only owned its impulse sets, and none of its main sets. nevertheless, this set has the "swoosh" factor. i was swooshing around in my home last night. well, i am not swooshing it like kimt though. am i seeing double? haha, the answer is "no". it has double sided face. i combined the pictures, to illustrate the two facial expressions. bits and pieces different angles love the way how the wings bend upwards and downwards. the only thing i find it a little bit wierd for spacecraft. normally, i thought joystick is the typical navigation controls for a spacecraft instead of a steering wheel? i am not complaining about a steering wheel in a spacecraft. to me, it's quite an uncommon sight. anyway, the white steering wheel is an useful part for making vehicles mocs. summary review playability: 8/10 (fun to play with when you bend the wings up and down.) design: 8.5/10 (design is simple, but creates a sleek and cool look.) price: 8/10 (an inexpensive set to get more scout craft and mars mission mini-figs) overall: 8.5/10 (a very good set to have for any mars mission fans, and for collectors like me whom can't afford all mars mission sets, this set is a very great alternative.) hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine. comments and critics are strongly welcomed. pictures can be found in my brickshelf (when moderated)

1 thanks for another review whitefang! this is quite a nice set actually. it evokes some of the design elements of the mx-11, while looking different enough to justify me buying it. the head on the astronaut is one i like, so even better. i hadn't realised it was that one actually. does 26 pieces make it one of the bigger impulses sets? i think i may have to get one, if not two... plus it's called 'crystal hawk'. how can that not be considered cool?

1 thanks for the great review. now i just have to have that set!

1 thank you for the nice review. this set has a very classic space feeling, so i don't care about the lack of cockpit. a nice little set with a nice minifig.

1 once again, another outstanding review by svelte_corps! i am not a very big fan of agents, but this theme defintely offer plenty of useful parts. this volcano base is simply fanastic for parts usage, especially in doing up landscaping, with mountains, by making use of the brown burps. i must admit that the exterior looks real cool, but the interior looks rather empty. these orange slopes certainly make a great illustration of the larva, which gives the agents a hard time to infiltrate within its compound to save his comrade. i am quite sure, this set will defintely attracts lots of kids to coax their parents to buy it, since the bright colors will defintely caught their attention. with all those hi-tech, sleek weaponary, i am sure this is the next big thing for kids out there. well, i am not sure if this theme works for me as well. but this set defintely works well for landscaping project.

1 droool must buy!!!!!! to svelte_corps: how on this wonderful planet, did you get that??? i thought it was coming in september!!!

1 excellent review sc. thanks for sharing. the figs are awesome. i really like the female villain - an excellent face. i also like the agent uniforms. the laser gun is perfect. it has that peter sellers/pink panther dooms day device look that i envision when i think of laser destruction. the volcano has some neat features as well, like the trans. red/orange lava. it is a bit heavy on stickers though, as are many new sets/themes. but overall, i think this set will really appeal to the kids. - a great review of a neat set.

-1 honestly i'm too much of a space fan to be interested in this set. i'd rather have the sub. good review though. :d

0 nice set review i really liked the narrative for the review. i must have missed your custom base back in june, also well constructed and great story too!

1 i know the word "secret" base but whats this! the base is hardly secret with a massive laser gun and wide screen sticking out it looks good, lots and lots of orange! woo!

1 this will be a wonderful set for a mustafar moc

1 cool set. i got that firearm thing straight away lol. i might get a few of these sets and combine into mustafar. great review

0 unfortunately i dont have any other sets yet, i think i got one of the bigger vehicles back in the time, but i don't have any sets from this time anymore. but i certainly plan to get the loader dozer and/or the chrome crusher soon. i found an ebay auction where somebody is selling the sets 4940, 4950 and 4970 new & sealed hopefully i have luck with that. it's only at 4 euros right now, but it's still running 6 days... http://cgi.ebay.de/w...t...a:it&ih=005

0 great review and such a nice figure! i consider rock raiders space too. i also consider many of the diver themes space as well... i've yet to own a rock raiders set. i have tried to buy a few off ebay, but they always went too high...

1 rock raiders was one of my favorite lego themes ever.

0 jimbutcher, on jul 10 2008, 09:44 pm, said: a hidden compartment! now this was a very cool idea by tlg, a secret compartment found by taking off the top slope of the hull you're supposed to slide the front of the hull off, rather than lift the top piece off.

-1 a very neatly designed sith infiltrator, though i think it lacks the size of the older version. a fine ship, but not what i would call a sith infiltrator. it should be bigger. thanks for another fine sw review kimt

1 thanks for review...(i hope svelt corps still reviews it ) slime is pretty cool, i knew about the torse for a while but its no less cool now

-1 great review, rezourceman! your pics really show off the sub well and it's good to see the build in progress. i also have this set but i didn't apply stickers to the sub as i was planning to reuse the nice dark blue pieces. however as shown in your review they do brighten it up a fair bit. i can't say this is my favourite agents set; the boat is a little oddly proportioned and the sub, although retro looking, has practically no interior and would be difficult to customise to put more in (unlike, say, the clever job batbrick did with the penguin sub in his review). the sub kind of looks like some jules verneish sea creature - i would have liked it if they'd gone all the way and made it some kind of giant robot jellyfish or squid i do agree with you about slime face - he has a fantastic torso with all the slime dripping down which is a bit obscured by the air tank. it's really encouraging that in the last 2 missions we've had great extra villains added in. the only thing i would add about the octopus is that the glow in the dark plastic is mixed in unevenly with the aqua blue, so it doesn't glow in the dark evenly - it's kind of like the mars mission jellies in that respect though much cooler! thanks again for the great review!

1 darth_legois, on jul 11 2008, 10:28 am, said: [color="#0000ff"] *cough*alphateam*cough* i'd forgotten about ogel's mutant vehicles i guess i meant a bigger cross between the 8636 sub and the big squid from 7775 aquabase invasion - that is such a great design. sort of keep the retro feel but make it bigger. with the 8636 sub, there's really only room for one agent to sit and despite its size, there's just a few (not amazingly great) functions such as the hidden chest and missiles.

0 i feel like a n00b asking, but what is the usd price? i didn't see a price in the review.

1 great review. this set totally owns alpha team deep sea. the sub design actually looks like a sub, the figures are way better, the acessories are better - everything is better! agents may have my vote for the best theme of the year. quote i wonder if it will last longer than one year (unlike other recent one-and-done themes). oh don't worry - a second wave will be coming next year. this was confirmed by both legomilk and in an interview with an agents designer.

1 aside from the price, i love this set! when i saw the prelim pics of agetns i did not like the theme, but all the sets are starting to look more attractive now i can see the cool features and details! as for this set, i really like the bad-guy boat for some reason and the submarine looks good - i love the dark blue colour.

1 wow, thanks for the review, that is one awesome set, slime face is excellent! i must add him to the collection, i think we need some new agents, there's so many inferno minifigures now... maybe next year? thanks again!

1 inertia, on jul 21 2008, 12:29 pm, said: wow, thanks for the review, that is one awesome set, i think we need some new agents, there's so many inferno minifigures now... maybe next year? there's only 2 infernos out of 8 sets which is pretty good. there's way more agent chases and break jaws. i agree though, next year hopefully we'll have some new figs.

0 thebrickster, on jul 11 2008, 10:16 pm, said: yes. the extra space was probably for the oxygen tanks on the figs. it makes taking them off a lot easier. as for the lab/control center, i never had an issue with it being open. i think this was just for playability. one could always "pretend" that some sort of invisible force ray closed the side when activated. invisible force field/ray? that is a very neat idea. i don't have much problem with it either. was just curious about the design, as i am not very familar with classic space. i supposed the oxygen tanks is quite big to carry around, especially when the vehicle is so cramped. these allowance of space, makes them much mobile to move about in the vehicle. cp5670, on jul 12 2008, 02:39 am, said: i just modified mine to make everything fully enclosed: great job! thanks for sharing and answering the question i posted above. i love the way you modify the front and back. now, i need to find where is the entrance to the mobile command center.

1 yeah, first time that i am getting a set before everyone.^^ first of all: the package the european version has no "limited edition" button. hooray!!! sorry for the blurry back-shot. we see the hospital back, a few bubbles with set functions and a little comic. comic: bubbles: the figures are injured spongebob, patrick and the new fish doctor. spongebob has a headprint... ...and a backprint (other than the normal spongebob). spongebob and injured bob: the set comes with two litters. the ambulance car is a bit extraordinary. i don´t know how the car is like in the show (and i saw a lot of episodes) but it looks a bit strange, mostly because the weehls are too small. of course we get another ss (not so d this time). the litter fits in the back, with help of this lid. i wish it would be the hinge-lid from before 2004... now we come to the meanpart of the set: the hospital! the entrance has got babyblue traindoors and a hudge sign that shows "emergency". the tubes are nearly everywhere in this set. i was getting insane when i came to the part, where i must put the stickers on the tubes. this parts are very usefull, but i wanted that the set looks good, because i will display it. so i stickered just two of the parts and not all four. now we come to the interroir: the doctor has a desk with computer. sadly it´s not very well placed and he must duck because of his fin. next to the door, we get this little case, wash basin and two drawers. again we get stickers... not that i don´t like stickers. it´s just: everytime i get to the part where i must put the stickers on, i think how i can re-use the model and if i rebuild the model, later and and and... i hate it to deside! a few posters are in it, too. the set is a great addittion to your own bikino bottom, but the playability is not very big for the kids. they can just play that patrick steals the ambulance car, like shown on the package, and is hitting spongebob. than the drive back, the doctor gives spongebob two medicines and let him go. i bought the set mostly because of the parts (tubes in lightbley and a few woodpieces). but i am thinking about let it stand in my little bikini bottom (just consist of crusty crab and chum bucket). playability: 3/10 figures: 10/10 price: 8/10 design: 9/10 total: 30/40

1 thanks for the review! the interior looks nice, better than i expected, lots of great parts but, as you say, so many of them are stickered. after rocket ride, the stickers in the sb sets seem to have gone crazy - the early sets weren't slathered in them. 2 new figs though is most welcome.

0 great review. as much as i hate spongebob lego, i just might get this set. it has a good number of useful parts, like the computer and keyboard, and all of the brown pieces. how much does this set cost in usd?

0 cpt. pegleg blockbeard, on jul 12 2008, 04:23 pm, said: is sponge bob sets available in auzzi land? i have not seen them in shops... regards cpt. pb generally not, although as a special sale promotion target has 3830 bikini bottom express and 3831 rocket ride available now (although the sale starts 24 july for 20% off) and k-mart briefly had the krusty krab set last year.

0 i ordered the set via s@h and it cost 34.99€ in germany, 37.99€ in belgium and 50$ in australia. it looks like it´s a exclusive set, but without the 2limited edition" sticker on the package. in the usa it´s not aviable, now. i think it costs as much as the rocket ride (30$). @ mrs pegleg: he has the same, short pants, like in the other sets.

1 nice review, the set looks promising.

1 wow, that set looks better than i thought! i just might get it if its under $30 usd. i love all the details inside, and it seems to have a better interior than the city hospital... and the new figs look nice...

0 i never have buy a sponge bob set but this looks so cool so maybe... (just maybe) i will buy it . i am curious of why tlc haven´t done the flying dutchman ship, it was in the first rumor list of sponge bob sets, that surely will be a must .

1 the official name for this lego set is "the emergency room". i have all the other spongebob sets, including three krusty krabs, two bikini bottoms, as well as one of everything else , now all i need to do is wait until next month to buy this set if i find it at my local toys "r" us. that spongebob minifig looks cute.

1 i'm not a huge fan of spongebob, but this set i might want also have. maybe i can combine it with the city hospital.

1 there's a lot great pieces in this set, i would be willing to get the set just for them. thanks for the great review!

-1 i recently bought this set for my daughters birthday. it's the first belville set that i've bought for her so it's a bit of an experiment. the house is 5 rooms and it's made up of mostly large pieces. there still is a decent amount of normal lego in it though. the doorways in the house align when it is opened out. starting with the bathroom, included is a shower, toilet, sink with vanity and a baby potty. the mirror sticker is one of the few that i put on. the open plan lounge/kitchen/dining room is well appointed as well and it has a nice glass table and coffee machine. the kitchen chairs are fabuland parts... and don't work really well. it seems they are having jellyfish for dinner! the clock is the only printed part in the set. upstairs is a baby room and the master bedroom. the radio and the tv (not shown) were stickers to my disappointment. up top is an extra room suitable for reading. (those antenna things were made from spare parts by my daughter. i have no idea what they are supposed to be... ) there are some stickers that go on the back, but i didn't put them on. as it is the set looks ok this way, but since it is a dolls house it doesn't really matter. i do think though that the fireplace should have been given a back. the bbq is made from normal parts and is quite effective. i think it uses the same light brick that's in the 4998 stegosaurus set. my kids were using it as a torch before my grumbling ruined their fun... like all belville sets, the highlight is arguably the accessories. i'll be borrowing a few of these from time to time... here is the controversial baby catapult. as you can see, it works ok, but lego probably should have tried a bit harder. we also bought for her 7583 playful puppy. it also comes with some nice accessories, but not enough to justify buying unless you want the rest of the parts. poor puppy; where does he sleep? here is my daughter assembling it. she made me make the house though as she wanted to play a game we bought her. (note the lego drink bottles! ) i didn't take any photos of the figures as they don't seem to be anything new, but i can if people want me to. at the time i was in bit of a hurry as i took these before bed so i wouldn't be stressed if the kids broke it the next day. overall, these sets seem overpriced to me, and hard to justify unless you actually want a buildable doll's house. (which we did.) it's still too early to tell if my daughter likes it or not... but at this stage it seems she lost interest in a few days. she does tend to go back to toys though. edited by whitefang, 23 may 2009 - 07:03 pm. indexed

1 excellent review! it's nice to see how... it's nice to see how ... ... it's nice ... okay, i can't get over the sex in the bedroom and the unattended baby crawling into the oven. i didn't read anything else except, where does the puppy sleep and my daughter made me build this. you are sick and twisted and that's why i love you! it seems you are coining the belville edge. now will you please stop sitting around eating clams and get that baby out of the oven or make the fun in the bedroom a three-way? please! thank you ps. ok, i read it. i want the baby toilet and i think the jellyfish is supposed to be a jello-mold. i bet you knew that. the fireplace lattice look like the harry potter one and not the fabuland one. boo!! wienies. when your daughter outgrows it, will you turn it into a belleville star wars moc please? thank you in advance

1 great review, and i note something like a bucket in the dog set... shame its not blue... as for the fire place piece i love it and i want one, ever since finding it on mlcad!!! i love the bbq, it looks so good!, you know i might even buy this, it it was not so pink! now as for the kiddies, in ovens, make sure they are not over cooked they can be stringy , and as for the couple up stairs, now we at least know what you do with your mini figs when no one is looking/ lego sets in public places , just following your name sake i guess and i must say lego, shame, shame, that catapult needs reviwing, hardly even make a dent in a castle wall! regards cpt. pb

0 great review sinner, i haven't seen a bellville set review before! i just realised what you meant by 'fore' in the topic subtitle, too. imperialshadows, on jul 12 2008, 09:31 am, said: obviously, it really is all about the accessories, and it's got 'em, but not enough to make me spend that kind of cash, and i don't even mind having a pile of pink parts around. i agree, a lot of the pieces are good but i don't think i would get it. however, i do think i will get the set with the dogs, so my minifigs can have giant mutant hounds! jimbutcher, on jul 12 2008, 06:45 pm, said: and look what you found... a bucket! a bucket, in disguise as a watering can...

0 hinckley, on jul 13 2008, 01:55 am, said: this reminds me of that popular tv game show in the states: identify the bucket vs. the watering pale. no one's won the million yet... i was on that, came close to winning too, but the one i picked was too well tanned. wah-wah-waaaaaah.

1 sinner!!! you know, i had never seen a belville set in any review with such great pictures before! i just can't take my eyes off, in the master bedroom. the scene is quite, a little hot. enough of me, peeping up there. let's take a look at the interior. i am very surprised by its construction of the house. it's quite big and is nice of you to buy a great sweet gift for your daughter. i am very sure, she will enjoyed playing with it. somehow, it reminded me of barbie doll products. maybe, its too pinkish for me. the accessories is the "plus factor" in any belville sets. it offered quite a handful of great accessories to add into any types of mocs construction to add in the plus factor in it. sinner, you are a very nice dad! i like how parents, buy educational toys for their children to expand their imaginations instead of sitting in a couch playing video games and etc.

1 aw, sinners' playing with toys again! great review! the set is good for parts it appears. and that bedroom scene is...interesting.

0 svelte_corps, on jul 12 2008, 03:19 pm, said: 2 questions though. 1) was it a fun build? 2) are those large figs anatomically correct under their frou-frou finery? if not, what the hell are they doing in the second pic whilst baby sylvia explores the oven? it was sort of fun, but it really is just a lot of big pieces. the kitchen stove is smart though. as for the figs, yes i forgot to add pictures of the happy couple! here they are. hinckley, on jul 12 2008, 03:27 pm, said: when your daughter outgrows it, will you turn it into a belleville star wars moc please? thank you in advance it could be a while; ask me again in three years. wout, on jul 13 2008, 03:58 am, said: why haven't they not made a saussagesseller for city. maybe in the future. there are already more chickenlegs in minifigs sets. i agree. there's a good chance of me borrowing certain parts in the future. whitefang, on jul 13 2008, 07:07 pm, said: sinner, you are a very nice dad! i like how parents, buy educational toys for their children to expand their imaginations instead of sitting in a couch playing video games and etc. thanks, but i must confess she does play with our ps3 too... ~vbbn~, on jul 15 2008, 11:30 am, said: aw, sinners' playing with toys again! when did i stop? elishelrot, on jul 15 2008, 05:54 pm, said: thanks for your report and the pics, my sister wants this set, but she's already got the last house and she doesn't play very often with it, but the new one looks very good, too i'm still undecided on if it was a smart buy. she played with it a lot this week, but last week she ignored it... and i had to fix it twice!

1 i bought this today, mainly because it was 25% off, but i'd been eyeing it for a long time. the accessories truly are brilliant! there's so much here to be pillaged for other uses, as people have said. i picked up heaps of new parts i've never had, or rare ones in even rarer colours. to be honest, i was surprised and impressed by the range and versatility of the regular bricks as well. when you look at the box art, what jumps out at you are the giant pink walls and curved pieces, but there's a nice amount of white arches and lime green bricks, not to mention all the windows and the trans blue 1x2x5 bricks. and plants! it's a good thing the target audience likes stickers though, there's more here than i've seen on any set except the 7709 sentai fortress! i think they were aiming for one sticker per page of instructions i hope belville returns in 2010 thanks for the review, sieggy! did your daughter ever go back to it?

0 i recognize the clock! it came with my old airport set 6392 back in 85! in fact according to peeron it mostly came out in train stations link belville looks horrible to me too barbie-ish and does not look lego at all. would prefer they went with paradisa instead.

1 when i saw this topic i was like : "oh my god this set is out since 2007. this guy is so late!" but i read your review and this idea got out of my mind! thank you jim! i have 2 of these and i even have twice more droids than clones! i should have buy more but it's sold out now

1 nice review jimbutcher , this set is for many reasons awesome but unfortunately i just buy one. now i am planning on buying one more in my wal-mart there are like three in stock but with a high price of $19.99 each so maybe just one and will keep it misb .

1 7654: droids battle pack. year: 2007 number of pieces: 102 number of minifigs: 7 price: 9.99 usd brickset hi everybody, and welcome to my fourth review on eurobricks. today, i will review the droid bttle pack set. note: this set originally came with four megaphone blasters for each battle droid, but i replaced them (along with the crooked arms) with the new blaster pistols and new twisted arms. a picture of the box: as it is on the shelves of major-retail stores. a small box, as expected for inexpensive sets like these. note the "build your army" button on the front: tlg obviously is encouraging customers to buy multiples, and with good reason, which will be explained later in this review. an overview of the set's content: you can see a droid carrying vehicle, a stap, and some battle/ super battle droids. a look at the carrier: a light tank. note the guns on the front: the guns and cockpit can turn a little bit left and right from the main body. also, the guns can move up and down, free from the cockpit: and check out the cockpit: two 2x1 center studded plates side by side for the pilot to stand on. now, moving on to the stap: a small, very useful vehicle in the sw universe. these are seen frequently in both the movies and games (as well as other multimedia). the design is very clever, using vertical building and a clear stand. rear view: the guns/ handlebars can go this far back: and finally, the figs: the figs are very good, but very common. we havent seen sbds in a while, and now instead of metallic blue, they are metallic dark grey. the worst part of this set is that the battle droids have the old arms and guns, while the droids in the mtt and clone pack (both of the same year as this) have the new ones. i wonder why tlg decided to do that... again, this set originally came with four megaphone blasters for each battle droid, but i replaced them (along with the crooked arms) with the new blaster pistols and new twisted arms. so thats about it, heres the... final verdict: build: 8/10, very easy, should take the seasoned builder about 5-10 minutes. playability: 6/10, has a few play feature, but nothing exciting. is good for mocs and army building. swooshability: 8/10, i suppose you could fly around the stap... minifigs: 7/10, the battle droids are good, but very common, and the dont come with new arms or guns. the sbds are very nice, and in a new color. all figs are great for army building. design: 8/10, the stap was clever, but the carrier was a little bulky. price: 10/10, as fair as it gets. overall: 7.5/10, the figs are great to have and make mocs and armies, and the vehicles are pretty cool (the carrier is a little lame). the main problem with this set is that the bds dont get the new guns or arms, so they dont fit in with all the new sets. also, droids arent as cool as clones. but the price is very fair. and now, my review has ended. unfortunately, i believe this will be my last review for a long time for two reasons: one, the remaining sets that arent done (according to kimt's index) i either don't have or are broken or have missing pieces. and two, my budget is low right now, and i wont be able to get the clone wars sets right when they are released, so someone will probably beat me to reviewing them. too bad, because i would love to do an rgs review... well, as always, comments very welcome!

0 the rancor, on jul 12 2008, 09:11 pm, said: thanks for the review... ...unfortunately the droid battle pack is discontinued for the uk s@h ...also the clone battle pack is discontinued for the usa s@h ( for the americans) really? wow, i'm luckier than i thought. i think i will buy another droid bp.

0 that's strange. i saw about 20 of them in my tru. anyways, nice review. i thought this set was great for armies.

1 thanks for the review jimbutcher . i think this set is cool especially the cool redesigned stap i just it.

1 great review of a lovely set! thank you! sadly i don't see my 6641 really often, because it is kind of in the back of my shelf. but i might get it and swoosh it (?) a few times...! imho i think 6675 is a little bit more aggressive. cool! please make more!

0 glad you guys liked this review. bernddasbrot, on jul 13 2008, 07:33 pm, said: great review of a lovely set! thank you! sadly i don't see my 6641 really often, because it is kind of in the back of my shelf. but i might get it and swoosh it (?) a few times...! imho i think 6675 is a little bit more aggressive. cool! please make more! swoosh it around?? i will prefer to use it to "vrooom" it around on my road baseplates. bernddasbrot, thanks for reminding me of the 6675. i will need to find it and restore it first. meanwhile, watch out for more upcoming classic town reviews.

-1 hmmm.... i probably would not have bought this as a kid in 1987, unless i had money to spare or the shop had no other set from space or castle, the two other big lines in 1987, and no better set in the town section. i think it's a great parts pack, but the model itself does not look very attractive. i never really liked those wheels, honestly. they're from the basic sets, mostly, and they work pretty well in those, but i'm just not a fan... the roof, on the other hand, was very popular and the blue modified bricks at the front were quite rare in those days, but generally speaking, this was not the star of 1987. gave it a "3"

1 i want it...i want at least five!! where will it be availible?

1 o....m.... g!!!!!!! that looks sweet! how much did he say it was?

0 awww i wanna see it please? edit: omg its all over the interwebs, if you know where it looks amzaing its a giant windmill with a house at bottom edited by pencoin, 14 july 2008 - 05:24 pm.

0 sounds cool but i can't seem to find any of these leaked pics, not even on brickshelf. maybe i am not searching under the right phrases. oh well. i guess i can wait patiently.

0 that sounds amazing! a wind power plant as a lego set is absolutely awesome and helps the lego city to get environmental energy. regrettably i missed the pics. when browsing through bs i didn't find them, too . can someone please post a link or sent me the link/picture via pm ? thanks. klaus-dieter

1 filefolders, on jul 14 2008, 07:29 pm, said: what's so great about the cottage? i do agree that the generator and van are teh pwnzorz. i think the great thing about the cottage is its very reminiscent of classic holiday home type houses that lego used to make like this one from the late 80s which a lot of people (me included) believe lego need to make more of.

0 ok guys, respect tlc? crazy policy (they don´t take care about thiefs selling those sets long before official release,but they complain about one small photo on web ). if someone still needs photo, simply email me on josefzizka@post.cz, i will be glad to send you three pictures

1 i recently got a few still sealed and new sets from the 90' on ebay, and after the rock raider's hover scout this isthe second one i'll review. i really like the space port theme, even if the sets may be more simple than earlier space city sets, i like the overall look and the color scheme. but enough of that, let's go on with the pictures! set nr.: 6455 name: space simulation station number of minifigs: 3 number of pieces: 240 release year: 1999 first again a few pics of the boxes and the instructions: the main box: this theme had a kinda strange seperation of the pieces, the parts for the control center and the shuttle are in seperate little boxes, and the others are in polybags with the models printed on them. also seperate instructions for each step: a general overview: we got 3 lovely minifigs here, from left to right the control engineer, the mechanic and the astronaut: the -i dont know the english word for it- testing-thing, the astronaut is being tested to hard nerves there the mechanics little car, on the back an extinguisher and a radio device is attached: the take-off station for the little shuttle with the shuttle itself on it: and without it: tools, tools, tools! the shuttle as stand-alone: i think that would be fuel tanks, i like this little detail: and finally we have the controll room, would have been better with seats, but it's alright: a really sweet mid-sized set if you ask me, a few juniorized parts, but it fits perfectly with the set. the theme itself is also great, and i wish that tlg brings it back, i could see stunning sets with the quality city sets have right now!

1 i got this set for christmas, and you gave me the feeling for wanting to build it again. thanks for the review!

1 my sister got this from our grandparents once when she was interested with space but it fell into my hands later. i had a lot of fun with that. by the way, the name for the test thing is called a centrifuge. it tests a person's ability to withstand high g-forces. edited by filefolders, 15 july 2008 - 03:55 pm.

0 i had never seen this set or this theme before. it was released during my dark age, and i had missed it. it's nice to see such sets, surface once again, to educate members like me that there are some good sets we had missed during the dark age. and, i must admit that this is a very good set. it's comes with 3 mini-figs and staudie with it. geez, i never thought he was an astronaunt back then. the testing facility is great, and i love to see it spin, by putting staudie in it for a "test-run". the buggy is cute as well, but somehow, i don't really like the white frame at the back. it looked a little odd to me. the tools, are simply wonderful to have. furthermore, these are grey tools. the last time, we had so many tools are the aeroplane mechanic. the shuttle is nice, but does the shuttle supposed to come with a cover as well? i guess, since this is a simulator, they must have cut down the budget for it. the control room is good, and it will be even better with chairs included. metalandi, thanks for the wonderful review!

0 thank you very much for the review. now i remember! i got mission control when i was only 5 and built it with the help of my older sister. i loved it so much, i never rebuilt it but now... i just have to! space simulation was one i never got but looks to be a great set.

1 the copter this is one bigass copter. the photos really don't do the size justice. lower cockpit with cool computer. too bad it's a sticker, although i'll definitely leave this one on. upper cockpit with cool computer. see above. awesome gatling gun. yes, even the technic beams have stickers. i'm actually really fond of that little canister thing. i can see using it elsewhere. yes - that's a sticker. the rope and hook. i forgot to mention it before, this set comes with two accessories besides the machine gun - binocs and one of those little things to slide down the rope. also, the thing that 'extends' the rope turns. the other side, because they're slightly asymmetrical. one of my favorite stickers. the door says 'survival equipment'. it's on both sides. definitely a keeper.

1 another of my favorite parts - landing gear. this is the front section. ... and it retracts! unlike most ships with landing gear, this does not retract without effort (coughxwingcough). very sleek. the back landing gear. ... and again, smooth retraction. gotta love it. final score: 8.4/10 parts: 8/10 figs: 10/10 dinos: 2/10 copter: 9/10 value: 7/10 don't buy if: - you can wait for vikings - you don't like any set with stickers - you're not a space fan buy if: - you're a space fan - you don't mind stickers/don't apply them - you're like to create cool figures overall, i think it was worth the price, even at 605 pieces. however, i'd suggest buying vikings even considering this. well, hope this review (unexpected as it was ;-)) helped someone out there. until next time, bloody jay

0 no, there aren't any pictures yet.

1 wow, great review, for a great set. thanks jay. i really like it, although to big for my city. :( i too really like the mfs. because of your review, i am definitely considering it. thanks again, legobmw.

1 very nice review and nice set to boot. lots of little features that increase the playability. great pics too (i remember you had trouble before with the tower raid castle set, as i just got mine and was looking to review it, but saw your review in archives.....shakes fist at how slow aussies get sets ) great reviews on!

1 good review ;) i will buy it this year :)

0 thebrickster, on jul 18 2008, 02:35 pm, said: excellent review metalandi. it's always great to see early pictures of new sets. this set really reminds me of an oil rig, and could probably be easily modified as one (if one wanted an alternate model). the two components that i like most are the boat crane and the control room, but other sections are pretty slick as well. are those printed pieces in the control room, or stickers? i'm really starting to gain an appreciation for these new coast guard sets. they've come a long way over the years: http://www.majhost.c...guard/09set.jpg 575 coast guard station -released 1978. i picked up the control boat & tower (7739) a few weeks ago but haven't opened it yet). in any case, thanks for taking the time to review this set and share it over eb. first, thanks to all your great response for my review, i'm glad you like this set aswell. as it comes to stickers, the tiles ant slopes in the control room are printed pieces! the rest as coast guard logo patterns and so on are stickers. i forgot to make a photo of the sticker sheet unfortunately

1 i it!! i dont think i'm gonna buy it but i loved the review nice oil rig worker; he looks so rough undersigned mowo

1 thanks for the great review. i'm loving this set a lot - it looks well designed, and the helicopter is awesome! plus, i love the new worker figure with the beard. quote i agree, this is a great set - one of the best of the cg line for sure, way better than the boat set with the tower on the bionicle baseplate i wouldn't say that at all - true, this base is bigger, but the other set was well designed as well - plus the included boat is wonderful.

0 i don't know really. in which country do you live? i haven't been to my local stores for a while now, so i don't know if they have it there, but maybe i'll find some time tomorrow to check it out.

-1 the worker looks like he soiled his pants um oh yeah... nice reveiw! very cool set... im not sure about the bottom floor glass being dark grey and the top floor glass being light blue.

1 nice review! this is just the "crown jewel" for the coast guard theme. i love the layout of its platform. it looks real neat to have it placed it in the midst of the deep blue sea, awaiting of any emergency rescue. sometimes, i feel that this set can used it to merge with my aqua raiders sets. i thought of using it as a land base, for the raiders to dock in their stuff before submerge into the ocean. ok, it's just a wierd idea of mine. just feel that aqua raiders and coast guard can work hand in hand, since they are naval expertise! it seemed, i can't view all the pictures somehow. nevertheless, i can still view some of it quite well. i love the command center. the amount of computer printed pieces simply make me smile, with the monitor, keyboard, radar screen and etc. the helicopter is cute too. however, i pity the victim that is loaded at the back. it seemed a little bit too dangerous. in addition, this set seemed to have quite alot of stickers, which can be quite discouraging. i do hope to see this set soon. so far, i quite like the current coast guard sets.

0 i agree with both of you. first, i have to add, that a few of the stickers were a bit annoying as it comes to put them on espacially the ones on the helicopter, where you have to put them on round parts. but i didn't really see this at a bad point, i really can live with it. second, it was a very hard decision, believe it or not, on which new set to buy, cause i got a huge 2008 set-wantlist. i guess it'll take some time before i can get most of the other sets i want

0 great review metalandi! thanks for posting it with a number of pictures, the only question is why lego decided to produce so many sets i want to buy in one year!

0 thanks! i own this set...! it was a good time as tlg released a lot of little buildings. (just look through the 63xx-setnumbers)

1 gave it a 4. it's not exactly town plan, but it's above average.

0 whitefang, on jul 18 2008, 09:11 pm, said: paramedic unit, does not seem to suit well for this set's name. it should be named as clinic, outpatient treatment, family doctor and etc. the definition of a paramedic is "...someone who assists physicians in providing medical care..." i think in more modern times a paramedic is generally thought of as a more qualified and experienced ambulance technician but the dictionary definition would seem to fit with the lego model quite well. cheers rog

1 i like this set, like most i view it more as a clinic, it sits nicely in my town plan. these old sets are all very cool

0 thanks for all of your encouraging comments! i am glad most of you love to view our classic reviews. do stay out for more upcoming exciting classic town reviews! i appericiate greatly by all of your words. there are many outstanding reviews from brickster as well, especially those classic vintage lego sets, that i had never seen before, except browsing it in brickset. therefore, i will encourage eb members, to take some time off to view these truly wonderful classic reviews. trust me, it shall be an eye opening experience for each and everyone of you, whom had never seen classic town, in such an up close personal experience before. lasse d, on jul 19 2008, 12:22 am, said: this is one of my favorite town vehicles from the old time, and for one specific reason: the truck is on the guys shirt! it didn't matter that the color was wrong, or the hook was missing. i thought it was awesome beyond imagination... for some reason the torso is just lovely! i felt the 6641, 4 wheelin truck is almost identical with the torso, except for the front color combination. click onto the picture for an instant review. bernddasbrot, on jul 19 2008, 02:47 am, said: btw: the 6350 pizza to go van looks soooo cute! yes, that cute pizza van appeared for a reason.

0 oh! never seen that set before! fun and strange that wheel supension system. has it ever been used in any other sets?

1 4/5. i've had this set since i was young. never understood why a tow truck needed to be an off-roader; maybe it was used to tow the other off-road vehicles. the suspension made the truck too tall to tow some cars, so i often took the hook out and use the truck as just an great off-road truck like 6672 (which also had the suspension wheels). other tow truck sets better filled their roles better, but that doesn't diminish this set at all. whitefang, on jul 18 2008, 09:19 am, said: i think it looks really out of proportion. no, for 25-odd years this vehicle was perfectly proportioned with all others in the town/city line. it's all these new 6 and 8 and 20 wide vehicles that are ignoring convention and making it look out of proportion. granted speed racer sets are more of their own line, but 6660 is smaller than most of the cars produced in the last few years.

1 superb review of a great set!this is one of my favourite classic sets becouse of all these functions(engine,suspension)and it's great design with less than 100 pieces used( only 52 )!congratulations for the review!i think that it's an outstanding set and surely worth 5 stars

1 skipper 24, on jul 19 2008, 07:25 am, said: cool set i really loved the classic town sets. this set has lots of detail, great reveiw. do you know what is exxon? thanks skipper. exxon is a big fuel company here in the us. there's a lot of exxon gas stations throughout the country.

-1 i think we only got shell stations in europe in the 80s... never got this one, but it looks like a typical lego gas station ... once again, i just don't know how you were able to keep stickers and prints in such a great condition! i am sooooo jealous! the tires of the cars are a problem though... it was difficult and painful to put them off the wheel and back on later... the black hat... g... i would have looooooved to have that when i was a boy...

0 i much prefer the shell version of that station which had the full awning over the roadway, and the special road plate with the extra lane to pull into to fill 'er up...

1 great review of a classic set. man, this is sure a wondeful kit, even today. the level of detail is astounding for the time, and the whole kit is really cute. you know, i honestly don't get why some people have complained about the city gas station's figure count - the majority of lego gas stations had no more than three figures - including this one and the wonderful gas and wash express (which i actually own!). i also don't get why people complain about the stickers so much - because even older kits often had a lot. personally, i think stickers are okay, because printed pieces can't be used in as many places if the stickers are really specialized.

1 i love this set, it's nice and simple. maybe it's because i build this set by myself by ordering all parts and buildinginstruction. and i made one extra tanktransporter :

1 excellent review, it's nice to see review of old sets that i don't own i hope to see many more. was this released under the esso name int the uk?

1 wow! this is a great mm set! and i wouldn't say that, but wow! this looks awesome. it's not the theme i really want, but if i get this set by accident ( ) i won't mind! hope to see your review soon.

1 iamded, on jul 20 2008, 12:36 am, said: anyway, i don't normally like it when people make a topic to say they'll review a set soon, but i'll let you off since this is one of the few mars mission sets i really like, and i'm glad to know somebody has the set and will be reviewing it. ~peace this practice annoys me as well - especially since i built this set last night and considered making it my first review until i saw this thread. i don't want to step on any toes, so i'll let the original poster go ahead with the full review. in short, to tide everyone over, this set is fantastic. i really like the alien ship, and the main drilling unit/break away ship is an awesome unit with tons of play value. highly recommended! edited by clubninja, 20 july 2008 - 03:41 pm.

0 algernon, on jul 20 2008, 11:54 am, said: anyone know the us release date? i live in the us. basicly that means, it's released, as far as i know.. anyway the review is up!! see the first post! thanks! as for me, i'm off to buil the agent's mobile command center. edited by ~vbbn~, 20 july 2008 - 05:17 pm.

1 wonderful review. i'd die if i had to upload that many pictures... man, this is it: the pinacle of mars mission's second and final year. man, this baby is flawless. there are so many indications that the designers took care in designing this kit - like the space for the pilot's backpack, the compartment for the mini flier, the sturdy leg design - etc etc etc. kudos to tlc for making mars mission go out with a bang. i have high hopes that whereever the space theme goes next year, tlc will make it worth the wait. edited by grevious, 20 july 2008 - 05:43 pm.

1 ok, minus ten for the placeholder, but plus about ten million for the review. this set is just amazing. it's really earned it's colors, and i'm sure no classic space fan can complain, even snefroe . i didn't know it had the tilting function for the drill- s@h is so pathetic with its pictures, and they really missed this amazing function. the detachable ship is so cute, it's almost classic space in it's design. major thumbs up to tlc. hell, make it a hug, even.

0 algernon, on jul 21 2008, 01:36 pm, said: this review should be put on the front page! i agree. i told him that if nothing more exciting turned up i would... and thus i have.

1 holy brick! i just love the water tank and those legs are soooo cool! i dont think i have enough cash to buy after the star wars release...yikes...! thanks vbbn,for a super review!

-1 nice review! i don't mind the set, but, at the same time, i'm not particularly fond of it.

1 i don't like mars mission sets but this one is just spectacular! it is beautiful! i must have this set, even if it means selling my kidney! i only have one mars mission set, the etx alien mothership assault, which is okay. but this set blows my mind! two thumbs up!

1 looks like a great set, i may consider making this the first mars mission set i buy. nice review also. but quote lol, thanks. i just wanted to claim my place for the review. personally i don't think you had a place to claim. somebody else could have also gotten this set and had a proper review ready before yours but felt it was wrong to post because you had posted a placeholder ( clubninja in this case). i think placeholders should be banned and if you are not ready to post a full review you should not post anything. simple really. either that or what is the policy on here regarding more than one review of a set being posted - then you could have both posted reviews and it wont really matter i guess. just my 2 cents worth thanks for the review though.

1 today i'm gonna review the bigger of the 2 castles from the fright knigh theme. i got this one last week at a pretty fair prive at ebay, new and still sealed. i love opening boxes that had been lying arounf for years and being the first to build an old set. since i know this castle theme is not liked so much by the general public, i'll try here and change their minds, cause i really think this is a great set. this time i have to say my pictures turned out pretty amazing, even if i am still using just my cellphone cam, but i'm really pleased now with the quality. here we go! set nr.: 6097 name: night lord's castle number of minifigs: 7 number of pieces: 598 release year: 1997 let's start with a few box & instructions pictures: the inside od the box, with a few alternate models: the back, with another possibility how to assemble the 3 main parts: instructions: next, the 6 minifigs, starting with the witch on her black dragon: all 5 figures of the fright section: and the poor royal knight: we go on with the set itself, first a general overview (it's really high!): on the "first floor" there's a trap with which you can drop stones or other things down on unliked guests, the pot comes originally from fabuland i think, i love this thing: in the same floor there is a second trap, if you pull the bar, the door opens: we move on to the tower itself (did i mention it's really high?), on the ground level there's the place for the witch to do her spells: the wall is a secret door, which reveals a skeleton when turned over: on the next level there is this little thingy, first it only seems like a barrel.... ...but when you pull the two 1x4 tiles on the back, a skull is being revealed, scary, huh : i don't really understand what this is for but i assume it's a telescope to watch and observate the dragons, i do find that a bit senseless since there haven't been telescopes in medieval times (or have there been): the back of the tower with the prison and the room for the treasure chest: the prison opened. it's secured with a chain, which i like very much cause you really can lock it with that: treasure chest: from the highest peak we now go down to the very ground level, at the back of the castle there is another secret wall-door, flanked by two shields: at the back half of the inside there is the throne hall for the bat lord, with a nice warm fireplace in the back (this is, where the secret door is placed): the second half is pretty empty, except for these two baskets. i don't know exactly what they are for, but i ike the idea for using them as water places for the horses: one thing that might be a bit stupid is that 2 of the 4 side entrances do not have doors, so they are open and a guard would have to stand there the whole day. you can see it in his face he isn't very happy with that : that was my last review of the sets i got the last weeks, but i'm looking forward to make much more in the future. overall this is a pretty good set, i don't know any other one with so much details and playability. the minus point is, as already said, that it is too open on the sides, but that can be solved easily with a bit of modding. also i must say, this set isn't that much juniorized as many might have thought, though the design is a bit unconventional, but exactly that's what i like most about it. all in all it gets a 9/10 for me hope you enjoyed the reading and the pictures, can't wait to see your response. edit: oops, i forgot to put one figure of the fright knight faction on the photo, but it's the one in the last picture. edited by kimt, 10 august 2008 - 01:28 pm.

1 i thoroughly enjoyed your review metalandi, thank you especially for taking photos of all the contraptions and detailing exactly how they work. as a member of classic-castle, the census always seemed to be that fright knights were a class 4/10 or 6/10 but as sandy stated above, it is one of the closest you can get to an evil faction. by today's standards, the contraptions seen here are much much more sophisticated and well thought out and are definitely missing in 2007's king's castle siege. i enjoy the design of this castle much more even if the towers are taller simply because the design in the king's castle siege left builders with an empty space right in the courtyard without even a base plate! and it's nearly impossible to get your hands in and play in the enclosed space (why would anyone unless you're simply posing figs, and even that was difficult). this castle instead, had a variety of trap doors and surprises, so despite the varied colors used here, it's not that hard to realize that the designers for this castle really took time to think things out and tried to make the castle enjoyable for the children that will play with it whereas our 2007 castle was strictly built to give kids the impression of an enormous magnificant castle with little to nothing inside. it's like comparing beauty (2007) to brains (this castle). edited by legobear, 20 july 2008 - 01:32 am.

1 i have this set, and ilike it! 6097 have many usefull parts! greate review!

0 metalandi, thanks for doing this fright knights review, by opening up a misb set which you have bought recently. i am very sure the feeling is very nice, especially touching the bricks which is preserved for 11 years sealed in bags. i am quite fond of the fright knights theme. unfortunately, this theme was released during my dark age. i never really bought sets from fright knights. instead, i bought plenty of minifigs to build an army. if i could turn back time or find another misb set with a reasonable price, i am very sure i will get it. my soldiers need a castle to stay in. i will be looking forward to your next review. keep up the good job

1 ah this brings back memories, i have this set and i loved the playabilaty factor opposing to older castle sets i have! in medieval times there actually were primitive telescopes, you can read about it here. thanks for this review, great storie, great pics!

1 good review - the photo from above shows off the scale of the castle much better than the box photo. i was one of those who always thought this set looked lame, ever since first seeing it in the catalogue. a couple of my siblings had smaller bat lord/fright knight sets and enjoyed the accessories and style of the minifigs etc. so last year having not only ended my dark ages, but done so for some of the rest of my family, i got this set off ebay for my sister for christmas. i of course had to build it to make sure all parts were there before leaving ebay feedback and ending the transaction. first impressions were of how much brick there was to the set, as well as really useful large structural elements. and to be honest, while perhaps a bit childish, there's no doubt the style of the minifigs is kinda cute and useful for customs. it was really enjoyable building this set, and the scale is impressive when built, empty spaces notwithstanding (but hey, lego has always had buildings with no back, etc. - just use your imagination and enjoy the access to playspace offered). the traps etc. are neat and more like the kind of "action features" modern sets come with (i for one am in favour of these, for kids they are fun and i think for builders they give ideas cause they are often done with minimal parts or impact on the set design). anyways, needless to say my sister loved the set. indeed she's currently rebuilding it for the second time. if i see it as cheap again, i will pick up one for myself. i got the first one at €30 incl postage i believe.

1 quite the topic bump, but dang, what a cool set, and so tall. this is the kind of sets i had as a kid, but i don't remember this one. i'm jealous.s

-1 i got a couple of the small sets from this line when it came out. recently, i acquired several more from bricklink because i just really love the way they look. this theme really had good intentions, but the execution was flawed. i hope one day lego returns to a darker tone, but maybe next time it could be more castlevania inspired. that would really turn some heads! plus, vampires and gothic aesthetics are really popular now. it will probably have run its course by the time lego would be able to develop a theme around them, though.

1 great review again it's nice to see old sets reviewed. i love the control stickers there's a great level of detail this is really the second best fire station in my opinion.

1 a 5/5. the set is beautiful, both the remake and the original. a classic and a beautiful thing, like dos. edited by maiq the liar, 20 july 2008 - 09:45 pm.

1 great review. i love tis set too, the best firestation ever made by lego. mainly because the '80s sets are the favourite with me. only i miss a helicopterplatvorm, well i made a little modification:

1 i am a proud owner of this set this is one of the best fire stations ever. what amazes me is what the designers made with only 368 pieces. you get a very nice looking building in good size, a good baseplate, 2 cars, 4 minifigs, accessories... and great alternative ideas in the back of the box (like the fire boat or helicopter). this is a great example of lego design.

1 i must agree great fire station, i love the fact that in the classic sets you were given a base plate and some other great idea's. i do miss the addition of base plates and alternate building idea's. the only newer set i have seen with any alternate build photo's is the 7239 fire engine. i miss back when.......

0 i honestly glad i got the latest fire station [cant remember set number] its waayyy better i voted 3 its realy not that great but its ok.....

0 thebrickster, thank you so much for all these reviews of classic town sets!! omfg, this set was released in 1982 and i was born 1 year earlier, hehe :) nice little heli!

1 a great small set! i remember this set most of all because of the inverted window screen. loooooved the chopper, but never got it... another "5" please

1 i owned this set, and i loved it. great idea to have the reversed windshield.

0 thanks for another great review. i can remember the 6358 very vividly. my parents bought the 6340 for me and a girl friend got the 6358. i'm quiet sure it's my envy because until now i want to believe that the 6340 is better. my reasons were these: i own the 6340 (and on the instructions of the 6358 stood "legoland" which i thought of as old.) but this review induced me to get over this humiliation from my childhood ( ) and check ebay for the 6358. edited by bernddasbrot, 21 july 2008 - 04:07 pm.

1 a truly great set. i always loved the mobile crane and was gobsmacked when this popped up using some of the great features from the crane but also making it an emergency vehicle too! great classic firemen and - in your version - a suspiciously blue fire extinguisher great review of a great set - just a pity i no longer have it... so many sets i used to have got lost during the period at the end of my childhood before i rescued what was left from my dad's house once i realised what i had left behind!! hindsight is a great thing?? cheers again rog

0 a great review, i like this set it captures the classic town feeling well, and the ladder is cool! i can't help but feel thought that these reviews are being churned out to quickly, you should leave a gap, i am being flooded with all these great reviews!

0 nice reveiw it looks like a great set i think i know what i will do tonight- rebuild my lego fire department it has- [fire pickup truck, fire truck [from 2005 sorry cant remember set number] and the most recent fire station if i can find all the pieces......

1 that's a great review/poll, whitefang! i gave this set a 5: it's simply ! the only thing which i miss are the respirators for the firemen since they already own air tanks. but otherwise this set is brilliant! i like it much more than the new one from 2007 since it's not that big and juniorized. klaus-dieter

0 quote i am not against with the newer sets. it just that, part of the reasons which reflected in the review had fufill the basic key factors of a typical fire engine. in addition, it was my all-time favourite under the "fire-fighting" theme. yes, i agree! this set is wonderful even today, and is one of the best fire kits ever release. and actually, realistic scale is not really a necessity in lego - it's just my personal taste. for example, i've never liked the tiny planes in the old airports that much, but i can see why a lot of people like them better than the new ones. edited by grevious, 28 july 2008 - 03:17 pm.

1 one of my all time favourite i still love it even after all these years, though it did always seem a bit out of place as when i was a child i’d never seen a similar looking fire appliance in the uk.

1 where do you come from? england? if so i gotta be getting to my local tru or woolworths! edit: wacthing the pics come through, looks so complex...gonna be a brilliant build! edited by joey lock, 21 july 2008 - 05:39 pm.

0 oops, i missed that, guess i just over reacted. random spellingg mistaks on!! edited by yorkiejim, 21 july 2008 - 06:25 pm.

0 can i see a close-up from that bacta tank?

0 nice pictures, but three questions: 1. how many pages do the instruction books have? 2. what are the spare parts? or: does this laaty come with two clone-commander-equipment sets and four assaij ventress lightsaberhilts? 3. where did you get it? 4. how much did it cost?

1 it looks like a really good set and like it is a lot larger than the old one. thanks for the review!

-1 this sounds very similar to the first one. i'm glad i'm saving this one till later in my purchasing cycle. all the sw walkers have a skeletal fram with almost nothing inside. it's very disappointing, but i guess filling them in would up the piece count considerably. does this beast have any good handholds for picking it up? i seem to recall a handle or something coming out of the top in the pre-release pics.

0 thanks for the reivew. could you post a few pics of the at-te in all it's glory? kimt

1 just picked this set up, and just took a break from building to go to football practice. i have just finished building all of the legs, and so far it looks like it is going to be a great set. i would have like it if more clones were included, but whatever. i find it interesting how many clone accessories they give you. i don't like it only because i can't decide what i want to use. i find it interesting that at lease 2 people are missing pieces. i have had multiple times where i thought i was missing pieces, only to find that they were in the bag somewhere. other than the fact that there is a lack of minifigures, i love this set and can't wait to finish it later tonight. edited by swman, 04 august 2008 - 08:33 pm.

-1 i just got this set sunday, and it's so huge that i can't put it anywhere. it is pretty sturdy and heavy, that's where the handle comes in. i'm pissed that you only get 2 clones. rex has to fight on the ground while you need more clones to man the guns/cockpit. the legs were the most annoying and time consuming part of the build. and yea i agree, that if tlg had made numbered bags, it would have taken only 2 hours rather than 4. edited by ih master 13uilder17, 14 october 2008 - 11:38 pm.

0 sorry for reanimating this topic. there is a technic brick in the mid section of this set. does anyone know the function of that ??

0 i dont think we have instuctions yet... but on topic, i have an at-te in the mail, on the way, so i should have a review of it in the next week or so. jifel

0 exactly kim, that's what i meant. i pondered and wondered that for a long time :) i decided to ask here when a friend wondered the same thing. i hope it fits with the new droship. it would be really cool. and it's also great that tlg knows what they'll be prodcuing a year later..

0 yeah, when i built it, i wondered for a long time. i considered many possiblities temporarily, like either tlc had gone crazy or i had missed a page in the instructions.

0 jimbutcher, on jul 28 2008, 12:20 am, said: hey everyone, i just got the rgs yesterday at tru after i came home from camp. i saw all of the topics that i missed, and noticed a mini-review and a review with one pic, so i thought i'd make a huge, shiny new review that has lots of pictures and all of the requirements of kimt's index. i'm about halfway through building it, so expect the full review tomorrow. hoope you guys will like it! mabye you shouldnt reserve threads and actually wait till your done. the threads wont run off i assure you!

0 thank you oky wan, and apologies to the rest of you guys, i guess i was rushing a bit and didn't think this through, it was wrong of me to reserve a review, if someone does an in-depth review before me, someone please close this topic. otherwise, i guess i will do it. again, many apologies for opening this topic before i actually had a review, bad example from me, very sorry!

0 can't wait my friend!

0 hey guys, the full review is up, check it out! i guess its a little late, but, warning: picture heavy.

0 i wonder if the only way to have a "functioning" open/close cockpit is with super-glue

1 i really like the new gunship. different enough from the old one to be better, but similar enough that they don't look totally weird together. really like the new minifigs. didn't think i would like the new clone troopers at all. the accessories are fine. i would never use them on the regular clones, but to each their own.

0 what's this thing on the clone at right ??

0 ah yeah, sorry ! of course ! i see. thanks.

1 thanks for the review jimbutcher . i really like this new gunship but i can´t own one until like two or three months and this is with all the clone wars sets .

1 whitefang, on jul 29 2008, 12:54 pm, said: jimbutcher, finally i had seen something that is worth reading and viewing. imho, this is your best star wars review i had ever read. most importantly, it is a complete review which has substance. you have my thanks! keep up the good job wow, that means a ton, whitefang! thanks a bunch! and i agree, you should try to get this one asap, you won't regret it. i personally don't think it's overpriced, the new molds give it a higher price, considering 1 old mold ( ) is worth 10 cents.

1 hey everyone, my wife took me to legoland for my birthday just last week. we had a fantastic time and it gave me the chance to pick up some of the new castle sets and battlepacks i was really impressed by the sets i bought and decided to do my first review... let battle commence! set name: tower raid set number: 7037 price gbp: £19.99 pieces: 364 the models here's a shot of the complete set: the set is made up of two models, the crown knight's tower and the orc's siege tower. let's start with the crown knight's tower: a knight readies himself for battle! my favourite model from the set, the wicked orc's siege tower: please note that for the purposes of display i mounted the orc's banner onto a small cone set on the top platform of the siege tower. this doesn't come with the set but saves any orcs having to hold onto it all he time! there are other areas it can be placed without using extra parts. features both models look great and have excellent features. the set as a whole has great playability and seems to have been concieved with a storyline: the crown knight's have a captured orc within the walls of their tower so the orc army has been sent out to recover him... or are they merely after the gold the knights keep horded away?! the orc's siege tower has a powerful ram - spring-loaded by the simple arrangement of an elastic band - so pulling it back sends it flying out the front, knocking down the wall on the side of the knight's tower... ...and releasing the captive orc! the floor panels inside the prison are laid over a lip on the inside of the collapsible wall, so fall in when they're not supported. there's a string at the rear for extending the boarding ramp... ...and letting a fearsome orc warrior charge across! flick-fire action! the battle heats up as the orcs close in! the minifigures the crown knights: i really like the crown knights. they're metallic helmets look great and they come with nice accessories. the archer has a double printed head with a frightened look on the other side too! i'm not surprised, i'd be frightened when staring over the ramparts at these... the orcs: these guys really do look the part, worthy advesaries to the crown knights! the details are superb: the printed elements, weapons and helmets, all set the orcs aside on the battlefield. the set comes with a great new molded armour neckpiece too. the mighty orc leader looks wicked in his full battlegear! overview there's so much to this set it's hard not to be impressed. the orc's siege engine is a thing of beauty (or terror!) and would look great on any battlefield. the crown knight's tower although basic, looks good and has great playability. i'm a big fan of the new castle knights and fantasy minifigures and the inclusion of five of them is just enough for this set and as a booster to any army. at £19.99 in the uk this set is well worth the money for content and quality. i'd highly recommmend this set as a must-have purchase for anyone a final shot of the siege tower with a host of orcs ready for battle: i hope you enjoyed my review, i'll be posting my next one for 7040 dwarves mine defender soon!

1 i got this set in the spring during my "buy every new castle set available"-season. granted, i couldn't afford all of them, but i do have most of them now. anyway, i love the action elements to this set, and the siege tower really does look wicked. i'd like to attach the crownie tower to the king's castle to see how it fits, but i unfortunately don't own that set (yet). i also love the turning head of the soldier, and i've used it in my princess quest-comic as well, along with the turning head of the princess. the troll leader brings good variety to the army of trolls, but they still could use another face type and more torso options. it's a nice review, in any case, although the set pretty much speaks for itself.

1 hey, good review and good photos. i also got this set just recently, and i wasn't very enthusiastic about it at the beginning, but after i built it i could appreciate it. the siege engine is very nice, but my complaint has do with the proportions of the knight's tower in respect to the trolls' machine - it's a bit smaller, and less bulkier. that complaint has to go with some other sets too. for example the troll warship is really humongous - it feels like it can load the evil wizard's tower and sail off. other than that - a good set, i like it, 4/5 from me.

1 i scream clone, on jul 29 2008, 04:42 pm, said: very nice review pedro! you beat me to it. there was a review done about january, but i wanted to have a go, just haven't opened the box yet..... great pics and well demonstrated action elements too. i rate this as one of the coolest castle sets just for its playability and 5 figures. this will def add to my orc army, and i may purchase more of this set if they dont release a orc bp. keep up the good work! for now, there is the impulse set... great review and excellent photography, i love this set, as it has many good features and the siege tower is the best tlc one yet! thanks again!

1 a great price point for a nice bunch of figs and accesories. pity about the fleshies though... god bless, nathan

1 i picked this up last weekend, mainly also for parts. it came with two mutt heads instead of a irena head. :( but anyway, it's a nice little $10 set...we need more sets like this that include these myriads of "detail" parts.

0 i was tempted to go buy this setbecause i havn't got a indiana jones . but when i went to get it and there was none .i still havn't got a indiana jones

0 hello again! wow, this really is an in depth review! at first when i pictures of the set i thought... "yeah, kinda boring." but after reading your review, i think i might buy it (when it's cheaper). the pieces look very good, and i love the droids and their accesories! thanks for the review! also, awesomestar, i knwo it is a default thingy but it would be good if the quote was taken out of your post as it does clutter up the topic (or "yopic" as dsr calls it).

-1 darthperson, on jul 29 2008, 07:15 pm, said: did you really need to quote the entire review, i had to scroll down for about five minutes to see the rest of the thread.... well sor-ree! alright, i'll remember next time.

1 , that was a weird race! anyway, i love the look of both sets, but i'll have to go for the dino attack quad for a couple of reasons: it is post-apoc, which i love, features tan and dark red colours which are far more useful than yellow, you get more "bang for your buck" with the dino set, you get a little dino (sure you can hate it but better than not having one right?), and the fig has much more useful pieces and a better face. thanks for the face off thebrickster! batbrick away!

1 that was an intresting race and i was split between the two until i saw whitefang`s reply and the fact you can use the sprinter as a militery thing(which you could do for both but sprinter just pulls it off better) and i like the radar on the back of it so i`ll have to go with the street sprinter. thanks for the nice topic brickster

1 i like the dino thingy because of the pieces and the dino is a lot of fun on its own (i know, thats akward)...

1 ooooooh! this is a very hard choice,i like this new coast guard theme but i loved! dino attack.the dino attack set has a weird looking gun,but imo the coast guard set looks.........cleaner if you get what i mean.the little dino/lizard thing is practically worthless (thats why i have a bin full of those little guys).i want to keep liking dino attack i just can't.so i know your like "just get to the point already!" so i guess i have to go with coast guard. thebrickster, on aug 3 2008, 09:41 am, said: i did not know that europe had a different quad (or at least one without the bazooka). interesting that the gun was removed from the european sets, or added to the us sets. i sort of like the chain. i also notice a big difference in the boxart. destroyed city to prehistoric volcano. i wonder if the story was different as well? thanks for sharing a good picture. ----------------------------------------- well, it does look like the dino quad has the upper hand; almost double the votes. wow i would have so much wanted the european one more than the us one, i mean that bazooka or as they called it a "sonic screamer" looks very silly

-1 i know it would really go well with the rgs but it is not enough for £50. ill wait for the sales at christmas.

-1 nice review , for portugal it costs 60€. i also consider it oversized, it shold be the third of that size... portugal and spain may have good prices but 90€ for the v-19 must be a tippo.

1 nice review, thanks for taking the time to share your thoughts. looks like a really nice set and i'll be picking it up eventually when it makes it to the us.

0 do you have any pics of the wheels? i wanna see what those are like.

1 great review! i really like the look of this set, and having played a lot of battlefront i am quite keen to pick one up in australia when it comes out (after the ds is paid off) looks like some nice greebling and cool colour scheme too.

1 must buy now!!!! totally sweet! not available in canada yet well designed and cheap (for clone wars!) i'm going to mod it so that it looks like the imperial version

1 this and the at-te and the spider tank and maybe the droid gunship are the few clone wars sets i'll buy. i loved playing as this tank in the clone wars video game( even better with cheat codes for extra missile spam ), so this is a must get.

-1 thanks for posting the review, i’ve been wondering about this set. to me it does feel a bit fig light, for £50 i’d expect maybe one or two more clones. i’m not to sure about the oversized issue, it seems to me it’s better to have something a bit to large and have a better level or features than something smaller will less.

1 i personally think this is a great set, but a little pricey. i wish it was available in the us though.

0 i wish they made more sets with those colored droids as well. we should have got them with the hailfire droid and dwarf spider set i think. i also just noticed look the ball turret on the manual there's no markings on it.

1 great review! man doi wish i had those red droids. i'm using the dell xps-1, and holy crap is it clear. those pics were beautiful!

0 ~vbbn~ the pics were 12 mega pixles which is quite a lot i think, although i had to scale them down to 800x600. i used to dream that tlg would bring out these sets of the geonosis arena and you could join them together to make a massive arena but i doubt they would ever do that. also look out for my forth coming reviews of 4500 snow speeder, some tie fighter with a lul dv, and gg wheel bike chase. i have taken all the pics all i need to do is upload them. also i would review the jango fett's slave 1 but i have customized it so much i don't really want to revert it back to it's original state. edited by skipper 24, 02 august 2008 - 07:18 pm.

1 great review! really shows off the main aspects of the set. wish i had picked up a tie when they were around... dsr

1 this set was on my wanted list for a long time and the sales at s@h came just in time i also loved the set, and like you only put the stickers on the toll both (it looks great on a town layout with almost no modifications). the racers are great. the trucks and the limo are the best in my oppinion. the sticker sheet is huge, but i've seen bigger. stickers over multiple pieces are the worst the slammers are ok, but not great. i played with my 4 years old son and we tryed to do what shows in the box (the cars passing the toll, jumping the ramps and crashing the trucks) but it is very difficult to get it right. but the crashes are very fun.

1 thanks for the review. i'll definately get this set sooner or later. imo the tiny turbos are awesome. i actually bought nearly every set so far, built the models, added the stickers and packed them away in zip-lock bags in the attic. sadly i don't have display room for them (yet). a fine set, carwise.. dump the slammers and buildings into the spare bag and keep the cars. kimt tiny turbos on!

1 thanks for the review! i have quite a few tts.(tiny turbos). i never got this one, but if it's on sale....

1 great review! i bought this set when it came out but sold it a couple years later for some extra cash. i have no regrets selling this one, as i was never really impressed with it (different story for the 4483 at-at - oh how i wish i still had that one). the snowspeeder was alright, just didn't have any sort of "wow" factor to it. the best part of the set is probably the rebel trooper. looking at the last photo in your review, looks like you're about to have a major battle in your hallway. apart from the snowspeeder & motorized at-at, i see the arc-170 fighter, grievous's starfighter, and is that a podracer i see -- and what is the set with the treads? it's not star wars, but looks like a pretty cool set (maybe a mission mars vehicle).

0 skipper 24, on aug 4 2008, 12:52 pm, said: podracer not sure where you got that from (i didn't have them out)? i noticed the minifig between the grievous starfighter & the mod-dino2010 vehicle and it looked like a little person sitting in the pod of his podracer. guess my eyes are playing tricks on me -- my eyesight is shot & my wife keeps pushing me to go visit the optometrist.

0 nope there is a guy sitting there. he's there because on dine 2010 there were no guns like on dino attack, so so i made a big gun like on the dino attack set. i can see where you got the pod racer idea from now.

1 you have to love the originals, well i didn't like the very first snowspeeder so this is the original to me. i like it more then the new one that comes with the echo base, beter color scheme and more realistic i think. i got this set in stores and still love it to this day =]

1 good review, i like it a lot. nice job

-1 not one of my favourite sw sets. kinda boring and the set is poorly designed imho. we do get the general, but that's not nearly enough. thanks for the reivew and fine pics. kimt

0 i had this set (£15 rrp actually ;-)) and agree mostly with your review, although on the wheel bike itself two legs can be placed at the front end and two at the back to enable it to 'roll' properly. boga is very juniorised, and the set itself is very simple and contains many large pieces. the minifigures are good though (i traded my gg however ). just to offer my personal thoughts; build: 5/10 minifigs: 10/10 parts: 3/10 price: 7/10 playability: 10/10 overall 7/10 -- (not an average) tk

1 stash2sixx, on aug 3 2008, 05:19 pm, said: i have all three of the slave i ships, and i agree with kimt...although it is a very small, compact ship, the first slave i (boba fett) is still the sturdiest. the newest slave i (boba fett) is not bad, and is of much better construction than this slave i from jango fett. even though i like the size and scale of the jango slave i and the newest boba fett slave i...when you pick that very first one up, it had the feeling of....."you can throw me against the wall, drop me off the roof of your house, or let 4 two year olds play with me...i'm not gonna break!" at least thats's my opinion. good review that's the exact explaination i was looking for. the old one feels...well...it's just special. kimt

0 i never got the original boba fett's slave 1. i wish they would make one to scale with the minifigures. i would be so cool. i am also putting up a review of the clone turbo tank probably tomorrow. it is a different variation to the one in the index. edited by skipper 24, 03 august 2008 - 07:12 pm.

0 thanks for the review. it looks like an interesting set, even if not as good as boba's. skipper 24, on aug 3 2008, 08:11 pm, said: i never got the original boba fett's slave 1. i wish they would make one to scale with the minifigures. i would be so cool. you mean it would be so cool? i agree that it would be, if they made a large minifig scale version like with the ucs millenium falcon. i would probably try to buy that. edited by shoc, 03 august 2008 - 08:31 pm.

-1 that was indeed a set that never appealed to me. its build was just plain wrong and awful. i only bought it because i found it on clearance at around 15€ (and they had 4 of them. if i had known better then, i'd have bought all 4; seeing how much that jango fett minifig is worth now... ) but i ended up heavily modifying it in its propoions and now it looks ok next to the new slave one (which is the best one of its 3 incarnations, i think)

0 very good review! i have he newest slave i and i like it more than this one. dsr

0 okay i have fixed that pic (thanks oky wan). i have modified this but then yesterday i built it back to its original state to review it.

0 you added some decals to the jango figure, right ? they seem to be suffering a little. i remember buying this set from the discount tent after my first visit to legoland windsor. i wasn't sure whether to buy it, even in their sale ... but i was glad i did once i'd built it :)

1 outback desert racer g'day mates! today from the legoland's desert down under, i'll be sharing an image review of outback set #6550, desert racer set #: 6550 theme: outback year released: 1997 piece count: 48 minifigs: 1 list price: $4 (usd) starting with an image of the box: and the back side with three alternate models: instructions and decals: the pieces: a side view of the vehicle: diagonal view: one minifig: and the complete set: pros: - price is under $5 ($4 usd retail) - good impulse set - goes well with other outback sets - combination of yellow and green pieces - working doors and liftable top for playability cons: - stickers on doors, hood, and 1x4 tile. no printed pieces - no accessories (a wrench, gas can, and other extras would have added to the set) - no extra tire for blow outs summary: i picked this set up new a number of years ago as a true "impulse buy", after buying one of the larger outback sets (amazon crossing or outback airstrip). it's a neat little addition to the theme with its working doors and playability factor. although i only built it once before today, i would buy again if i had the opportunity. hooroo for now! some good aussie music to leave you with: down under

1 this set looks liek a good buy for $4. wish it was still around, but like you said, it needs accessories.

0 i remember having this set (actually i even still have it, at least the pars are somewhere ) when i was a child, and i used it for making races, as it is there for. all these many reviews let me think again at that i also planned to make some reviews for the town section. i got your message thebrickster, don't worry! i got a lot to do at the moment, but i should find some time this upcoming week.

0 this little set really makes my point small playable inspiration to build the set into a few other models, great set i wish i had it my town is going to need more vehicles. i really miss main model instructions with alternate build idea's.

1 7261 clone turbo tank parts: 801 figs: 8 price: £70.00 (ouch! ) edit: new box pics added. my version of the set comes with a normal mace windu figure and an extra clone trooper. also the mace windu, barc trooper and jet trooper minifigs were exclusive to the set (well you could make the jet trooper yourself) . also my set came with 4 extra blasters (you'll see them later) and baby blue vent things instead of trans blue. 1.manual & box the front of the box. the box compared to the motorized at-at and the hailfire droid and dwarf spider droid. minifgs. the back which has pics of the sets functions and alternate models. inside the box it has a white cardboard divider probably for strength seeming as the box it so flimsy. pretty hefty manual. the tt manual compared to the one of the at-at ones. random shot. another random shot. poster at the back of the manual 2. general set and minifigs the whole set. i accidentally left one of the plates up when i took the pic. close up of the figs. two battle droids come with blasters and a mini turret. the republic. from l-r: jet trooper, mace windu (not lul), barc trooper, normal clone, the commander, look out. jet pack. mace's torso. barc trooper legs. barc trooper torso. he has got to be my favorite clone trooper by tlc. the mysterious commander. on lsw he was called cody (right) but he has star corps armour making him commander bly (left) . normal clone and the look out clone with electro binoculars. 3. speeder bike side view of the barc speeder. menacingish front view. (is menasingish a word?) printed back engine piece. one of my shield things came with a crumpled handle it is worse than it looks in the pic. 4. the turret the turret. it can rotate and point upwards. but what if you want to blast all those battle droids that are shorter than the height of the turret blasters... add another hinge in! that extra hinge in action. 5. the tank it's to big to get a decent side view pic johnny the cabin boy on the crows nest. front 2 seater cockpit. the 2 seats. better be careful you don't fall off your seat there are some pretty big gaps down the sides. back cockpit with dual missile launchers. the back seat. the engine. the large central storage. the turret controls fold down to lock into place so it doesn't fall out when driving. you can put 2 minifigs up top. mace and a clone driving. you can see those 4 extra blasters, 2 orange at the front of the pic and 2 between the chairs. the turret and jet trooper. barc trooper on the barc speeder. the commander on the lift chair in the back cockpit. another shot of that chair. 6. overall build: 8/10 quite enjoyable because it incorporates technic and system parts. minifigs: 9/10 on a set this size it has quite a lot including some exclusives such as the barc trooper but it could of had a droid or 2 more. design: 7/10 way out of scale but generally pretty strong due to the technic frame. parts: 7/10 lots of plates and nice minifig parts. price: 6/10 justifiable because of the amount of figs in the set. playability: 7/10 includes some cis units to fight the clones. overall:8/10 needs more droids and it could be bigger. i will also probably have a break form reviewing for now seeming as i have just put out a whole load of reviews. edited by kimt, 09 august 2008 - 08:51 pm. indexed as 7261 review 2

1 nein! you rejected lul. lul's are awesome! thanks for the review! i like the set a lot, mace is only featured here. great fig of him too, i like the grey jedi robes torso. cody is great as with the other figs. the tank's probably a second favourite, next to the mighty at-at of course.

0 i hate how the original release had the light-up windu, which was really lame, and one less clone trooper. i bought it when it first came out, so missed out on a good windu and another clone trooper.

0 good set, but it's flimsy as sin (but that may have been my rush job building it). mine got shoved off a bed oh, and i lost my light up mace >.> propably somewhere within the blue bin 'o' doom™ (aka the brick bucket™, or block/null™ ) edited by maiq the liar, 04 august 2008 - 10:15 pm.

1 nice review again, skipper. i passed on this one because of the price, but it's a nice set. good for you for getting the newer version with non-lul mace and an extra clone. that purple blade sure is a beauty. the tank itself is alright, just an at-at on wheels, in my opinion. the turret is great, though, and so is the speeder bike. i didn't realize that the jet pack had two "nailguns" (harpoon guns) on it. i thought that the nailgun was a new piece... but the jetpack is very cool.

0 i wonder why this set had no blue or black astronauts? whatever the case, i always loved the small minifig sets that lego released, as i could never get enough astronauts. my favorite was the set of futuron astronauts. why would the yellow astronauts freak you out, sinner? is it because they look nekkid? ;-)

-1 kdog, on aug 5 2008, 04:45 am, said: why would the yellow astronauts freak you out, sinner? is it because they look nekkid? ;-) you bet! but this set is still the most freaky...

0 he does have a cape, a cap and a bandana around his head. that's not the same as being bare as when born. edit: oh yeah, he's also got red gloves on as well btw what does this have to do with the 6701 space minifigures review?

1 7674 v-19 torrent number of pieces: 471 number of minifigs: 1 price: £49.99 the v-19 torrent starfighter was an assault fighter with exceptional speed and maneuverability used by the galactic republic during the clone wars.it was a predecessor of the alpha-3 nimbus-class v-wing starfighter, in terms of purpose and usage. it first appeared in the genndy tartakovsky?€™s clone wars 2d series. basics box front: the box art shows the torrent flying above tatooine, with the new blue and white ?€œclone wars?€? style packaging, box back: the back shows some of the features of the set including the lifting mechanism and adverts for 7679 republic gunship, 7675 at-te and the 7673 magnaguard starfighter inside the box, there are 2 instruction books, a very small dss and 9 bags that are not numbered. bags: instruction books random manual shot parts list book one is mainly the construction of the body and one of the engines, book 2 is the other engine and the wings. for better pics of the manual look on lego's website. sticker sheet: a very small sticker sheet is included, which includes 2 republic insignias and a nose sticker. minifigure one minifigure is included, a clone pilot. the whole "omg only one minifigure in this set" and "its not movie accurate, i hate you tlc!!!11one2" has been beaten to death, so please don't make this review turn into that and to be honest i don't care because its an awesome figure. tlc have made the effort to print the life support device onto the chest plate so props to them. he has the "clone head" like the rest of the clones have in the cw releases, there are no extra clone bits apart from a long blaster, that's not included here. interesting/other pieces printed piece! rare/unusual pieces: there are 2 pistons included, as well as 2 weird looking technic pieces that serve as the landing gear during the build. which might explain why the set is quite expensive, it musn't have been cheap to manufacture them. the build it starts off relatively simple, the first 16 steps is getting the basic shape of the cockpit and the mechanism to make the middle wing move up and down. after that the next few steps are getting the landing gear/wing folding device done, it's actually the same thing so when the wings move into attack mode the landing gear retracts. this is then locked into place by the white beams that form the basic shape of the fuselage. up to step 46 is the fuselage, as well as fitting the hydraulics. this is what it looks like when the fuselage is complete. the cockpit is not "air tight", there's is quite a big gap top: bottom: the final few steps of book 1 is the construction of one of the engines, here it is attatched : the yellow bar is not permanent, its used to keep the white bit at the top from moving downwards. the steps are repeated in the second book so that both engines are now in on to the wings! first one attatched, the middle one is attached now: and finally the last one: it is now finished! the pieces that are left: so, you're probably wondering, how does it enter attack mode? well can you see this bar? push that bar to the center, and pick it up, the hydraulics move the central wing downwards as well as the side wings to enter attack mode: the outer wings have flickfire missiles on them, they obviously don't work, but it increases the playability of the set. the cockpit opens in a similar way to general grevious's starfighter released last year, using a sliding mechanism for other pics see here : http://s25.photobuck...eview/?start=20 and i'll be taking other requests for pics, maybe a video of it switching between modes. build: 7/10 very symmetrical build, the mechanism to move the wings might annoy some people. minifigs: 5/10 1 fig in a £50 set, however it is a starfighter design: 9/10 very accurate to the source material, lego have really made the effort to make the movement feature work. parts: 8/10 lots of technic, white and dark red pieces price: 7/10 could be slightly cheaper, playability: 6.5/10 need to buy some enemy sets to get the most of it, flick fires don't work. comments, requests, questions and criticisms welcome. edited by kimt, 04 august 2008 - 06:48 pm. indexed and poll added

0 i'm still reviewing it, the internet broke half way through it

1 nice review simon jedi. the v-19 has been one of my favourite ships since the release of cwa and this is one of the sets i've been considering most about buying. it's great to see tlg's treatment of it. it looks like no expense was spared making it as aesthetically and functionally accurate as possible - though i think the cockpit windshield could maybe have been slightly bigger, but that's just me i'm sure. it looks pretty big compared to other starfighters too. did it take a long time to build?

1 thanks for this excellent review simonjedi . this looks like an awesome set and this is the set i am most looking foward just as well as the separatist spider droid (7681) .

1 hydraulic wings! i am very impressed and am now considering getting this set purely because of this funciton. i am just curious as to know why are there sand green parts on the bottom of the v-19. is it visible when the model is completed? i am also pleased to see tlc giving us a printed cockpit computer this time around.

-1 skipper 24, on oct 11 2008, 08:10 am, said: in addition to my last comment am i correct in saying that the left over yellow technic part was merely to hold parts together while building? yes i believe that the yellow technic is only used for the building. however i didn't find it neccessary. what a strange step...

-1 i built mine today. as soon as i tried to put it in attack position, the thingy rotates the wrong way and it falls apart. what a waste of $55

1 i love this set and i gave it "outstanding". i might note though that the cylinder is just there as a dampener; when disenegaged the wing function still works, just not as smoothly. interestingly though the cylinder is an old piece, (i have a few others) it's just that this is the first time it's been used without a spring... i had no problems assembling this set.

1 having just bought myself a copy of the wonderful metroliner (4558) i felt like doing a review. before we start i'd like to thank greenhair for selling me one of his metroliners for a mere 80 euros. granted, the motor, "trainstation" and tracks weren't included but i did get an extra railcar instead. - * (please note that i have included the fourth wagon in the final pic but that the official set includes just three wagons.) the metroliner was released in 1992 and was extremely popular amongst lego fans. the set a picture of the box showing the set completely. (pic taken from peeron) and one of the minifigs and the accessories.: as you may notice, tlc was extremely generous, supplying us with a grand total of 11 minifgs amongst which no less than 4 female minifigs. ah, the population crisis is finally over we also have three suitcases, three cups and a small freight parcel and freight handling thingy. normally this would include two bicycles; a red and a black one. a general side view of the three carriages. (thanks to greenhair and the brickster) and here's one of the extra carriage. (thanks to greenhair and the brickster) moving onto the front and back carriage, which are externally identical. please note that greenhair changed my back carriage's headlights. these would be yellow in the normal set. all the doors in the entire set are printed pieces. (sorry for the bad picture quality in this one) the interior of the two however is laid out a bit differently. the space in the front carriage is occupied by a cockpit (or whatever it is called in trains) and some space to store your cable connecting the front lights with the engine. i can imagine it must get quite cramped and dangerous for the minifig driver with all the cabling. further back we have a quite random, weird looking engine. one part reminded me rather of a jet engine on a commercial airplane. the engine is accessible by means of the two side cargo doors. at the end of our first carriage we hit what looks like the train's restaurant, two tables and no chairs. the two middle carriages are identical, both have a small sink nicely hidden from the intervening and impolite looks of fellow passengers. the carriage further contains two tables and four seats. two cargo spaces are nicely tucked away from view below the tables. our final carriage has a back cockpit as well but differs from the front carriage in the central cargo area - where our train employee is hard at work earning his lego nickels - and the rear sleeping area. the bed is a double one, the upper one able to be flipped up for somewhat difficult access to the lower one. the train station i could not take photos off since it was not included in the purchase. judging from the building plans however i feel it was thrown in at the end just to add 'something' to the set. its construction is very simple, consisting of a few grey plates on top of a few pillars. access is provided by a plate which is connected to the platform with a few hinges. there are however two lamp posts, a timetable and a few chairs so if you don't like the platform you can still use these parts in a variety of other constructios. to end off i took a pic of the complete set (with extra wagon) and a friendly surprised train driver opening the door and greeting the camera man. conclusion being a '90s set, the train basically builds itself. the entire build cost me two hours and a half (i lost quite some time simply admiring the set) and was extremely straightforward with no suprises at all, but i need to admit it has its charm. the exterior is simply amazing. the sleekness of the design, the colours, it matches perfectly! i believe however that a width of 8 studs would be more to scale but 6 wide still looks amazing. the interior is somewhat simplistic but is easily moddeable with a few extra pieces. i basically bought the train as a parts pack. the standard set (three wagons) includes no less than 8 train doors with windows, 14 train windows, 4 smaller longer ones and 4 freight doors. the front and back of course count as unique pieces as well. one feature i am displeased with are the printed doors. i like printed pieces and while the blue-white-red stripe looks beautiful on the side the printed doors kind of limit mocing capabilities to carriages with a stripe on the side. i considered simply removing the stripe but i found out i could just get normal grey ones from bricklink for a fair price. i am very pleased with the train but since you already know my opinion, feel free to tell us yours of this fabulous set! edited by thebrickster, 09 july 2009 - 01:51 pm. poll question was not multiple choice, switched to radio group

1 i voted outstanding, this is simply an amazingly good looking train and comes with indeed 11 minifigs! i sold this one because i need a budget to build my ship, but i kept one because i love it! not bad for a first review ruben!

1 thanks for the review hinckley! i love this set! i still haven't renewed my bm subscription, but i'm sure i can find this on ebay or bricklink. and what an addition this would be to my army. edited by ~vbbn~, 05 august 2008 - 01:32 am.

1 nice review hinckley. i just got mine as well by paying quite a high price for it since its exclusive to us. however, i had not opened it yet and i left it in my friend's car. i gave it for an above average for that cool little jeep. for an exclusive brickmaster set, this is certainly one of the best vehicles i had ever seen. i like its construction built. if this is ever released in the main stream, i am sure it will be a hit to get a small sized indiana jones set.

1 outstanding set and review, thanks for presenting it! i've had this since it first came out, but didn't think it would be that impressive, so i didn't bother opening it. now, i'm tempted. aside from the slight size issue, i can't find anything here to gripe about, except for the limited availability. i want 5. i think that makes me a parts monkey. eek eek. you're exactly right about this selling like mad. it's another one of those missed opportunities for tlg. sure, it's nice to get people to subscribe by offering it as part of brickmaster, but in the long run, put it in the stores for $6 and sell a million. just give us indy's manbag, we need it for postal employees and such. as is the running joke whenever i comment on one of your reviews, i'd give this a solid 985. not out of anything, just 985. or, in clearer terms: + 1/2 (though i voted 5)

1 looks really nice, if they keep making bm sets like this, i might actually subscribe... nice comic too, remind me not to run into copmike and his gloveless hand...

1 thanks for the good review ! i can´t wait for mine to arrive! and just think how close paulc was in his reverse building of this which turned into a event exclusive in billund ! he was just wrong on the color of the headlight bricks (black instead of frown) and the rear bumper stuff which couldn´t be seen on the bag picture! kudos paulc! as for my badass patrol car and the sop (standard operation procedure) of cavity searches there´s more to see here over at brickzone - here´s a teaser: copmike

1 copmike, on aug 6 2008, 03:49 pm, said: here´s a teaser: copmike that looks a bit odd out of context. great teaser. what a cool site you've linked to. i love it! thanks. i'm glad you guys liked the review and i hope everyone gets a chance to own this little gem...for a reasonable price.

1 this set easily is above average for me. i had this as a little child, and whenever any of my relatives came to visit us, they brought me some lego. usually it was either this set or 6844 the really nice thing about this set are the alternate builds. for the low price you got a nice range of parts and cool ideas what to build with them. you could build a fleet of rovers, or the alternates, and everytime it was huge fun :)

1 nice review of an interesting set. but i have a query... anyone know why it is actually called amazon crossing when it's meant to be in australia? also, the amazon runs through a jungle anyway. edited by shoc, 10 august 2008 - 03:44 pm.

0 ok, this is the big one. the controversial one. the one everyone either hates or defends... what do i think? read on. the figs: bandana man masked dude dude with shades good figures, i miss scarface. comes with his torso, though, which is my favorite (the one with the ammo strap across the chest). one figure short of the figure-to-price value, but we can deal with that. the dino: the dino. it's the one that comes with the chopper, in green. any questions? the tank: and so it begins. i think it looks a lot better in person than on the box. the left side. good time to mention that the treads run pretty easily, and this is a very playable set. right side. keep an eye on that flap in the center... ... and we have a folding ladder! the back. probably the weakest point of the set, apart from the dino. the turret, turned and tilted. the mechanism works extremely well, and the gun seems to work better than others for some reason (or maybe it just seems that way). the front of the cockpit. i'm at a loss trying to figure out how those tiny windshields defend them against 40-foot mutant tyrannosaurus rexes with radioactive breath, laser eyes, and what have you... anyway, another one of those neat steering wheels, some viking horns, and some stickered control panels (oh yeah, this set has a good amount of stickers. probably around 20-ish.). the back of the cockpit. i love the little gun, it turns 360 degrees and tilts up. oh yeah, and those green barrels they've been using are awesome, i can think of tons of uses for them. the verdict: 7.6/10 playability: 9.4/10 pieces: 7.5/10 figures: 8.8/10 dino: 3/10 value: 4/10 the main downfall of this set is the price. i would easily pay $30 for this, no questions asked. but $40 was a hard sell for me - i gave in merely to see what i would think of it, and also to help you guys find out the same. this is a great display set, and a great play set. the pieces are good - lots of nice blay beams used in the construction. but the price, people. that's the killer. pick this up only if you have everything else or you find it on clearance. and thus ends my dino attack review series. hope you enjoyed them! until next time, bloody jay

1 very interesting indeed! i especially like the folding ladder. i never thought of making such a clever function. i might have to use it in my future lego models. another great reveiw bloody jay! ;)

-1 quote i would easily pay $30 for this, no questions asked. but $40 was a hard sell for me is it easier for you to "eat" if you know that this would cost you around $60 if you live in denmark :|

0 this is an ok set....

-1 dino_bot wrote: quote you're lucky...they sell those for $60 here...am i getting ripped off? only if you think you are. this set isn't too bad in the play-ability factor. it's not that great though. a better cockpit, and some more armour to this treaded monster is needed. thanks for another great review bloody jay. and i agree that this set isn't worth the price. though, the ark 170 is still my least favorite badly priced set. graynar

1 nice review cobra. thanks for sharing. i think arctic was one of those neat themes that never really took off. i like these little poly-bag sets as they make great starters/introduction sets for themes (or) serve as a nice supplement or add/on to an existing collection. i've always liked the thick green hood piece used in the arctic theme and have thought about using it in a sw hoth scene. in any case, nice review! i've got an arctic set that i built recently and will share a review soon.

1 nice review agentrick.$30 is a good price, but tlc think thats €40 so i'll have to pass. btw i thought this ship was supposed to hold many droids like in sw battlefront. oh well, its good for show. edited by skinny boy, 09 august 2008 - 09:31 pm.

1 so it comes with an extra gun-holding arm? it looks like it, and that's great. that way you can make all of the droids gun-totting ones.

-1 i don't really like this set because it isn't my idea of the droid gunship, which is from sw battlefront, which can hold as many droids as a rgs can hold clones. if i buy this, it'd be for the dark blue pieces, which is the signature color of one of my castle nations ( dark red and dark blue ).

-1 this is a great set it's too pricey though if it was $10 or so cheaper i'd get it!

1 i'm definitely getting this soon. a good value for money, a cool set, and another part to my clone wars collection!

1 emergency evac set #: 6445 theme: town res-q year released: 1998 piece count: 97 minifigs: 1 list price: $8 (usd) in 1998, lego introduced a new theme called res-q. the theme was really a quasi-coast guard sub-theme of classic town. the theme included boats, helicopters, emergency vehicles, and even a water hovercraft. most notable was the black and yellow color combination that predominated the sets. i only picked up a couple of sets from the theme including this emergency evacuation vehicle that i consider a van. i never got into the theme, but looking back at these sets, i have gained a better appreciation for their value in classic town. let's take a look at 6445 in greater detail. starting with the box: the back of the box providing a few alternate models: and similar imagery on the instructions: the set includes one small sheet of decals for the van: 6445 has one res-q minifig that i find pretty nice. i like the neon orange reflectors: he has a nice printed backside with the word res-q prominently displayed: this little set includes an abundance of tools: a black walkie-talkie is not pictured here's the emergency van: i like the back section that has a nice winch with turning wheel and a few hooks for tools: here's the minifig pulling the grappling hook for some res-q action. this is my favorite part of this set: the van isn't too fancy but has some neat features: while i like the blue windshield piece for maybe space sets, i'm not really fond of its use for the van: the van has no steering wheel, but rather two levers for steering: on the top of the vehicle are two emergency alarms and some extra lights: the back of the van has a large opening piece that allows wide access to the back section: it comfortably fits a long gurney/stretcher: here's the driver resting on the gurney: he should never have tried to pick up the gurney without a 2nd res-q minifig. and a shot of the back section without the gurney: lastly, a picture of the complete set: final thoughts res-q is really a neat theme that has great play value for kids. while it's not one of my more favorite town sub-themes, it does offer some nice pieces and an abundance of black and yellow pieces. i think a few of the res-q sets go nicely with the divers theme released one year earlier in 1997. i had a chance to purchase the largest set of the theme, 6479 emergency response center, at half the price, but passed back in the late 90s. i'd be interested in finding out what other eb members think of this set and the res-q theme.

-1 i am a proud owner of this set. like others, i got it discounted and couldn't resit the parts pack. this is the type of lego sets that bothers me. when you look at it now, you'd be tempted to say "hey not bad", but at the same time, some years ago, it wasn't good enough to buy it full price. i was kinda disappointed because usually sets using that kinda baseplates are excellent (castle, paradisa), and this one is just "ok". one really minus point would be the lack of any opponent faction in the set

1 that's it! thanks for the review but now you make me want to build my own one! thanks a lot! on a more serious note, i really like this set and have always wished to aquire it. i have two broken tie interceptors, so this should be a easy build. and as someone in the pirate forum, i think, said, it would be a great baseplate for building cave to hide the booty! thanks pmg and welcome!

0 thanks for the welcome everyone! though i'm still wondering where the drone minion/commander idea came from.

0 wow certainly much bigger than i would have thought, thanks for the great review and pictures =] well for some reason i was drawn to this set, but with the lack of interior and quite a bit of technics, i think i'll pass, or at least get the at-te first! thanks again!

0 i read the visual guide recently and learned a bit more about the twilight. i won't get into spoilers but it seems that the ship becomes a sort of endearing family van for the characters which is neat. big bulky, uncool, but it gets you from one place to another. if it factors into more than just the 90 minute film, i may pick this up. it seems that there's room for a lot of personality in this ship once you see the film. it is a corellian freighter smuggling spice for the hutts. that's cool right?

0 thank you svelte_corps for the review! i like the inside, nice and cosey! i also like your little garden! for me, this put the twilight different in a better perspective than my first perspective of the twilight. i voted outstanding. greets the-force!

0 svelte_corps, on aug 12 2008, 02:19 am, said: hmm... dior. i can smell it now the ship doesn't look too swooshable (but, then again, more than the heavy rgs) i really like that review svelte corps! so much detail! unfortunately i would only get this if it was a very low price, like in a sale.

-1 dovchenko, on aug 13 2008, 12:29 pm, said: looks fine... but still that designs quite a downer. but look at that wing design! its lovely! looks exactly like the b-29 bombers wings look like.

1 oky wan kenobi, on aug 12 2008, 01:52 am, said: oh no! anakin has gone over to the green side of the force! not the green side!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! looks like a good source of grey panels, and a cool headpiece. nothing more.

1 good review there! my daughter loves the backyard garden of the twilight my opinion of the ship has changed after reading this, thanks!

1 very good set. indeed the possibility to alter the knight's appearance hugely boosts the value! very smart thinking of tlc. got one of these so far, but if i ever do a castle-related comic or animation, this will be the set i buy tons of.

1 argh! what i was typing kept getting deleted by my stupid keyboard!!!!! on topic: this looks like a great little set, i could use a few of these, but i haven't seen any at a local store. too bad for me i suspose . great review, and i like the green plate on the bottom, never can have too many greens for my small but expanding swamp i'm building. hope i can pick some of these up eventualy.

1 this little bugger brought me back from my dark ages! as a movie fan, i just couldn't resist the thought of making an animation with living lego skeletons (i'm referring to ray harryhausen's work on the classic jason and the argonauts here). buying the indy sets stopped me from getting a lot more castle sets. though in time i added the final joust, the wizard and the impulse knight to my collection, as well as buying more unique figs (king, princess) from expensive castle sets off bricklink. so yeah. great little set. two crownies, a skeleton and a skeletal horse, you just cannot resist that! even if you hadn't been buying lego for 5 years. as far as i'm concerned, this set is one for the ages! i love it!

0 tenorikuma, on aug 13 2008, 03:48 am, said: i should really get one more of these for the figures, shields, and weapons. this set is the only one with the scythe in pearl-grey, by the way. except, it's just plain dark-grey, you must have gotten this set mixed with another. though i've never heard of a pearl-grey scythe

1 good review kimt. pictures are clear and show each of the pieces in great detail. i agree with your comments as well. i'm a bit curious, does the knight's helm have a hole for plume? i've been debating whether to purchase this set or not. i'm not a big fan of horses so i'll likely barely use them, but i do like the unique minifigs, weapon rack/weapons, and the fact that the divider has a few useful pieces that can be added to other sets. however, i just don't feel the set is worth $8 when compared to crossbow attack and the knight's catapult unless the buyer is really wanting some mounted minifigs. luckily, amazon just lowered their price of this set from $8 to $6 (along with another 20% if using bill me later... just in case anyone was also in the same situation i was in). at that price, it's damn well worth it.

1 dj2005, on aug 29 2008, 11:26 am, said: i'm a bit curious, does the knight's helm have a hole for plume? i can answer on behalf for kimt, if memories served me right. yes, there is a hole for placing the knight's plume. do correct me wrong, if i had answered wrongly. it's been awhile since i last touched my castle sets. thanks kimt for this fine review. this is one of the castle sets which i had bought high volume, mainly for its horses, barding and the weapons. a great army builder and accessories for your castle armies. this is an instant "5".

1 first things first. the knight's helm does have a spot for a plume. now, i really like this set and it was the first one i dug into when i got my collection in the mail. it has a great selection of equipment for good or evil figures and the barding for the horse is outstanding. my only wish was for one of the long chrome swords for the knights. i think the new knights with the tall shield and chrome sword look excellent on foot and on horseback. it would definitely be neat to revisit this set with another human knight instead of the skeleton. make that change and add a lady to joust for and it'd be bang on.

1 this looks like a really great set! i wasn't around in '88 to get it but i like it! it actually has things inside the interior! thanks for the review. hinckley, on aug 13 2008, 06:11 pm, said: there were quite a few sets in the 1980's that weren't sold in the us. hooray! (sort of) in england we don't get, in normal shops, batman and spongebob sets, and not at all - avatar sets, and brickmaster, but america gets all of these. maybe it's revenge for america's lego neglect in the 80's. hinckley, on aug 13 2008, 06:11 pm, said: i remember reading once that it was because they contained wine glasses and tlg felt they wouldn't be able to market a toy that encourage the drinking of alcohol. this set was one of them. they didn't want to encourage the drinking of alcohol in america but were fine encouraging it in other places? maybe that's why my country has such a big problem with binge drinking... or maybe not.

1 nice set what a great find, this is one thing i think the tlg has forgotten about, the creator houses are nice but they are not really geared toward a town them (no mini figs, cars etc) these sets were and that adds so much to a town layout it can't be overlooked. i really like this i may have to start my ebay searching..... thanks hinckley

1 great review, and great set! i just wanted to comment on the beauty of the car included in this set. it gets no better than a four-wide car and hinged roof (with sunroof!)

1 hairy ruben, on aug 13 2008, 05:03 pm, said: somehow, i feel like watching south park now ... that was such a good episode i thought it was simpsons, but you're right-it's a sheila braflowksi line. isn't it in the movie, though? right before "blame canada?" on topic, i find it funny that people find that car so great. i don't like 4 wide cars but i also think it's beautiful just because of the nostalgic feeling i get looking at it-like hot cocoa on christmas morning with a new teddy bear in my stocking. get out of my socks teddy bear! my feet are cold! is that santa's boot dangling from the chimney? what's that smell? anyway, does anyone long for the days of 2-wide cars with 2 x 2 slope windshields that were more suited for a skateboard than a car? i suppose someone has to have affection for those things. who was around back then? copmike? gylman? hobbes? do you like 2-wide cars? seriously though, anyone? my point is, as much as i like the realism of the six-wide and wider cars, the 4-wides make me feel all warm and fuzzy.

0 hinckley, on aug 14 2008, 12:10 am, said: do you like 2-wide cars? i didn't even knowthere ever were 2 wide cars hinckley, on aug 13 2008, 11:23 pm, said: yes yes. in the states, horrifying and deplorable violence is fine, but drinking and swearing sends kids directly to hell. you forgot sex ...

0 well, technically it is 4 wide...

1 lots of rare parts and a good baseplate, sounds great. how much did this cost you and where did you get it from?

1 this is my favourite house which i owned during my childhood. although it's in the crypt, but i hope to build it back one day. looking at your review makes me so envy of you to own a complete set. the baseplate is very unique especially for its stoned pattern. classic lego telephone is just so lovely especially when its printed. the entire house layout is simple and very nicely constructed. in fact, the simplicity just showed how much lego could do with such parts. there are many nice furnitures included in this set such as the little oven/stove, dining table, bed and car porch. the little black car is a classic example of a true 4-studs car. i love this house very much, and my verdict is a full "5". no doubt about it. thanks hinckley for this lovely review.

0 i've 2 of these sets. one is for sale .....

0 cool review! i never knew that those wine-glasses could be the reason for this not being sold in the us!

1 this is an awesome set, man... and a great review. just too bad it is so rare! i voted 5. by the way, does anyone know if there is a review for this? or other sets that come with a camper, perhaps? also, i was wondering if the creator houses are in scale and could be used with minifigs and such.

1 has anyone noticed the dwarf in one of the completed shots? nice set, alot better than the new city sets...*looks at an army of firefighters that have no fires to put out and the police officer army* edited by indianajones, 21 april 2010 - 12:06 pm.

1 hello all eurobricks members and town lovers, today, i will be doing up the third item in the shell promotional series in 1998. three out of the eight promotional sets are under town theme. the third in the line is the exterme team sub theme which is promoted in 1998. extreme team is a bunch of adventurous, daring, breath taking individuals that risk their lives for an unforgettable excitement of the lifetime. their vehicles range from land, air and sea type of extreme taking types. extreme team is one the unknown themes ever released in my "dark age". i only had this small lovely set in my entire extreme team collection. hope we are able to see more interesting reviews under extreme team as well. name: extreme team raft theme: lego system / town / promotional / shell year: 1998 pieces: 19 minifigs: 1 price: usd$2.00 an image of a 2537, extreme team, raft this will be an exciting water adventure! this is another great addition to your female population count. she is one of thhe daring individuals in the extreme team, that take her raft beyond limit, into the rough waters where she might face possible dangers. look how confident she is, with those witty eyes of her. i am very sure she will survived the course of her entire journey. raft's design this is a very simple design, with just a big piece of wooden plank and a couple of logs tied together on the side, and it is ready to take it down to the water. speaking of some real adventure, do you dare to take this raft in the unknown waters? there is a small holding area, where she is able to place her critical equipment to ensure her safety throughout the journey. bottom of the raft excellent range of equipment this set actually provides very good range of equipment. there is a pair of oars, hammer, life vest and backpack. the most wonderful piece of equipment is the pair of dynamites. first of all, they are printed. next, they can be used in wild west or any playing possibilites which involved in explosives. this is a very good impulse set to stock up these accessories. i wondered what she need to use these dynamites for? her extreme team black jacket is very nicely designed, with their logo "x" or another way of saying "xtreme". i find the green arms and black jacket matched pretty well, with that blue cap. front view relaxing herself, listening to the calm sea to summarise, this is one of the better impulse sets ever produced. it comes with a simple raft with tons of good accessories, and a very cheap way to obtain dynamites. in fact, these are my only 2 piece in my entire collection. somehow, this set managed to find its way to my collection in my dark age, and i am very pleased to have this. no major flaws on this set, it fufill the conditions of an excellent impulse set! summary review playability: 9.5/10 (high playability involved. you can used it as an indy, adventurers or whatever purpose for the raft) design: 10/10 (very very simple design with superb great accessories. for a promo/impulse set, it's very good) price: 9.5/10 (a very inexpensive set based on the 1998 pricing. great way to buy this to add in some adventures of your own) overall: 9.7/10 (this is a fanastic set, mainly for its accessories. get it if you still see any of these. it's defintely worth the money, if its reasonable) i gave it a "5" based on my review score card. what about yours? hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine. comments and critics are strongly welcomed. pictures can be found in my brickshelf (when moderated)

1 overall, an excellent set concerning the price range. nice review, whitefang!

1 thanks for this review thebrickster, i also have this set and think it's one of the best helicopters tlg made in the 90's. it's quite big and has got place for 2 minifigs in the cockpit. i also like the fact that there's a victim included in form of the x-treme diver, which also is a theme i always loved as a kid. do you have any other res-q sets left to review? it would be an honour for me to also do a review of one or more sets which are left, but unfortunately i got not much time at the moment.

1 i got this set as well as a res-q hovercraft. this set is cool because of all the accessories and it come with a x team guy. your set is also in much better condition than mine. you have made me decide to rebuild it. another great review thebrickster. keep up the good work.

0 thanks for the review brickster, i do own this set in it's original form, the only drawback that i have noted previously is the lack of rotor's and the cobraesq of the copter body i wish it had a larger fuselage but i still have it and i still like it despite my criticism....which i am sure is in my eyes only. thanks again brickster. i wish i had bought some of the other res q sets but of course i only bought three.

1 i've always wanted this set and the hovercraft... too bad i never did. great set.

1 what exactly makes you feel this set isn't realistic? it has got nothing what wouldn't be on a real helicopter, imo. and for the futuristic design, yes, it looks modern, but it works. and actually, most of today's real helicopters also don't look like in the 70's anymore.

1 this is one of my favourite sets. i remember getting it in tesco soon after it was released. those were the days... the res-q line was good, and this set made it better.

1 if you still have all the parts, try to rebuild it, you'll see that it's a great feeling!

0 very nice review. this is another set which i had never seen before when i am in my dark age. quite an useful set, especially with the accessories and the minifigs' torsos. the speedboat is able to hold the car and the rubber rescue boat. how can the driver steer this boat with so many things blocking the way? i can't seemed to find its control though. thanks for doing this review.

0 nice review. i always wanted this set. the speed boat makes the set. thanks for sharing.

1 this is a pretty nice set. i really like the torso and its "genericness" so it can be used for other factions. and at least this set has 2 shields (althought i prefer the triangular ones) instead of just 1 shield you get from crossbow attack (from the wrong fraction, i'd have liked a crown knights shield 100x better). some improvements for this set would be a normal bow and a sword instead of 2 of the 3 crossbows, smaller wheels and triangular shields. 4/5 from me (actually 3,5 but i'll round it up)

1 originally shared in the history & adventure forum for its adventure attributes, here's my favorite of the outback collection: first, let me say that this little set is one of my all-time favorites because it can be used to sumplement a number of different themes. 1) the set makes a great little adventure airstrip for adventurers and more recent, the indiana jones theme (see also german headquarters and port adventure). i've also used the set as an addition to my wild west town. the tan baseplate and windmill works great, just subtract the plane, modern equipment, and figs. and lastly, as the set was intended, as an outback/desert airstrip. set description: outback airstrip set # 6444 pieces: 157 minifigs: 3 release date: 1997 original price: $20 (usd) starting with the box: and the backside. notice the alternate models. i love the swamp boat: the building is my favorite part of the set. it is simple, has a little detail, two great roof pieces, and a single green window (great piece!): check out the great windmill piece. it's my only one and makes a great part for wild west and that farm you always wanted to build. i used it for the barnhouse of barnabas higgens and spring valley ranch on the side of the building is a great radio and a clear glass: unfortunately, no furniture can be found within the building: and now the airplane: front view; i love the twin propellors: side view: and the rear section: the back has a small cargo hold for some boxes/freight or some gear needed in the outback: the set includes three figs, two with cool shades: and some great equipment. i love the boom box: a shot of the whole set: and another: summary: as i mentioned above, this set is very versatile and can suplement a few different themes. it's my personal favorite of the outback collection and i'm really glad i was able to find the set in the late 90s (i almost didn't buy). sets like this are timeless and so much fun to build and display. hope you enjoy the review. edit: additional reviews: review by agentrick57 (december 24, 2007) outback airstrip review in history & adventure forum (february 10, 2008)

1 great review! this set has cool features. i just wish that lego would release this as a lego legend and release it to australia too, since this is a set about australia. i would've bought two if this were a lego legend. that is how good it is. i like the building with latticed window and windmill. i also like the cargo airplane, windsock, and radios. plus it looks like it's got great minifigs.

1 the building is great and detailed, with a few mods it could be added to my castle town. i don't really like the plane though, seems kind of abstract, not really good in my opinion, but i bet it would be easy to mod to look better.

1 legoman132, on aug 18 2008, 09:36 pm, said: this was a cool set i thoght of it as i was building the post plane. interesting thought. i have the post plane but i haven't opened it yet. i suppose it's the yellow. the plane in this set is much different than most of the other classic town airplanes in that it has the double tail section. here's a shot of the new 7732 air mail set - definately a nice set:

1 set#: 7103 theme: star wars set name: jedi duel pieces: 74 release: 2002 price: 10 usd minifigs: 2 (count dooku and yoda) links: 7103 brickshelf folder bricklink reference catalog peeron.com introcomment: i remember getting this set solely because i collect star wars. as i rebuild it and took pics of it, i found that i actually like this set for different reasons. dooku's speeder is pretty cool and the lightsabre rocks. the dooku minifig is also great. what's not so great is the flythingy and getting another yoda. though that's kinda hard not to get in a set focused on their duel "you can't see the wires, because they digitally removed them." "be careful or i'll digidally remove your head" - steven seagal [i hope i quoted that one right ] so to get the review on the move, i'll impress you all with a box picture: neat, huh? one of the smaller boxes, but still kinda big when consider that you only get 74 pieces and 2 minifigs. the instruction isn't that big as i said, the dooku minifigs is awesome i love the print on his torso that combines the brown cape with the torso and also the head is neatly designed. not a fleshie, though. this was before the flesh-license-facelift a sideview of the light blue speeder. mmmm that crome light sabre hilt is nice the design of the speeder is also ok, and without the usual off-colour-scheme bricks. no tan or yellow sticking out there yeah, i'd panic too if this came right at me...who wouldn't when noone's driving? and a rear shot. i think the design is a little off. the shields makes it all a little too open in my opinion. the printed bricks are a kick and thus evens the score here. this hideous design is meant to flip yoda around the air. put him in this funfair from hell thing and give him a twister he and dooku will never forget. my guess is that it's there to add some playability, but it's just odd and quite useless. much like the playability soccer thingies in the ultimate light sabre duel the verdict: ups and downs. this set offers both. i rate it as "average" since the size and price of the set make it acceptable to have odd things. confused? good so am i making a small set isn't that easy and remeber this set is from 2002 and a lot has happended since then, designwise that is. what do you think?

1 you think it's not a great thing that we get a yoda fig in an affordable set like this?!? that was the main reason why i got this set! and what do you mean by "another"? wasn't this the only one that was ever released except for the one in the dagobah/x-wing set? sure, he is not the best fig with the unmovable legs and all, but still: it's yoda! besides, he doesn't move his legs a lot in "real" life either. nice review, though, and thanks for telling me what that liftarm-thingy was meant to be for. i never got that and thought it was supposed to lift up the speeder for some reason. i got two of this set, and the printing on those blue parts were off in the second one i got. edited by oky wan kenobi, 18 august 2008 - 08:45 pm.

0 thanks for the nice review kimt . i like this set especially by the fact that it is the only set containing the dooku minifig and the curved lightsaber , i also think that the minifig is cool but i also own the dagobah x-wing and the wookiee catamaran sets so i have enought minifigs (a clone wars version would be very cool ) and the extra-thingy is well, just ok. the bad part is that i don?t buy the set when it is out and now is go for $40 on ebay and bricklink . edited by darkrebellion, 18 august 2008 - 09:51 pm.

-1 i think this is a pretty lame set. it came with dooku, who i think only came in this set, plus a unique lightsaber. still, they could have made it much bigger, added anikan and obi-wan, and added structures and made it more like the scene from the movie. also, the speeder doesn't seem very accurate.

0 i missed out on this set but it looks pretty good imo. thanks for clearing up what that thing was i thought it was something they flung at eachother in the movie i like the lightsaber also but why did they stop making chrome ones

0 i got this set a long time ago. the review pretty much says all there is to say about it. (never knew what the red/brown thing was anyway, i used it as a canon.) isn't this also the only set up until now that had count dooku in it?

1 great review, kimt! at that time, it was still in my dark age and i hated myself not to get this set earlier. this is quite inexpensive and you are able to get two greatest characters especially count dooku. the minifigs are excellent, especially the unique design of count dooku's lightsaber. i have no problem with the speedbike, as it looks quite alright to me. as for the elevation of yoda's jump adds some playabilty, but that does not work well for me. nevertheless, the main attractive factor is count dooku and i have to rate it a "5". i never own a yoda, except for the magnet version.

0 i know we have another review of this set, but since i just got it, i thought i would share my comments on it. set name: droid gunship platform number: 7678 pieces: 329 price: $29.99 before we begin i will say that i like having a droid gunship, but i still hope we get a maf: hmp droid gunship: maf droid gunship: on to the review. here we have the box. it is really shiny, and smooth, and fits the set's size okay. it has a clean, bright look, and is truley outstanding. the back of the box, which has the features of the set, as well as the other three cw sets. the contents the siticker sheet. no to bad, and the stickers have clear backs, which is always nice. instructions here we have the figs(two new droids and one older armed droid for the cockpit), and the extra parts. the build starts with the flat base. pretty simple. the bottom. the side lasers. next is the head: it starts pretty soild. the side buble laser turrets. loveing the detail. on the ship: the "lid" and eyes. the finished cockpit. cozy interior... would have had more room if it were the maf though. the front landing gear. simple and effective. the back landing gear. the rockets. the clips are annoying. but it make the rockets work so, i guess it was nessecary. mounted on the bottom. not very secure, but that's why they are meant to be dropped on the clones.... the finished ship. --------------------------------------------- let me say that the droid gunship is a nice set indeed. final rating: 86% hope you enjoyed the review! please, if you have a ny questions, pic requests, etc, then by all means, ask! best regards, vbbn

1 very nice review. one thing you have to consider: when lego sees pics of the star wars universe, they have to decide which would be the easiest set to make with the most playibility. therefore, they chose the hmp. quote thanks for the review. it's always good to have a 2nd opinion on a set. i've added the usual poll and i'll index it tomorrow (must sleep). super pics and great to have "in-build" pics default_thumbup.gif a fine set which i'll surely buy when i find it. default_hmpfbad.gif where? edited by lt. col. thok, 18 august 2008 - 10:07 pm.

1 metalandi, thanks for doing up this review! this is a chance for me to gain some insight for extreme team theme. this is a very interesting set that can be used for so many purposes. 3 different vehicles, wide range of accessories and nice minifigs. what i love the most, is the mountain, bridge and tent. it provided so much playability. i am very impressed with it. thanks for sharing.

0 set data 4920: the rapid rider year: 1999 subtheme: rock raiders pieces: 37 (+1 extra - trneongreen plate 1 x 1 round) price: euro 3,50, used, not including s/h, on ebay building time: less than 10 minutes. more info: bricklink - peeron. i could have owned the 4910 hover scout (see metalandi's review here), but while i was buying some used sets, i forgot to buy that one too! so, here's my only rr set, the second smallest one (if we don't count japanese promos; sweets are surely sweeter if they come with a lego set!) pieces: face and torso closeup; i like the torso, the face is good except for the bandanna. building is based on two big pieces: landing skids and plate 6 x 6 x 2/3 cross with dome. let's go! building is over: review: pros: small set (= cheap), 1 fig, two accessories, some interesting pieces like the rock and the crystal. no stickers but 3 printed pieces! good color choice. cons: tipper bucket is fixed, no hinge. no levers or steering wheel, it probably moves by using the buttons on the 2x2 tile. it deserves a 4/5.

0 thanks for the review! rock raiders was one of the last new themes i knew as a kid before my dark ages came. unfortunately i never managed to get any sets from it, beside a few months ago the 4910 the hover scout, which i review a while ago. wish i can get some of the bigger sets in the future.

1 hello all eurobricks members and classic town lovers, *** editor's note: to mark the celebration of classic town, this set which is released in 1994 and re-released as a legend in 2002. pizza to go review, is dedicated to classic town's opening cermony and members such as hinckley, brickster, imperialshadows, sinner and many others whom have contributed to the final success of classic town! thank you so much for inviting me to be part of this wonderful project, and i wish all the best to the success of classic town! i urge everyone of you to check out classic town and take alook at the cool stuff we have done! *** today, i will be doing up a review on pizza to go set. this outlet is one of the most favourite eatery for any lego citizens living in their town. when they are driving on the road, they are sure to look out "pizzeria" signage. they offer the best pizza in town. no one in town can resist the delicious aroma of pizza, coming out from the red chimney. let us find out why is this shop so popular among so many lego citizens and was one of the famous sets that is re-released under the "legend" theme. pizza to go is my favourite set of all time. i believed there is no other pizza outlet lying around in any lego city apart pizzeria. it seemed there are the sole outlet that is selling pizza for many years. this set was re-released in 2002 and it is part of the legend theme. this is one of the few sets that are highly demanded to be brought back by many fans of lego around the world. i owned the 6350. any members whom had owned both sets before? is there any difference between these two? because when i searched through peeron, it shown 144 pieces instead of 194 pieces for the 1994 set. name: pizza to go theme: lego system / town year: 1994 (re-release: 2002) pieces: 194 minifigs: 3 an image of a 6350, pizza to go let the delivery begins! pizza to go is the regular pizza outlet that sells nothing but pizza. they deliever pizza to every household in town, with their trusty delivery van. walk-in are welcomed too. there is a stand for customers to dine in their pizza quickly before making their way to their next destination. in my opnon, no town can ever survive without the pizza tradition! devoted "pizzeria" staff every outlet comes with 3 dedicated staff, making sure that operations will run smoothly. on the left, we will have the pizza boy, whom is wearing the regular blue dungarees and its white cap. i wonder who is that boy? on the middle, we will have the pizza girl. she looks like any typical sweet girl in town that the boys will look at. she is wearing a suntop strapless on her. she reminded me of one person though, i think her name is called alice. taking a careful look, i wonder if imperialshadows is the pizza boy back then, without that black patch on its left eye? on another note, this mini-figure was my favourite. female mini-figures are very uncommon back then. i am glad i have this figure, adding to my town population. on the right, we will have the hardworking chef, preparing the pizzas in the oven. he wears the regular white chef outfit, but he wear a grey pants instead of the usual full-white outfit in most resturants such as breezeway cafe (6376). let's take a closer look at the pizza boy's van! this van is very very small looking and very fuel efficient. it is able to cut lanes very fast due to its small size. the pizza van is made up of 4-studs wide design. no doors by the side. however, in this vehicle, i think the doors is not a must to be included in this design. our pizza boy will need to leave vehicle pretty fast, and ensuring that the pizza delivery is on time. common mechanism this van has the regular rooftop that can be lifted up to place the pizza boy into the driver seat. there is a sun roof on its top, which enable him to let him have some sunlight from above! the logo on the side of it, is actually a transparent sticker, which have the pizzeria itallian logo and a tasty looking pizza on both sides of its van. i like that sticker very much. mine looks quite worn out over time. if its a printed piece, it will be a terrific bonus. nevertheless, i can still accept the sticker. our pizza van can deliever up to 2 pizza at a go! at every trip, 2 piping hot pizza will be stored at the back of the van. the pizza is fitted in perfectly in each compartment. furthermore, the white window shutter, is terrific in this design. you don't see this kind of design anymore. i think, i have not seen much delivery vans on the street anymore too. base of the van from the base, you can see that it is using of the regular red car base that is common in most 4-studs vehicle design. in fact, this car base served as a foundation for its vehicle design. back of pizzeria alice and the chef will be showing you around at the back of the kitchen. there is an oven on the left, a water tap and a holder for the oar stick. looks pretty empty right? look below for a surprise! my favourite feature! this oven can be used to heat up 2 pizzas at a go. now, i understand why, this set is named "pizza to go". i have been using their slogan unknowingly. this feature is superb nice. now, we know that the pizza is prepared from the outlet instead of using delivery van to collect it from a factory. alice, what are you waiting for? help the chef quickly! pizzeria! the signage sure looks big from far and catches their attention easily too with its pleasnt looking design. as you have already noticed, this is made up of sticker. i don't mind, for this set, it contains sticker. sometimes, i do hope they can give us spare sticker for us to change, after a long period of time. distinct red chimney this is the front of the oven, and that is where the smoke comes out. using only bricks to construct this, is simply wonderful. i like the use of their white bricks to construct the wall layout, and a combination of red parts, especially on the top. i like the look of this very much. another picture on its side printed parts in this set, you will get a total of 5 pizzas! and, i believed no other sets offer so many pizza. you can placed up to 4 pizzas in the van and oven. alice will be carrying the last pizza around. the green and red round dish is a printed part. most exclusive part in 6350/10036 the most unique and important printed parts that is only exclusive in this set. it's at the front of the pizza van. it is none other, but the pizzeria logo, standing at the front of the delivery van. (forgotten to take a picture of this piece, took it from peeron.) different views of pizza to go outlet another bright sunday day in pizza to go! summary review playability: 10/10 (a lot of playing by doing up the pizza process. from preparing to delivery) design: 9.5/10 (outstanding design, with great use of bricks. i like the structure of it very much) price: 9.5/10 (an inexpensive set based on the 1994 pricing. it comes with 3 mini-figs, shop, a van, and a exclusive printed piece) overall: 9.7/10 (i am not trying to be bias. in fact, this set is absoultely filled with minimum flaws. look at my review again, if you are not satisfied with it, or tell me what you don't like!) i gave it a "5" based on my review score card. what about yours? hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine. comments and critics are strongly welcomed. pictures can be found in my brickshelf(when moderated)

0 jopiek, on aug 24 2008, 10:48 pm, said: a very good set indeed, we have at least 3 of them, but we like them all. what do you mean by "we"? you own three sets of the orignal 1994 series or the 2002 legend series?

1 this set looks really cool, especially for one this inexpensive. the van is neat, and the hidden storage compartment i back is the icing on the cake. i like the back with hidden oven as well, and the rare sink piece makes it all the better. with five pizzas and three minifigs, it's and excellent set to behold.

1 excellent job, and one of the best sets in history, if you ask me! 5/5 all the way. this is what we need more of. whitefang, on aug 24 2008, 05:22 am, said: devoted "pizzeria" staff on the left, we will have the pizza boy, whom is wearing the regular blue dungarees and its white cap. i wonder who is that boy? on the middle, we will have the pizza girl. she looks like any typical sweet girl in town that the boys will look at. she is wearing a suntop strapless on her. she reminded me of one person though, i think her name is called alice. taking a careful look, i wonder if imperialshadows is the pizza boy back then, without that black patch on its left eye? on another note, this mini-figure was my favourite. female mini-figures are very uncommon back then. i am glad i have this figure, adding to my town population. hmmm... he does look a little familiar, and i definitely recognise the lovely alice. now stop staring at her. sandy, on aug 24 2008, 06:33 am, said: it's chef, not "chief" (entirely different professions) actually, salvatore, as i like to call the chef, was in the navy where he reached the rank of chief, a nickname he holds to this day. so both work in this case. whitefang, on aug 24 2008, 09:12 am, said: flyut, if you need decals for the stickers that are featured in this set. hang around here until imperialshadows drop by to give you a little surprise if he is free. surprise? free? i'm not even close to free, i'm rather expensive, but i do have a surprise for everyone! i think you'll be interested in the companion article to this fine review, my first set restoration project. again, great job whitefang, excellent review, and tlg, this is a star amongst your sets. think about that when you're designing new ones. seriously.

1 i used to want this set so badly and i almost got it when it was rereleased. i still wonder why i didn't because with a building, van, 5 pizzas, and a then very rare female fig. this set would have been perfect for someone with a smaller collection like i had then. what surprised me the most is how well this set still holds up to others today. off to bricklink!

0 do you mean this one http://www.brickset....aspx?set=2962-1 ? i would also like to get that, alone for the fact that it's the only res-q set with a female fig

1 i have this set and it's pretty nice. i love the res-q theme in general. i think that tow truck is easily the highlight of this set and is probably the best such vehicle i've seen in any city set. the other vehicles are also great. the base itself is lacking though, as it basically consists of one room that doesn't even have side walls. it does include a cool 3x6 computer sticker and a vast array of minifig tools and equipment though. i have some plans to modify the building and make it larger but have never gotten around to doing it.

1 there are very few late 90's or early 00's sets worth ever having and i wish i had this one. with it's futuristic look and yes, that tow truck too, oh yeah heaps of equipment ! it's not over junorised, there is still plenty of building in it. thanks and have a happy new year, 'metalandi' !

0 wow, this is one great review! fantastic pictures, this looks like one cool set with heaps of neat functions. a shame it doesn't include exclusive figures (like ahsoka and captain rex in the at-te or plo koon and asajj ventress in the gunship), but you can't have everything. so again, thanks for this sweet review! ~peace

0 nice review i hope i can get this set [as well as agents, city & other sw stuff...] and nice pics, i didnt think they were bad, i thought they were pretty good

0 mattzitron, on aug 13 2005, 11:30 pm, said: the strange thing is, for the first time i can remember the minifigs came decapitated, and there's no neckwear. i recall jake saying something about it being new lego policy to supply the minifig heads and torsos separately. what with the expenses-trimming and all, it's apparently one of the many little quirky things they've discovered in the manufacturing and packaging process that people have done for years without thinking (in this case, putting the heads on the torsos) but that turns out to be a surprisingly significant expense (timewise, i suppose). think it was in one of his blog posts, but not sure. too tired (ie, lazy) to go hunting for it now, sorry >-|

1 good work samsta! no wonder i wasn't aware. 4+ pirates and all...

1 [burns]excellent...[/burns] i love those parts shots, great stuff in there! this really is a good sign for the new line, hopefully there'll be the same level of usefulness in the others. thanks for taking the time to finish it up! did you scan the back of the instructions?

1 very nice review of a set that i've been dying to get, but my friendly neighborhood lego store never seems to have in stock. the yellow seat is most definitely not a new piece. i had two of those in my old beta-1 command base, almost 30 years ago!!

1 thanksfor this review, i also got this set recently, and i'm very happy about it. i live the design of these new trucks, and the forklift is also great. not to forget the good amount of cargo. btw., i think the "mysterious cargo" only are normal fuel barrels

1 today i shall be reviewing 8290 mini forklift, which i recieved when i went to tru to get a technic set. so enjoy! set name: mini forklift number: 8290 theme: technic parts: 89 price: $10.99 1/box the box for this set is suprisingly small. it's about the size of a $3.99 set. it shows the main forklift, and the set information. the back of the box features the dragster. a very cool model, and the suspension works perfectly. 2/contents we have two instruction booklets; one for the forklift and one for the dragster. the bags: here are a few interesting pieces: the long double pin in blue, a bionicle connecter joint, and a yellow l joint. 3/build we start off build nice and solid, with your average technic build: the following steps build up the detail of the bottom part. next comes the cab. it's pretty simple yet effective. after that comes the forks. they work very well, but if you have the palatte on them, and you let go, it might topple off. hint: put the edge of the palatte on the small lip on the pieces that connect to the forks. this will hold it on better. the finished product and palatte: extra pieces(keep them, as they are used to build the alternate model): here is something that i found- how to put a minifigure into the cab. first, remove the side doors. then, set the fig into the cab, with his arm sticking slightly out the gap. and finaly, seal off the cab. a nice way to put system into technic for your towns. ---------------------------- parts: 9/10(loving them all.) price per part ratio: 8/10(somewhat pleaseing) playability: 9/10: works in any system town, and has a great dragster alternate model. overall: 26/30 86% b+ overall i would definatly recommend this set to anyone, whether you are a system or technic fan, this is perfect. it has great parts, and is pretty cheap. the alternate model is also very good. i hope you all enjoyed my review! i have made the pictures the requested size on my camera. i look forward to hearing your comments. edited by ~vbbn~, 27 august 2008 - 07:02 pm.

1 that´s really a sweet and charming little technic set, thanks for that fine review!

1 a very original and perhaps even a little weird design indeed, but nice and creative for sure! thanks for that good review!

1 a wonderful set and a really charming design, well detailed and pretty smooth at the same time. perhaps that small gap at the cockpit´s an a little weak point, but we can always mod a little. thanks for that very neat review, cardinal brick!

0 kimt, on aug 28 2008, 09:08 pm, said: you've got to be kidding? the ilc is bulky and doesn't even come close to the design superiority of the y-wing. it's smooth, it's beautiful and it's awesomely designed by the designers at lego. "it's got greebles, man!" i was not talking about the looks, of course the rebels have got to have nicer looking ships

0 yodalikespie, on 03 september 2011 - 07:21 pm, said: is it worth the money since the new y-wing comes out next year? please, check the date prior to asking questions in old topics. three years ago in this case. it's rude to expect people to answer questions like that, especially since it's such a generic question. besides, how is he supposed to answer the question without knowing a lot more about the new y-wing...

0 i think it is a fair to ask questions here with the expectation of a new y-wing in the coming year. i came here to look at the review even though it is a few years old. no images to go with the review. bummer. i'd like to see a more friendly tolerance on dated threads being bumped.

-1 etav8r, on 19 september 2011 - 03:16 am, said: is that a threat? is it fair to ban someone on the forum because they revived an old thread and made inquiries? thought this was a forum to discuss lego and that is what he was prompting. i don't really care why he was banned but this isn't the only time i've seen this type of behavior and discourse here on eb. not a threat at all - i was simply pointing out that yodalikespie made the mistake of inquiring about the new y-wing before we had any information on it. to my understanding, it's not so much the fact that he bumped the thread as the fact that he bumped it for no good reason. i'm not certain where the moderators stand on this issue, but i feel that yodalikespie's question would have been better received had he posed it after a substantial amount of information had been gathered on 9495 - as i've said, there simply isn't much one can go off of at this point to determine its value relative to 7658.

-1 maybe the thread should be locked or taken down since the pics consist of broken links. kind of a pointless review without the pics. and for the record, there are other websites with preliminary images of some the new 2012 sets that are not on the eurobrick star wars 2012 rumors thread. perhaps that banned fellow was hoping some of the lego insiders had some knowledge about it. i guess we'll never know now. edited by sharky, 22 september 2011 - 09:22 pm.

1 nice review and i especially enjoyed the ending. i personally think it is quite a good set for the price considering it comes with a fully armed minifig along with enough stuff to suit up another. i just wish amazon carried this set.

-1 do we really need more construction works? legoland is just one huge building site. theme: city set name: mini digger set number: 7246 number of pieces: 36 figures:1 released: 2005 list price: $3.50 (usd) 7426 peeron.com 7246 bricklink catalog diving right in let get some photos of the box the digger at work. the back just has more of the same not to inspiring. once we open the box we find two poly bags and some instructions the total contents of the box, well minus the air instruction booklet short and simple. now the single minfig of the set, nothing new of special that i can see. …got a job working construction for the johnstown company. moving onto the digger itself, it’s one of those builds where all you really need is a quick glance at the instructions and off you go. side view of the finished product. alternative view, it doesn’t look to bad. now lets add our construction worker. looks rather good, though the lifting action isn’t smooth. it’s nothing special, it’s not the greatest construction set that lego have ever produced but i think it is worth the money. the arm action really does bug me though. the rating system figures: 5/10 (just another construction peon.) parts 4/10 (nothing novel and i dislike the new digger arm system.) fun fun fun 7/10 (i think the playability is high and you can get a good load of bricks in the bucket.) design 6/10 (not the best designed digger but not the worst.) price 7/10 (a reasonable price for what you get) grand total 29/50 still halfway decent but nothing to write home about conclusion. this set is yet another in a long line of lego digger and to be honest it’s not the best in my opinion. i still hold nostalgic memories for 6504 which i still think is a great digger. from my point of view the set sits to high off the ground and make me wonder how the worker gets in. i really don’t like the digging arm action it will never be smooth and while it poses better i just think it’s inferior. despite this i still think it’s not a bad set, i’d just like it to be so much more.

1 thanks for the review, ~vbbn~. i have to say, ef has never really caught my attention, but this set seems alright. to be honest, when i saw the topic title, i was expecting a tiger- looking mech. the mech itself is cool, except for the huge leg pieces. i think the minifigs are great in ef sets, with the dark colored outfits, like dark red or dark green.

1 thanks for the review!!! one of the best sets in the entire line.

1 since my last post i've had the chance to build the tiger, and i was surprised in a good way. a much better set than i actually thougth. front

0 wait a second, a "troll"?? isn't that an orc? i thought that this is a troll:

1 nice review, makes me want 3 honestly. and comgratz on becoming a teacher in the reviewer's academy.

1 nice review! i never new trolls had fireworks, at least that's what it looks like to me. maybe i shall build a trollish fireworks company! fireworks on!

0 that’s the problem i couldn’t quite tell what, it’s a bit of a problem in a reviewer. maybe a hose to clip to the fire hydrant i don’t know.

1 brick built robot, surely we?€™re getting near classic space now? theme: space, mission mars set name: mini-robot set number: 5616 number of pieces: 24 figures:1 released: 2008 list price: £2.50 (gbp) $3.50 (usd) 2.99 (euro) 5616 peeron.com 5616 bricklink catalog 5616 shop at home let look at the box first. space man approaching the robot from behind. i?€™m not sure you can still buy the base easily anymore. the contents of the box. the contents of the box, it?€™s rather white. fairly standard mission mars spaceman, he?€™s got printing front and back but sadly no air tank! how does he breath? *as has been pointed out he does have a printed tank but i'd rather a physical one* note the megaphone is in flashlight mode not weapon mode, that?€™s important.. the robot itself feels a bit clumsy the metal detector is never going to touch the ground and it feel a bit wide. i don?€™t like the look of him something in the eyes. the reason why so we can have a box to put crystals in. both together and ready to explore new worlds etc. sadly the robot was homicidal, remember in space no one can hear you scream. it?€™s not a bad impulse set and if it marks the return of brick built robots to space then it?€™s a good thing. i just feel the robot could have been better built. the rating system figures: 6/10 (not to bad but nothing wonderful) parts 6/10 (lots of white and not much orange, but where?€™s the air tank!) fun fun fun 6/10 (probably the best impulse set as a stand alon toy lots to do with a robot and his human boss) design 5/10 (the robot feels clumsily put together i think it needs work) price 8/10 (can?€™t fault the impulse price.) grand total 31/50 (not well designed but does have more play value than other impulse sets.) conclusion. i was surprised that mission mars got impulse sets as it didn?€™t seem to sell as well as other lines last year. however i think this is a fairly good set, it has more playability than other sets and does come with a metal detector been a while since i?€™ve seen one (though i could be wrong) sadly the robot isn?€™t as good as it could be. edited by sinner, 01 september 2008 - 01:30 am.

-1 i wasn't all that impressed with what you get in this set for the price. but you have an interesting point; that the robot can be considered a reference to the classic space bots. makes me think i ought to try modding the robot later...

-1 nice review and quite funny now i'll never turn my back on a robot again. poor set. i find this set bad, even for an impulse,. the robot is poorly designed and without any use. the space minifig is ok. i'd rather get another impulse set than this. except the other life on mars mars mission impulse sets.

1 this here was a set that i new i had to get. a beautiful minfig, amazing minfigs, what more could you want? so was this set worth it? i guess you will just have to read the review to find out! set name: the batcycle: harley quinn's hammer truck number: 7886 pieces: 267 theme: batman year: 2008 price: 35.00 usd, 44.96 euro 1/box the new box art for batman is pretty stunning. it's clean, and really sells the set. for this set, harley quinn's truck is pictured attacking batman, with the set information. the back of the box shows a nice little comic, the other sets, as well as the set functions. 2/contents the instructions: the instructions for the set are, as always, clear and straightforward. they display the colors well, and have what we expect in an instruction book. 3/build minifigs: the stars of the set! batman is back with a new torso, much more metalic than before. harley had all new printed torso, legs, a new head, and that sweet new hat. batcycle: the bottom part is very sturdy thanks to a small bit of technic. the red throws it off a bit, but it isn't seen once the top part is put on. it has a nice use of the smoke stacks, and looks very nice in the end. the top part is simple, but suits the purpose well. it has handle bars, and a nice motor. the blue is a little strange though. hammer truck: the hammer truck begins with a very sturdy base. it has lots of detail, and really looks cool. rims added: lego did a very nice job at giving it a checker board appearence. the only problem here is that you stick a sticker over two bricks, multiple times. jewels: inside of the crate are these shining jewels. look how they illuminate the darkness in gotham... more added: then, we add on a spoiler and the crate. looking very nice now. the detail is again, outstanding, and it has a good amount of smoothness to it. the infamous hammer! okay, i haven't said this yet, but the square pieces need to stop. first on those sw backta tanks, now on the hammer? it creates a sloppy look for the hammer. still, this is the ultimate wacking weapon. added to the truck: on the truck it works pretty well. but the handle is to short, and it's near impossible to smash batman. the finished truck: the finished truck is really nice. the big wheels give it the monster truck feel, and the way that lego alternated the colors works well. the cockpit is a little palin, but that's not a major issue. the "i love joker" sticker is one of the best stickers i've seen. it's simply a classic. the finished set: ---------------------------- parts: 9/10 (lot's of good mocing pieces, and red and black are always usefull.) minifigs: 10/10 (awesome!) playability: 9/10 (the hammer is a little short) price-per-part: 8/10 (it's a liscensed theme, so meh.) set 7886 is a very nice set, and has some great details in it. the minifigs are very cool as well. however, their are some flaws. first, the hammer is two short, and is kind of square. the batcycle has a few awkward colors in it, which throws it off a bit. this set is definatly worth the money. batman fans will love it. and also wacking fans will like it, for that hammer... and if you would like to buy this set, here are a few useful links: s@h link peeron link please let me know your comments. and pic requests and questions are welcome!

1 cues the indy theme song let's follow indy on his pursuit on the stolen ark. indy rides full speed ahead on his white horse, but the nazis are pulling away! will indiana jones be able to grab on to the truck and reclaim the treasure? or will the nazis and their high-powered mercedes trucks prevail? let's find out! 7622 race for the stolen treasure set info set name: 7622 race for the stolen treasure theme: indiana jones released: 2008 price: 29.99 usd 34.95 euro 24.99 gbp pieces: 272 minifigs: 4 price per piece: about 11 cents and now, the main event! first, the box shots the front shows a nice image of indy on his horse, trying to make it on to the truck, and the attack truck taking aim. the back this side shows some of the features of the set, in little pictures on the left. instruction manual not much to say here, as it's the same picture as on the box. inside the manual on one of the last pages we have a nice picture like the one on the back of the box, showing some features of the set. random manual pic here we have the nice piece call-outs that we have come to expect lately. the bags were numbered as well. the pieces a nice selection here, especially if you like black, dark bley and bley. "cool" pieces the golden treasure chest has a really nice sparkle to it. the set also has a good assortment of coins and jewels, and some wonderful silver 1x1 dots. the canvas covering this is quite nice. it has a nice dark tan color, and some nice detail on it as well. the minifigs first comes indy's beautiful white horse. i always like lego animals and this one is no exception. here are the figs on the left indiana jones, and his nice stubble, printed legs, side bag and the best lego hat in history. and the nazis, peter, hans, and klaus. their torsos are very nice and the hats are amazing. they look really nice with all of their tan. the extra parts here you get two of the nice silver 1x1s, some clear 1x1s, and the usual technic pins and levers. now the finished set! first we have the attack truck the truck looks very good. it looks very military like with the colors and the design. it is designed wonderfully with really nice mudguards and a well-detailed front. the only fault of this is i think the top part where the gunner stands is a bit bare. the front here you can see the front, which has a nice smooth look with some nice details as well. the front ridged piece works well here. the gun this is well made. it is built by attaching a lightsaber hilt in a sort of videocamera piece. the actual area where the guy stands is pretty bare, but not too bad. backside of the truck the spare tire here is a simple, but nice touch. a side view the mudguards are smartly built by clipping wing flaps on to handle plates. this part gets a bit tedious, but the end result is worth it. the big boy cargo truck! this is another really well built truck. it has a lot of the same design elements as in the smaller truck, such as the mudguards. front view the front of this truck is as nice or better than the other truck. it uses good snot building, and everything fits in well. a close-up view of the tire area just behind the tire you can see those silver 1x1s being used as the suspension. this is a really nice addition and it looks great. note: it's only visual suspension. it is not supposed to work. the canvas cover in action now the canvas attaches by putting the holes in the canvas, on some little blue technic pins and then clamping them down with the hinged pieces. it looks really nice and curves nicely. the windscreen treasure! my favorite piece in action. i took this picture with the flash on, so you can see how it sparkles. i think we have waited far too long for this great piece. the complete set! everything all together. indy is chasing fast! indy's got it! brickshelf folder now, for the ratings! price: 9/10 (not bad, but could have slightly more pieces. at least it has 4 minifigs and that makes up for it.) parts: 9/10 (a nice selection of parts, lots of greys and black.) design: 10/10 (the trucks are really well-designed, the mudguards are excellent.) playability: 8/10 ( i always like rolling the trucks across the floor. ) build: 9/10 (pretty good, but gets a bit repetitive in some parts.) overall: 45/50 brickset bricklink entry peeron lego s@h even after intense fighting, everyone always gets along when there's food to be eaten... "hey indy! vant some mustard?" "how about some ketchup?" summary this, and all of the other indiana jones sets are some of my favorites. they all have nice colors, good design, and great minifigs. although i need indy in a different outfit pretty soon. his outfit is starting to smell a bit ripe . this set in particular is very well designed, and i can't wait for some more indy next year. thanks, and happy building! edited by erdbeereis1, 29 august 2008 - 03:47 am.

0 great review! hmm, i notice that the leg of that old guy is not so perfect. perhaps you want to push it?

-1 nice review. i really want this set, but i think the €35 here is too much (more like €25 would suit) and haven't found it cheap enough on ebay yet incl. shipping.

1 another great review erdbeeries! i have to give it a i have thought about this set long and hard and your review might just force me to pick it up. the vehicles look nice and the nazi's are great figs. bravo.

-1 it's an ok set. i just don't really like the look of the van much. too rounded for my liking. what happened to the box like cars??

1 thanls for the review, i was looking at this set last time i went to the lego store, but in the end decided not to get it. now you’ve made me really doubt my decision. one question though do you think the jet ski is as good as previous ones?

1 nice set, nice review, i already have one coastguard set (that truck) but i like the idea very much. however, the rigid inflatables could be much improved (see the real ones at www.rnli.co.uk or www.knrm.nl)

0 erdbeereis1, i've had a quick look your review and i must say it's quite superb! i'm dead tired so i'm going to take a nap but i'll be back later to read it more thoroughly.

1 excellent review! i want this set now!

0 $17 for an old set is good. i may hunt for it on ebay. :)

1 an outstanding set, too bad that i couldn't get this set set when it came out ...

1 very solid set. 5 minifigs and plenty of weapons to go around, adding up to great playability, what more could you want? (aspecially from a set this size) only i would have liked another cutlass, a musket (instead of 1 of the pistols) and for 1 of the pirates to have another head, but those things are no big deal, it is still a lot better than sets nowadays. edited by fluyt, 23 december 2008 - 09:50 pm.

0 those indians look useful for indiana jones in the future {as long as the have the new skin color} i wish i could have picked one of those up when i could.

0 well, this is a not so old set and i bet most of you already have it. so here is another review from me. as usual, let us start off with the box art. box art: i like the box art. they put a nice background for the at-ap. at the side we have the minifigs scale and at the back there is the function shown and advertisement for other set. the content: the content is consist of 6 packets of bricks and a instruction book. yeap, no sticker sheet. instruction book: the instruction books not only show us the steps but also show us all a clear pictures of the january release sets and some sets show with their function. well, this includes the at-ap functions as well. besides, there are bricks checklist as well and the how do you start off before assemble your sets and a little poster where the clones with their at-ap battling the droids. here's a random page. new pieces (to me): i never see both of this piece before so i assume it is a new pieces. anyone have any idea is there any other sets that contains this piece? the blasters: we are given a 2 long blasters which is great. which i it is more accurate as most of the clone troopers use a long blaster. the minifigs: the minifigs is 2 shock trooper but is different with #7655 clone troopers battle packs's shock trooper. the leg is different in colour, we are given white hip while the one in the battle pack are given a black hip. furthermore, we get a new printed headgear, which i think they have improve it, check out the mouth printing, the colour is brighter. so here is the headgear: the headgear limit itself from turning to the side this is because the front part it is too low until it block by the torso. the shock troopers: without helmet on: we are given a black stud, no face printed. how i wish that i have extra. with helmet on: comparison with shock troopers from battle pack: the at-ap: here's the at-ap. it looks ugly at a certain angle and looks great in a certain angle. anyway i still like the set. i like the walker vehicle. below are the pictures taken randomly: top view: side view: without stabilizer leg: with stabilizer leg: rear view: the functions: well, the functions are not so impressive. just something turning around, open here and there. the only function that is say as special is the retractable stabilizer leg. the cockpit: the cockpit can fit two clone troopers but too bad we are only given two and is not enough as there is no gunner on top. inside it there is a guns holders, which can hold two guns but fall off easily when you are trying to remove the guns. well the other side have some speedometre thing and a controller. to reveal the cockpit, you have to open the top hatch. look below: so you can see what's inside: oops, the side hatch and back hatch as well: open and close: i think this pieces is use not to let you open the hatch but to make some design, i mean make it able to move inside. with clones: beneath: so this is the pieces that hold the stabilizer leg when is not in use. this is how the stabilizer leg move: at last~ and of course the revealing cockpit from below and at the back. guess the droids have alternative way to take this things down faster. the leg: there are pieces blocking the leg to go to the front i mean overhead and lose balance. the base in not movable the side armor: the side armor has door and this is how it is attach. it is very flimsy, when you want to adjust it to be a little steep to creat the shape, they might just fall off. so it is connected to the body with just a technic pin. and to hold it properly, here is the support: the side hatch: it open and close easily, very loose, nothing to hold it tight. here's some view when the side hatch is open. the cannon: the cannon on top is movable and adjustable. the big cannon can move up and down while the smaller one can cove sideways. but the smaller one tend to lose balance when it is without minifigs, means the one on top and below will not b align. this is the pieces that only enable it to move up and down. to prevent it from moving freely, lego put two pieces to block it. completion: i try to make the sets looks great. i think this angle is right. spare parts: it is so few compare with #7673 magna guard starfighter and it is more expensive. overall: this set is not really a good set. the hatch is quite flimsy, top and the side since there is nothing to hold them tight. besides, it is lack of one clone. but to complete your walker collection, you must have it. pros: -no sticker needed -new improved headgear -long balsters cons: -lack of clone -flimsy -expensive as few pieces are given] hope you guys like it. edited by kimt, 30 august 2008 - 12:01 pm.

-1 i do not like the fact that the clones have pure white legs. it looks weird to me. it was also weird that they included shock troopers, but it was probably a way to get people to buy it. this set also seems like one of those that was kind of thrown in with a mix of other sets like the tie crawler. i never picked it up, and with the new clone wars sets out, i won't.

0 stauder, on aug 29 2008, 02:45 pm, said: has anyone noticed the boxart includes the 3rd leg both in the lowerd position as well as the raised one? stauder. it's not the 3rd leg, it's the other main leg. zoom in and take a closer look.

0 did anyone encounter the problem with the main turret? apparently, the very tip of the piece (cone shape) can't be put onto the "pole" piece. i check the instructions 2 times and still can't find what i'm doing wrong. is it just me or did anyone else got this problem as well?

1 product: 7681 separatist spider droid™ (ssd) theme: star wars: the clone wars no of pieces: 206 release date: 26 july 2008 rrp: sgd59.90/usd29.90 availability: lego shop@home, target, toys 'r' us (worldwide). quote conquer the galaxy, one planet at a time! unleash the power of the separatist spider droid™! this towering engine of mechanical destruction from the clone wars strides across hostile terrain on four independently positionable stilt legs, then uses its movable laser cannons to blast republic forces. includes commander fox™, clone trooper™, battle droid™, super battle droid™ and battle droid commander™ minifigures! rotate the laser cannon on top! laser cannon underneath bends to change direction! measures 6" (15cm) tall and 10½" (27cm) wide! also known as the homing spider droid, this is what i would usually reckon as a mini-fig set if not for the high price point. since there's a total of 5 mini-figs to be had, and at least 3 of them are going to be high sought after.(commander fox™, clone trooper™, battle droid commander™). at first glance, it looked like there's only 3 packets. actually, it's a total of 4 packets, 1 of the packet is inside the biggest packet. it's not a very complex build. took me around 25min since i was playing around with the mini-figs more than i was building up the spider droid. though finally, here's the completed build-up. usually for lego products, what excites me are the vehicles, yet this set is the other way round. yes, the mini-figs are definitely the crowd-pleaser this time. on with the review. here's the close-ups of the droids in the following order, battle droid commander™, battle droid™, & super battle droid™. there's not much to comment on the droids, except that the battle droids come with the new arm that's able to hold the blaster properly upright. the sbd is the same dude that can be found easily in the previous droid battlepack. and now the good part... clone troopers. and that's commander fox, and his trooper. i was quite mystified by the amount of accessories given to the clone troopers as per the instruction booklet, as there wasn't any indication of what they were... (commlink, grenades, sensor scope, range finder?!?) then it hit me... real hard. notice anything yet? yup, it's a night scope, and a range finder. that, plus the visor that's available to fox too. now, this is really a good time to start troop building for the clone wars. :twisted: here's the weaponary. of course, let not forget the main dude... fore: port: aft: starboard: the ssd looks very similar to the actual screenshots from aotc, though am still wondering what's that little translucent red piece for... a re-enactment. and a comparison. this set is really either a miss or a hit. for me, it's a hit, due to the mini-fig count, and the wide array of accessories. it's going to probably be a hit depending on the movie that's coming out this month, since we have commander fox here(i heard that c.fox hasbro figure is a target exclusive, meaning it's gonna be another highly sought after). this set is also stated to be a limited edition, and seeing as how it's only available so far in only 1 toys r us in sg, this just might not be available anymore after the movie starts. :d comments: this review was done immediately after the launch of the clone wars toys at the midnight launch on 26 july on a local starwars fan forum. and after having caught the movie only yesterday, i now only have this to say, "it's not part of the movie!?!". oh well, cmdr. fox probably will fair better once the tv series starts proper. then again, that less-than-one-minute cameo of him, i do find it unforgivable. this being the 2nd review available, i sincerely hope you guys enjoy it.

1 i did enjoy it thanks for sharing your thoughts in this set and reviewing it. i'll add it to the index. maybe you should consider joining the reviewers academy and rule the galaxy (or something )

1 valentin, nice review! i was thinking of doing this review, and realised there were 3 reviews being done for this lovely set. i must admit this is an amazing set, after buying it in tru for sgd$49.90 (15% discount). i like the comparison of both spider droid even though one is not lego. thanks for doing this lovely review. it's enjoyable to read.

1 thanks. keke, imagine the horror that gripe my heart to see the discounted price on the sg's toys 'r' us flyer about a month after its release into retail. anyway, looking forward to your other reviews too.

-1 the next in my attempt to review every impulse set single handed theme: space, mission mars set name: alien jet set number: 5617 number of pieces: 21 figures:1 released: 2008 list price: £1.99 (gbp) $3.50 (usd) 2.99 (euro) 5617 peeron.com 5617 bricklink catalog 5617 shop at home as always we begin outside of the box it looks rather exciting at first glance. set that cost a lot more than this one. now for what?€™s inside. the contents of the box, the impulse sets never look that inspiring. now for the alien, i have to say i?€™m not impressed. i?€™m not a big space fan and i only bought this due to my impulse review challenge, but as the main point of the impulse sets is the alien is a little hard to build a good set round something with one point or articulation. it lacks what make lego minfigs so great their articulation. now for the space vehicle, as always with impulse a short and easy build ensues. took maybe 2 mins at the most. time to mount the alien in his craft. the craft looks a little wide for him. slightly better from this angle but still not winning any awards. i?€™m disappointed of the impulse sets i?€™ve reviewed so far this is clearly the weakest of them, but what really disappointing is the other seem so good and useful. the rating system figures: 3/10 (the alien is not a good minfig) parts 6/10 (some interesting parts but nothing that special.) fun fun fun 2/10 (i can?€™t think of anything to do with this set to be honest.) design 4/10 (poorly designed the box makes it look much better.) price 6/10 (despite the impulse price tag i?€™m still unhappy about the price.) grand total 21/50 (less than half marks the lowest i?€™ve given so far.) conclusion. in many ways i?€™m annoyed, from the outside of the box this set looks quite interesting and certainly appears to be well designed. the idea of a small alien fighter/flying craft is in my opinion a good one, but sadly when you?€™ve got the finished product in your hand it looks nothing like the box art. while i think mission mars had some interesting sets and i might still get some of them this one will not be a repeat purchase for me.

0 well set out review with alot of great content! gotta ask you though, how does the set look nothing like the box art? with so few pieces i'd have thought one could mentally put it together given the box front.

-1 thanks for this review. as for the set? well, i am not to crazy about this set, but i want some sort of small alien fleet vehicals, and this would work well. but i would rather ave my money to buy classic town. edited by ~vbbn~, 01 september 2008 - 02:48 am.

-1 impluse sets are made good by using parts well and minifigs. this has either. i give a low score. i really dislike the alien figs. worst lego fig ever.

-1 thanks for sharing this review with us. i think this one of the sets. in europe this thing is waaaay overpriced and thus makes it a crappy set. we pay nearly double the us price. so i rated it poor. also because the figs included does not make it great. the hailfire is well designed and looks great, but that's just about all there is worthy of a positive mentioning. sorry. [on a side note: as a bronze-awarded student, where's the price in eur and gbp? and where's the poll?] [nevermind the poll, i've added that one for you ]

1 thanks for the review, jimbutcher. i really like that set. it combines interesting and good design with some awesome cool parts and a neat amount of charm.

1 great review. i agree that this set is underrated. the hailfire is supposed to be a little taller than two battle droids, so scale-wise it's nice. the dwarf spider droid is amazing in my opinion. i just wish it wasn't brown, it makes me feel like it's on geonosis. we never saw a grey varient of the hailfire, so it's fine with me that it's brown.

1 this is a great set, i have 2 of them now, and i plan to get more. it is much better than the droid battle pack. for 10 bucks more, you get better battle droid arms and some canon "vehicles", good enough for me.

1 7681: homing spider droid (limited edition) number of pieces: 206 number of minifigs: 5 price: 34.99 usd/ 29.99 eur/ 19.99 gbp theme: star wars: episode ii year released: 2008 brickset folder bricklink catalog welcome to my sixth review on these boards, of the mighty homing spider droid. at first glance, this ball on legs may not seem like much, but hopefully this review will change your mind. the box. this box is the standard for all of the new clone wars sets: sleek, shiny, and a right-out-of-the-factory look. the blue-and-white color scheme is fantastic, and portrays that the sets are based off of a cartoon well. this box has a "limited edition" (in spanish, too! ) seal slapped on the front, although you won't have trouble finding this in your local toys "r" us, because of the big clone wars display in the front of the store that you can't miss. overview in this picture, you can see the contents of the whole set (minus the instruction booklet) built. you can spot five minifigures (which i'll get to later), and a very tall cis weapon, known as the homing spider droid. this weapon of destruction is a must-have for your cis army, although the color scheme (mostly dark bley and light bley) is a change up from the regular colors (brown or blue) of the cis. this may have something to do with the blended armies of the trade federation and corporate alliance, but i don't know for sure. the instruction manual is very thin, only about twenty pages. homing spider droid this is the main part of the set. four huge legs, two mounted guns, and a red sensor eye are the highlights of this artillery unit. there's not many playability factors to this one, but sometimes its just fun to squash the little clones, a change-up of the contrary. it also looks good next to all of the other cis sets, but you might want to clear some room in your display area; the legs take up a lot of room! this thing is also massively tall, about the same height as the republic cruiser. main body this is the main body of the spider, which has no cockpit and is remote controlled. this spherical body (not in that sort of way...) is a very quick build, and features a big, red eye connected by a red stud and hinge. top gun here is the top gun (not with tom cruise), which is connected to the body using a clever technic system (pun not intended). as you can see from this picture, you can see that it can rotate a full 360 degrees, but only if you remove the eye. also, the gun can be pulled back, and if you let go, it will snap back, like the a gun does when fired, due to the force of the shot. i'm not sure this was intended by tlg, because it wasn't showed anywhere on the box or in the manual. lower gun here is the gun attached to the under body of the main part. it is attached using a hinge, which allows it to move up and down. i also like the cord (that presumably transfers power) included on both guns. hips here is one of the hips attaching the legs to the body. there is one on each side, with two legs each. the are attached to the body and legs with technic pieces. legs you can see the tall legs in this pic. they are basically just technic poles and connectors. feet this is one of the feet, the essential to balancing the whole vehicle. these and the legs are repetitive, so i suggest doing them all at the same time to avoid flipping back in the manual and repeating the process three more times. the picture speaks for itself for the design of the feet. all are connected to the legs using a double-holed technic piece. one massive son of a gun this thing is so tall! it frightens the skin off of even the toughest, most experienced soldiers. run for your lives!! look at how much havoc and fear it causes! family photo enough of the battle scenes, here is a shot of this spider with it's smaller cousin: the dwarf spider droid. minifigs finally, here are the minifigs that come with this set. there are five in all, which include: battle droid: nothing special, but still an addition to your army commander battle droid: i love that yellow torso! super battle droid: again, nothing special clone trooper: i'm glad they gave us one in this set, i can add it to to my other phase 1 clones. commander fox: i love it! everything from the dark red markings to the accessories are fantastic! the head is just the regular anime style clone wars face. this set comes with two flashlights, two antennae, one visor, one pauldron, and one kama. close-up of fox here is a close-up of fox, so you can see the detailed insignia of the republic guard. that wraps it up for the review, here is the final verdict: build: 8/10, very easy and straightforward, a little repetitive with the legs. should take the seosoned builder around 20 minutes. playability: 6/10, not many play factors, but it's fun to just squash puny clones with this giant arachnid. swooshability: n/a minifigs: 10/10, you really can't ask for more in this sort of set! design: 8/10, not very sturdy, but it is altogether clever. price: 5/10, yes, it is limited edition, but pumping up the price fifteen dollars more than it should be is a little ridiculous. overall score: 8.5/10, an excellent set for display, although not very sturdy. minifigs are superb, but the price could be better. in the end, i would highly recommend this to any prequel trilogy fan looking to build up his/ her army. well, that's about it for this review, please feel free to leave your opinions!

-1 i just bought this set the other day and i must admit that it gets a "below average" from me. the price is not corresponding with what you get. which would be implied, had jim added the eur or gbp price in the info[hint hint ] the spider droid is flimsy at best. making it stand or even move without tumbling over is hard. also why the brown cylinders on the legs? keep the colourscheme clean, please. the figs are fine, except that i dislike the clone headgear and the fact that the helmets now have holes in the sides, allowing the flesh head to show within = goofy looking. i am soo replacing the clone heads with black ones. great review of an acceptable set

1 thank you for that good review, jimbutcher. i think that this is really a pretty interesting and original looking set. maybe it´s not very stable, but it owns some special 'war of the worlds' charm for sure...

1 i love the look of this set it's the closest to getting a walking eye from the venture bros. as well as the droids and troopers :)

0 this is polar-1, over... it's day 5 at arctic research base 76. we are experiencing radio difficulties since discovering a number of strange radioactive arctic life forms which seem to be effecting our signal, over. we have encountered a large polar bear which by all account appears to be friendly and playful. our food supply; however, has diminished quickly, and we have to venture north from the base to a frozen lake in search of fish. our cordinates are currently 46Â°45â?²4â?³n, 741Â°21â?²7â?³w. we do plan to take the snowmobile to the lake after we get our provisions in order. this is polar-1, out. polar explorer bonus pack set #: 6569 theme: arctic year released: 2000 piece count: 76 minifigs: 2 list price: $10 (usd) in 2000, lego introduced a new theme called arctic. it was something completely new and different for lego as no mini-fig scale sets and/or adventurers had ever ventured to the arctic. the set offered new orange pieces and combined elements of blue and white pieces to provide a number of sleds, vehicles, a mobile outpost (6520), and even a large polar base (6575). the theme was unfortunately short lived and did not see 2001. this particular set is a "value pack" that combines sets 6578 (polar explorer) and 6586 (polar scout) at a reasonable price of $10 (usd). i may have even paid a few dollars less at a discount toy store back in the early 2000s. a picture of the "bonus pack" with the two sets combined within the box: the backside features an advertisement for the lego club and pictures of other arctic sets: starting with the smaller set, the polar explorer (just a tip of the iceberg ): instructions front of box back of box both sets include the same minifig, an arctic fig with glasses and a thick arctic coat: here's a shot of the fig with his hood on. i always thought the hood is a nice piece that would work well for hoth rebel snow scenes. the set includes a few nice accessories: the set actually creates a small ice/snow formation that can even be placed on water to represent an iceberg: here's a close-up with the blue ice spider: the complete set: next, the polar scout: front of box back of box the polar scout instructions picture the same image as the box: but i really like the real arctic imagery on the backside: the set includes a small sheet of decals: included are some great arctic accessories: and some interesting arctic creatures, like this neon orange scorpion in a ball of ice: i love the polar bear, a great addition to snow scenes: but the best part of this set is the orange and black sled: the back sled attachment (u-haul) has some tools and a removable storage cover: the top comes off easy to store tools and equipment: here's the arctic fig with a great metal detector (or other snow research device): and the sled itself: lastly, a picture of the complete polar scout: final thoughts: i'm a little disappointed that arctic was a short-lived theme. at the time, i wasn't too interested in the arctic, but i still regret not buying the large polar research base after seeing it at a discounted price. i was able to pick up this set and the mobile outpost that i never opened. i'd be interesting in reading your thoughts in regard to this set and the arctic theme.

-1 a nice set review. as for the theme itself, i though it was a very interesting theme. sadly i don’t think lego put enough effort into it, i was personally upset not to se a second year even if i didn’t buy any of the sets. it reminds me of the artic theme playmobil did at one point in the distant past to be honest. i think a number of good artic scenes were missed, when it came out a really wanted to get a ski plane but it never came, i built it myself in the end but i don’t know how lego missed that one. on a slightly random note i do know that at least one lego minifig did make it all the way to the real artic with a research team, sadly i don’t have any pictures to offer you.

0 i find it amusing that the numbers on the decal (for the flag) were chosen so that it wouldn't look stupid if you put it on upside-down by accident.

0 46Â°45â?²4â?³n, 741Â°21â?²7â?³w??? those are some wierd coordinates.

1 nice review brickster! the arctic theme is very nice. the minifigs have a great look to them especially with the hoods. the colors for the arctic sets i have always liked, and somehow the idea of minifigs exploring the arctic is fun to me.

0 wasn't there some years back a film based on aliens in the arctic? can't remember the name and i think it was really old, but there certainly was going on something with strange creatures and a polar base

1 2872 witch and fireplace review theme: fright knights parts: 18 figs: 1 price: unknown (bricklink $5.00+) year: 1997 brickset peeron brickshelf bricklink ever wanted to turn into a animal, wanted to curse your enemy or just wanted to be rich beyond your wildest dreams. you should go visit the witch and her fireplace. she can brew you up a potion for any occasion or purpose. so head down to see the witch right now. although this set is from the fright knights theme it can easily fit in with any other castle theme due to the lack of specialised fright knight parts and printings. the set comes with no astounding parts but looks like the source for our good magician impulse set from the current castle theme. i think i got this as a promo set. official pic. the box art for the set has the standard fright knight background and lego system logo followed by the set number. down the left hand side of the box a cat is attempting a head stand. also i think this box display the contents of the set in an attractive set up as usual. 1. the whole set minifigs and all here is the witch. on the torso there is a spider amulet which is a little hard to make out due to the low res of the image. the witches wand is the same as the bellville fairy wands except in trans red like a lightsaber blade although it is completely useful as a lightsaber. as you have probably noticed the witch has no legs instead she has a slope brick with the dress pattern printed on witch (get it witch-which) looks better than asajj ventress' from the new clone wars sets in my opinon. (for this anyway) the fairysaber (new word) duel. this is the old run down fireplace of the witch. at the base there are two smouldering coals instead of fire witch (it's not funny any more is it?) doesn't make that much sense seeming as it is a fireplace. the little triangular brick on top doesn't really do anything i also accidentally put the wrong one on while building, it should be a sloping brick. here are the coals. the old trans orange studs are less translucent than the new ones. i like how they have places them above the main baseplate on a 1x2 plate so they are in line with the rest of the fire place other wise it would look wrong. here is everything else i haven't covered yet, the crystal ball, the pets and the magical potion vial. the crystal ball is identical to the one included with the good wizard impulse form the current castle theme. i like the molds for the cat and the bat although if the cat had some yellow printing for the eyes like the white cat had black for the eyes it would be much better. i think the trans green tube things are a little uncommon but i'm not worried about that. 2. overall build: 6/10 extremely puzzling and difficult do not attempt alone . it's pretty simple but seeming as it has a load of stuff you can move around it is good. minifigs: 9/10 i really like the witch and it couldn't have really come with anyone else also it came with the wand which is really good too. design: 8/10 it should have come with some fire and maybe some more orange bricks to put at the base. parts: 8/10 the minifigure isn't bad nor are the animals or the trans green part. price: 10/10 i am guessing this was pretty good. seeming as i think i got this as a promo i gave it 10 because it was free. playability: 7/10 as wth all impulse sets there isn't much here but at least it comes with some animals to have a fight with or give the witch rabies. overall: 8/10 if it came with some more stuff for the fire place and the cat was more detailed it would have scored higher but because this set can easily be intergrated with other castle sets it got a mighty 8. 3. mini comic ! hocus pocus magic shocus turn my pets into dinosaurs (not to catchy is it?) *poof* oh know i think i might drink my magical potion glug glug glug oh! my

1 kimt, on sep 30 2008, 12:55 am, said: you're damn right, that is strange why is this your favourite? please explain, i'd love to find that out haha! i wish i could. well, i like small sets, and this is, aside from the fright knight's flying machine, comes in the smallest lego box i have seen. i just like the look and story feel of the set. i wish lego put out more sets like this and the 3075 ninja master's boat.

1 huzzah! the king has declared a royal tournament pitting the brave knight in his shining armour, against the feared skeleton warrior and his shadow horse. the jousting arena is set up so let the joust begin! 7009 the final joust set info set name: 7009 the final joust theme: castle released: 2007 price: usd 7.99-gbp 5.99-eur 7.95 pieces-62 minifigs: 2 figs 2 horses price per piece: about 13 cents let the games begin! box shots the front has an image of the knight and skeleton jousting with lightning in the background. the back show the two now fighting with an ax and ball and chain. i don't really like the box image, as i think the background looks too dark. manual the front has the same picture as on the box. on the back some of the other 2007 castle sets are displayed. this is better than the usual sweepstakes image that we get. the pieces nothing really special here. but you at least get a good assortment of weapons. shields i always like lego shields and these are no exception. the patterns are great. minifigs first the horses. these are great, the knight's horse's coverings are really nice. now, the minifigs. the knight and skeleton both have nice armor. the torsos are plain black for the skeleton and bley for the knight. the finished product in the middle is the jousting barrier which is simple, but serves its purpose. on the left we have the weapon rack which is good. it would have been nice if tlg had included a rack for the skeleton as well though. extra parts only two extra white parts here. you can use them if your knight's horse wants to retire and look like a normal horse again. oh! that has to hurt! it seems that the skellie has won this round! poor knight... brickshelf folder now, for the ratings! price: 7/10 (not a very good price per piece ratio, however at least 2 figs and 2 horses are included) parts: 7/10 (the shields and log bricks are nice, but most of the others are nothing spectacular) design: 8/10 (relatively well designed, but a bit boring) playability: 8/10 (you can joust with it and that's about all) build: 8/10 (short and easy) overall: 38/50 brickset lego s@h peeron bricklink strike! it seems that the horses have rebelled against their riders... summary this set although not amazing, is still a very solid set. the minifigs are great and so are the horses, but the rest of the set kind of feels like an afterthought. even with its negative aspects i still recommend it, especially if you are a castle fan. thanks, and happy building! p.s. if you want to see how i made this set a bit more fun, check out this click

0 review of 7670 hailfire droid and spider droid *updated* theme: sw episode ii / clone wars parts: 249 (- figs) figs: 4 price: £20.00, $20.00, ?‚?25.99 year: 2008 i think many people were deterred from this set because of the low piece count and a high price for it although it does come with 4 minfigures. 1. overall set and figs official box pic. this indicates it is a geonosis set from the background but it is no different from any other set same old brown separatist ship/s. the whole set. some red tan droids would have been nice like in the geonosian fighter set. all the minifigs. the super battle droid body is slightly different to the one in the bp. it looks more grainy and silver. i doubt this has any relevance for it being a geonosis set but i like them better how they were in the bp's the super battle droid body dwarfing the commander droids body. i think that the new commander droids body is better than the old one with just the yellow strip even though it is less accurate. new twisted battle droid arm, each droid has one of these. i don't really like having droids with these new guns i think the older guns suited them much better. 2. hailfire droid hailfire droid by itself. it is certainly smaller than the original. seeming as this is the main part of the set i was hoping it would be bigger but i don't mind it being this small too much. wheels and rockets can fold outwards and inwards the wheels which spin round two large clear discs and made from loads of these tiny links. this is probably the best way to make the wheels on this small scale. the only other alternatives i can think of are using the tracks from the wookiee attack set or catterpilla tracks, both of which wouldn't look right. one of the missile pods. these use the new flick-fire missiles which don't fall out are an excellent idea. they should have come with the purple cones like on the magna guards staffs instead of red though because in the film the missiles are purple. one of the new flickfire missiles that don't drop out when the model is tilted forward. i don't know what the holes in them are for though. the 3 "eyes" are made up of 2 trans red cheese bricks for the sides and 1 trans red stud for the center.you can also see how the missile pods are attached to the side of the body. this is the back of the hailfire droid. there is a plate with a hole in, i have found only one purpose for this. the hailfire droid is the commander droids war chariot! what do you use the plate for? 3. spider droid the spider droid. the design has been greatly improved from the wookiee attack set. not only is it more accurate but also more poseable which is useful when setting up battle scenes. the ball joint provides the place to put the antenna which isn't long enough but the dome form the old set looks more like the droid form star wars episode ii. the eyes are made of a telephone piece with 2 trans red studs on. in the original it had orange studs. the eyes can be seen in action 2 pics down. i told you it was a telephone. 1 of 4 identical legs. these are very easy to adjust into what ever position you want and are much better than the originals. but a word of warning never pull them apart as i did they become very loose when put back together so i put some blue tack in the holes. 4.overall build: 7/10 a little to repetitive for my liking. minifigs: 8/10 4 figs for £20 isn't too bad plus they come with new guns. design: 9/10 both vehicles are very well designed but the hailfire's small size let the set down. parts: 8/10 comes with lots of useful (maybe not ) brown track links. price:7/10 not too bad with 4 figs and loads of little brown links. playability: 6/10 not to much on it's own overall: 7/10 if it came with some clones and tan red droids it would be better. afetr jar jar wiped out a small droid patrold he realized he was being watched mesa in big dodo this time...

1 6205: v-wing fighter number of pieces: 118 number of minifigs: 1 price: 9.99 usd/ 13.99 eur/ 8.99 gbp theme: star wars/ episode iii year released: 2006 brickset folder bricklink catalog welcome to this review of the v-wing fighter. this will be my eighth review on the boards. strangely enough, there was another set called the v-wing fighter that came out in 1997 for the space theme. note that i am missing several small pieces to this set, but they are mostly insignificant to the overall look. the box this is the standard box type for all 2005-2006 star wars sets. i can't say that i like it as much as the 2007 or 2008 box types, but it'll do. it features a profile view of darth vader and silver text. overview this is the whole set. this ship is meant to protect the chancellor at all costs. they are usually found in groups of three or four. front this ship is very sleek, and you'll notice that it's colors are dark red, light bley, and dark bley with a touch of black. it starts at the nose very narrow, but as the body progresses to the back, it gets wider, like a "v" (hence the name). back here is a view of the rear. note the trans-neon green discs used to represent the boosters. also notice the dark red r4 astro droid and the hinges used as aromor. flight all four wings (two on each side) can open up for flight/ attack mode. they can open even farther then the pic shows, but it's not an intended function. the wings a great, but it's a real pain to position them correctly, and the bottom wings close when you set the ship down. tail fins this is what the tail fins look like on each side, with two flaps attached to the top and bottom. if you look closely, the tail fins and wings look a little bit like a mini ship themselves, maybe controlled by remote. no, this is not an intended function, either. guns, side the guns are very simple but very clever, using a double technic hole piece, two black bars, and two technic pins. also note the landing gear. minifig finally, here is the minifig: a clone pilot. it has light blue arms and legs, white hands, a helmet with black markings and republic insignia on it, and a double-sided torso. the front of the torso is great, featuring shoulder straps, armor plating, and a life support system. while this minifig is not altogether accurate to the movie, it has still been one of my favorite star wars figs. back the back of the fig that can double as the front of clone marines. this side features shoulder straps and armor plating. cockpit lastly, here is the pilot seated in the cockpit. he fits perfectly, although it is not air-tight. we wouldn't want the poor guy to suffocate, now would we? that wraps up the review, here is the final verdict: build: 8/10, a nice, easy, build, and the last of the small sw ships ($10 or less). playability: 6/10, pretty fun to swoosh around, but that's about it. could use a vulture droid, but that would take away the 'small' factor. swooshability: 10/10, very fun and easy to swoosh around endlessly, without fear of it breaking. minifigs: 9/10, there really is no need to have more, although a palpy fig would be outstanding. the pilot is a great figure though. design: 9/10, extremely accurate to the movie, but the cockpit is not airtight. price: 10/10, you couldn't ask for a better deal! overall score: 8.6, an excellent set. unfortunately, this is the last of the small sw ships currently. the fig is great, and the sleek design is accurate. that just about sums it all up, feel free to leave your comments! edited by jimbutcher, 15 september 2008 - 03:11 am.

1 this was a great set for the price. ten dollars for a cool minifigure and a decent sized ship is great.

(still not as cheap as regular us price ) some ok bricks and a great minifig. thanks for sharing your thoughts and opinions on this set i'll rate this set as average. oh, yeah i've added the review to the index. thanks for the index, kimt. by the way, a certain someone recommended that i should change the fig pics, so i did that. edited by jimbutcher, 05 september 2008 - 01:35 am.

1 is your knight army feeling short? do your knights get consistently run over by the skeletons? if so, this is the set for you! 852271 knights battle pack set info set name: 852271 knights battle pack theme: castle released: 2008 price: usd 12.99-gbp 6.49-eur 9.95 minifigs: 5 it's army building time! packaging the figs come in a plastic box with a slide out tray. to open, you slide out a tab on the bottom, and pull the tray out. the weapons one plus of this set is the good weapon selection. you get a whopping 5 shields, a spear, a lance, acrossbow, a pointed lance thing and a lovely chrome sword minifigures now the main focus of this set, the figs! one thing that's nice here is that you get a good selection of different knights. the figs are quite nice, with different faces and helmets for almost every one. minifig backsides! i really like the archer's quiver. two sided head the archer has a scared head on the other side. brickshelf folder and now, the ratings! price: 6/10 (certainly a bit overpriced. it should have been $10. the star wars battle packs have only 1 less fig plus some parts for $5 less) parts: 8/10 (no bricks, but a nice selection of weapons) minifigs 9/10 (the figs are great) overall: 23/30 lego s@h brickset bricklink even with a bigger army, the poor knights are no match for modern technology... summary even though the pack is a bit overpriced, it is still great for increasing your army's size. i would get this set if you are a castle fan looking to expand your army, otherwise don't worry if you pass on this set. thanks, and happy building!

1 i love this battlepack! i bought two last time i went to legoland california, and it certainly gave the knights a good variety of new troops. however, i have one complaint, and that is the guy with the lance. i am wondering why he has a lance while fighting on foot. if tlg really wanted to give him a lance, they should have given him a horse.

0 great set, but with two huge cons. - availabilty: only on s@h? well, surely not in italian stores. - why are the figures already built? are today's kids so dumb? let's go back to those old minifig packs!

0 the cobra, on sep 2 2008, 11:33 am, said: - why are the figures already built? are today's kids so dumb? let's go back to those old minifig packs! probably to reduce the size/complexity of the package, thus, saving tlc money. i don't see it being a big deal as customization is always an option. concerning the set: not much to say other than it does what it's suppose to do: build up one's army of knights. the variance of faces and accessories are great. i especially love the chrome sword. the price isn't bad either since the package comes with five nice figs and some great equipment. edited by dj2005, 03 september 2008 - 06:46 am.

0 after reading your review i might buy me one of these. at first i thought it was quite useless, but i must admit that your review kinda changes my mind on this bp. i've added it to the index

1 and another great review from one of our academy teachers, i always look forward reading them ! i think the battlepacks for castle are a great initiative from tlc. i like this one, but also the one with the skellies, you get some different looking soldiers and a few weapons and shields, so that's cool. the low prices make it so that most people could build a large army/battle if they want to. a big for your review and another for tlc for making these. edited by zorro3999, 06 october 2008 - 05:40 pm.

1 i love this set. i bought one when i went to the lego store at downtown disney, and went home and bought another online. i love that it gives you a variety of weapons and figures. i like using the bowl helmet guy to man my catapults and crossbows.

-1 it's way to expansive for what you get, besides you pay more for the package then its containts...

-1 i like your review on this battle pack. but i think that this battle pack was over priced. $12 for this? i am not paying that much for 5 knights.

0 dear all, i found this to be a very usefull army building set. at 2 euro per minifig it is relatively cheap in my book, so i bought 4 battle packs recently. although, it could be difficult to integrate all of them in your army. personally, i reshuffled some of the weapons as to integrate them better. but that is a personal preference ofcourse. kind regards, teddy

0 tanks for the review erdbeereis1 but i don't really need to buy this set since they're are always loads of police sets and it's not as if i need anymore cops, although stud makes it tempting...

1 thanks for this fine and elaborate review on the 2nd best impulse set there is. (yes the troll warrior wins by a zillion miles) i've added it to the index

1 set name: crossbow attack set number: 7090 theme: castle pieces: 54 minifigs: 3 released: 2007 price: 5.99usd, 3.99 eur, 7.99 cdn legoshop.com description: ready, aim, fire!it's a battle of brave knights against the evil skeleton rider! includes 2 knights, skeleton and a skeleton horse! rolling wagon has a launcher that really fires! bricklink inventory peeron inventory brickshelf gallery now, on to the review! the box as you can see, the front of the box illustrates the set very nicely, showing the skeleton warrior attacking and the knights firing their crossbow. the back the back of the box shows a small battle happening between a knight and a skeleton, as well as the main feature of the set, the firing crossbow (more on that later.) the instructions not much to say here, its the same as the front of the box. the back of the instructions this merely shows pictures of other sets in the castle line. random instruction page this set does not use piece callouts to tell you what parts you will need in each step. however, the set is so small you should never have trouble finding a piece. the minifigures this is the main reason i bought this set. you get two knights, one with a standard helmet, and the other one with a new mold. you also get a skeleton warrior. the horse the set comes with a skeleton horse that looks great. however, it is a single molded piece that has no articulation. close-up of the warrior riding his horse here you see the brave skeleton riding in on his...ah......er......um......noble steed! the accessories/weapons for minifigure accessories, you get an axe, a skeleton sword, and a skeleton shield. extra pieces i was left with one skeleton arm and one leg when i was finished the build. the crossbow wagon and now, to the main part of the set, the crossbow wagon. it is really just a plate with some whells attached and a lot of those cheese wedge pieces to create the track for the projectile. back view this view shows the mechanism that makes the crossbow fire. it is powered by a rubber band. you pull back on a technic piece, which creates tension in the elastic band. when you let go, the elastic pushes the piece forward, which in turn hits the projectile and makes it fire! it works fairly well, but i would have prefered it fired farther. entire set the skeleton charges at his adversaries! the knights prepare to counterattack! overall build: 10/10 the build is simple, easy and quick. set design: 7/10 the crossbow could have worked a bit better. playability: 8/10 the crossbow is fun to shoot. minifigs: 10/10 it doent get much better than this. i love that domed helmet mold! price: 8/10 the set is very affordable and worth the price. overall score:43/50 conclusion overall, this is a great set and a solid army builder. you get three minifigures for a fair price and the crossbow wagon adds some much-needed playability. i bought two of these to bolster my army and to stock up on those rare domed helmet pieces. basically, get this set! thank you for taking the time to read my review. i hope you liked it!

0 i agree that this set is worth the price considering the amount of minifigs and even a skeletal horse. it also comes with a lot of blue 1x1 slopes that are always useful and quite rare to obtain. another weapon for the soldier operating the catapult (or a shield for the other soldier) would have been great, but that is pushing it. the crossbow itself is quite nice and is better than what most $6 sets come with, imo. overall, a good set indeed. thank you for the review and the other review concerning the knight, of which i hope to buy in the near future as it looks like it comes with a great deal of goodies. the weapon rack is useful, too.

-1 cardinal brick, on sep 4 2008, 07:47 am, said: nice review . i still thing sets like this are the reason castle has done so well, it allows you to collect a large number of minfig for not very much cash, which i certainly indulged in. my only complaint is that you end up with the evil skeletons out numbered, however heard of the good guys winning with the numbers in their favour. i've experienced that problem too. i find my knights outnumber my skellies about 3:1.

0 millacol88, on sep 6 2008, 01:55 am, said: i've experienced that problem too. i find my knights outnumber my skellies about 3:1. a crownie dies easyer than a skeleton. it's so hard to perforate the lungs or pierce the heart on a skeleton with a spear or crossbow bolt, isn't it? a great set with a reasonable price. thanks for sharing it with us. added to the index.

0 you're really rolling these reviews out, huh? i am not sure how i feel about this set. while it does include five figs, three are skeletons and are generally worth much less than say three trolls/orcs (i know they didn't exist at this point in time so this is understandable). the amount of horses is nice, but i'm not a big lego horse fan. what this set does have is a great appearance and brings atmosphere to the table. $20 is an affordable amount for those of us who do not wish to splurge too much on a toy while being enough to actually get a large enough set to create something out of. personally, i'd rate it in between average and above average. like another castle set (i can't remember which), i just feel this one also lacks something.

0 i really like this set, and it's probably my next purchase from a store (if i can still find it). there's alot of great pieces (i especially like the spiked thingy on the front), and it makes a great addition for any skeletal army. above all, i just love the spine-chilling feeling of it. if i were a minifig in a legoland, i'd be scared out of my pants-piece if i saw a carriage like that rolling towards me in a dark night.

1 one of the best sets from the new castle theme. we havent seen a carriage in a long long time. and it looks so spooky and sceary! lots of minifigs new skeleton horses (3!) this was the first set i got from the new castle theme!! outstanding!

1 this was one of the first sets i bought from the new castle theme and i love it. so many figs and awesome skeleton horses in just one set. at the same time you get quite a few usefull black bricks for castle mocs. another perfect set in the new world of castle review added to the index.

-1 other than the minis, accessories and animals, this set is 'meh' at best.

1 my first fantasy era set.. and now i have 5 of them.. really good set..

0 this set is alright but it doesnt have that pizzaz feeling you know what i mean. i would prefered a knights carrage realy but the design is ok.

1 i'm a little late in the coming (okay, a lot ), but regardless, i'd applaud you for another fantastic and insightful review, erdbeereis. out of all the castle sets, this one remains one of my favorites. i got it for christmas in 2007, before i intended to spend much money on the new castle theme (that changed once i managed to get the king's castle siege for a very good price). it's really a wonderful set all around - the design accomplishes the spooky undead feel very well, and it contains a good piece selection and a phenomenal amount of minifigs. seriously, this set is almost unrivaled in modern lego in the final area - i'm still amazed at how many minifigures tlc put in the kit. i also appreciate that the carriage has a far more realistic horse arangement - after all the sillyness of the one-horse pulled siege engines in kk, it's good to finally see a carriage pulled by multiple horses again. all in all, an excellent set, and well worth $20 imo.

1 great review erdbeereis this is a cool set! pics are great! love that shot of the lightsabers! well done! commanderfox

0 you say in the review it's great to get 9 minifig's, but there are only 2 minifigs and 3 skeletons??

0 7990 cement mixer theme: town released: 2007 price: 15 usd pieces: 209 (1 minifigure) introduction: need a skyscraper built? a mother-in-law buried? a treasure kept? no problem, here i come ! only one booklet for instructions without any alternative model: it's divided into two sections for two seperate baggies which the parts come in. parts come in two big bags: a few big pieces and the stickers are loose in the box. extra parts and sticker sheet: dark bluish gray 1x1 round plates are meant to be used as cement. sticker sheet is neat. a standard worker with helmet: he comes with a shovel. colour scheme makes it easy to understand the instructions: it's easy for younger lego enthusiasts to build the model. building in progress: chassis of the truck is really sturdy. drivers seat is on the left: i wish we had a real seat instead of a modified tile. working drum mechanism: you can turn the cement drum from a handle on the front right. nice details on the front: rearview mirrors are great. i love the snot front panel too. control panel on the left: cement hose hardly fits its place and the hose is too thick. don't forget the shovel: snot technique is used on the back panel as well. long & wide truck with 8 wheels: i love the 6-stud-wide design of new town series. cement drum actually works: if you place a couple of 1x1 plates in the drum and turn the handle it pours out the little cement parts! man at work: all this hard work gave me wrinkles on my face :( folder when public: brickshelf rating: -figures: 6/10 nothing special with the figure but what did i expect? at least we have a face expression. -parts: 6/10 standart parts for a truck but the big blue drum is new. -price: 8/10 very nice and detailed truck for 15 usd. -design: 9/10 it really does look great, doesn't it? -building: 8/10 easy to build and it's fun with a little use of snot. -total: 37/50 it's a must for every town. but other players should find it attractive as well. conclusion: i occasionally order town sets but i felt a great urge to build this when i first saw it on brickshelf. when it was released i ordered it right away. ten days later i was amazed looking at this beauty by my table. we didn't have a cement mixer for ages and i'm sure every town builder will have this set. and i have no doubt non-town enthusiasts, like me, will consider getting this. links: brickset reviews bricklink entry peeron inventory

1 thanks for the great review! this is one of my favorite city kits from 2007. i think it's a lot better than the cement mixer from the classic town theme - and it has some cool pieces too.

1 i voted outstanding, because i think this is the best cement mixer tlg ever made, also love the 6-stud wide based vehicles, as you mentioned. i both bought and sold it again this year, and i already regret it, but i had to sell some stuff because of a loss of space

1 indexed going through the boards i was amazed to find out that no one ever attempted to review one of the best lego classics, the 6399 airport shuttle. while i was studying for exams a few weeks back i decided to take a break, built the monorail and take some pictures of it. resulting in the present review. along with this i made my first ever poll. here we go: first, some data: setnumber: 6399 setname: airport shuttle released in: 1990 in holland, though bricklink says 1991 number of parts: 731 number of figs: 9 price: unknown, prices on bricklink vary from $261 up to $2300 (!) but this was an expensive set even in the nineties the box: mine is a bit battered by the owner before me, but there's still plenty to see. this is one of the largest boxes i have (look at the minifig in the down-right corner for the comparision) and it is a really neat storing facility for many sets. the box shows the set, and in the background the silhouet of the set that is to accompany this one: the airport from 1990. i like the angle of the box, showing the two stations, track and train in one picture. the back of the box shows some really nice ideas for other setups, why oh why has lego abandonned this kind of showing what's possible with one set...? inside flap of the box, showing details of the set and the functions, detail on the front of the box, displaying the dimensions, it really is a huge track layout for one set! the instructions: there is a nice little booklet showing the same picture as the box art with the figures lined up underneath. the last page nicely folds out to show the entire setup of the tracks, the figures: a brilliant selection of minifigs including airport people and a cook. all figures that are supposed to go on the shuttle carry a ticket and there are also some suitcases (tickets fit inside, of course) station # 1: the set includes two stations. here is the first, depicting the airport. there are lots of details: a phonebooth, two seats, some flowers, a map, luggagelockers and of course the streetlights. a detailed shot of the station showing the luggagelockers and ticket-validating machine, part of the beauty of this set is the fact that it is so extremely detailed, just look at the signs to show where to go next (stickers), and the scenery opposite the street... the station has the same shape as the airport shuttle logo, how sweet is that? the station pictured as part of the layout. the stations ends are made with airplane wings to smoothen the arrival of the shuttle. station # 2: here is the second station, my personal favorite: an elevated stop with a little snackbar underneath and stairs leading to the platform. some chairs and streetlights here as well plus two old fashioned trees, the part of the set that can be used in any layout: the snackbar with hamburger sign (sticker). yes, those hamburgers look tasty indeed! also notice the lights hanging from the platform overhead and the ticket-validating machine at the bottom of the stairs. here we have the platform with information panels and seats. also notice the two trafficlights for the train. here's how it works: the train will travel in the direction the arrow is pointing. when turning the knob the two grey blocks will move towards or away from the track-center, activating a button on the centerpiece of the train (the motor) which makes the train start it's journey around the track. there is only one speed and the train can only be put to a stop or change direction at stations. the station as part of the layout. the shuttle: now on with the train: there are two carrriages connected to a centered motor. the power is provided by means of a batterybox containing a 9v battery. the batterybox is in one of the carriages and displays: airport shuttle. a total of five passengers can be seated inside leaving room for their luggage and two drivers. the front carriage with the button for the batterybox showing. the underside showing the gearwheel (metal) that brings the power from the motor onto the geared track. the black pointy things alongside the gear-wheel react with the direction knobs at stations. this is how the shuttle negociates with height differences, everything hinges and rotates, making the shuttle capable of performing steep climbs. the motor is powerful enough to not slow down at such a climb! detailed shot, showing the first set of covered wheels in hinged position. the shuttle on the layout. the full layout: this layout is quite huge, involving lots of track pieces, ramps, ten large stanchion-poles and the two stations. to show the movement of the shuttle i have made a 20 second movie, which can be seen in my brickshelf gallery of this set. conclusion: well, to conclude the review, some final thoughts: this truly is one of the more detailed sets around (at least from the nineties) and one of the largest in dimensions. the monorail system is cleverly thought out and works excellent. track extensions are hard to get however and very expensive nowdays (especially the switchpoints and long straight track pieces). the tracks included with this set will provide you with hours of fun though, because there are a lot of them. it can be quite hard to incorporate the monorail in your town without having a clearly-based-on-the-monorail-alone town. i tried to incorporate it some years ago (link here), posing a real challenge. the ratings: price: 8/10: this is an expensive set, if you can get it for under $200 get it!), this set is rare in any condition. parts: 10/10: lots of rare pieces, cool minifigs, 9v system, roadplates, lots of minifigseats en red trainwindows. originality: 10/10: there are very few monorails released, this one being the only town set. compatibility: 8/10: can be a bit hard to incorporate in a town, but hey: you got the monorail so no complaining here! total: 36/40: i can only reccommend this set to anyone, it is my personal favorite set upto this present time! if there are any questions, ask them, all comments are welcome of course!

1 best. set. ever. i got my copy years ago from a guy on the old rec.toys.lego newsgroup (anybody here still remember that newsgroup??). i traded him a guarded inn, a black falcon's fortress, and a couple other small castle sets for it. no regrets on that trade. it is hard to incorporate a monorail into a town, especially if you have a bunch of trains too! i ended up making my entire monorail system elevated. there's just no easy way to make a monorail / road crossing. i also gave up on having it run in a loop. instead, it runs back and forth between two endpoints.

0 thanks for all the nice comments! holodoc, on sep 5 2008, 11:05 am, said: i had to laugh when reading your comment on the minifig seats. don?t you own many of those? i don?t know where to put mine... well, of course i do have quite some seats (a drawer full actually), but this was my first set that had them in black... when i was young however (long time ago, you know ) i always had a short supply of seats, so that's why i noticed and mentioned it.... whitefang, on sep 5 2008, 02:18 pm, said: this is an outstanding review which deserved to be featured here! thank you for drawing attention to this review through classictown.net, i have not been a frequent user of the boards lately and the release has mostly passed me by but i must say that it looks like a great site! whitefang, on sep 6 2008, 06:45 am, said: are the both of you doing grading out of the academy, when he is not a student there? indeed i am no student of the academy, i have another academy (university) to attend to, leaving little time to venture around eurobricks latlely, a shame, i know... i hope my review is in accepted here despite my lack of grades concerning the art form

1 just funny that everyone likes this set outstanding. i love this set also and glad i own one. it looks fantastic with trains running underneath it. good review .

1 very nice review indeed. b.t.w. a lot of children just love this set. one year we had it with us to legoworld and children asked a lot of questions about it.

0 section8, on sep 6 2008, 10:06 pm, said: i thought it was out of my price range too. then i realized that i had probably spent enough since coming out of my dark ages to buy a misb 6399. so i bought it, and i am going to cut back on buying other sets for the next year or so to offset the one big purchase. those glimpses of the 2009 sets haven't made me regret the cutback. that must be one of the biggest expenses lego-like: buying an misb 6399! congratulations with the purchase, though it is a lot of money for one set.

1 what an amazing set and a truly wonderful review! thanks simonwillems for the work you spend on this.

1 indexed name: refuse collection truck set no.: 6693 theme: lego system / town year: 1987 pieces: 103 minifigs: 2 price: unknown special parts: 4215ap08 (yellow panel 1 x 4 x 3 with recycling pattern), just occurs in this set (2x). 4598 (red bracket 2 x 3 - 2 x 2), occurs only in this set and only one other set. this truck was introduced in the same year that lego came up with the garbage bins that of course also appear in this set. have you ever wondered why most of the time the streets of lego city are so clean and neat? no litter, no garbage everywhere, no chewinggum on the streets. even with so many different inhabitants, it seems to always stay that way. however, the older afols amongst us, have experienced totally different situations: rubbish everywhere, smelly and dirty looking pavements, minifigs that were losing their standard grin. that is why lego came out with this magnificent truck back in 1987. before that, people needed to put there garbage in bags or maybe barrels. from that year on, every miniman and miniwoman is happily using a trash bin. the minifig civil servants never seem to become tired and the garbage truck comes every other day to collect the rubbish and keep the city clean. the secret behind the clean lego city and the always happy 'standard grin' of our minifolks are the anti-litter warriors that use their powerful machines and handy tools to just get the job done! so if you don't own a garbage truck, better try to get one, before your standard grins also fade and your streets become as dirty as naples (where the garbage collectors recently had a strike for quite some time). an overview of the set including instructions (actually one is included in the set). unfortunately i afraid we don't have any boxes of this set left. another image of the lego items in the set. it shows the truck, two civil servants to perform the waste collection duties, two garbage bins and a broom and shovel. the two chaps that always seem to smile, even when the litter that they collect really stinks. the accessories that accompany the set. a broom and a shovel to help cleaning up in case a dustbin tips over. a very nice feature of the set is that the elevator at the back can be lifted in more or less the same way that real garbage trucks do. as you can see here, the dustbin is emptied through a red 'train window'. (it seems to be that the hinges of my version will need some 'revision'.) panels inside the back of the truck maximize waste capacity for this 4 stud wide truck. it is nice that the designers added this simple red round brick on a clip. presumably it should depict cylinders to let the back compartment tip for emptying or otherwise it might be gastanks. again the complete set. it is very complete set but some additions could make it even more playable: - garbage (e.g. a green flower bottom or some round plates 1 x 1) - a place for the second worker to position himself on, when the trucks needs to drive to the dumpsite or an other street and also vertical bars for that second worker to hold himself by. this is what the truck will look like when dumping the litter at the recycle plant or dump site, the whole back nicely tilts, so that all the litter will fall out of the truck. a view on the back of the truck. quite a small but yet effective opening. the front of the truck. only one seat for just the driver, but i personally prefer that to a 6 wide truck that fills the total width of the streets and has problems with corners. of course set 7991 (the orange garbage truck of last year) is also nice, we also own some of those but we never put them in our lego town since they take too much room and the color scheme of 6693 is also more preferable to us. the two panels with the printed recycling pattern are a bit worn so we might recreate the recycle logo and put it on a sticker some day. playability: 8/10 (like i mentioned it is too bad that the set doesn't have any litter [however lego also saw that and has put litter in the 6693 set]) design: 9/10 (a really nice truck with two minifigs and very nice details) price: -/10 (i was not able to get any price information, at bricklink one can still obtain a 2nd hand one for about 25$.) overall: 8/10 (a set that should be entitled a 'classic' in the same list as the pizza restaurants, the 7750 and the blacksmith shop) that was all the pictures i was allowed to take since it seems that those brave man still have quite some trash cans to empty. thanks guys for doing the dirty work so our minifigs stay happy and our streets stay clean! peeron lugnet brickset: bricklink entries additional notes on the review: my brother has always been keen on garbage trucks. however when he became aware of this truck it wasn't available in the stores anymore. newer sets that had the 'recycling theme' we not that good. they didn't have the emptying mechanism. so after our dark ages, one of the first sets we bought, were some of those nice refuse collection trucks. although the new orange truck has the desired mechanisms and thankfully is a decent garbage truck, we more like 4 wide trucks than 6 studs wide trucks, so for the years to come our lego town inhabitants will still be seeing this great truck to control their waste problems.

1 this truck is simply beautiful! it's on my brickset wanted list! i love the colour scheme. red and yellow are the right choice for this vehicle! the back part of the truck can be opened, so it can discharge the rubbish like real garbage trucks. you've also mentioned that in your review, and i find it a wonderful detail! thanks for the review, jopiek!

0 tenorikuma, on sep 7 2008, 08:30 am, said: it would be cool to see a review comparing this set with the newer orange garbage truck. well i might want to do that, but then in a different way as the railroad maintenance: i will then review the orange one and make comments on it compared to this one.

1 yeah its very nice along with all the older sets. i've got the cement mixer that was released around about the same time as this.

1 tenorikuma, on sep 7 2008, 08:30 am, said: it would be cool to see a review comparing this set with the newer orange garbage truck. true, woold be good for the people that have few new city sets like me, and your review is good btw! i own this set however, because it was really cool those days, nowadays all trucks nd cars can do neat things, but that wasnt so back then.

1 greetings! just looking through the review index when i came across this one. i recently acquired this set through ebay which came with a practically perfect box and instructions. i would almost say that no one played with it much as all of the parts were brand new. anyway, i just wanted to say that this is a great set that was worth the $14.99!

1 great review, and i love the soft yellow effect to the pics imo, the most recent garbage truck should've used the same piece for lifting the cans into the big bin instead of the droid arms

1 thanks for sharing your thoughts and opinion about this set with us. i've added it to the index. this is one of my favourite ties and i think tlg did a good job at designing it.

0 i owned it and loved it when i was young ^^ i really miss it.

0 perfect perhaps the front sprouses are for foaming the runway? you've certainly kept that set in near mint condition, haven't you? now all we can wish for is a new firetruck combining this l&s version and the new

0 sometimes there's no need for a big ambulance; sometimes you only need a doctor to get there. fast! set data 7902: doctor's car year: 2006 theme: city subtheme: emergency pieces: 66 (3 extra) price: 6 usd / eur / 4 ukp (uk price may have been higher in the past) building time: less than 10 minutes more info: brickset - peeron box front: no frills, just the set. box back: no alternate models, but "designed for easy building and istant play". i still wonder if today's kids are lazier or dumber than my generation... box content: 2 bags, loose car base, instructions, stickers. (not so) random manual page: the evolution of snot tecnique on car lights. set inventory: split into 2 pages! stickers: red cross has gone a long time ago; here's caduceus. loose pieces: we're ready to start! minifig and accessories: "what's up, doc?" m.i.p. (most interesting piece): it's snot time! building starts: and it's fast and easy notes: car has doors! and that black plate with rail helps so that the roof doesn't only weight on the windscreen. complete model: top view "container cupboards": that's where doc puts its accessories when driving. sticker time: see the difference, with and without. review and rating. do you remember when lego cars had doors? it seems so long ago... the car is simple; but as well as a set can be designed, this one doesn't look so realistic (isn't it what lego has been doing over the last few years? going realistic?) doc is ok, but i guess many people would have wanted a female fig (and: brown eyebrows with black hair? that's odd ) as i said, no red cross, but a politically correct caduceus on the roof and sides. extra pieces: 1 small antenna and 1 1x1 decorated tile. overall, a cheap way to own a doctor minifig and a nice vehicle to add to your town. just above average. rating: 3.5/5

1 i was going to get this, but instead i got someting else (firetruck i think) nice review!

0 name: cargomaster crane set no.: 6352 @ peeron.com theme: lego system / town year: 1991 pieces: 133 minifigs: 1 price: usd $26.00 / gbp unknown / eur €19,95 aargh stupid tree! for more than fourty years this 'megabrick' has tormented our town! we need some help! long before my dark ages lego released this relatively small set. since they didn't have a construction site like nowadays, they released these small road-works. i was only six years old and really into small sets since my adhd didn't allow me to sit and build for long periods of time. so these smaller sets were ideal for me. the instruction booklet. the complete set. the set itself is not really a surprise to set up and play with. first you'll build the smaller parts of the set like the container and the small verhicle. no real surprises there, except for the smaller car that fits perfectly in the cargo container. just pull off the seat and steering wheel, and the car just fits. the crane itself is just as easy to build as the smaller parts. just place bricks on top of eachother. although you'll still have the wire to connect and pull through a diversity of bricks and plates. the carco container and small car. being out of my dark ages really tunnelled my vision toward bigger sets and completing my town. this set really comes in handy if i need construction or traffic workers in my town, i can just moc a few containers for tearing down trees, fixing traffic lights, and so on. behold the mighty cargomaster crane! it's pretty easy to say that a set as simplistic as this one is not much fun to play with. however if you see the bigger potential in your town this one could be of great value to any city. playability: 7/10 (with only one container it gets a bit boring) design: 9/10 (it's small, and fits perfectly) price: 7/10 (average, but not really cheap.) overall: 7.7/10 (a nice overall set if you're building on minifig scale) gimme my pizza! every town should have a pizzaria! more information: bricklink search results brickset lugnet edited by crazydance, 07 september 2008 - 03:52 pm.

1 a very nice review, jopiek! you know, i was wondering how lego could justify having two 12v-powered passenger trains at the same time, but after reading the review, and seeing the lack of figures and accessories, i guess i understand why (plus the train is rather compact). oh, and i can't help but think that the chairs in the middle carriage are somewhat oddly placed, because those placed next to the door are unusable because the door takes up room needed for figs' arms. also, it appears that your set also has the newer couplers, i.e. there's no hooks for the decoupling rail to grab hold of. with the light assembly it really won't matter, play-wise, or if you don't have any decouplers, but it's still a bit of a bummer.

1 a nice old classic, the driver has a nice hat and torso, and the train is well designed, except for that thing on the roof.

0 jopiek, on sep 8 2008, 12:20 am, said: the chair was just loose so it should be placed on the 2x2 plate that is also visible in the picture of the middle car. b.t.w. the front magnet is the old type. i have some decouplers but we don't use them because they are not really that reliable. lego just release a whole line of trains at the same time. i just discussed with my parents and they told be lego had those sets longer in store back then. i must have gotten the 7745 somewhere in 1983 or even 1984 although it was released in 1981. i started of with the 7710 (push along train) and then upgraded the tracks with current rails when i got the 7745. the 7745 was realsed in 1985 ;) lego had 2 12v passengers trains between 1981 and 1984 (the 7740 & 7725) during the 80s the avergae life of a train was about 5 years.

1 a great review for a great set. thanks for sharing it with us. a like the older lego trains. btw i think you need to fix this: quote name: jetport fire squad (light and sound series)

1 the best 12v legotrain is for me the 7740. the 7725 is still a goodlooking train and the only one with short wagons in a electric version. before i started to with bricklink, i started to build this train in blue. i've build 4 trains of it and sold 2 of them. still one for sale . you can also build this in other colors, like a yellow one: or you can build a black version, which i made a death train of it. driven by a skeleton . edited by panda9001100, 17 may 2009 - 08:01 am.

1 great review! i would buy the sets, but sadly tlc doesn't sell them anymore. i have one question only: how can you be reviewing at this time at night!?! i would never dream of doing that! well i can't wait to see the other reviews!

-1 her name was sky lane. it's quite sad, though, to actually play the game--the "xtreme tower" is the only set that made it into the game itself, and it was a really watered down version of the information center from the first two games. but the island was, in the game, filled with incredible buildings that would have made really cool sets.

0 hippie dude? thats snap lockitt, island xtreme is one of the best themes ever, im trying to get the sets off bricklink, thanks fo the review i need this now.

0 shoc, on sep 9 2008, 05:55 pm, said: thanks for the review! i loved this theme, it had some of the greatest pieces ever arranged in any theme, brilliant printed parts and figures, and some good colours. snap lockitt (hippie dude ) is a great figure with a cool name, i own him from another set, but unfortunately not this one. it looks like a very good set, no stickers and good printed parts too. nice review. hahaha. that made me laugh for some reason... i don't know why though, i agree with it. i have him as well, i got him from the orange jet-ski set.

-1 it is not very often that i rate a legoset 'poor' (it's the first time actually), but in this case i had no other option. the idea of this set is good, and i like the mostly yellow minifig, but the design of both the airplane (weird 'window'-piece, a propellor that is way too small, minimal skies underneath and a strange colourscheme) and the hangglider (two handlebars on the wings, too many colours) makes the set mark the essence of lego's downfall during those years. i really appreciate the fact that you made a review of this set, brickster, it made me look into the details of 6735, but i am just as sure today as i was back then: i will never buy this. anyway, thanks for the review, the quality of the set may be a disapointment your review certainly is not

1 one of my favourite sets! me and couple of buddies got this set back then. the fig was so cool, sun glasses, fast boat....

1 yeah, the name on this set is strange. i think all the boxes say garbage truck. i guess it's up to each builder to decide whether 1x1 round plates are recyclable material or not. it's a great model in any case. i love these highly detailed city trucks we've been getting during the last year or two. i used to have a preference for the late 80s/early 90s city line but some of these new sets have really surpassed them in detail and functionality.

1 trop beau

1 jopiek, on sep 10 2008, 01:45 am, said: also it will not empty completely because of that panel. actually, it does. the back part of the truck with the panel hinges up, so that when you want the truck to dump, it doesn't get in the way.

1 a good set, with a nice color scheme. i still prefer the last one that had a removable bin.

1 what a great set and a very nice review erdbeereis. i think the only improvement to this set would have been the use of chrome exhaust pipes and front grill. i bought this set with a lot of excitement, but unfortunately have not put it together yet. what are your thoughts on these larger 6-stud wide detailed vehicles as opposed to 4-stud wide classics? here's an image of 6668 recycle truck released in 1992: ps. i like the use of "taking out" sponge bob in your review.

1 this looks like a great set, and i'm happy you were dumping spongebob, he deserves that. this set looks very nice, and if i see it i will probably pick it up.

0 hi, i bought this set a while ago, and have since remodeled it into a larger 8 wide truck. now it can hold a driver and passenger. its kind of boxy, i may redesign it in the future.

1 nice review i realy need to pick up this set! and the cement truck too!

0 it would be cool if someone made a moc in which hippies steal the truck and cover it with flowers and bright colors and stuff!
