-1 first, what i liked sooooo much was the cover of these plates, with this large picture of a classic space scene. i still have a '306' misb just to keep that nice feeling of taking it out of a plastic box, and look at it... there were different versions of the cover though. second, the markings of the landing platform changed at some point. i'd have to check it later when i'm at home, think it had something to do with the interupted yellow lines...

0 whitefang, on jul 7 2008, 11:42 pm, said: actually, with only 2 plates, i could not do much serious expansion with it. instead, i merged it with my old city baseplates, and used it as a docking station for scientific purposes or restricted facilities that is guarded by the police. you make a very good point there. i've used these plates to represent restricted areas, and even as simple airport runways, beyond their space uses. i never liked the black plates (they were during my dark ages anyway, so i've never really seen one up close), but i have seen them used in a death star display as suggested and it turned out fairly well.

0 quote oh how i love these plates. afew years ago i found a local retail store with about 6-7 sets of these in their basement warehouse i was given special access to (along with many other old space goodies.. hehe..) i love the things, i have loads, and i've used them for multiple space bases and battles. along with afew grey crater plates and the large grey plates (1.5x the size of a normal baseplate) you can get quite a monorail layout going. *sigh* i should really clean up and get one set up again, so i can take some pictures! wow, nice. you probably have enough to make that scene on the box picture. i got one pack off ebay a while ago and have another octagon plate from the blacktron 6988 base. i'm building my carrier moc around one but don't have anything planned for the others. these baseplates are still relatively common on ebay for their age. i see misb packs on there every few weeks and they tend to sell for around $20. the older kind (in the op) are much harder to come by. edited by cp5670, 09 july 2008 - 10:18 pm.

1 great review sinner. i own the later version, 709 released in 1977. mine no longer has decals though. the variations were minimal. it looks like your boat is in really good shape considering it's >30 years old. excellent review!

-1 nice review sinner! the old sets... i dont know - every old set, especially equipped with the old non-moveable arms minifigs look very odd nowadays. i agree with you with the hull shape and its possibility to be extended, but every other aspect, the lack of detail, the keel itself (you cant float it in shallow water) keeps me from rating it higher than 3/10. in my opninion the best police boat so far is 4021 *click to enlarge*

1 i love those minifigs, they'd go for alot on ebay i bet. great boat as well, i love the old hull design.

1 this set showed what potential variations on the standard brick had back then. i think that tlg was still finding its legs back then and learning new things so this is a solid set for the year it was released. nice review sinner.

1 snefroe, on aug 7 2008, 07:53 am, said: my parents always needed to keep my quiet during the 3-day trip, and the best way to do that was to buy me a lego set... this still works nowadays. quote i often saw large quantities of lego sets in those gas stations though... i remember seeing yellow castle and... the galaxy explorer, standing on a shelf. these were the times... although i dont recall lego sets in fuel stations in the past i would appreciate to see lego "on the go" now. its holiday time and i have two sons, you know.

0 so, you've been bitten by the classic bug too, sinner. great review; but one would think arms would come in handy (pun intended) when you are a police officer, right? it's a shame that many of the original figs must now be forced to stand looking like they have their hands in their pockets, eh? i have no idea where i was going with that last sentence...

1 as you may have seen in my topic in general lego discussion, i received a bunch of old lego from my step-grandmother-in-law. among the bricks were instructions and pieces for an almost complete set 345 from 1969. i was very excited to find this out, so i put it together. i recently took it apart and re-assembled it, taking photographs along the way for the sake of eurobricks. so, without further ado, set 345: house with car. first off is the car. this was still constructed in the bucket of bricks i received, so i never took it apart: next i'll show you the instructions. lots of added bricks per step, which was fun. however, the angle of the instructions sometimes made it difficult to find where things were supposed to go. the in-build shots. finally, an all-around view of the finished set. sadly, i don't have much time to post more pictures or thoughts. however, i'll try to come back and update the review later this week. until then, enjoy!

1 great review. i never had this set, but it looks nice. i really like the checker pattern near the big window.

1 nice review! i haven't built yellow castle for many years, but i do remember the fun i had building it when i was young... yellow castle just opened up an entire new world for me... also, i liked all the alternate models on the box :od wish i still had that...

0 there's two alternates on the back of the instructions and as i recall, some sort of bridge on the inner fold or back of box. i threw away the box to this set years ago- just lucky to still have all the pieces. with standard pieces, you can build all these alternates and many more. that's why i don't particularly care for the new castles (like vladek's). they make building so difficult and duplicate pieces are so limited. here's an old shot of the castle in the city that it use to guard. we played for hours back in these days,

0 question for you guys, what's the best way to clean lego? i was noticing that the baseplates and gray plates to this set are very dusty and could use a good cleaning. mild soap water soak? is there a better way?

1 toothbrush and mild soap - and lots of time gently scrubbing a cleaning. and great review - i love that set *wub* *wub* i'm sorry that you seem to miss the stickers - if you find somewhere to download printable copies of them please let me know *satis* kimt

0 i've tried this once. remember? normal white sticker sheet in an ink jet and the transparent plastic on top !! p.s. the one on the right is the homemade one!!

0 wasn't this the first castle lego released?

1 as stated in the first post, over 2 years ago, yes, it is. this is a wonderful review, the brickster, and this would truly be a great set to own. *wub* ~peace

1 rare classic sets are always a priceless part of any lego collection, and it's a good thing you still have this first set of yours luxor (or did you purchase a new one?). excellent review btw, it's always a pleasure getting a closer look at these classic sets which i wouldn't have known to exist had i not seen this review. overall i think it's a really good set at that time, of course judging this one by modern standards won't be fair but at the time i'm pretty sure it was a 'cool' set to have (though less cooler than having the harley davidson set).

1 thanks for the great nostalgic review! great pictures, i love the shiny glow of 37 year old bricks! sets were simpler back then, but not less exciting in their own way. i wasn't even born in 1973, but one of my first sets was the 1982 update of this, 6630 bucket loader. almost 10 years later, but the very same bucket assembly, only the colours have changed.

1 nice review! great nostalgic set, like you said, it has nice design-simple yet effective! i like construction vehicles, so this set has even bigger impact on me!

1 this was my first space set ever!! 1979, 1980... don't know anymore, but i do remember i got this together with 897 for my birthday when we where camping... with a little luck i may even have an old film from my dad, opening the boxes... well what to say... it looked soooooo aggressive with those two engines! but i never knew why you needed two steering wheels on it... they probably just thought a symmetrical model was better .... i can't blame them... what a nice set.... it would even sell today, no doubt... looooots of swooshability...

1 very brave to give an impression about one of the oldest sets ever reviewed! a lot members here are younger than the set itself. i think you will have to have grown up with it to like it. nowadays we have seen quite a few better airplanes than that one, for example this years 7643 . but thanks for letting us know. btw., the 1x1 round brick with the solid stud is no. 3062a instead of 3062b (with the hollow stud).

0 i'm sorry you had to move this topic, white fang. when it was in the reviewers academy, the teachers agreed it belonged in other themes. *shrug* i guess it ended up where it belonged eventually.

[...] except that it wouldn't have been the spirit of st louis. oooops, you're completely right, the spirit of st-louis didn't have any front window nor rear wheel. anyway, i think a standard ryan m-1/m-2 plane would have been a better choice. less a legend, but more a flexible plan for multiple uses!

1 wooow! what a set!! not all that large, most defenitely not as sophisticated as the message intercept base from 10 years later, but in those, this was all a kid need to have hours of fun. soooo many great parts on this one.... technic hoses, computers, rocket parts, trans yellow parts... the perfect outpst really... it was actually my sister who got this one, but it only took an hour before i claimed it... edited by snefroe, 14 july 2008 - 12:36 pm.

1 oh did i drool over this set as a kid! since i never got it i didn't know how bad the rocket really was... great review. xenologer, on jul 4 2008, 12:25 pm, said: come to think of it, when were technic axles invented.... the white ones were.

1 ahh, the good old days. thanks for the review.

-1 thanks for the great review! *sweet* now that i've seen the set, i'm afraid i'm a bit disappointed 8-| 1) the color combination doesn't really do it for me. blue, dark blue, grey, black, tan, white, they're all mixed together without any over all design... 2) is there any interior? it doesn't look like it, and in any case, you can only reach it if you remove the modules... hm... |-/ now it looks too much of a box... 3) there are most certainly some nice ideas in this model and some great parts. the best part of the model is the staircase 4) i don't think he spent much time in thinking about the design. as apo said, the chimneys on top of a garage is kinda weird, there's also a gate, next to another gate which is weird as well... also, if this is supposed to ba a grocery, then the owner has done a lot to hide it. the croissant is nice, but next to the brown box with vegies, there's nothing that suggests this is a shop... 5) the white lamp and the the yellow cylinder are at the same level of the tiles. imo it should be above the level of the tiles... 6), imo not worth the 90 euro edited by snefroe1, 20 june 2007 - 09:03 am.

1 hi thanks for posting those great pictures. i got the cc some time ago and i really looking forward to get my hands on the market street. i think the colour scheme of this set is great, maybe because blue is my favourite colour (just check my wardrobe)? i really like the design of the roof and the staircase. i ?am not so sure if i like the gateways but i believe they will grow on me when i get the set myself snefroe1, on jun 20 2007, 09:02 am, said: 5) the white lamp and the the yellow cylinder are at the same level of the tiles. imo it should be above the level of the tiles... i? am totally agree with snefreo1, the yellow cylinder and the lamppost should be on a level above the tiles. actually i have put a 2x2 plat under the lamppost on my cc, looks much better if you ask me. unfortunately shop at home does not send to norway???, so i have to purchase this set in billund (yes, i ?am going to legoland this summer) or on ebay.

0 apophisv, on jun 20 2007, 10:32 am, said: btw, could you exchange the modules and make pics of that? i'd like to see how the building looks with the flat roof instead of the dutch style one. i?m sure that a could do that. it?s a good idea, i hope you can wait a few days, i?ll do it this weekend and make more pics then. holodoc, on jun 20 2007, 03:22 pm, said: thank you legocastlegirls for your quick review! *y* it?s the first time i realize the back of the market street. the tan bricks are a replacement for some windows i?d guess? i do love that building, especially the top floor with the neat balcony. *wub* of course you are (again) left alone filling the interior. but i just had some food parts ordered at bricklink... x-d i also think that this is a replacement for some windows and i like this idea, because i often see houses with that kind of "windows" holodoc, on jun 20 2007, 03:22 pm, said: one thing i?d like to know: this is an online-exclusive, right? can i order it at a lego-store (k?ln / oberhausen) and get the sum rewarded on my voucher booklet? *sweet* i heard it i don?t know that this is an online-exclusive.. but i know that you can order it at your legostore, and when you get it, you get the stamps for your voucher booklet at your next visit at the legostore. but you have to bring the bill with you. barbossa, on jun 20 2007, 04:10 pm, said: i? am totally agree with snefreo1, the yellow cylinder and the lamppost should be on a level above the tiles. actually i have put a 2x2 plat under the lamppost on my cc, looks much better if you ask me. yeah i also agree with snefrooe and you. i?ve never seen holes at the footpath for some lamps. it is really dangerous for all the nice little minifigs :-) greetings sandra

-1 thanks for the pics legocastlegirl! one thing that i find strange is that tlc doesn't use a female mf head for those two females mf in this set, but a female mf head is available in ldd and pab *wacko*

1 i'm not much of a city fan but this looks great. i guess this is the closest we can get to legoland (miniland) quality sets. and considering this is a three floro, small structure, and it's over 1,000 parts, just imagine (pun not intended) how many peices are in ll california's empire state building or wtc freedom tower models! both are large and in real scale over 100 floors! that's a lot of bricks. anyways, i've got a friend who loves city. i'm sure this one would make a great addition to his town setup! gotta tell him about this new set! *y*

0 i can't believe i missed this great review! thanks for the pictures, sandra!

1 i also missed your review, but now that i found it i really happy i just ordered the set :) thanks for the pics! peter

1 you?re a lucky man.... *y* thanks for those cool pics. :'-)

0 so, were you serious about any of the boba fett, luke skywalker, stormtrooper & darth vader ones? because i'd love to see a boba fett and vader one. :-d

1 wow, if the tru 6212 is to be believed, the luke marque costs $50. but that looks so cool. definitely a keeper.

-1 the lightsabers are strangely skinny. do they light up or something? or was the transparent plastic too expensive to make thick blades? :-/ :-p

1 well it has taken me over 2 years but i have finally bought this maquette! it's a real beauty! just don't ask what it cost! my set of maquettes is finally complete.

1 damn you for making me want these now! seriously, these look amazing and would look great on any bookshelf.

1 well, now that i have some money, a trip to toysrus was obviously in my future, especially since my local tru has much of the summer 2007 lineup. when i got there, almost all the smaller castle sets had been sold out, but there was one left: the one i am now reviewing for both eurobricks and bzpower. ;-) the box: well, for starters, the castle theme boxes are beautiful! the blended clear and stormy skies give a great ?clash of the titans? effect, and the action poses help as well. ;-) the back is equally nice, featuring a photo showing kids how to use the crossbow, and the brave axe wielder taking a swipe at the skeleton (foolish soldier, that won?t work on skellies! see later on in the review to find out why). and of course, we have a small box with the link to the official lego website, where tlc can advertise even more lego sets! :p the contents: after opening the box, a single bag of pieces (with a couple loose ones), the instruction manual and necessary catalog ( :-p ), and a new wider rubber band holder spilt out. the instruction manual is clear as a bell. no color trouble here, folks! also, it?s worth mentioning the nice background with the mountain and king?s castle silhouettes. :-) sorry that there's no picture, but i'll take one if someone wants to see it. ;-) the pieces: for being a 5 dollar set (well, seven in my case. darn your above average prices, tru!), crossbow attack features a lot of nice pieces (as does the entire castle lineup). notable elements include two large brown spoked wheels, two brown modified 1x1?s, a pearl gold slope end, and six dark blue modified 1x1x2/3 slopes! the bulk of the pieces, however, are nothing special. i?ll let the picture do the talking for this. the accessories are by far the best parts in this kit. two different helmets in a beautiful shiny silver are my favorite, but i also really like the scythe (looks good for mocing) and the round shield ( *wub* ), which are both brand new parts. and can anyone not love the classic axe and crossbows? oh, and there?s a black lightsaber too, but that?s rather boring compared to the other parts. :-p the minifigures: can you say, four figures (including the horse)?! that has to be a record for a regular 5 dollar set, at least in the present age of limited figures per set. we?ll start out with the two crown militia: a regular soldier and an archer. both have old faces, but they look spiffy with the shiny helmets and the superb torsos. i?ll name the soldier bravo the stout and the archer angler the precise, for future references. now we come to the skellie. although some people dislike the new skeleton design, i personally prefer it to the old ones, since the arms are now poseable and the face much meaner. the only problem is that the arms hang too low, but it?s not too noticeable when they have weapons in their hands. and last, but not least, here?s the elusive skeleton horse. i for one am very happy that tlc took advantage of that awesome prototype piece and made it into an official mass-production mold. however, the horse is unfortunately one piece, but since regular lego horses are as well, i don?t have a problem with it. i do have a problem with the pose, however. the legs are in quite an odd position, and i wonder why tlc didn?t make the front and back leg poses symmetrical. ah well. the finished set: i have only two pictures here, since this set is so small. first, here?s the completed crossbow. i must say: finally! no more ridiculous horse mounted catapults or crazy fire wheel launchers! now we have realistic siege weapons, including the one included with 7090. plus, it actually launches okay, although not the best. here?s the other main attraction: the completed skeleton rider and horse. i think it?s rather dramatic with that pose and the dark background, don?t you think? ;-) playability: okay, so there?s not much in this set, but a bit of imagination brings plenty of possibilities. to show you what you can do, here?s a little story made only with this set. ;-) overall rating: presentation: 9/10 pieces: 8/10 minifigures: 9/10 finished model: 8/10 playability: 8/10 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ final score: 8.4/10 crossbow attack is a fine introduction into castle, so i recommend it to any lego fan, whether they are a castle nut or just want a cheap change of pace. tlc has a knack with making great small kits these days, and i more than ever support them in their amazing rebound from their dark ages (between 1997 and 2004). ;-) edited by kimt, 10 august 2008 - 01:33 pm.

-1 thanks for this review, and that great little comic! about the skellies though (x-d), you have to admit that besides their long arms making the skellie legs look out of proportion, that they're just made poorly. they're sticking straight out, as opposed to every other fig, which have a slight bend to make them look more natural. also, as i'm sure you've noticed, the pegs are on angles! that makes it impossible for them to hold their weapons straight, and they can't even put their arms over their heads without stressing the plastic some... i mean they're dead. well, at least undead, they're not supposed to be stiff, and personally i like the ragdoll look more, it makes them seem more dead :-p

1 very nice little review. tis too bad i'm skint and can't afford any sets at the moment. loved the little story too! also, on your comment about the skellie horses. all lego horses are posed like that because it's the way horses walk. check it next time you can.

1 excellent photographs! and i like the comic too. i don't care what anyone says, i love the new skeletons. *skull*

1 nice review, and great little story. :-d *y* look at the normal horses, their legs are positioned like that too. only the skellie horse's legs are touching, so as to strengthen the middle, otherwise it could easily snap in half. also, i think the new skeletons are nice, their head is awesome, i just don't see why tlc couldn't make the bent droid arms with the hand facing vertically, instead of making a new arm design completely straight.

0 tks a lot for your review ickelpete ;-) i saw that set at tru a couple of weeks ago but was really not interested due to the design - i am not a fan of those motorized lego sets |-/ i guess the lime colour is to please kids, as well as the general design, far from a real dino ;-) i am sure that its going to sell well to a younger croud. let me quote you here: quote the walking motion works well although there is no steering and it will fall over it it encounters obstacles. hum, i really hope it works welll because i will have to buy that motorized at-at and i dont want it to crash :-p *yoda*

1 ickelpete, on jul 9 2007, 11:19 pm, said: first lets start with the box which is much larger than it needs to be!! pete no lego box is too big my friend x-d ;-) nice review *y* as for the set... i don't like the colors myself (surprised? x-d ), and it seems a little blocky. otherwise, the set is cool. i really like the head.

0 ugly. as. hell. but an awesome parts pack, worthy of purchase.

-1 the box is has really strange dimensions - it's very flat but has a large front - the 1:1 scale. regarding the spines, because they're made of the softer non-abs plastic (the stuff the 1994 cutlasses and brown muskets were made of), they lose their shape a bit and so are hard to grip; they simply fall off. i suppose tlc use loads of different colours because a single or two-colour dino isn't very nice to look at, especially when the surface isn't very smooth - it takes your eyes away from the surface and puts it on the colours. someone should make an all terrain dino that can walk everywhere from this set - i don't have the skill with technic - i always end up layering and never finish any models. :-(

1 thanks for the nice review. it's butt ugly to me but the motors + ir control seem pretty neat ! even at that high price, it looks like a good parts pack ! *sweet*

1 i didn't spot this great review earlier. thanks for the effort of posting all those pics and videos, they helped me decide that this set is worth getting.

1 great review *sweet* maybe i will buy this one... but not this month... buying lego in billund has left me totally broke :-x :-$

1 nice review!

-1 of course, right before i post this i see that ickelpete reviewed this set earlier in the week. sorry for being redundant but it is already written so here ya go: monster dino reviewed by dunamis set 4958 792 pieces $89.95 from lego online store build time 3.5 hours here we go with another offering from the creator line. i?m kind of fond of these sets as they are pretty imaginative and usually have instructions for multiple models. i like the reusability of all the pieces and the varied things you can build. the box: the box that lego shipped this thing in was absolutely huge! when i first got this in the mail, i thought i had won the lottery and they had shipped the ucs falcon early. once i opened the shipping box, i was surprised to see an unusually large creator set box. the box itself is pretty standard creator type box but this one shows off the power functions prominently on the right side of the box. the back of the box shows some of the motorized features as well. opening the box is a matter of breaking two seals. we?re back to the reusable cereal box type tab system for those of you who stay up a night wondering about lego?s next box design. inside the box we have a bunch of sealed bags. immediately the power brick, remote and motors stand out as they are each in individual bags. also, there are three manuals. the manuals: the three manuals are 76, 76 and 56 pages in length. they are laid out well and are pretty standard with all the usual trimmings: - piece call outs for each step - parts inventory at the end of the primary model build - page numbers color separation in these manuals were fine for me. interestingly, the instructions for the primary build took a full manual plus about a quarter of another manual. random manual photos: parts list i?ll explain a bit more below, but it would have been nice to have some written documentation on all the functions of the motors, remote and receiver. such as motor load guidelines and specific explanations of all the remote control functions. it is severely lacking in this area. the pieces: obviously, the pieces we?re most interested in are these new motors and wireless remote control. note that before you fire this bad boy up, you had better byob. since this is prominently a european community, i had better clarify my acronyms. over here across the pond, byob usually means ?bring your own beer?. in this case, it still means bring your own beer (i?m on my second heineken right now) but in addition to numerous bottles of beer you will need a total of nine batteries to get through this set. i kid you not: anyway, there are two motors (a small and a large) each with its own very unique name according to the manual; the smaller one is called ?motor? and the larger one is called ?xl motor?. very creative indeed! the battery box takes six aa batteries and there are two compartments to hold them. here is the first: that seems pretty normal. however, the back side of it holds the other three batteries and it seems to be very poorly designed: note in the photo above where the bottom battery is placed. compare it to the previous photo and you will see the difference. i played around with trying to get that bottom battery out and you better pack a lunch (or byob) because it is no small task! why couldn?t they make this compartment just like the other side? there is a single power cord connector and a three position switch. the middle position turns the power off and the other two positions seem to provide the same functionality in either position as far as i can tell. perhaps a little blurb in the manual would have been nice to clear things up a bit. the remote takes three aaa batteries. it is fairly small and lightweight even with the batteries installed. it has two thumb controls which could be levers if you insert technic bars or even pins. the two controls are color coded and match the plugs on the receiver to control two separate motors. in addition, there is a four position switch which i assume changes the channel. finally, there are two tiny levers that seem to have no function. i?m not sure if they are a trim control or variable speed control. i messed with them and didn?t notice any difference in the motor speed. again, some documentation from the incredibly verbose lego manual would have helped. as far as the rest of the parts, it?s really a mixed bag. there are a lot of varied parts in this set to the point that there is almost one of everything. lots of technic gears, pins, studded beams, studless beams, axles, wheels, etc. also, lots of little 1x1 slopes in various colors, teeth, horns, etc. you can?t really say it is a parts pack because there is not enough of one thing to make it a parts pack. a couple of notes: it seems the quality control issue on the axles has been fixed. i initially reported this back when i reviewed the 8285 about a year ago. all the axles worked fine for me. the color quality control issue is still alive. check out the different shade of red in these two parts: also included is the sound brick. this looks just like the other sound or light-up bricks we have been seeing lately. it does have a load dinosaur ?roar!? sound embedded in it though so hide the younglings if they are a bit on the skittish side. finally, i?ve never seen one of these before (although someone will no doubt rattle off a dozen sets where you can find this part in about 5 seconds): no, i am not referring to the studded beam, i put that in the photo for scale. the build: the build was fun and was fairly straightforward. as i mentioned, there is a lot of technic parts, so if you are not a fan of the technic line you should run, not walk away from this one. there were no gotchas to speak of, but you need to pay careful attention to the placement of the wires that go from the motors to the receiver. they kind of sneak them around a bit so watch closely. otherwise, it was fine. here is what is left over: so far, i have only built the primary model. as seen on the box, there are instructions for two more models. both of the other models seem less complex than the primary model and are likely quicker builds. the dino took me about 3.5 hours which included some time to screw around with the motors. i?m an old school technic fan from way back in the 80?s so i had some familiarity with the old technic motors. obviously, 25+ years has improved some things and these seem much more powerful. the design: if you have built the 4507 prehistoric creatures then some of the design will feel familiar, especially the head and tail. it is almost like they took the dinosaur from that set and figured out how to motorize it. this is not necessarily a bad thing, just a comment. the set does a good job of showing off the features of the new motors and remote. it is nice to see how one motor can perform multiple functions. in this case, the small motor makes both arms move and opens and closes the mouth of the dinosaur. when the mouth is completely open, it pushes the activation switch on the sound brick which emits the ?roar!? sound. pretty cool. the ?xl motor? handles the walking feature of the dinosaur. there is both forward and reverse. forward works really well while the reverse just makes the dinosaur look like he is doing a michael jackson moon walk. (wow, i never thought i would use michael jackson?s name in a lego dinosaur set review!) it is almost like the dinosaur can?t get traction going in reverse. however, as noted previously forward works really well. this guy actually gets going at a pretty good clip. as you might expect, he kind of waddles like a duck since there is no articulation in the knees. it is a bit awkward but it works. the ?xl motor? seems to kick out plenty of power. overall, the design seems to be a mixed bag. the way the tail is attached seems to be an afterthought. the arms look to be too small. however, the walking mechanism and legs/feet are pretty cool as well as the head and mouth. i guess it is a reasonable effort to get people introduced to the parts and we?ll see designs improve as time goes on. here are a few views of our new friend: but what about the at-at??? of course, the real reason you are reading this is that you hope i will have some epiphany on how all this relates to the new walking at-at. judging from the box on the at-at, it looks like we get one motor. i don?t see the remote which is a disappointment as i hope it is not controlled by a switch on the body and you either turn the at-at on or off. if that is the case, the first thing i am doing is scavenging the receiver and remote from this set to add to the at-at. granted, it could be that it comes with a remote but is just not seen on the box. also, the at-at box looks like one of the images shows that the head turns. i sure hope this is controlled separately as it would be really lame to not be able to control this independently from the walking feature. i?m kind of skeptical on the walking feature of the at-at. i suspect it will be rather cumbersome but hopefully i will be pleasantly surprised. needless to say, this is all speculation but those are my initial thoughts based on this set. overall thoughts: it?s an ok set. kind of pricy but i suspect a large part of that is due to the motors and remote. i haven?t built the other two models (they seem less interesting to me) but at least it has some variability. also, you get a ton of different parts which can either be a good thing or bad thing depending on what you are looking for. the dinosaur is average. the color selection is marginal (black and lime green?) and the tail section is just lame. i appreciate it more for the mechanical functions and how the motorized parts work. it does do a good job of waking up my dog who seems pretty irritated by it. it is a nice set to show off to the neighbors or the endless caravan of my wife?s friends that seem to materialize out of nowhere. people are quickly impressed by it and then promptly move along once you start trying to explain how it all works. i?m a bit disappointed that the manual did not explain more about the remote and motor functions. i suspect that there is more than meets the eye and i?ll just have to play around with it to find out. it would be nice if lego had a website that showed all the cool functions of the motors and remotes so we fully understand the capabilities. final rating: 72% build 9/10 (pretty quick and fun. the mechanical part is cool) functionality 6/10 (it is a creator set so you have multiple builds. as far as it being a dinosaur, it?s just ok. motorized parts are cool though.) design 6/10 (partly cloudy. some things are cool, others are lame.) parts 8/10 (new motors and remote are cool. lots of varied parts included but nothing to write home about.) price 7/10 (it is kind of expensive) edited by whitefang, 23 may 2009 - 06:23 pm. indexed

0 lieutenant colonel thok, on jul 14 2007, 02:20 pm, said: thats a nice looking dino set there! great review, dunamis! also, on this side of the border (see that big thing above the us? thats canada, where i'm from) byob still means bring your own beer. my uncle is already on his third molsons. so that's canada? :-) quote in case you don't know, the at-at in the dark side development kit had a single motor and a moving head. it worked by the head simply swinging from side to side due to balence shifts. i suspect the at-at will be same. i also think that there will be no remote for it either. thanks, that makes sense and you are probably right. i do have the dark side development kit, but i have not built that at-at. hopefully we will get some clarification from the lego europe show this weekend. quote here?s one of the sets it?s included in: it didn?t even take me 5 seconds lol, i knew it!

-1 oh, is he ugly or what? i've never seen a dino that needed to go on a diet more then him. :-d but i'd get him for the pieces; all those lime-green pieces. *drools* but, meh, i'm not really in to mindstorms, so i don't think i'd get this. but anyway, nice review, i now know exactly what he's like. kml

1 awesome reveiw, thanks! i gotta get this one!!! *y* *wub*

0 i ended up buying both this and the dozer. :-$ i plan on using my dino for a ir car in a month or two...

1 great review! thanks for doing it. i'm a big fan of this set, the minifigures are good, as is the parts selection. i like the piece used in the cockpit to secure the minifigure in place. i would've liked to see some panels in the cockpit though rather than translucent red pieces, that said however they are useful pieces.

0 smitty500, on 25 december 2014 - 07:21 am, said: awesome! i am really looking forward to buy this, but is it really $50.00 us? i was hoping more around $30.00. i mean, it fits the 10 cents per piece count and has 4 figures so for a licensed theme you can't beat that. but i guess lego can never satisfy everyone

0 the legs are about 2" shorter than the at-at; its cockpit is a little larger than the at-at's "head;" it doesn't look out of place as an escort-type walker or heavy walker, especially as both are built in the same style, although if scale differences really bother you the most recent at-st is probably a better bet for you. edited by hjmediastudios, 29 december 2014 - 04:32 pm.

0 it's a different helmet. ezra's is an imperial cadet helmet (the same one he wears in "breaking ranks).

0 hi, i need some help...when i atach the pod to the place where the legs are placed, the small piece that unites the pod to the legs is loos from the bottom, so the top of the walker just moves around freely, wich is different from every video review that i have seen (where they can rotate the pod but its not loose) the small piece that serves as the axis isnt staying locked on the bottom piece and i have reassembled it all and still its the same :\ help! edit: sorry, i found out what went wrong...didnt push hard enough :d edited by mrpinache, 05 july 2015 - 12:10 am.

1 super outstanding review! i am outside at this moment and this review is certainly great to read while you are on the move. i am looking forward to get this upcoming new modular. it is definitely fun to play and real awesome indeed. thanks oky for this very fine review.

1 fantastic review, could easily be the year's best, and it's only january 1st! you've got a duplicated picture in the bit where the candy is being moved from the outside and through the barber shop.. ...and i was expecting a final b&w picture or two where the detective makes his report to the woman in red, and gets his reward (candy, of course) or she in turn reports back to her real boyfriend, the candy smuggler. edited by rollermonkey, 01 january 2015 - 04:08 pm.

0 how was the pool table legs made?

1 firstly, great review ++++++ i was really on the fence on this one. this review has greatly changed my view on this modular. a definite buy for me. love the interiors and the whole concept. the more i see it the more i see the little features which put this set apart or at least slightly different from the others. of course great playability for the younger lot and i think a nice building to give any lego city more character and colour...

1 great review oky! i really love your introduction text. you put a lot of effort in this review, with lots of nice touches. well done for me the set gets 4 out of 5. it's a great set, but there's something preventing me of giving it 5 stars.

1 wow, that is the best start to a review i have ever seen. great job oky, amazing set, i'll be picking it up this weekend!

1 great review oky! i managed to pick this set up a few days ago and i must say, it might be my favorite modular yet for the feel alone. the pool hall, barbershop, and the detective's office itself are all wonderfully designed!

-1 great review! the intro was great, but i'm still not convinced on this one. the height seems too small for comparison with the rest of the modulars. the play features are ok but i wish it would have been taller.

0 thank you for the great review of this set. i'm also curious for the backside of the mirror.

1 awesome review, and an awesome set. what are the different shades of blue? i know there's dark and medium blue, but what's the other blue? locutis

1 awesome review 'oky'.....thanks for the cool writing and excellent photography........your last photo could of had a cry of......."you'll never take our candy !"......well he does look mel gibson like ! this set is a serious contender for best set for 2015, so much detail .........must buy one, need to brainwash wife into buying me one !

0 natelite, on jul 15 2007, 12:20 pm, said: seems like they infuse system sets with more technic bars. must be that technic isn't selling too well and they want to educate ppl how cool technic can be. :-p it's quite apparent when even the small bike needed technic frame. my guess it's less expensive and complicated to produce. they're also using these parts in other themes, so in the end, they're producing a smaller catalog of bricks but every part gets produced in larger quantities.

1 wow. this year, my wallet size has been bugging me. *sigh* still, it's a good-looking set and i will get it. too many big sets...

0 this is a great review and so is the set *y* i thought i would buy it, but when i saw the price... i changed my mind x-d i always liked flying things better though... like the dropship... although that is a bit pricey too, i guess x-d

0 thanks for that very interesting review, snefroe1. *y* that vehicle looks really nice, with a lot of playability, but too much technic brick construction for my liking. it seems like there?s pretty much space wasted inside of it, some kind of small laboratory or a room for the crew and at least a mining toolshed would?ve been cool.

1 sinner, on jul 15 2007, 01:02 pm, said: incidentally, when people were calling it rhino, i thought it was just a reference to captain scarlet. yeah, me too. that's a great programme, is it not? and i mean both new and old. anyway, i like this. i'll probably get it when it finally becomes available in the uk. i think there's a few things i'll mod, but overall it's very nice. although it's interesting (and slightly creepy) how much the lights at the front look like eyes... and, as i've said many a time before, i love the motorbike! edited by brainbox, 16 july 2007 - 01:11 pm.

1 nice review *y* i have quick question though.... do the crystals fit into the aliens hands? try and stick one in there,becuase the new catalog shows an image of an alien holding a crystal lastly lego should have made the aliens with movable arms and no hole in the middle |-/ i don't want to waste any money so i am only going to grab 1 or 2 of the smaller sets piranha edit:imo the aliens would win becuase they have superior technology and all they do is have to cut the airtank line and the humans die edited by piranha, 20 july 2007 - 01:40 am.

0 say, i was looking at your pics and then at the instructions and i just realised : haven't you put the stikers on the shield thingies in the middle upside down? i think you did :-d i don't know if i like those new sets, though... i mean they have great shapes and potential, but at the same time, they seem so holey... they're really huge and big but full of empty air and space as well... well, this one not as much, and indeed it is the best looking set of the lot, though... but i don't think i'll go into that line...

0 lego 41062 elsa's sparkling ice castle lego managed to get a frozen licensed set in the new wave of disney princess sets. however, i'm very surprised by the size. it's a $40 set and comes in a small friends-style box (roughly 12"x12" size) - i almost didn't see it on the shelf when i was looking for it because it's so small. i mean, i know it's only $40 but it's a friggin' castle. and why did lego only make this a smaller set? if they'd made a $200 frozen castle they still would have sold every one they could produce. they made big harry potter hogwarts sets and those sure sold. and have you seen the toys in the frozen section of stores? huge playsets for barbie-sized dolls. but i suppose i'm getting the cart before the horse here, reviewing before i've even opened the box. so..... name: elsa's sparkling ice castle set number: 41062 pieces: 292 price: $39.99 minifigs: 3 theme: disney princess year of release: 2015 links: bricklink peeron brickset the box the front of the box is standard lego fare, other than the large anna and elsa in the bottom right corner. oh, and surprisingly, nowhere on the box is the normal minifig lineup. the only way to know what characters are included is to look at the set pictures. the 1:1 this set uses one of the minidolls as the actual size sample. that's probably not a bad choice since the minidolls are not nearly as well known as a minifig. the back on the back, the play features are shown in insets around a rear view of the castle. like friends sets, you also have an array of play accessories. the seals is this standard on 2015 sets or is this specific to this set? i've never seen 3 tape seals on a set. even huge modulars or technic sets only have 2, so 3 on a set this small seems excessive. perhaps lego expects people to try to steal the dolls? if so, why bother with extra tape? a tiny pocketknife makes quick work of the tape so the third strip doesn't even slow you down. the contents in the box are 2 instruction booklets (bent), a white plate, a sticker sheet, and 3 numbered bags of parts. the stickers these are very hard to photograph since they're shiny. i mean polished chrome shiny. those dark lines across the corners are not really there, they're reflections of my ceiling. the manual backs the back of one booklet has a friends "win!" girl. the other has an ad for the lego disney princess website. that site is so girly there's even sparkles following your mouse cursor around. so i didn't stay too long or look too deeply. the sample page the interior pages of the manuals are on lavender backgrounds. it's standard lego instructions with part callouts and insets when needed. the build, 1 the first thing you build is anna, but i'm not showing that yet. then you build this little picnic scene. it's tiny but effective, and nice to have something not icy in the set since the movie has the "in summer" song for olaf. i'm curious what's in that sandwich though - green and pink? after the picnic is the olaf build, but i'll save him for later too. the build, 2 next is this small sleigh. it has an amazing amount of style for something so small. the curved front and decorative whips on the back make it look sleigh-like instead of blocky. but come on, it already had pink accents, are the pink flowers really necessary? technically, yes, so the whips can mount to them, but still, it's just over-girly for my taste. the build, 3 the sleigh needs a ramp to help it rocket along (for a couple inches, at least). the ramp starts like this, with a hidden lime green jumper plate that gets a cookie on it. i couldn't remember anything in the movie like that, so i asked my wife and she couldn't either. a hidden cookie under a hill? the build, 4 after putting the tilting 2x8 onto the base and adding decorations, this is the result. a lime green bucket holding a pair of ice skates, a flower (in the snow, really?), green and white round studs that i assume are supposed to be grass and snow? the build, 5 the sleigh looks huge sitting on top of the tiny hill, but it actually works pretty well. assuming you're on a smooth surface like a table, you can give the sleigh a little nudge and it'll shoot down the ramp and a few inches across the table. the unevenness of the slopes vs the blue tiles holds the sleigh in line well, and the bumps in the slopes don't seem to hamper anything. the build, 6 moving on to bag 2.... man that's a lot of colors in this base already. and i'm already starting to feel like there's trans-blue cheese thrown around randomly. the build, 7 continuing (and rotating), some steps and even more colors thrown in. magenta? in elsa's ice palace? i sure don't remember any of that... the build, 8 wait, seriously? an ice cream stand in the castle? that is what the magenta is for? i kinda actually like the looks of it, but it doesn't fit the set. the build, 9 spinning back around, now there's a light aqua spiral staircase added along with a roof. this is where i'm really starting to wonder about lego's thinking. those light aqua stairs, and the light aqua 1x4 tiles, are exclusive to this set (as far as i know... it's possible some other 2015 sets use them, but nothing in bricklink yet). seems expensive (to produce) to me, when there's no huge reason to need them. another blue for the tiles would have been fine. and the spiral stairs? really? elsa's castle is known for staircases, but not spiral ones! there should be a huge straight ice stairway out front or sweeping curved stairs inside, but not a spiral. the build, 10 and now we finish the tree. again, why? where is there a tree next to elsa's castle? and so weird... with ice hanging from green branches that have both snow and flowers on them. huh? did lego watch a different movie? the trans-light blue bits before looking at the upper level, a brief pause to look at some other parts. here's the 1x2x5 brick in trans-light blue and the 2x4x6 rock panel in glitter trans-light blue. do those look like the same blue to you? and again, another unique part for this set. why do those rock panels need to be glitter, when lego made the same panel in trans light blue in 2013 and 2014 for superheroes, friends, and chima sets? apparently disney really wanted glitter, because there are a bunch of trans-glitter parts in the new princess sets. there's trans-neon green cones for jasmine; ariel, jasmine, and sleeping beauty all get glitter trans purple cones. so there's a bunch of new glitter parts for 2015. the build, 11 back to building - time to add the upper level. we get a bedroom with a decent bed, although stickered. the build, 12 the other side of the bedroom has some little accessories. perfume and a crown i assume? the build, 13 time for walls and a roof. i like the small white macaroni bricks for a wall, but what's with the lavender fence piece in the center? i'll grant that it looks nice (a common white fence would have been a little boring), but it's another unique piece to this set. the build, 14 the very top of the castle is built separately. not a whole lot to say here other than why is there a torch in an ice castle? the finished castle once the roof is put on, the castle is done. and that big purple star on top says everything to me about the styling. it just doesn't look like modern lego to me; it looks like this should be an old belville fairy tale set from around 1999. if i saw a photo of just the castle with no figs (or picnic blanket), i'd assume that's what it was. the oops, not actually done yet accessories at the end, there's a few bits left to add. there are these dark purple skis (yup, another unique part) in the lower level. let me tell you, they're a pain to get into that location, at least with my big man hands. more accessories the top level gets a stickered book. the sticker has a nice castle image on it that is, while not quite exactly the castle from disney world, very disney-looking. i actually had to google and see if that's the castle they use in their logo. nope, but it's the same style. the leftovers there are a lot of extra parts in this. that's almost 10% of the part count in the set right there! they are pretty useful overall though. it's great to have an extra "carrot" and brown "branch" for olaf, since you know those will get lost as he's played with. the figs finally, the reason for the set. let's face it, the castle set is just an excuse to make these figures. and they're great. i mean just fantastic. the print on them is just such a good match to the real characters. compare to the cartoon version from the front of the box. elsa's hair is a little darker than the cartoon, but overall these are just dead on. if i had to pick out a flaw, it's the "spell" elsa is holding. it's too bad she can only shoot it forward with her arm down like that. it'd be nice to have the end of the splash part bent 90 degrees so she can have her arm forward and the spell shooting forward too. oh, one other thing. the minidoll heads don't press down tight to the body like minifig heads do. there's still exposed neck. it looks nice, but it means elsa's cape can swing around. the fig backs elsa's cape is glittery on the back and you can see the removable bow in her hair. the full set one final issue. when you put anna on the sleigh, her cape doesn't have enough flexibility (since it's a wraparound kind) and so it folds out funny. that's why on the back of the box it shows her standing on the back of the sleigh with elsa in the seat. edit: how on earth did i forget to comment on those orange flowers to each side of the castle? i'm pretty sure elsa did not have any flowers blooming outside her castle! the conclusion hm. i really wanted to like this set, but i just can't quite bring myself to. it feels like lego pulled a random castle design from the files then redid it into white and trans blue to look icy and allow a frozen tie in set. the figs are great, but the castle isn't. i guess the real castle in the movie would be a boring set and this one has play features, but it just is too different for my taste. the ratings value: 7/10 - $40 for less than 300 parts is high (especially when so many of the parts are tiny, but on the other hand there's a lot of rock panels and 1x2x5 trans blue panels), but the figs help save it. design: 4/10 - not one of lego's best. not as bad as the lows in the 90s, but not a great set. minifigs: 10/10 - possibly even a 12/10. they are the reason to buy the set . playability: 8/10 - there are a bunch of play features, but they actually detract from the design, so i had to knock off a couple points. parts: 7/10 - a bunch of impractical unique parts (how often do you need dark purple skis or a lavender fence piece?) but also a bunch of nice parts if you wanted to make your own icy scene. overall: 7/10 - a great bunch of figs, but i'd recommend not bothering with the manuals. just use the parts to build your own castle that's better.

1 two of my daughters are building this as we speak. i agree the design is a lot smaller than i would have liked, but they're loving it. no question the figures are the real draw here. and at 6 and almost five years old they're doimg a good job building so far. at least for the 4-6 range in my house, this set is a home run. thanks for the great review, mostlytechnic!

0 vorkosigan, on 09 january 2015 - 12:29 am, said: isn't getting parts in new colors a good thing? it is a shame there is only this one set, i think tlg could make a whole subtheme out of frozen. i do agree that they overuse lavender and magenta, i don't see why every girl set has to have these sort of colors instead of what would be accurate to the source material . sure, new colors are good. but cramming a bunch of oddball ones into a single set where they don't even make sense just seems financially unwise for lego. i'd rather have seen a larger set than light aqua spiral staircase parts. or lavender tiny fences. lego made the stairs in dark purple last year for rapunzel's tower, and those probably would have been ok here. or make them in a more useful color like white.

-1 thanks for the review! i have the same opinion about the design, looks like belville. i bought it on legostore orlando december 30th. it was impressive. my wife saw them putting on shelf, 8 or 10 boxes. she ran and grabbed the last one! the girls faces around it was indescribable, mix of ecstasy and afraid to loose it. it happened in less than 2 minutes. my 7 yo girl didn't want it. she likes the dresses but hates the movie. prefers lego movie. but my 2 yo girl who never saw the movie grabbed it for good, and we bought it. lego will sell it like water, but i do not understand why a set so small. it is the worst set design since the introduction of lego friends. my 7 yo has more than 50 lego friends minifigures, all the lego fiends stores and concluded that the castle had a terrible design. she is 7!! let's be honest, lego should have released this sets months before this christmas and is loosing a perfect opportunity to sell a decent set, with much more pieces. i am wondering if they are going to make another set with the same characters. at the end,. it is just for the minifigures.

-1 yep, my family all thinks they should have made a bigger set, added figs, and just been printing money. this feels massively rushed into production. which is weird, the other princess sets that just came out look worlds better.

0 i'm pretty sure i've gotten other sets recently with three pieces of tape on them.

0 i see the cookie smugglers from the detective's office have already infiltrated other lego themes.......

0 there is a very simple reason for the flowers and green-leaved trees; you should remember from the movie it was actually summer when elsa set of the eternal winter the orange flowers do bother me, from a design point of view; i would have liked it better if they were a pink/purple/blue/white color. same goes for the leafy bits; they could have used the pink/purple ones they are gonna use in the elves sets. it would have been fantastic if they had given us white leafy bits (like snow covered branches)! i'm sure loads of us could use those in our mocs! edited by bennemans, 13 january 2015 - 06:14 pm.

1 this seems to be one of those sets that lego really should have released a month before christmas, it likely then would have been toy of the year 2014,

0 i'm trusting there is something else going on behind the scenes because this should have been a huge set and released in november of 2014 at the latest. maybe we will see more and better frozen sets when the post-christmas consumer spending wave hits. edited by m0dulo, 13 january 2015 - 10:03 pm.

0 what's up pups? i have written a review for 7786 batcopter: the chase for scarecrow on my website: brickzone.net as usual it involves fabuland figures involved in a crazy story. enjoy and feel free to let me know what you think. thanks! x-d click on the picture to read the review...

0 hinckley39, on jul 18 2007, 04:51 pm, said: sinner, thanks brother! and yes please take your request and stick it...back in your heart where it came from! :-x i know you mean well, but i love the camp!! i purposely put "to the batcopter" and my favorite "the jig is up!" in there because it's so ridiculous. and don't you know requesting me not to do it will only encourage me to do it more? i annoy because i love... *wub* i thought you would like it! i am pleased to say that i didn't know that "the jig is up!" was also a common line. most of what i remember about the old batman tv show actually comes from the movie as i own that. (mum bought it for me.) i tend to put in on if i have friends over and i am drunk enough. i like the darker side of batman only, and thus anything that is against the idea that batman is as big a loon as the guys that he hauls in i don't like. joel schumaker's movies fall well within that category. hinckley39, on jul 18 2007, 04:51 pm, said: the crow is my favorite part. :-$ i'm happy to be swaying you over to the side of mini-fig suffering >:-) it sucks that your pricing is so different over there. perhaps if you're a good sinner (?) santa will bring you some evil pumpkin heads for christmas. or whoever brings you presents over there...a magical wallabee flying a didjeridoo, i presume... :-p santa brings presents here. in the middle of summer, in full winter rig. he is a hero. at least he can come down chimneys here without being burnt :-p ! but i am not too badly done by. i should be buying some more (non-licensed) lego goodness tomorrow...

1 when i first saw pic's of the bi-plane i wasn't sure if i liked it or not, but after seeing it in more detail i gotta say i love the thing *wub* it's a great plane with so many good aspect's, it's also the perfect counter vehicle for the new bat-plane. for me though the best part of the set has got to be the new pumpkin heads, those are just beautiful and i cant wait to get lots of them.

1 tks mate for this brilliant review :-d i loved your batfabuland story !! always fantastic to read like always *sweet* i really love this set and i shall buy 2 copies: one to build as is, and another one for my town loool: regular biplane for the tarmac, and my swat copter ;-) btw, i would have a request: could you post pic(s) of the parts inventory please ;-) many tks in advance !! *yoda*

0 hinckley39, on jul 19 2007, 12:59 pm, said: wait, what? are you saying you prefer the joel schumacher films? sorry, due to my convoluted sentance structure you mis-interpretted me. i meant that joel shumaker's movies fall well within the category of being against the idea that batman is as big a loon as the guys that he hauls in. just to be sure, i hate :-x the joel schumaker batman movies. hinckley39, on jul 19 2007, 12:59 pm, said: no. no no no. i saw a movie once. i'm pretty sure it's a wallabee. i'll get back to you at christmas. it is possible i made a mistake. hinckley39, on jul 19 2007, 12:59 pm, said: i'm deeply concerned about price differences in other countries. it seems pretty ridiculous and counter-productive for tlc. has anyone posted about this in the embassy forum? yes. i also wrote to lego about it and i posted their reply.

0 what about the cartoon??? batman: the animated series will always be the definitive batman to me. the two tim burton movies were okay (they haven't aged well though), and i really dig what christopher nolan is doing with the new movies. christian bale did a fine job in "batman begins" ... but when i watch the movie, i hear kevin conroy's voice in my head. the cartoon rocked. and as much as i enjoyed the justice league unlimited cartoon, my biggest complaint was always: more batman please!!

0 hinckley39, on jul 19 2007, 12:59 pm, said: i really like batman, batman returns and batman begins. i like the first one (although i have seen it too much now), love the second one and am undecided about batman begins. i didn't like how he insisted on wasting time with the backstory, and i especially didn't like the certain over repeated lines like "mr wayne, why do we fall down" and "you should learn to mind your surroundings." brainbox, on jul 19 2007, 08:30 pm, said: i love the 60s show, even though i've only seen the movie. sure it was camp, not batman, and often ridiculous, but so what? that was the charm. i think that is the truth. the old batman tv show had its good points (not many if you ask me), but it isn't really batman. joebot, on jul 19 2007, 11:40 pm, said: what about the cartoon??? batman: the animated series will always be the definitive batman to me. i agree 100%. i think the best batman movie is mask of the phantasm. incidentally, i love your new avatar copmike. fabuland has a certain charm... edited by sinner, 19 july 2007 - 03:11 pm.

0 you're second post on this forum and already you bring us this great review. thanks for making this !!

0 kernow, on jul 22 2007, 10:48 pm, said: a new r2 unit as well. don't remeber this in the film, but great to have one in a new colour. *wub* it's also at this point that you come across a big disappointment. on the box you get a flesh qui-gon. what is actually in the box is an epiii obi-wan. more to come... :-) nice review and i can?t wait to see part ii :'-)! the "qui-gon" incident is just plain stupid >:-(! nice to have a new droid *y*! part ii wait on copmike

1 thanks for the review! i'm glad to see lego including details of everyday life, like the food (though a plate would have been nice). steve

1 nice review, i like the building/port the most mmm,dark blue plates *wub* pity it is a toys'r'us exclusive, in the netherlands there are only toys'r'usses in the greater cities.

0 shakar, on aug 1 2007, 01:34 pm, said: third note: is it just me or did you attach the two black gate pieces too high? shakar no, i think this is correct. the upper plate with clip for the door is a little high, on top of a dark gray 1x1 brick. so if you want the door to operate well you have to place it like that. i just put the clip under that brick, a very easy fix, so my door now is lower which looks better imho, and no sneaky skelly can crawl along under it.... x-d

1 yes, that was definately an optic illusion. looking at it again, the gap looks a lot shorter. thanks. :-) shakar

0 @ mr tiber: they have them at the toys'r'us in eindhoven. in the new shoppingcentrum west of the bijenkorf. and the bijenkorf is west of the central station.

1 thanks for the review brickster! it's great to be able to see more views of this set.

1 sam89, on aug 2 2007, 02:59 pm, said: thanks for the review! that's to put the snowspeeder on (there should be a 2x4 plate underneath the snowspeeder that fits in that gap). :-d oh yeah!

0 mutley , did you bought it @ tru? - are there any other sets? exept of hoth base , and is there the republic cruiser?

0 ?40 i think.

1 mutley777, on aug 2 2007, 05:00 pm, said: yep! very reasonable *y* not too bad ... might have to pick that up soon then, i will be in tru in southampton over the weekend ;) i think i'll buy the bigger sets here and get the smaller ones in the usa later in the year. the smaller the boxes, the more chance i will have getting them in my suitcase ;) i have to say, i am very glad we are now not getting a 1:1 ratio between the numbers used prices in usa vs uk (e.g. it is not longer ?49.99 = $49.99) :)

1 great review - now i want it even more! ?40??? that sounds reasonable in comparison to our recent experiences!

-1 man the stickers on everything are really starting to irritate me a lot. i'm not sure i like the white 3p0, in a set that is primarily made up of whites. doesn't stand out enough. the snowspeeder looks a lot shorter than previous versions. steve

0 review - 42039 - 24 hours race car introduction when the preliminary images of the "le mans racer" surfaced somewhere last year (2014) it got a lot of praise. this changed dramatically when the final images of the 24 hours race car showed up. the front side of the car, especially the head lights, and the curvature of the side of car had changed a lot. the car obviously still resembled the prototype, but the new design raised a lot of eyebrows. the new design was considered a step back instead of forward. eventhough i still liked the design, i must admit i liked the earlier design better too. with the emphasis on past tense liked. i am not sure anymore and this review will show you why. like the arctic truck this set has a b-model which is well worth checking out. that's why this review includes both the a-model and b-model. for people who are on the fence, the b-model might actually convince them to buy the set after all. let's see what this set is all about! note: all images can be clicked for hi-res versions. set information number: 42039 title: 24 hours race car theme: technic released: 2015 part count: 1219 box weight: 2110 gr box dimensions: 47,8 cm x 37,3 cm x 8,7 cm model dimensions: 40 cm x 18 cm set price (msrp): 99.99 / $? / 99.99 price per part: 0.082 / $? / 0.082 links: brickset, bricklink the box the box measures 47,8 cm x 37,3 cm x 8,7 cm and weighs well over 2kg (2110 gr to be precise). the width of the box is the same as the box of the arctic truck. this box also feels like it's filled to the brim. the front the front shows a picture of the main model in action, with radial blurred wheels to emphasize the motion of the car. the lower right section shows the dimensions of the model. upon completion, it will measure a length of 40cm and a width of 18 cm. the back like the front, the back side has exactly the same setup as the box of the arctic truck. the top shows the functions of the model, while the lower left side shows the b-model and the lower right side shows the motorization options. the picture of the b-model looks so cool, it could be a model of it's own. at this point i was very eager to build both models and compare them. the side one of the sides usually shows a part in 1:1 scale. this time it's one of the wheels indicating the size of the model. content of the box the box contains: 1 book(let) 1 sticker sheet 13 bags 4 tires instruction booklet since i own two copies of the set, i also received two instruction booklets. what's catching my eye is that my second copy is supplied in different packaging than the first one. it's for the first time (that i am aware of) that the instruction booklet and stickers come in a sealed bag, without cardboard back. hopefully this will be a new standard for all sets with sticker sheets. instead of multiple booklets, this set contains a single square bound book. in earlier reviews i have epxressed my preference for a single book. i don't see any advantage in having 2, 3 or even up to 6 booklets. sticker sheet like the actual model, the sticker sheet looks very vibrant. the bright green, white and black color combination has found it's way to the stickers as well. either you love 'em or hate 'em. since i started writing reviews i have been applying stickers and i am happy i started doing it. stickers do give the model it's finishing touch. bags with parts thirteen bags with a total of 1219 parts (give or take a few) are supplied in the densily packed box. the rims and flex are sealed in a bag as well. sometimes looking at the bags makes you wonder what the logic is, behind the distribution of the various parts across the different bags. well this time it really got me confused. take a look at two of the bags below. there's a bag containing all the 3l blue pins. then there's a bag with various parts....and a single 3l blue pin. i figured this might be an error, but both of the sets have the same anomaly. tires the tires have been supplied unbagged, as usual. highlighted parts this chapter describes new and interesting parts. this set actually contains a lot of them. this set also contains an abundance of panels. if you aren't into panels, this isn't the set for you. changeover catch this year (2015) the new changeover catch parts were released. it's a combination of three parts. the advantage of the new parts is that the red gear is the same on both sides, which avoids mounting it the wrong way around. it also avoids the changeover catch slipping out of the driving ring, like it used to do. you can apply lots of pressure, but the catch doesn't slip out. pins some of last year's new pins are also included in this set. 12 x pin with pin hole and 21 x 3l pin with 1l axle. securing technic beams can be quite simple with the new pin with pin holes. the new 3l pin with 1l axle gives you more possibilities when connecting beams and other parts. below are two example situations where the new pins have been used. granted, the examples below can be accomplished by using other techniques. however, some predicaments from the past can be easily solved by using these new parts. like me, you will most likely appreciate the ease of use. engine and suspension also included are two steering portal hubs and steering portal hubs with ball joint arms and four steering portal axles for driving and steering the vehicle. these parts are commonly used nowadays. the picture below also shows some other parts, like gear rack, steering arms and suspension. frames this set comes with a single 5x7 frame and three 5x11 frames. panels this set contains a whopping 47 panels in three different colors. i personally like panels a lot and i do appreciate the variety we have at our disposal lately. this set even contains a new 13x3x2 curved "mudguard" panel. new 13x3x2 curved panel this is the first set to contain the new 13x3x2 curved panel. looking at the pictures doesn't do these panels justice. in real life they are actually quite big. i figured they would be smaller, but they are even longer than the 11 x 5 frame, with a length of 13 (including the attachment points). hopefully this part will be available in other colors as well, preferably white, for adding variety to your ev3 robot. 19l white flex-axles the white 19l flex axles have only been released in a single set, the 8461 williams f1 racer in 2002. current prices on bricklink are as high as 15 euros! needless to say we are very happy with the return of these white axles. now we can build jeroen ottens' awesome alfa romeo 4c spider for a decent price as well. i am really happy that useful rare parts are being used more often by tlg designers part list here's the complete list for all 1219 parts. as you can see in the highlighted parts section, this set contains a lot of interesting and useful parts. if you don't own sets like the 8070 - supercar, this might be the set to pick up if you want to start building your own supercar. the build enough with all the set and part information, let's build the model. rear suspension the build starts with the rear suspension and drivetrain. as you can see in the picture below, the length of the axle between the steering cv joint is 4l, where it usally is 3l. this is an indication that the finished model will be a bit bigger than usual (8070 for example). the finished suspension is one of the cleanest suspension setups i have seen in an official model. it's pretty basic, but it works like a charm. this setup is defintely worth using in your moc. here's a video: after attaching the suspension to the frame you rotate the module and secure it. at this stage the rear section of the chassis with suspension is almost finished. v8 mid-engine extending the chassis forward results in the picture below, where the front spoiler is already visible. what's also visible is the v8 engine placed right in front of the rear axle, resulting in a mid-engine setup, perfectly suited for sports and race cars. two exhaust pipes have been fitted on either side of the engine, together with two hoses attaching them to the engine. the instructions are easy to follow, although you sometimes you need to bend the beams a bit. minor improvements are possible here and there, but nothing shocking. front suspension the front suspension is a bit more complicated than the rear suspension, which makes sense considering the fact it contains the steering rack. the shock absorbers are placed in a different angle than the rear ones, resulting in a somewhat stiffer front suspension. all in all the front suspension is well designed and the steering rack can be easily powered with a servo motor. the picture belows shows the front suspension attached to the chassis. if you follow the official instructions to motorize the model, the area in front of the suspension is used to mount the battery box. when you are modding this model to make it full rc this area can be used to mount the servo motor. gearbox like the gearbox in the 8070, it's not used to switch gears powering the drivetrain. it's used to switch between two functions, opening the doors and the hood/bonnet. the gearbox is located at the left of the vehicle, near the cockpit. the mechanism to open the doors is located on the left side, while opening the hood/bonnet is taking place at the right side. to accomplish this, some axles traverse under the cockpit to the other side of the vehicle. following the axles to other side of the vehicle and adding some gears, results in the situation below. the video below shows the gearbox in action. door opening mechanism the mechanism to open the door is comprised of some knob wheels, links without stoppers and pins with towballs. take a look at the doors opening and closing. the front using the new mudguards and various other panels you finish the front of the car. the front is probably the most controversial part of the car. this is caused by the preliminary pictures shown before the release of this car. in the early pictures the front of the car had smooth curves and beautiful lines, while the final car lost these smooth lines and got a more blocky look in return. i must admit that at a first glance, the new design lost some of it's appeal. however, this model grew on me pretty rapidly. the headlight design can be found, in more or less the same way, on several real le mans type race cars. the rear the rear of the car looks great, with the stickers continuing from the mudguards to the panels underneath the spoiler. the two exhausts sticking out give some details to the back. i absolutely disagree with all the negativity surrounding this car. maybe it's one of those models which needs to grow on you. finished model here it is, the finished model. i know some of you don't like the looks of the car, but i think it looks great. the color scheme is outstanding. the new (for technic) bright green parts, combined with white and black make this car look very vibrant and colorful. i am not a big fan of the green used in the 42008 - service truck, but i do like this bright green a lot. it fits perfectly well with the mindstorms ev3 set. the curves on the side of the car are not as smooth as some of us hoped, but i still think the car looks more than acceptable from the side. the stickers add some nice details to the car, giving it that characteristic race car look. the model looks great in pictures, but it does even look better in real life. i love this picture of the front of the car. however, i do wonder if a dedicated 24 hour le mans racer has the seat and steering positioned off-center?! using the good ol' google machine i come to the conclusion that they do have centered seating and steering, at least the majority of them. there's ample space in the cabin, which makes me wonder why tlg decided to place the seat off-centered. the rear view looks cool too, with some of the suspension showing and the two exhaust pipes clearly visible. the bottom view is very useful to determine the size of the car in studs. it measures approx 59 x 27 studs. the chassis looks organized and well designed. the engine has been placed close to the ground, which is perfect for the weight distribution. a low center of gravity improves the handling of the car. i really enjoyed building this baby. the build is very clean and organized, although there are some steps where you need to bend the beams a bit to get things into place. seeing the model come to life and seeing it grow to pretty impressive proportions is very satisfying. for me it was fun, but i reckon kids will go nuts over this set and the build. size comparison what became obvious during the build, but what's emphasized when you have finished the model, is that it's quite big! the size of the car is pretty impressive. the pictures below show the car next to the 42030 - volvo l350f. the side view emphasizes the size of the car. it's even longer than the volvo, if you dismiss the bucket. parts left some parts left. nothing out of the ordinary. features and functions unlike the b-model, this model doesn't implement any unexpected features. the functions it does implement are exactly what you would expect from any car. steering (hog) working fake engine suspension opening doors (gullwing style) opening bonnet/hood opening trunk gearbox for switching between functions unfortunately the steering wheel hasn't been linked to the hog (hand of god) steering mechanism. placing the seat in the center would have provided an easy way to link the steering wheel to the steering mechanism. it's a shame we hardly see actual steering anymore. opening the hood actually opens up the entire rear section of the car, providing you with easy access to the motor compartment. the mechanism to open the hood works properly, which results in smooth opening and closing of it. the same goes for the gullwing style doors. both functions are operated manually and you need to switch with the lever to the left of the cockpit. these two functions are also the ones which can be motorized by placing an m-motor near the cockpit and a battery box in the trunk. all things considered i think this car offers lots of playability. the model is solidly built and the functions are easy to operate. i'd say it's pretty safe to let your kids play with it. b-model unlike the a-model, the b-model for this set received (almost) universal acclaim, and i can see why. often the b-model is a pale shadow of it's part donor. in this case the model looks so good, it could be a model of it's own. it even incorporates a neat feature, which actually deserves to be in the a-model. there's a lot a variation in the quality of digital building instructions tlg is providing, but these ones are of very high quality. the picture below shows most of the chassis with suspension, fake engine and gearbox in place. finished model some concessions have been made, but overall the car looks fantastic. the black of the roof has been extrapolated from the hood, which definitely works for me. the rear section of the car feels a bit empty, but the panels do cover up most of it, so it's hardly noticeable. the v8 stickers will be upside down if you use the parts from the a-model. since i could apply new stickers, i have placed them using the proper orientation. the bottom of the car shows the chassis. it's obviously a bit smaller than the a-model's chassis. features and functions taking the functions into account, this model isn't playing second fiddle to the a-model. besides the obvious functions like steering, opening doors and hood, this car features folding fog lights, which deserve a better podium than a b-model. steering (hog) working fake engine suspension opening doors (manually) opening hood/bonnet (manually) opening trunk (operated by gear) folding fog lights (operated by gear) gearbox (used to switch functions) fog lights one of the most interesting features of the b-model are the folding fog lights. it almost feels a bit weird that a feature like this is implemented in the b-model, instead of the a-model. below are 4 steps showing how the mechanism works. i have also included a video. the mechanism is somewhat reminiscent of fork mechanism used in the 8109 - flatbed truck, which has been described in efferman's review. take a look at the video to the fog lights in action. parts left a fair number of parts left, which isn't uncommon for a b-model. summary to summarize how i feel about this set, you need to take a look at the picture below. the combined image reflects the quality of this set....or better yet....sets! you actually get two great models, for the price of one. you don't like the a-model? no problem, you can have lots of fun with the b-model. i can't stop playing with the fog lights, it's mesmarizing. the color scheme on both models is outstanding. i simply can't emphasize enough how well this color scheme pleases the eye. the regular green is dull and boring, but this bright green really pops out, especially when combined with black and white, and possibly some red details. black, white and a little red?! sounds familiar? yes, bright green can easily be combined with your ev3 robots. so while you are combining the bright green with your robot, why not use the great new curved "mudguard" panels. these new panels are introduced in this set and they look great. they open up a lot of possibilities in the design department. the build of the a-model is outstanding. it is fairly simple, but since it's so clean, i really enjoyed it a lot. i think the build should be entertaining, which doesn't mean it needs to be a real challenge. and let's be honest; when is a build really challenging?! the rear suspension is a good example of why i liked the build. it's very simple, yet very effective. works like a charm. the same goes for the other functions in both models. and the star of the entire show can be found in the b-model. how's that for a surprise?! being aware of the fact that i like this model a lot better than most of you seem to do, i really encourage you to give this model a chance. the sheer size is impressive, the color scheme is awesome and you get a bonus model, which is actually worth building. score okay, so how do i grade this set? 8 design open to debate, but i like it a lot. 8 building experience fun and clean build. 9 features superb function in b-model steels the show. 9 playability both models offer lots of playability 8 parts lots of new parts and cool existing parts. 10 value for money two models for the price of one. 8,7 twice the fun i hope you enjoyed this review! more pictures can be found on my flickr page.

1 outstanding review jim, congrats ! love the pictures, so clean and crisp . hope to see many more of your reviews. as for the set, after seeing this review i kind of like it, if i will find it at a decent price, i will get it for sure.

0 mostlytechnic, on 12 march 2015 - 06:25 pm, said: thanks for a great review. i've got a pile of tru and lego credit i wanna spend and was thinking about getting this (since i got a sneak peak of your review in the academy) but it's not here in the us yet. too bad. wonder when it'll hit? i feel a bit sorry for you guys in the us. mostlytechnic, on 12 march 2015 - 06:25 pm, said: i do disagree about the manuals though. i find the thinner, stapled manuals easier to use than single large square-bound ones since they lay flatter when open. well, you certainly have a point. can't argue with that. mostlytechnic, on 12 march 2015 - 06:25 pm, said: have any links to the prelim photos of the front end? i don't remember seeing that and was curious how different it looked. i must have it somewhere.

1 great review,i am still undecided whether to get this set or not.

1 great review jim and stunning pictures

1 great review with fantastic pictures. as for the model, i'm glad that they chose to make it less pretty - real le mans prototypes are rarely a sight to behold. it is function and aerodynamics over form. i would, however, have preferred more realism for the sake of learning: - the front shouldn't open like that - instead it should be easy to remove the whole front cover, leaving the suspension easy to work on. - the aero seems to be realistic, except for the rear end where there's no indication of a venturi channel. this should have been easy to include. - there is no fuel tank, nor fixed fuel connector right behind the cabin. - there are no air jacks! seriously!? this is one of the most unique features of a race car like this... and lego forgot about them. instead they automated two functions which are manual on a real race car. - the top cars at le mans are hybrids with ingenious systems. i would have loved to see the front wheels connected to some kind of spinning apparatus indicating a kinetic energy recovery system. if i get this set... i'm going to make some modifications.

1 ted, have you described your photography setup somewhere? i love the crisp quality of your pictures.

0 wonderful review, but i am still not sold on the set. if we get more sets with the bright green i might be tempted to get it, but until then it is too few parts in bright green (too few different types, not the number of pieces) to be able to use that colour effectively in making moc's.

1 i have been waiting for this set since the pictures for the toy fairs eirlier in the year and i am glad to say i am not disapointed. first the price it is not cheap at ?99.99 but i guess that is typical for a set with this amount of electronics in it.there is no parts count and i have not had time to add up the 2 pages of contents to get a figure. first the box standard flip top with large internal picture and rip to open lid. inside there are no numbered bags in this set which i prefer i like to open all the bags and put all the parts in the box before building. next is a picture on the electronics 2 xlmotors as lego describe them and 2 standard motors. 2 ir receivers and 1 ir transmitter i know these have been discussed before but i really like the thought that has gone into the transmitters/receivers each receiver has 2 outputs to corespond with the 2 controls on transmitter they also have a choice of 4 channels so one transmitter can control up to 8 independant motors by changing the channel switch. the transmitter also has a neat motor direction switch so you can configure the transmitter operation. the set comes with three manuals 1 is the main drive mechanism 2 is the cab and engine and 3 is the attachments front and back. there is also the now standard parts list in the back of the third manual. there is no alternative model instructions despite the pictures of one on the box however there is a reference to the technic website on the back of the box but at the moment the page only has an advert saying the set is to be released on 1st september so i guess i will have to wait untill then to see if the instructions will be online. the build is fairly straight forward the main chassis is studless, the next picture shows the motors mounted into the chassis and the drive for the shovel and claw. it also shows the v6 technic engine. this next picture shows the ir receivers mounted on the back. the battery box slots into the back and can be easily slid out with the removal of two pins which is useful because i can imagine i will need to change the batteries on a regular basis. the next 2 picture are of the completed model overall i was very happy with the finished dozer the functions work really well and as i have the monster dino i have used a second transmitter so i dont have to touch the channel switch, i have included some video on my brickshelf page. unfortunately this set does suffer from some quality issues for example moulding marks on the plates, colour diferences, some of the pins not finished properly, some pins were very stiff and quite hard to push into the holes but the worst issue was an axle that would not turn freely in a hole which just adds extra friction into the system. i am glad to see some studded technic in this set i much prefer sets that use both varieties of technic beam. there are only 2 fairings which is a great improvment over recent sets if tlc had tried to make the bulldozer shovel with fairings this would have been a complete disaster. marks for the set 8/10 for price with the number of motors i expected it to be greater. 9/10 for fun my kids love this type of set that does something when finished. 6/10 for quality tlc really need to work on this one. 8/10 overall i would definately get a second one if i see it in the sales. feel free to post questions but i will be on holiday next week. more pics and videos available here

0 thanks for the review, it really looks cool. too bad it's soo expensive. :-/ i must admit that i prefer the 8421 mobile crane for more or less the same price, the design is more "sexy". *wub*

1 i can't wait to get my paws on this dozer! :-$ the new motors look very interesting and i it will be fun to see which possibilities they have in any future moc:s.

1 5150 lego, on aug 3 2007, 06:10 am, said: you found it in the u.s.???? where?? i'm really liking this set! its looking better now that i'm seeing more of it at differnt angles. i'mvery curious how wellit pulls, and and can push/doze before the clutches start slipping. the clutches are only for the shovel and claw on the front and back the tracks are driven directly from the xl motors and first impressions are good they seem quite powerful it will climb over a small cusion quite easily.

1 what i really want is for philo or someone to test it's power and such. *sweet* edit the power of the motors that is. its getting late. *sing* edited by eyesonly, 06 august 2007 - 09:12 pm.

1 cute. do mine eyes deceive me, or is it actually minifig scale?

-1 holodoc, on aug 5 2007, 05:10 pm, said: oh no! look at the small yellow "cabin" - no minifig would ever fit in that! :-) other scale on! my bad. i must have been drinking cough syrup. i thought this was some kind of mini-crane they might use to lift very small bits of steel. *smack of the head against wall*

1 sinner, on aug 5 2007, 06:52 am, said: overall this is a remarkable achievement for the low price. i bought it for the boom piece as i want to improve the crane that came with 7998. i highly recommend it. great review sinner! i'll be picking up this set for sure. probbly a few just for the parts. but one question. what crane are you refering to that came with 7998? that is the new heavy loader, and it didn't come with an any crane> 8-?

1 thanks 'j2g' for another review, one of my favourite parts of the set......the half eaten donut on the dashboard of the police car. brick on review on 'j2g' !

1 thanks for the review, your video was very well done, seeing those sticker sheets is daunting.

1 looks great. how does it compare to the house

1 here's a size comp to the house: click for a bigger image.

-1 it's the level of detail that floors me, a licensed set with the mindset of those great creator sets. i think it displays much better than the simpsons house which, from the outside, is a bit drab

-1 nice review! but i have one question: is the transparent dome of the squishee drink removable?

1 skalldyr, on 15 april 2015 - 10:53 pm, said: nice review! but i have one question: is the transparent dome of the squishee drink removable? nopers.

1 did anyone else have a problem with the piano against the wall of the simpsons house? it just kept coming off way too easily and i was getting really frustrated with it sticking out and not fully going on so i had to put the two tiles that hold them one place over away from the wall for it to sit properly without falling out, i think i might put snowball ii behind it since cats love to hide underneath or behind things lol but just curious to know if anyone else was encountering this problem with the previous set.

-1 i recently acquired 90% of this set, so i thought i would do a review of it. please note that half of the mini-figs are wrong, and there are some part substitutions. this is the only set that comes with this plate. there is a depression under the grey plates to the back. the pool depression can be easily covered by three quarter circle plates... which just happen to be included in this set. (good set design lego!) the stairs are old fabuland ones, and have been used in a few other sets. this is the only one that has them in "parapink" however. what is the difference between "parapink" and "pink"? dunno... the big windows are in only two other sets, both of them dacta ones! the smaller ones were in one other paradisa set. the interior, while simple, works very well. i love the coffee machine. a cute car came with the set as well. the bird house is a nice idea as well. once the current visitors leave i will probably be breaking this set. i wish lego would go back to these sets as they always had some great parts in them.

1 nice review of a surprisingly interesting set. *y* those windows are great, and no doubt difficult to get. classic coffee maker, simple yet exactly right. that baseplate was in a few other sets, but never with that pattern. would have made a great base for some of the classic 80s houses lego used to treat us to. in tan was part of the adventurers egypt sets. as recently as 2001 it was a base for ogel. versatile plate that hopefully hasn't disappeared completely. parapink is apparently "light pink" on brickshelf, so i guess it's just lighter than normal pink (and stopped appearing in 1995. just so you know, that monkey is drinking too much and likely to fall in the pool ... ;-)

1 tks sinner for that cool review ;-) this set is not one of my favs (never was really a big fan of those raised baseplates) but had fantastic parts and mfs !! it has great playability with really cool "80's miami" feel *wub* that pink was actually pretty cool and went well with that lime green (i think its lime but i'm not 100% positive). once again this pisses me off so much that i was in my dark ages when this theme was out !! i loved it, especially all the beach/water themes *wub* i really wish tlc decided to bring that water paradisia back !! who knows !! after all they need to make some girlie sets !! girls are a part of their market totally neglected !! how many women we have on the boards ?? really a tiny few unfortunatly !! so tlc, please bring paradisia back in may 08 :-p , please !! *yoda*

1 nice review sinner! *y* my favorite part of this set is the parrot in the front window! *wub*

1 awesome set! i really like the robots, and that tiny tank could be quite useful! all the fancy machinery in there really make it more like a lab than a restaurant! :-d the thing i found most funny was the positioning of the middle finger on the hand. :-d :-d definitely gave me quite a laugh. x-d

0 great review. very funny with "little you" helping with the building. i got the wagon myself, i really like it. what more did you get? morten

1 wow, you?re pretty strong, especially for a hologram. :-d thanks for that neat and funny review of a very fine set, doc! *y*

1 nice review about a nice set (i like this wagon, but don't buy it, because of the size, compared to my other wagons...). poor minifig who had to build an entire set! :-d

1 excellent review doc - i?m glad you can get out of the holodec *y*! i could see this done with other colors than blue also *sweet*!! 9v on copmike

0 photoshop?s your friend... *skull*

1 great review, *y* i have just bought my first 9v motor and you have convinced me, i will buy a least two of this set. :-)

1 yes my spongebob fans, its time for another review !! lets look at our bikini bottom map and head strait to meet miss puff at her boating school. she is waiting for us to give us a guided tour of her establishment ;-) another bit of sb history: this set comes from the following episode: boating school: spongebob fails his boating test for the 38th time (what a freaking retard lool). he's so determined to get his license that patrick decides to help him. he implants a walkie-talkie inside sb?s head in order to cheat and tell him what to do. you will say that i am biais but i really enjoy building this set and i really like the sb theme !! lets hope 2008 brings more of that cool spongieness !! but i digress... here are general pics of the instruction booklet and the dss (g there are loads of crappy stickers in that one also !!). as you can see the set is divided in 3 polybags. shamelessly (but nonetheless wilfully hehe), i will disregard the third one which is that playability crap course !! i would have reviewed it but since it involves stickers, i didn?t want to ruin the parts and without stickers it would look dull, plain and ugly (it does look crappy with so imagine without), so that review will not be 100% complete and i do apologise in advance. but how many of you would have build that and keep it hehe off :-p 1/ mfs and extras i will start with the really cool miss puff *wub* (the fig mind you !!). she looks a bit stressed !! no wonder, that sponge menace will bring her to the hospital once again hehe. as you can see, that mf comprises 3 parts: the small blue 1x1 round and the 2 major parts. yeay another great stupid looking sb. i love those idiotic faces !! 3 different sb figs and 3 idiotic faces hehe. you never can get enough of them !! here is just a regular patrick. too bad patrick doesn?t have different expressions ! the pull back boat car: nothing really to report (except the fact that i left it sticker free !!) the only thing i built from the third polybag is that pretty cool ancker holding tower thingie !! looks great in a lighthouse set hehe. yes the roud tile bouey is printed !! its the same as in sb's bed in the bikini bottom set ;-) ok, its time for those two great buildings: the lighthouse and the school + pontoon !! before reviewing them individually, here is a general pic. 2/ the lighthouse one of the main reason to own that great set !! sure it suffers from accute stickeretite (sad but :-d ). t worst is that door), but nonetheless a great and simple building !! great white/red colour scheme, and a really fantastic 2 turning lights !! i really like the yellow top of the lighthouse, it adds to the comic atmosphere of that theme instead of having a more plain red/white only. the rear has nothing really fancy, except tools to fix it in case of problems hehe. the only thing i modified since i didn?t build the third polybag is that i got rid of the trechnic parts on the right of the lighthoue to replace them with regular ?logs? all hail the tower king !! :-d 3/ the school and pontoon i really like that little building and its great to see that once again tlc uses the amazing dark blue color !! its really a simple design but looks fantastic and can be used for many things in a town hehe i also really like the combination with those dark bluish grey slopes !! the rear reveals the desk, stickers on the wall (d?oh !!) and two clams serving as chairs (really like on the show). its really great to see that tlc stays really as close to the show as possible. the pontoon again is simple yet really cool and effective. and its really nice to have 2 lifesaving boueys. the only thing i modified since i didn?t build the third polybag is that i got rid of the trechnic parts in front of the pontoon to replace them with regular ?logs? on the overall, i think its really a great set !! apart from the crap stickers, i think tlc should have ditched (or simplified) the third playability polybag to lower the cost !! oh well, parts are always usefull (except those one part shitty palm trees !!). so until my next review, i bid you farewell my spongebob fans !! and i really hope to see next year hehe will sb get his driver?s license one day ? for the sake of bikini bottom, lets hope not !! no license ever on !! *yoda*

1 that?s really a great and overall nice playset with a very cool mrs. puff and a fine new spongebob! *sweet* the boating school?s indeed very nice with a beautiful color scheme, and so is the lighthouse.... i?m really tempted to buy a second set just to "complete" these buildings.... although it?s a little too expensive for doing so, and it wouldn?t even fit with the style of the other sb sets. x-d wet highway to the poor puffer fish? privat hell on! :-d

1 *yoda* comes through again! i love this set... but it just costs too much for australians so i will be giving it a miss. :'-( it is a shame as it has clams in it... 8-|

1 one more sb face - yeah *wub*! being a lighthouse freak i really like it, the trans clear blue ones rocks *y*! i?m getting it - period! sb on copmike

1 nice review !! i'm not a big fan of those spongebob figs. however this set has some very useful pieces. this is actually the first time i took a decent look at a spongebob set.

0 yoda, i don't thank you for this review, and after the chump bucket review too! because i'm so exited to have them that since i ordered them from s@h, i come back home aftre the work the faster i can, with the hope to see a big box on my bed... and this, even if i know that it tooks more than 6-7 days to have my order... this mrs. puff figs is really really nice *wub* and this 3rd sb head too!

1 man, that sponge-bob head cracks me up! hilarity.this is a cool set, although i much prefer the chum bucket set. i don't see what's wrong with the course, then again i can see why afols wouldn't like it. it's just playability really. i like the breakable wall though. the building is cool, a few modifications (i.e. making it more realistic, real chairs for a start) and it would make a cool little wharf for your lego town. and to sw4j, mrs puff's legs are connected at the feet, if you look closely. so, thanks for the great review, *yoda*!

0 holodoc and yoda, don't be so hard with, or i will call my stronger friend, you know this aqua-squirrel aka sandy! star treck off sponge on :-d

1 i might get this and convert it to a lighthouse and warehouse for a city dock...looks nice. wall on!

1 very nice review *yoda* !! though, i think you should review the "course" because it looks very interesting.

1 the lizard looks the best to me - put him in a town and you've got a monster terrorising the residents. dr. s.

1 a very fine review of a very fine set, thanks sinner. *y* the variety of cool colors in that set?s just formidable. one more beautiful creator set indeed! roaarrrr on! :'-)

1 imperialshadows, on aug 16 2007, 08:43 pm, said: only thing is, does everything horrify the mrs? she seems perpetually shocked and/or dismayed at the goings on here. now that i think about it, i can see why. i'm occasionally shocked and/or dismayed 8-? i just love playing with the new princess! you will be seeing her shocked and dismayed for a while to come... holodoc, on aug 16 2007, 10:43 pm, said: i also bought this set but in combination with 4883 when it was on sale (50% - hurray!) at s@h. don't remind me; :'-( i bought that set on s@h when it was on sale.... but my bank delayed the transaction so it sold out! a broken man, i seached stores over and over again for a good deal on that set, and i found it last week for $25 aud ($60 list). ahhh...... *sweet* holodoc, on aug 16 2007, 10:43 pm, said: i have different feelings about this set. on the one hand i love the lion. he is really impressive (even my wife -not known for being lego enthusiastic- asked me, if there were more animals of this kind). the lion is - restricted - poseable and the colors used are fantastic. *wub* 3 models can be built simultaneously - that?s great! on the other hand i still don?t know what to do with these rotation joints. *wacko* and the other models are somehow disappointing compared to the lion. well, i will have to get back to you on what i do with it. :-p i do agree though that most of the other models are not worth making. i made the snake because in the instructions he is shown terrorising the lizard... >:-)

1 lego 75915 pteranodon capture i'm glad to review this nice set; 75915 pteranodon capture name: pteranodon capture set number: 75915 pieces: 174 price: $19.99 minifigs: 2 theme: jurassic world year of release: 2015 links: box the front of the box has the jurassic world logo along with the set number, piece count, etc. its a decent box size for a $20 set. here it is compared to a minifigure. here's the back of the box. it shows all of the features from the set an ad for the video game. the back also shows a small picture with a silhouette of the dinosaurs from the line, along with their set numbers. instruction booklet the booklet shows the same thing as the front of the box, nothing more, nothing less. near the back of the booklet, there is a picture with all of the characters from the sets. the other page shows all the dinosaurs with a mini box that shows the size comparisons. the minifigures the minifigures in this set are simon masrani and an acu. both of them have excellent printing on the front and the back. the gun is the same one from tlm that the ssp used. simon masrani is the only one with a double sided face. his second face shows a scared/worried exp<b></b>ression. he has a zipped up jacket or jumpsuit with a shirt underneath. the acu trooper only has one face which is a scared/worried exp<b></b>ression. i would have a scared exp<b></b>ression too if i was about to get eaten by a dinosaur. he has great detail on his torso and legs. let's take a look at the vest. the vest is the same mold from the ssp in tlm i think. it has the letters acu on the front too. the back is nothing interesting. pteranodon the pteranodon has great printing too. the colors match the ones that the pteranodons from the movie have. the wings, mouth, and head are a rubbery type of plastic and are easily bendable. it uses the same mold from the pteranodon in the 2012 dino line. here's a comparison between the two. spare parts the spare parts aren't many, just a few extras. the helicopter at first the helicopter was 'meh' when i first saw it on the box. now that i've built it, i've got to say that i really like it. its my favorite helicopter of all of the ones i've built. its sturdy and sleek. it's not too bulky either. the first play feature in this set is the net launcher. it works pretty well, not one of my favorite features but it does what it's meant to do. the other play feature is on the other side. its a stud shooter which can be used by a minifigure. you can put it on their hand or you can leave it there and let someone operate it. the shooter can fold up inside the helicopter as well. there are stickers on both sides of the helicopter and they also have the jurassic world logo with dino marks. final verdict value: 9/10 - for $20 this set isn't that bad. the parts count is a little low for a $20 set but the price is probably because of licensing. other than that, it's a great deal, i would've hoped for maybe some bait for the pteranodon but that can easily be fixed. design: 9/10 - i really love the way this helicopter looks, it's sleekness and design is great. the only flaw this has is the huge net launcher, it's too big in my opinion. minifigs: 10/10[/b] - the minifigures are extremely detailed and it even includes an exclusive minifigure. playability: 9/10 - there are many things you can do with this set. the swoosh factor is great and so are the play features. parts: 10/10[/b] - they're useful parts and there isn't many huge specialized pieces in here either. overall: 9/10 - this set is great for fans of jurassic world, it's also a nice parts pack. there's one exclusive minifigure in here too which makes it even better. having a little fun with the set hope you liked my first review here on eurobricks! please leave any suggestions on what to improve, thanks! edited by thelazychicken, 02 may 2015 - 10:19 pm.

-1 i love the dinos in these sets but aside from that the builds imo kind of suck just like the last dino sets. this just has a franchise connected to it. and honestly i hope it does well enough to spark more dino/jurassic park-world interest because i want to see more dino "minifigures". maybe a brontosaurus or something. i will most likely be buying many of the dinosaur minifigures here. however i doubt i'll buy the actual sets or the genetically altered dinosaur (which can only work for jurassic world). this set is imo average. love the dinosaur...

0 nice review! although, that picture of the ad reminded me of how some of the things surrounding jurassic world (lego, that is) seems hastily put together. just look at that the minifig. he is star lord's head and hair, indiana jones' torso with different arms, and city legs. to me, that seems a bit weak, especially for a video game.

1 yesterday i went to toys 'r us and bought the dilophosaur ambush. beside that the shop had a display of the jw polybags. for 3,49 i picked up two of them. now here is my little review of this pretty nice set. first some data: line: jurassic world year: 2015 pieces: 29 price: 3,49 packaging: polybag ok, lets start with the polybag itself. it is a standard size and had plenty of room for all the parts. the front depicts the whole set with a little hexagon on the right with a seperate picture of the dinosaur and its name. in this case the celophysis is called gallimimus. weird choice next is the instruction sheet. it is a doublesided paper with every building step in clear sight. the part selection is nice. there are only a few but all of them are pretty usefull for all kind of builds. there are two parts which stood-out. both are printed tiles. the first one is the yellow/black warning tile in 1x4. you can't have enough of that. the second one is a 2x2 tile with the jurassic world logo on it. that's pure awesome. the bigger sets seem to have only sticker for that, so this little set is a perfect way to get hold of this nice tile. the leftovers. nothing special. here is the complete trap. it is a basic build and functions pretty well. in the end the parts are more interesting as the build so it will definitely end up as a parts-pack. now on to the star of this bag. the celophysis/gallimimus. i don't know why lego decided to call this dinosaur mold any different, but i think it has to do with movie-connection and the will to not produce a new mold. nevermind, this figure is great and the colour is very bright and totally stood out. pretty beastie. a comparison between the 2015 gallimimus and the 2012 celophysis. the final set in all its glory. final verdict: it is a great little set. the parts used a nice and usefull. the printed tiles are the secret stars of this set and the dinosaur is fun two. with a few packs of these you could easily build a celophysis pack with lots of jurassic world signs on their way. highly recommended.

0 nice little review! now i definitely have to check if the toys r us in dortmund has it, too! edited by kcmatze, 03 may 2015 - 01:34 pm.

0 thank you, guys. i'm glad you liked this review. it's a nice little set.

0 nice i had to buy the jw lego game to get mine.

0 great review! very thorough. it's not a set which makes me run to tye store, but it definitely has some fun elements. i do like your new grey background. your pictures look great!

0 any chance you have a picture of the news stand next to the detectives office building as i would love to see the scaling for that?

0 stevkir, on 04 may 2015 - 08:06 am, said: any chance you have a picture of the news stand next to the detectives office building as i would love to see the scaling for that? sorry, i do not - but it'd be tiny and not look like the same scale. johnny6666, on 04 may 2015 - 09:59 am, said: it feels like a mishmash of bricks with no clear design aesthetic and as such blatantly underdeveloped (i.e. designed to hit a price/brick count point rather than provide a solid set in the creator town tradition). compared to other creator sets at this price point (31025 - mountain hut, for example) it feels utterly uninspired and ugly. well, i felt like the main model almost got to good looking :) i'd replace some of the tan with black, but otherwise i'm ok with that one.

-1 cheers for putting in the time to create a wonderful review. i am not a huge fan of this set; i like the colour combinations, but it all seems a bit all-too-simple. it can (and will) be nicely modularised, though!

1 reviews for this set really should picture them next to the bike shop & cafe, which it's intended to be compatible with right down to the size of the baseplates and grey tiles around the edge. it doesn't look that great on its own, but if you add the two sets together you get something that begins to look like a street scene.

0 thank you andy for your speed review! *y* so there?s nothing left to open while advent? ;-) i like all the tiny sets, it needn?t be another police- and fireman |-/ , but well, what would an advent calendar be without them? :-d one thing about the train traffic lights: tlc used to give us similar lights, but you could show either of the lights with the other one being covered: that one was waaay better! :'-( just a little piece more would have done the thing... ...and i won?t mention the radar-crap-dish :-x let me quote franz beckenbauer: "is' denn scho' weihnacht?" (legendary quote from an promotional job he did years ago - "is it x-mas already?")

-1 no girls....again! and no santa? whats up with that? sure there are many nice pieces to give life to every city layout.. i would love something more simple a girl taking her dog for a walk a boy on a bicycle simpler things...not all the workmen again!

1 a funny review with cool pics, thanks lasse d. a somehow mediocre mecha design, but a beautiful dark green color! upside down mecha yoga exercises on! :-d

0 nice review :) but... you paid how much? this set is priced around 7 euros here in germany, which is a very fair price for what you get in my oppinion. it?s a little disappointing though, that i couldn?t think of any alternate builds for this set, and there are no inspirations on the box or the ef website.

-1 nice review but i dont think i'll get this set i dont relly like the look it looks ugly, hmmm anyway...

1 i couldn't find a review of this wonderful set in here, so here it goes! i got the set for msrp (180kr = 24 euro) which is a fair price here in denmark. as all other creator sets there are instructions for several models (3 in this case). the box the box is a little larger than city sets in the same price range. the primary model is shown on the front while you see the secondary ones on the back. what you get 312 pieces in 5 polybags and two building instructions: one for the primary model and the other for the rest. the built it was impossible for me to speed build this model because of the nifty functional details from the retractable landing gear to the wings that can turn by means of the handle in the back of the model. it took me a full hour to build it because i had to "test" how it all works together. the finished model the landing gear isn't fully enclosed when retracted and the models are sub-minifig scale, but i still love the design of the models. the doors for the rear wheels open as you pull the wheels down and the final piece of functionality comes from the wings that can either tilt (the horizontal stabilizers) or have elevators. wing in, wings out, wings in, wings out... ratings as a whole i actually like this set even more than the big rig. the models are just as diverse but the added functionality makes the plane more fun to play with than the rig. price: 7/10 - a good price, but not a bargain as the big rig design: 9/10 - there could have been a sligtly higher level of details in the main model, but all models are really good looking and i especially like the design of the hovercraft. functionality: 10/10 - i guess you could ask for working rudders, opening cockpit and so on, but the plane is really filled with movable parts and the turning of the wings works really well. secondary models: 7/10 - a hovercraft! how awesome is that!? if only the last model was just as inventive instead of a standard helicopter... modifiability: 8/10 - the bricks are in ordinary colours and there is a good variety of them giving you plenty of possibilities for moc'ing. you can easily make the main model into something that looks more like an f-14. 9/10 probably as good as it gets for a creator set in this price range. it is entertaining to both build and play with, looks good and the secondary models are worth building as well! (brickshelf gallery)

1 thanks! i was planning on doing this review but i have been a bit swamped lately. :-$ great review of a great set. it isn't too hard to convert the plane to mini-fig size either. (sorry i forgot to take photos...) i might add some photos to your review....

1 hovercraft alternate model. uses around 4/5th of the parts. it is cool but a bit fragile.

0 batbrick, on sep 21 2007, 04:51 pm, said: glad to see creator making great sets, the theme has so much potential, i just wish that this set had more models... |-/ according to the guy that designed this set there was a space shuttle alt model but this year lego decided to not show them... *wacko* lasse d, on sep 21 2007, 05:36 pm, said: you didn't step on my toes because i took the pictures after you posted them :-p i just wanted to add them for completeness. that's a relief! :-) i didn't make the helicopter as it didn't impress me very much. i was curious about the hovercraft though.

1 i so need to buy this! where did you get it from? it says limited, so i guess it?s only available in certain stores, as the bridge walker was, or supernova or golden guardian.

1 it?s for sure an at least interesting set. the idea of attaching that small mecha to the bugs body is very good, so it works like a counterpart to the aero booster. pretty nice. although.... only the two front legs?re articulated? that?s a shame.... :'-( thanks for the review, rezourceman. *y*

1 that yellow mech would make a killer $10 set! i would buy it on its own... *wub*

0 why are the best sets limited editions? >:-(

1 i got a set of this but i planning to sell away to earn money to buy another set since im almost broke right now. :-d i got a set of this but i planning to sell away to earn money to buy another set since im almost broke right now. :-d

1 hahah, entertaining and informative, a great read- thanks for the review! on a side note i thought fant-four-stic was....ok. on the poorer side of ok. the exposition felt like it was from a 3 hour film because it was so long and towards the middle it started to drag. the ending was terrible. edited by mutant orc, 12 september 2015 - 09:53 pm.

0 this set is from 2013, doctor doom is completely based off the comic version/ tv show version, not the movie in any way. anyways, nice review. i personally own this set, and it's a nice set, but could have been better. edited by aegis2000, 13 september 2015 - 02:33 am.

0 thanks for the review, i've had that set for quite a while, and it's among my favorite marvel superheroes sets actually. compared to the other stuff we usually get to accompany the minifigs... all those "laboratorys", the most recent construction site, and the "hydra fortress" .. yeah... you're being a little harsh here maybe you're still suffering from ptsd after watching fant-four-stic!

0 i actually am surprised at the poor points this set has gotten, as this is one of my favorite sets that marvel has put out. i actually would like to hear what your thoughts are on the usm - lego dr. doom comparison, oky. thanks for the review. http://marvelanimate...or_doom_usm.png edited by zorglorfian, 14 september 2015 - 06:44 am.

0 for those of you who are old enough to remember system shock: next on maury: who's the father? edited by darthbrickus, 15 september 2015 - 05:28 pm.

0 overall, i wish marvel in particular would have more playsets in its theme (batman has several great ones in the dc theme). but then again, if this is the best playset to date for marvel, maybe it's better just to leave well enough alone. i would definitely like to see them attempt something in the $100+ (us) price range because i think it could be good; marvel needs an equivalent to the arkham asylum set. regarding this set, i saved myself some money and bought the 4 minifigs i needed (all but spidey) on bricklink for less than half the set price. edited by dmarvin, 17 september 2015 - 06:25 pm.

0 this set seems to appeal more to the non superhero crowd. it is one of the only marvel sets i bought. mainly because i thought that the building was a nice return to the old style of city sets. i would love to see this sort of backdrop for a more realistic agents theme... i also liked that most of the figs in this set were easier to merge into other (non-super) uses... thanks for the review! god bless, nathan

1 hi again! they have arrived *wub*! they come dismantled inside the package instead of one piece like the blackhole stormtrooper did. they have the head and sw-sign made with magnets to clip on to the torso. it actually works even if it feels a bit "cheapish". here?s some pictures - mr vader goes first *vader*: package pieces stormie: package pieces my collection so far >:-) : here?s the blackhole stormtrooper review. boba fett & luke maquette on copmike

1 super-cool! any text on the boxes of these ones? the stormie's left arm seems really long and slightly odd, but that's just because i'm jealous you've got one. :-d shorter than i was expecting though. dr. s.

1 ooh, i want one. i don't care which but i want one. perhaps *vader* ... thanks for the pics.

1 thanks copmike! dr. s.

0 the arms of the stormtrooper are a litle long i think.

1 dam you copmike! i really wanted to just get my boba fett one of these and you go and tempt me with great pics of them all togeather. must resist ebay!! must resist!!!! :-d

1 hello everyone! by now many excited lego star wars fans have started receiving their ucs falcon. some of us here enjoy writing reviews and sharing our thoughts. i mentioned to yoda that i was planning on doing a review of this set but it would likely take me a few weeks (of 1-2 hours per night) to finish building the set. yoda suggested that i do the review as i go so everyone could see the progress of the set. what a great idea! so, here is the first entry. feel free to comment along the way. i will try to post photos and updates every night on the build then wrap up the review when i complete the set. if you have any specific questions or photo requests, please be sure to ask. ucs millennium falcon reviewed by dunamis set 10179 5195 pieces $499.95 from lego shop at home the box: obviously, this is a box like no other. first of all, it comes in its own shipping carton. inside of that, there is a standard lego carton. finally, inside the lego carton, we have the actual millennium falcon box and a nice little letter thanking you for buying the biggest lego set ever. shipping box (naboo set provided for scale) lego carton and letter lego carton the millennium falcon box is really quite nice. there are lots of photos and it does a good job of ?selling? the set. there are 8 individual pieces of tape that keep the lid on the box. the limited first edition comes with a seal on the lower left corner. millennium falcon box (naboo set provided for scale) lifting the lid straight up reveals one compartment of several bags on the right. on the left, we find a thin, square box (like a pizza box) that contains the official certificate of authenticity, two sticker sheets and one enormous manual! under the pizza box, we find two more compartments each filled with several typical lego bags. the box weighs 24 pounds! stickers pizza box pieces in compartments not quite sure what the little 30th anniversary sticker is for yet. the certificate of authenticity is on heavy paper and is suitable for framing. more to come tomorrow. it's late here.

1 nice review. i'll be watching and waiting for the rest.

1 will follow this impatiently ;-) really like the start of the review *y* you always seems to pull it of nicely, in comparission with the exasperating *yoda* x-d :-p build on! play on! on on!

1 excellent beginning. our numbers are very close, but i haven't the luxury of space to build it, so i'll be enjoying it by proxy through you. enjoy! *y*

-1 tks for that comparison pic dunamis ;-) ok the box is big !! i pictured it a tad smaller though !! i know what i don't like, its the fact that it has the regular lego star wars logo on top with vader. ucs sets should have a different iconography like they did in the past. sure its a trivial detail but it adds to the fact of owning something special !! after all its the most expensive set ever as of now ;-) happy building !! and we'll wait patiently for some cool pics later on :-p *yoda*

1 the manual: the gigantic manual measures 17? x 12? and is almost an inch thick. it is spiral bound with a cardboard like front and back and it is 314 pages. interesting decision not to break it up into multiple manuals. it is almost unwieldy at this size and thickness. unfortunately, the manual is not available electronically from the lego website. hopefully, it will be soon. missing were the little instructions at the beginning telling you to not build this beast on shag carpet and to sort out the 5,000+ pieces before you get started. i guess they figure if you got $500 to spend on this thing, you can build it however you want. as usual, we get the regular lego manual features: - piece call outs for each step - parts inventory at the end of the manual - page numbers - photos of all the other 2007 sets at the end of the manual manual (paperback book provided for scale) various manual photos (8x8 plate provided for scale) i'm about 2 hours into building and sorting. i'm trying to stay a day ahead in my posting. the build has been easier than i thought so far. despite the massive number of pieces, it has not been too hard to sort and find what you need. build photos will start appearing in tomorrow's entry.

1 nice idea, reviewing the set while constructing it. this is the top of the bill for any lego-collector (also financially speaking..) and i like the look of all those thousands of pieces. the manual is incredible, i thought i had a really thick manual coming with set 8479, but this one exceeds it with ease... review on!

0 xwingyoda, on sep 28 2007, 07:34 am, said: tks for that comparison pic dunamis ;-) ok the box is big !! i pictured it a tad smaller though !! *yoda* i don't have the ucs isd but from the pic i can see that it is about the same thickness, slightly shorter but much wider than the mf. so this leads me to believe that dimension-wise the ucs mf is more compact. also, notice how in the content, the parts fit in just nice without additional spare space for anything else. strange isn't it that when tlc is responsible for the shipping, we see optimum usage of box spaces. x-d imagine if all boxes were this efficient. $4.99 sets would be no bigger than a match box! x-d x-d the mtt would be reduced to 1/4 its current size! x-d x-d x-d

1 the build: the build is going quicker than i thought. i am sorting as i open the bags that i need. some bags are in multiples so it is easy to pick them out. the build is a tad repetitive as the framework of the ship is somewhat symmetrical. here are some progress shots: note that two plates (1x4 and 1x8) are stacked in between technic beams. then the part below is assembled to hold the structure together. this took about an hour of sorting and building: i'll post another update tomorrow.

1 i have been taking photos for this review for a few months and i finally took the rest of the photos last night. all the parts. if you want tan, this is the set to get! main model. the garage is a great addition... ...but the car only just fits! the main house is very nice looking. the windows extend to the sides... ...but not the back. the chimney and drainage work very well, and i love the "basement". i think the front works very well. when i was making this i was multitasking doing weight training; do a set, do a step, do a set... and i ended up missing one of the row paths. i discovered this after i finished the basement. :-| the removable roof reveals byo floors. probably why this is called a model house! the roof was quite interesting to build. this is my first large house set so it all was very new to me. i love the garage door. more nice pipework. this photo i mis-focused but there isn't much to see anyway! the door is a nice touch. the grill to the right on both sides is not just decoration as it hides the hinges for the door. i also made one of the sub-models. i was considering keeping this but i decided against it. once again the sides have windows... but the back doesn't. the truck is there to make the photo more worthwhile! the roof to this one doesn't come off easily as all the tiles are used for the front. just to clarify; these houses aren't attached so you can arrange them however you want. the fronts are quite elaborate and it seems that lego were trying to make this almost like a simpler market street. the truck is too small for a minifig... ...but it probably was my favourite car. thoughts i highly recommend this set. in most countries it is good value for money, including australia. the design is excellent and three instructions are included. (the third is a school. if anyone has made it and wants to post photos feel free! at least one person at eb has made it.) i love how each house has its own car. due to the way the primary model is made it is a bit weak at the corner, but that was a design choice. my only real complaint about this set is how lego is going though a mould transition and thus some roof slopes are rough, others are smooth. i can accept either, and lego has been moving to smooth slopes for years now, but to have a set with about 50/50 is annoying. (the mtt was the same.) but that is my only gripe with this excellent set. *wub*

1 thanks for the review sinner! *y* ... although we had a not very detailed one already... :-p i bought this set at tru with 20% off resulting in 54?. x-d definitely a must buy for every townie. you get tons of useful parts to build other buildings as well. [shameless self-promotion /off] ;-) you have to love tan bricks though. 8-| moc on!

1 sweet! looks like an awesome set. i might get it, i have to see. looks like it has a lot of good parts. -zots

1 thank you for the nice review. i want this set too with al those tan bricks and black slopes and the cute blue car *wub* i like the old windows more, i hope they don't stop producing them

0 hi, you've done well on the pictures! but i agree with freekysch; a little more text would be great. ever thought about joining the reviewer's academy?

1 very nice review! i like the amount of pics and that alternate model. i wouldn't have thought of making a ship from those parts, i once made a larger, crownie-ized skellie barrier instead.

1 a very nice review with good, although perhaps a little too big, pictures.... *y* now i realized that this catapult?s able to swivel, that?s neat, thank you! x-d

1 thanks for this nice review. nice comics presentation, too. *sweet* makes me want to get some new castle sets even harder, now. :-$

1 ah yes, the good ol' catapult attack. nice review, and what a great comic, i loved it. *y* :-d you've inspired me, all i need now is a camera! :-p great job, keep up the good work, and i'm looking forward to more reviews! *y* ~peace edited by iamded, 12 october 2007 - 10:30 am.

1 great review. you almost make me want to buy one. i don't know what it is with these sets. on the one hand they are so nicely designed and cute on the other side i never seriously consider buying one. i can't explain what it is that holds me back.

0 great review, thanks oky! imo, the only significant improvements over the 2009 version are the figures, toys, and printed shop sign. as i already have the older one i'll have to give this one a pass.

-1 thanks for the excellent review! unfortunately it only highlights how minimal the upgrades are (though they are nice). definitively a pass for me. let's hope lego does continue to make the more realistic winter village sets (versus santa). i'm not opposed to a rehash, the post office could use some improvements for example, but this one is just a wee bit minimal.

0 thanks for the review. they definitely improved upon the original, but since i already own the original, i can't justify this set also, unfortunately. it seems to be the trend. but i'm sure there are a lot of first timers out there too that will snatch this up since it is a really lovely building. and the updates make it better for sure.

0 oky, on 29 november 2015 - 11:45 am, said: as for the controversy over re-releasing the winter toy shop, i can see where the haters are coming from, but i find their complaints to be quite petty. i can understand if you're disappointed because you already have the first winter toy shop and were looking forward to a new set this year, but there's always next year. if you're a completist and feel like tlg is forcing you to buy a set you don't need, you're wrong. nobody is forcing you to buy anything but yourself. if you decide to buy every set in a theme no matter what it is, that's your problem, not lego's. so put down your torches and pitchforks and just be glad that they improved the set design and gave us another chance to buy this classic set. there are far worse things that can happen in this world than lego re-releasing one of their most popular sets. sorry for that little rant. so what is your opinion on re-releases like this? please cast your vote in the poll above. after mocking people for holding a particular opinion, you then turn around and ask people to express their opinion?? no thanks. i guess i'll keep my opinions to myself. i certainly don't want to be labeled a "hater."

1 review - 42044 - display team jet introduction the smallest of the 2016 sets, is the display team jet. it doesn't seem to have lots of functionality, but maybe the landing gear is retractable. this set kind of reminds me to the 9394 - jet plane, although it's obviously a lot smaller. as you can read in my review of the 42052 - heavy lift helicopter basically anything flying is +1 for me, so let's find out if this set also fits the bill. note: all images can be clicked for hi-res versions. set information number: 42044 title: display team jet theme: technic released: 2016 part count: 113 box weight: 193 gr box dimensions: 15,4 cm x 13,8 cm x 5,9 cm set price (msrp):  9,99 price per part:  0,088 links: brickset, bricklink the box being a small set, it obviously comes in a small box. the display team jet is an aerobatics jet, used in air shows. on the box it's flying rather high, but at least it's at a safe distance from the crowd. front side shows the main model, together with a small section indicating you can use digital building instructions to build this model. back side the back side shows the b-model, a stunt plane. and again a reference to the apps for digital building instructions. more on the stunt plane later. content of the box the box contains: 2 instructions booklets (a- and b-model) 1 sticker sheet 3 technic liftarms 2 bags instruction booklets both the instructions for the a- and b-model are included in the box. sticker sheet a lot of stickers for such a small set. apparently no panel is left untouched. liftarms three liftarms unsealed, nothing out of the ordinary for a small set. bags two bags containing the rest of the parts. highlighted parts this section describes the new and/or otherwise interesting parts. yellow 5l axles the 5l axle in yellow has never been released before, so it's one of the new parts for this year. black 7l flex axles for the layman this seems a common part, but the 7l soft axle actually has never been released in black before. combined with the re-release of the 19l soft axle in black, this will open up lots of possibilities. for those of you thinking you've read this text before; you are right, the new drag racer contains these new 7l flex axles too. white panels this small set comes with a whopping 10 panels. great for the ones who like panels. not so great if you think tlg is using too much panels lately. rudder this part, the small bionicle wing, is the same as the one used in last year's 42033 - record breaker. part list this set contains 113 parts, all listed below. the build this is the collection of parts, used to build the jet. it sure looks like we are getting a landing gear. the build is fun, but pretty straightforward. there aren't any special or cool techniques used in this set. it almost took me more time to apply all the stickers than to build the actual model. finished model the finished jet does look cool though. the white and yellow color scheme, combined with the stickers, work really well. i have seen people refer to the plane as being orange, but it's definitely yellow. technic (or lego in general) tends to have some color variation when it comes to yellow. i do concur this is the warmer variant of yellow, but it's not orange. the back of the plane looks nice too, although i am not a big fan of the rudder part. it looks too detailed, compared to the other panels. it's not a big deal though, and maybe it's just me. parts left only three common parts left. features and functions this set has a single feature and that is a retractable landing gear. it's operated by the black 12t double bevel gear near the cockpit. in the following picture you can see the landing gear retracted. this image shows the landing gear when the plane is ready for landing. hopefully the pilot will roll the plane before landing, but you probably know what i mean video here's s short video demonstrating the display team jet. b-model this set also includes the building instructions for the b-model, a stunt plane. the building experience for the stunt plane is more or less the same as for the jet. well, what do you expect when both models are planes with a limited number of parts. for an alternative model the stunt plane looks fine. there's not a lot of functionality in this plane, but it's worth mentioning that the tail wheel allows the plane to roll on a flat surface. the plane also has working propellors. both functions are demonstrated in the video. unfortunately, the landing gear of the stunt plane is not retractable. parts left a couple of extra leftover parts, but it's nice to see that most of the parts have been used in the b-model as well. actually, there's probably an extra yellow technic smooth 1/2 bush left. i just found it on my desk, but it could belong to one of the other sets. video here's a video demonstrating the stunt plane. summary two nice planes for 13 bucks, that's basically what you get. both models look good and the set has some interesting new parts. especially the 7l flex axle will be very popular. it comes with a decent collection of white panel, although they are very common nowadays. both models have limited functionality, but each of them has at least one function to give the model some playability for kids, other than the swooshability that is. okay, it might lack some proper functions, but i still think kids will love this set. i can see kids running around with one of the planes in their hands. all in all i think this set delivers what you'd expect. score let's see how this set flies! remember that the grades are based on it being a small set. obviously a set like this, cannot be compared with a mercedes flagship. 8 design for a small set, the model looks very authentic. 7 building experience no surprises. 7 features just the retractable landing gear. 8 playability it has swooshability, so i see kids running around with this model. 7 parts lots of panels, if you are into that. 8 value for money can't go wrong with these small sets. 7,5 fun for kids more image can be found on my flickr page. thank you for reading. i hope you enjoyed it.

0 it says 5l in the parts list.

1 love this model, awesome swooshability, interesting parts, and a nice little model to put on my desk at work :)

0 megaroi, on 01 december 2015 - 10:56 am, said: hi there, nice model, great review! i almost reverse engineered this model, but used wrong parts for landing wheels, didn't know how to fix the nose proper, and so on. so i was very interested in this model and i like playing with it. i love the reviews, but i think i have to mention, that the yellow axle must be a 5l! the picture shows a 5l, and a 5l would fit the size of the model. the cart has also a 5l in yellow. what sitze is the yellow axle in this seit. really 4l as written in the text? greetings, robert the picture of the manual says 4x 5l yellow axle, and that seems to line up with what im seeing in the pics as well so i assume the 4l is a typo

0 i seem to have been messing up axle lengths in various reviews it's indeed 5l. my bad. thanks for pointing it out.

1 i am definitely getting set for the panels!

0 jay psi, on 02 december 2015 - 12:10 am, said: nice review, even with the missing demonstration video of the a-model! hmmm strange. let me fix that.

0 fixed the video and fixed the stars in the voting. thanks for paying attention guys

0 set is only interesting for the panels, that's all it is to me

1 my favourite of the 2016 sets i've built so far. i'd go so far as to say this is the best "budget" set in years. i would have loved this when i was a kid ... great "swoosh ability" ??

1 another great review jim! and again i love the model, those pearl gold wheels this one definitely goes on the "buy on sight" list

0 jim great reviews but can i suggest you one thing? take some pics before you apply the stickers....and some with the stickers on! it helps to have a comparison!

0 are parts #62462 in flat or metallic silver?

0 thanks for the thorough comments! i agree that the set has some limitations, both in construction and realism, but i think they're acceptable given the pricepoint and size. the antenna is definitely ludicrous - i really do suspect they had a surplus of the swords to use up! and yes, the way the steering knob is mounted is loose. i also noticed that the u-joints to the claw are not in the right spot like you mentioned, but didn't include it since it still works fine. that axle coming forward to the claw has a very long unsupported section that does bend a bit when you raise and lower the claw. it works, but is a bit of a cheat that i'm kinda surprised they let through. i just checked and the bucket from 8043 is a couple studs too wide for this set. i'm betting that was seriously considered, but it'd have meant scaling the whole thing up and that would have put it into a higher price point. or they could have pulled the mold for the 8x14 bucket back out and remade it for this set... i really like the model you built! and that's interesting about the cabs being basically flush with the top but sticking out the side. in image searching as part of my research, i found both that style and ones like this, with the cab sticking up more (like the photo of the caterpillar one in my review). i wonder if that's a us/european difference, or different types of mining, or what, because both styles definitely exist in the real world.

1 think this is the only 1h set i'll be getting. guess i'm waiting for 2h for the rest of the construction stuff! this set looks okay to me; it includes the instructions for both models, which is cool, and includes some great parts. i like that it's not just another bucket loader and that it actually tries something different, too.

-1 freekysch, on 06 december 2015 - 12:00 pm, said: great review and great pictures ! many thanks for talking the time to review this set . i am a fan of lego technic construction stuff, but this set is not so appealing to me. but, then again i am sure some people will love it. indeed very good review! and also good points pointed out by m_longer ;) this set doesnt appealing to me neither, but before i knew what it was i was thinking it was interesting but now... its so simple, a set close to 500 pieces with only 1 real function, and the entire rear section looks unfinished.

1 thanks for review, mostlytechnic. not a must have for me, but this set have nice assortment of parts... new turntable, new panels (i like yellow). and if i'll buy two of this sets - i'll get enough wheels for proper 18-wheeler. and rubber connectors, that i almost don't using at all, but want to have more and more) edited by victor imaginator, 06 december 2015 - 02:19 pm.

1 nice mod there, effe, might inspire me when i get one and start modding it

1 i have made a ldd file of a improved version

0 ^^efferman : would there be an instruction list for this mod ?

0 a forum member on doktor brick has said he will make an instruction

0 the instruction is done. many thanks to martinsch https://www.dropbox....loader.pdf?dl=0

0 majklspajkl, on 05 december 2015 - 11:45 pm, said: my opinion on the frictionless axlepins is that the flex axle might be easier to stick in them than in regular/blue axlepins... didn't actually try it though :-) frictionless pins have accurate round hole, while blue friction pins have something squarish. flex axle will fit in both, but using tan pins doesn't require strength. conncetion with tan pins is weaker too.

0 great review! im a bit undecided on the set though, it has some nice parts (4 cil engine in such a small set!) and it looks good, but also a bit small and simple, not sure if it stands up to the standards of the small tracked loader or similar for sets of this size, and as a parts pack (for panels/flaxles) the display team jet is infinitely better. ill probably pick one up, but right now i really want another tracked loader... (last one was sacrificed to the mod gods)

1 nice review, thanks nice little set, i might buy me one

1 i was supposed to publish it together with the 42039 - 24 hours racer, but it somehow got backlogged. after completing the reviews for the 2016 sets, i felt i needed to finish it (was already 90% done). that c-model looks cool!

0 i think this model is more or less supposed to be a version of this thing. a pretty obscure topic, but also very interesting.

1 another great review i like this set very much, both models look good to me and it's a great part pack for me, the long list in the "high light parts" session tells everything. as for the real world counter part of the a model, how about this: try googling sno-cat and there a lots of such things.

1 the suspension is indeed awesome. for it's size, this is a great set! looking at the grades, i seem to have lowballed the score.

-1 i don't like appearance of this off-roader at all but i've got it as gift so it's in my technic collection now. when i built it i was very surprised how cool suspension it has and how much playability it features. i've also tried to build some alternative model out of it but without success. anyway thank you jim for great review! edited by tomik, 14 december 2015 - 05:45 pm.

0 you've done a good job of this review mr imperialscouts! but two things. 1) background far too bright and the set is far too dark, easily rectified with brightness & contrast adjustment. 2) no poll to rate the set out of 5. nonetheless this should be frontpaged on classic-pirates.com!

1 a fine little set with 64 pieces and 3 figures for under $10. may have seemed a bit steep in 1991, but i wouldn't know, i'd passed into my dark ages already, so alas, i haven't a copy of this set. looking at the parts list, i could build one out of my current inventory though. issued today for $10, i'd buy no less than 14 of them, even though it does lack the obligatory rowboat for the pirate to make his escape in. very nice review and comic, thanks for doing them! *y* edited by imperialshadows, 20 october 2007 - 06:10 am.

1 nice review, funny little story, and a 4 from me. a useful little set indeed. *sweet*

-1 well i only know the european price: 89.99 euros i think that's quiet expensive against the 2005 police station (7237): 74.99 euros - rupeeclock

1 hooray assuming from the picture on the box we will also be getting the old police car and bike in blue aswell! i really like this set it seems the best police station we've had in a long time and what a great amount of figures! thanks for this great insight the-force! ;-)

1 it's mine *wub*! just got my luke today from tru in in merrilville, in... ;-)! so here's some pictures and thoughts: still in the packing with the box pieces out in the fresh air put together, ready for some serious vader vacking >:-)! if you this close you're so dead!! it's yet another lovely maquette *wub*! the only downside is that the lego sw sign doesn't even resemble (ok, i've exagurating a bit :'-)) the ones from the other maquettes! check out this one from the blackhole trooper compared with the luke one: the luke one is has a massproduced look over it with just a printing |-/ , the other has depth & a painting on it. now i'm waiting for the long overdue boba one! here's the other maquettes reviewed: darth vader & stormie blackhole stormie maquettes on copmike

0 excellent review copmike! i feel as if i've actually seen the maquette up close in real life. x-d i swear i've even touched it. tack for sharing min kompis! *sweet*

0 thanks for the cool picture! how big are those maquettes? could you make a picture with a minifig next to the maquette please?

-1 wow i went to my local toysrus and apparently they had some there dont really like them but there neat:)

-1 not my thing, but a very nice review, thanks for sharing it! i was seriously considering this one when it was originally announced as a 6212 copack item at a particularly good price and then everything changed. i do, however, seriously ache to get my hands on one of the more traditionally lego looking 2ft+ vaders they use in the official stores (at least they had one here in orlando). *wub*

0 nice review. how's the head made attached to the body?

1 during the annual thanksgiving road trip to the relatives, i stopped by the tru in portland, or. lo and behold, the new mars mission sets! obviously, i bought them. ;-) the box: not much to say. standard box art for mm sets, nothing new. the parts: some good parts here. even if you don't like the set (which i highly doubt after i've had my say :-p ), it's a decent parts pack. i noticed that some old parts have been renewed. i know the wheel has been used in the '07 sets, but the cockpit and hitch i haven't seen in a while. the vldss (very large dss). grr. new part. at least, i think it is. someone slap me if it isn't. *wacko* the figs. i know i've seen that head before, but i have no idea where. does anyone know? i was hoping that the aliens would have new arms, at least. i was sadly mistaken... on the upside, i finally discovered that they glow in the dark. :-$ the alien has a jetpack. if that's not the silliest thing i've ever seen, i don't know what is. the build. simple build. a block. so easy a caveman cou- oh, never mind. geico's used that one enough. then, we have this jobber right here. not sure what it is, but it looks like some crystal scanning device. it's starting to look pretty nice. it almost looks practical. the cockpit is suffering from a bad dose of over-stickering. on the upside, we have a new piece there to hold the cockpit on. part 1 complete. it has a nice little radio antenna, which is ruined by the use of a random missile that looks like it's going to shoot the antenna before it shoots the alien. still, i never say no to a good missile i can use for something else. the trailer: fairly simple, but it works. it features stabilizing arms, a handheld saw, and an extremely random mini-bot who's purpose escapes me. the whole meal deal- erm, general pics. overall, i thought this was a good set. in fact, it reminds me of this:

1 cool review, thanks!! :-d i personally think the minirobot is awesome, and (dare i say) cute! this was described on amazon to be a mobile lab, i'm not seeing that. i do however see a crystal hauling vehicle. *sweet* pretty cool, not as bad as previous sets. ~peace

0 thanks for the review. i still will not get this set. speechless about it

-1 great review, but am i the only one who thinks this is a pretty homely looking vehicle? the small exploration robot is cool, but the large windscreen on the main vehicle reminds me about jack stone! i also think the bases of the vehicle parts are very basic and look almost unfinished with the holes and such. i think i will pass this one, even though the alien has a jet pack and there is the nice mini vehicle.

-1 ah, thanks so much again, mr. m! this set looks great! i probably won't get this though. i hat mm as far as it goes. i agree with xwingyoda on this one. does the minibots wheels move? edited by ~vbbn~, 26 november 2007 - 10:34 pm.

1 mr. mandalorian, on nov 26 2007, 09:05 pm, said: uh oh. don't get me wrong- i like the set, but the world's gone crazy when we need technic parts for the little bike. |-/ i agree with the technic bike.... :-x i would be getting the set whenever you can. edited by exo-builder59, 29 november 2007 - 09:43 pm.

1 cool review. i'm actually liking that new missile part as it seems to combine a bar with a pin. but it's a real eyesore if you ask me.

-1 hmm, its actually a nice bit better than i expected, and great review, thanks! but think ill pass on this one. i quite like the alien fighter though, heh. and loved the way you described how he sat in the cockpit.

1 thanks for that very good review, mr. mandalorian! *y* i think that this is a plain beautiful set, oh how i wish that tlc would?ve taken that direction from the beginning.... :'-) the design is much more practicable, with fewer non-system parts and technic beams with(!) studs.... this makes everything much more easier to mod and a lot more useful, at least imo. *y* so it?s for sure not very hard to make the (wonderful enclosed) cockpit one brick higher, and even that little alien ship looks decent and nice.... x-o and the fighter looks sleek and elegant too, in both modes! that?s just very cool, compliments, tlc. now all we need?re aliens with moving arms and here we go, classic space on forever! x-d

1 friggin sweet, thank you mr mandy for the reveiw of this sweet ship! *y* *wub*

-1 hmmm, i doubt i'll be getting this set. good review though.

1 hmmm, great review for a great set. *y*

-1 and another tks and congrats mm on that review !! like the o?her post i think that this set is a wastre of time and money and shelfspace. its such a ripp off from that ugly alfa team crapjet. i do not like the design of the jet itself: the small flags as front is so lame !! and i don't like those orange wheels as engines !! furthermore i don't like the "rover" mode either !! the only cool thing about it is the special martian jet which they should ahve sold separatly :-p at least some interesting parts but that far from saving that set imo |-/ money saved on once again :-p *yoda*

1 john cleese, on nov 25 2007, 10:56 pm, said: cool review. i'm actually liking that new missile part as it seems to combine a bar with a pin. but it's a real eyesore if you ask me. a needed solution to those blasted flick missles from falling out while swooshing. *sweet* wonder if the range might have an issue seeing it's held in there but who knows, maybe they now "pop" out with a greater velocity than a mere finger flick? i had resorted to technic 1/2 bushings (smooth) to lock in the missile's technic axle (with stud).

-1 mr. mandalorian, on nov 26 2007, 05:45 am, said: the wing. for some reason, the body of the "mechanism" has a blue brick. *wacko* i think blue must be a cheaper color for lego... steve

-1 lasse d, on nov 26 2007, 03:34 pm, said: 1) there will always be kudos for a good review at eb ;-) 2) yeah. it does look quite slow and tank-like. it is a shame lego didn't make a more obvious way shoving what goes on. you mean the ungainly way in which the wheels have to turn in order to change from tank mode? i think you are right as well. on the other hand. if it has anti-grav, then it doesn't really make sense to have wheels as well. i mean. if the power goes, then the wheels can't turn anyways! it must have anti-grav. otherwise, none of the flying sets would work... athos, on nov 26 2007, 04:02 pm, said: i think blue must be a cheaper color for lego... steve i think this is weird. tlc included way too many random colors. blue, red, green, and yellow... *wacko*

0 so hinckley, can you give us a hint on what our walrus friend will do with the dark panther? i can't wait to see. 8-|

1 sweeeet. *wub* it's nice to finally see a set that's not bipedal or (?) tripedal. quote exo-force is an anomaly in my lego interests. i don't know why i like it so much or why i keep buying it but i do. that would be a problem, wouldn't it? :-p quote the cockpit itself is constructed very well but the canopy seems like an afterthought, closing on to the robot's head and leaving his back and sides completely exposed. i dunno. at least it has a canopy, unlike past sets..

0 great review! *y* i am sure to get this set for parts now. his legs dont look very poseable... :-/ thanks hinck! ~vbbn~

1 great review as always, hinckley. frankly i'm in love with this thing. so much so, in fact, that i've been calling it 'shadow panther' for weeks, but never mind... anyway, why do i like it? well, purple is such a fantastic lego colour- it's sparingly used, which makes it interesting, and it simply looks great. those jetpack/backpack things the robots are wearing, and if they are jetpacks, as the back of the box suggests, then the use of chaisaws is quite nifty and innovative. the minibot is cool, and certainly an interesting gimmick. sure, they don't look quite as good in some of the other sets, but here it looks great. the overall structure and design are cool too. it's always nice to see an 'irregular' mech, and this is no exception. it's especially cool whee the spines are concerned. plus, on top of all that, it's got a nice selection of parts, including some lovely new ones, and the inlaid box is interesting. well worth getting, i think.

1 another fantastic review, hinckley. i really like this set, i wasn't to keen on it when i first saw the pictures bit having seen the review, i am starting to like it. it seems quite sturdy, and it makes a change from the usual 2 legged mechs. as well as that purple is welcome anywhere, i have such a shortage of that colour! i like the rusty orange colour of the robots, and their back/jet packs are quite cool, and the mini robot looks sweet.

0 hah screw patience! you're the best hink! i can't wait for the comics. edited by exo-builder59, 28 november 2007 - 03:02 am.

1 sweet. caant wait for all of these sets to show up in the u.s.

0 from the lego store in chicago, if i recall his post properly! my goodness hink, you're going to pull an all-nighter for reviews at this rate! oh well, it's kinda worth it, right? :-p

0 this designers were on a roll with this one until it came to the flying unit. it looks like a shambles, epecially the guns looking rather simplistic. although they used something similar to the light and sound globe peice, which is kind of neat. i dont think i'll be buying this but your review almost talked me into it.

1 this one is much better than i thought; i didn't expect the gun and the "turret" to be geared! i agree that a lot of the details sux (hollow inside, lame cockpits...) but as an overall package it looks quite good. the best part is.... no shooter! is the nightmare finally over? :'-) the bonus robot is a much better idea. the large amount of blue pieces make this a must buy for me as impartial needs more raw materials! :-p how well do the tracks work? the last tank was too light and it didn't roll well at all. :-/ thanks for these photos as well hinckley. *wub* so far the 08 exo-force sets are looking good! *sweet* hinckley, on nov 28 2007, 04:48 pm, said: and actually i did feel the same way you did about the flying module, until i put sinner in it and started to play. :-p wow! it's big enough for my big walrus head! *wub*

-1 fantastic! great review, thanks a bunch for all the pics, they've shown me how (in my opinion) bad this set is. :-p i just expected it to be more bricky rather than technicy. oh well, i wasn't planning on buying it anyway. x-d i noticed you spelt mini-figs mini-fgis in the first paragraph, in case you wanted to know. x-d so again, thanks, and i'm looking forward to seeing the rest of them, and the comics! ~peace

1 thanks for this great review hinckley! :'-) i know you're loving this attention! x-d :-p i actually like this set, and like it a lot more now that i've seen this review. i'll most likely get, mostly for the figs and parts. i reckon it would look a lot better alongside the rest of the 2008 ef mechs. anyway, thanks for the review! to the brickmobile! >:-)

0 thanks for this other great review, hinckley *y* ! you sure you don't work as one of tlc's prs? x-d ;-) everytime i see one of your reviews i want to buy the set, and that is sweet to me, but bad for my money 8-| luxorv

1 thanks for that good review, hinckley. *y* a really interesting set and a turning point for lego. minirobots instead of shooting crap, pretty cool. i hope the kids?ll like it too. for the design, i love that asymmetrical look of the front part and the sleek guns of the flyer. it?s smart that the gatling gun moves along with the tank, too. the set idea with two vehicles in one?s not new, but very play- able and the treads/big wheel design?s cool. i don?t like the use of studless technic beams, but well, they do their job i guess. and keiken?s cockpit should be easy to improve....

0 can't wait for the extended review!! ;-)

1 some of you might know that i'm not a big fan of exo-force, but this set is an exception. this looks like a futurist tank. my kids would love this.... if i should have any :-d as always, very professional review hinckley!

1 crap! >:-( now i have to spend all my money on this! *wub* *wub* and whats the code? oh well, awesome set, and judt curios, didnt the reviewers used to be bianca and gavin? jifel

0 8112 battle arachnoid review i've opted to do another set review instead of getting the comics up. i don't want anyone to beat me to the reviews. so, thanks for your patience and enjoy the review. the comics will be up in due time. thanks! :-$

0 hinckley, on dec 6 2007, 04:56 am, said: honckly? wow, dude. :-/ well, at least you got the c and the k. of course, the e is missing. it's all right though. eight letter words can be challenging :-p that's always the case for me. although, i have the assault tiger and will start on it next. on the box it looks like it is wearing huge bell bottoms. :-d i want to get the chameleon hunter, i really like the look of it and forgot to pick it up. guess i'll have to go back to tru! :-$ cross your fingers that i find more indy sets! x-d i'll just stick to calling you hink *y* (less letters :-d )

0 zero1312, on dec 5 2007, 05:27 pm, said: wow, nice review. *y* but i have a question: where can i find these "ork sets" everyone is refering to because of these swords in the rotors. :-/ are you talking about the dwarves mine? *sweet*

1 here is my review of the set 6265 sabre island! overview: sabre island was release in 1990 an it contained 92 pieces and its retail price was $15.50. it comes with 3 imperial blue coats, and a nice outpost for them. the pictures + full review: anyway, you can see here a picture of the box, the model shown on the box differs from the actual model slightly. ...and the back of the box, which shows some nice alternative models from the pieces provided. a close up of two or three of the alternative models. and now for the minifigs. i prefer the red coats over the blue coats but these minifigs are nice, and for the number of pieces one gets a fair amount of them. the set itself makes a nice small outpost, it comes complete with a palm tree, a cannon (with ammo) on a turntable, a small tower a nice large imperial flag and a little red row boat! here is a shot from ground level showing the cannon and blue coat (patrolling the out post!) the rowing boat was a nice touch, and it comes with a small flag too. "no pirates will avoid the wrath of myself and my mighty island!" the top of the tower is rather plain and simple which in some ways is good, as it keeps the whole set detailed yet not crowded, but i feel a little something should of been added to the top though. the back is lacking any type of walls, so one can play with the minifigs inside, yet their are also no stairs or any other ways for the blue coats to climb up their tower either! the rag tag pirates attack sabre island! but never fear, the lord of pies is here! me throwing a pie at captain ironhook from another angle. overall i think this is a very good, if somewhat simple set, and makes a great cheap imperial set! comments, thoughts and opinions are welcome! (and sorry about the darkness in some photos, i have not had time to take photographs when it is till light recently, for when i return home it is dark |-/ ) edit: fixed, thank you! edited by phred, 12 april 2015 - 05:14 am.

1 i gave this one a 5. it's one of the little pirate sets i had during my youth and i loved it for several reasons. first of all, it contains 2 of my favorite minifigs! it can be used as a small independent base or in combination with one of the bigger sets (eldorado or trading posts) as a lookup or outer defense. besides all that, this set just looks beautiful. i love the colors (blue baseplate and the white/yellow tower). one of the best little/medium sized sets ever made by lego!

1 i give it a 4, only because there are no pirates. i aways loved this set, nice little fortifaction. lots of details. i only wish i could have worked it in aberbrick.

0 did i hear right? a catapult in the 16th/17th/18th and 19th centuries? *wacko* perhaps it's an appeal for lord of pies to have his own personal catapult to pelt the pirates with whipped cream pastries should they try to sail past. but this begs the question... why waste perfectly good pie on those scurvy, mangy, mutt-faced villians!

1 indexed i'm going to have to start dodging cannon balls soon if i don't start making some pirate mocs. *pirate* anywayz, i've had my shell service station set # 6378 built exactly by "the book" and sitting around for the longest time. with the recent twinning of my "town" with dr. sinister, i needed a gas station that could handle a lot more traffic (especially military traffic and these new 6-wide vehicles x-d ). here be a thumblink to the original station at bl: i love this station so much, but it really needed some modernization. the reopening of this station received a lot of attention, even the local police stopped right over. one big upgrade to this station is the selling of propane tanks, which is generally a rare commodity from the lego towns i've seen. x-d also at this service station is a propane tank refilling station. the milkman is our first propane customer. the interior has also had an addition and many upgrades. for instance, this building now has florescent lighting, a big frig in the back, and more shelf space. *y* oh look! there's the officer purchasing a mountain dew. now that there's more shelf space, we can sell more than just 1x1 round yellow bricks and levers. we now have available 1x1 round plates and 1x1 round cones available in multiple colors! :-d with this upgraded gas station, hopefully this town will bring in more business and customers into my small town. x-d p

1 great moc! it seems you did the math when doing this one and hit the nail on the head (which pierced a megablock causing it to self destruct) ! stauder

1 nice station phred, love those fluorescent lights! *wub* but...start dodging cannonballs now, boom, harr! :-p

1 great review!! i love this set *wub* (not only because of marion though :-d ) it has the ark that is very cool , sw humor and lots of snakes a very cool set and perhaps my favorite so far *sweet* damn, 3 out 4 indy sets reviewed and isn't even 08 yet x-d p

1 thank you for the great review! looks like a very nice set, so many snakes!!

0 this is great, thanks for the review...but they're using a new skellie? i thought those were just for the reanimated dead...not just skeletons. unless that skeleton is supposed to be reanimated? either way it makes me sad :'-( that marion is beautiful *wub* worth it for the set alone! and that sw reference is great x-d

0 indy565, on dec 16 2007, 12:50 am, said: awesome!!! i want it soo bad!! :'-) how much was it? ?44.99, as it says in the first line of the review ;-) edited by big pete, 16 december 2007 - 01:04 am.

0 can you get a close up of the golden idol thingy? looks cool! jifel

0 big pete, on dec 15 2007, 06:04 pm, said: ?44.99, as it says in the first line of the review ;-) yes, but i don't live in the uk. any idea how much it might cost in the us?

1 thank you very much for another great review, big pete *wub* this is a good set, but i probably won't be able to afford it with all of the rest of the lego coming out in 2008 |-/ oh, i watched this scene a few weeks ago, and the pilot is fishing while waiting for indy to escape. thanks again you lucky lucky man :-p

-1 no hovitos? no! ah well, if i get more pirate sets next year i'd use the islanders as hovitos. in the video game they have the same torsos. i'd really like to get this, maybe in june i'll have luck. :'-)

1 tks so much big pete for thisd awsome review of yet another fantastic indy sets !! its clearly one of the best lines of all times with sw 8-? that idol is superb and i love all the details of that set: loads of cool defense mechanisms, sweet vegetation and yeay another black carrot torch :-p and those mfs are really nice !! i am so happy to see lego go dark tan *wub* now i clearly can't wait to enjoy building this set ;-) fertility idol on !! *yoda*

0 this set is so cool... and another must buy! :-$ i'm in trouble next year it seems... the figs are great! *wub* i think the plane is only ok; perhaps they should have made that in a separate set as it needed to be a certain size to fit the figs, but that meant that the tail is way too short. here is a picture of the actual plane so you can see what i mean. (notice the pilot is fishing... ;-) ) the temple is another story; i think lego have done an incredible job with this, fitting in the key parts of this sequence without making an absurdly large model. addtionally, there are many parts in this set that i haven't got so it shouldn't be too hard to justify. x-d thanks for another great review. *sweet* i love the photo of indy running with the idol and the boulder close behind. :-p naith, on dec 16 2007, 10:20 pm, said: lol is it just me or in the earlier concepts of this set we saw a native on the box? i wonder why they removed it :-( *wacko* i recall that too. :-/ edit: yes there was one... big pete, on dec 16 2007, 11:28 pm, said: we don't normally have this many inconsistencies do we ? quite annoying ones too. i think the plane looks better with those being white.

0 i want this set but its $60 aud which is a ripp off! i like the yellow car! *wub* :'-) *y* by the way good review! *y*

0 picked up from the lego shop in bluewater yesterday front of box back of box price ?2.50 gbp contents, a very small instruction manual instructions (front) intsructions (back) 25 pieces (23 used in the model) regular construction mini fig start of the assembly roll in the drum just attach the drum a little tap with the hammer! (hammer not included!) wheel it into position time to start mixing, also time for a well earned tea break, the cement is all ready now. and the 2 left over bits. extra cement is always useful and not really wasted. overall, a nice little set and i am pleased to see little sets appearing again at long last. the only negative is with the drum of the mixer, although the angle can be adjusted you cannot tip the contents out of the mixer. all in all i would say 8/10 for a good little set? comments...? ? ? edit by hobbes: replaced pictures with clickable thumbs and corrected set number.

1 great review and nice touch putting the minifig in the mixer *y* and i think you are the first to review this set so all in all good work. steel...

1 should be here's the completed base and my knee in cordoroys (sp?) great review.

1 thanks for the photos and review brickmaster. i'm hoping to find this on sale as well... no luck so far. i love the white ship, and i think the base would be amusing, but ultimately hard to re-use. incidentally, that long axel is common in recent technic sets, but i think it was orignally made for the hockey sets. :-d

0 lol, "polizei" is german for police.

1 i quite like it, but i feel that my lego city is getting over-run with helicopters and planes. also i have got the helicopter from the 7237 police station set, but it is not as good as this plus i'am sooooo dissapointed that the :-x stickers :-x are blue instead of black and green as they will not fit with the sets i have already got :-d nice review thanks edited by caseyref, 26 december 2007 - 02:04 am.

0 nice review *y* i will get 2 of these at the least especialy since they're going to be $15 aud *wub* :'-)

(the look recessed to me. :-/ ) they're definitely recessed new windows in this set i'm afraid, just in case no-one has answered your question yet. i got this set in woolworths the other day. tescos have it too now. i have to say it's my all time favourite police helicopter. nice review psp guy!

1 thank you for the great review sandra *y* . i *wub* the detail that tlc added to this set. i would like to add that i think all the buildings look *sweet* . i really like how you compared the look to "back to the future". when i saw the first pics, i thought the same thing. the look of the set is definitly the 1950's. i am :-( to see the price though. i am sure this set will be $149.99 us too. great review, model on!!

1 axle, on dec 28 2007, 02:07 pm, said: can you take a picture(s) of all the film posters? there?s no necessity to take pics of all the film posters. there are only 3 different film posters at the set. always one poster twice.. and you can see every different poster at the brickshelf gallery. if you need more details, then you should maybe buy it :-) regards sandra

1 freebee, on dec 28 2007, 02:33 pm, said: ouch ;-) hm if my answer was to harsh: sorry axle :-$

1 i enjoyed seeing this review. nice to get some different angles on the components. sorry to disagree with anyone however, but this was not a great review. i appreciate the effort sandra made but a great review would include more details such as what are stickers and what are printed pieces. a great review points out flaws or limitations as well as what works or is really neat. a great review would have analyzed the price per piece and compared that to other sets/themes. one might look at the recent reviews of the indy sets or the new spongebob sets as examples of really good reviews. the pictures are good but a great review, above all, should provide the reader with some new information, perhaps even answer questions posed in the pre-release discussion thread. i learned nothing new about the set from this review. that said, it was a good review for someone who had not seen the pre-release discussion and she did a good job of showing said person what they could expect in the set.

1 thank you for the review

1 nice review - thx for all the pics. they certainly made me consider getting this set. kimt btw: which set would you recommend: market streeet, town plan or cafe corner? just curious. they're pretty expensive and i might only afford one of them.

1 kimt, on jan 4 2008, 10:25 am, said: btw: which set would you recommend: market streeet, town plan or cafe corner? just curious. they're pretty expensive and i might only afford one of them. definitely the coffee corner. it?s a hard desicion between coffee corner and town plan, because they are both really great sets. the market street is no "must have" in my opinion. but the other two. maybe you should start with the coffee corner, it?s the older set. the town plan is newer and will be available longer then the coffee corner. i hope it helped you a litte bit :-$ regards sandra edited by legocastlegirl, 04 january 2008 - 10:43 am.

1 thanks for the review. i really want this set because: 1. it looks fantastic 2. has harder to find colors 3. is a 50th anniversary commemorative 4. some of the models are based on the 50s sets (i love the old stuff) the tanker truck is a perfect recreation of the old ho 1:87 scale esso tanker truck. i have one, and you can look at it for comparison if you would like. lego ho vehicles i'd like to modify the truck from this new set to look even more like the old esso truck, getting rid of the green and adding some decals.

1 tks will for your great review !! g after reading *vader* 's reviews (of that set and the rs) and yours i really can't wait to get that set and all of the sw sets :-p really nice photography there which is sweet !! *yoda*

1 thanks will! this really is a nice set! your new camera and the backround looks great, the pic quality is very good! thanks!! *y*

1 thanks for the review, mr. mandalorian! this set looks very nice, and it's good to know the nose cone stickers are 2 separate ones, so they don't cross bricks. :-d that camera is working out great for ya'! thanks again! ~peace

1 thanks for the reveiw on this great set! i actually just came home from tru with this, maybe 1/2 hour ago! funny! love the new hair sculpt! *wub*

1 this is a brilliant review of a brilliant set! *sweet* thanks a lot! i know this may be a bit much to ask but could take some pics of the whole instruction booklet? please!!! if you can thanks a bunch. but if not do know of a place where i could find the instructions?

1 ok i thought it might be to much to ask. i will try *vader* 's review. and again thanks for the review *y*

1 than kyou for the review. i don't know if i buy this set now i know there's also a anakin in the at-te with a new jedi, but who knows.

1 wow, i'm surprised no one had done this already. first off, this is a truly lovely set that many people should own, even though it's sold out on the s@h :'-( . now lets start off with an overview. *note*: i was missing a few of the pieces (the rabbit, the trike) when i toke the pics. the figs and a cat. the engine: i really love this thing. it's a beautiful 0-6-0 steam engine with a tender. this is probably the most detailed steam engine lego has given us. i loved it so much, i made a non-holiday version for my town. the flat cars: i like these, but they seem a bit simple. their cargo is good for christmas or a birthday party. the passenger car: it resembles the green passenger car we got a while back, but i like the interior in this one a bit better. the caboose: a simple caboose like the one from 2001. the sad thing about it is thats there is no interior and it's hard to take the roof off. overall: i like this set, but it is kind of hard to use during the non winter months. the price is kind of good, but with that price, it should have came with the motor. i give it a 9/10 happy new year! edited by agentrick57, 04 january 2008 - 12:00 am.

1 thanks for the good review, i wish i had bought one when it was going for only ?24.99 on lsah instead of the usual price of ?50!

1 i was fortunate enough to get one along with the hobby train. they are the first trains i have ever owned (mainly by virtue of them having been half price). it's a fantastic selection of parts with the holiday train, as well as it really looking the part as a set. i'm happy not to get a motor; as i think the 9v setup would prove expensive, and the ir control system for the rc setup seems a bit poor. i got some "dead" track for with it to have just as a push train for now.

-1 nice review, thanks. it still seems overpriced to me though. also, the box shows the droid torsos that are used for "feet" on the spider droid as being light bley, yet they are clearly dark bley. *wacko* tk

0 great review mate as usual, for me the highlight of this set has to be the new spider droid. even though it's made up of some strange parts it really appeals to me, i would love a few of those babys. the hellfire droid is also well put together even if it is a little small, but hey it looks fun. i really like the look of this set but the price tag really puts me off, why oh why did lego price it so high.... :'-(

0 my hailfire droid is gonna be coming in the mail soon, as well as the battlepacks.

1 great review yoda. thanks for sharing. i wasn't real fond of the postal truck at first. it's so different than those in the us. but after seeing your close-up images (esp. the back of the tuck), it looks really neat. i also like the mail box a lot. it looks good in red. too bad for the stickers, but it's still nice. the plane reminds me a lot of the design used in the jurassic park set. as you've said, it's similar to 80s designs. i really like the brick-built design too. it's just real lego - that's about all i can say. very nice sets that are a must together. thanks for the review.

1 i haven't spotted these in the us yet. i'm looking forward to finding them. overall, the 2008 line-up is a excellent and it's going to be difficult for me to decide which themes/sets to pursue. there's a lot to choose from.

1 thanks for the takes on these two sets, yoda. stickers or not, i still think these are charming sets with all the essence and nostalgia of the older sets back in the 80/90's. am i the first one to notice the new doors used in the back of the van. not only is it using the popular new frame, but the old container doors have been redesigned to fit with the new frame as well. pity they're not yellow, though.

1 aww man, is tlc really getting too cheap for printed parts? shame on you tlc!! despite those stickers these are two really neat sets. especially the airplane. classic *wub* reminds me of that little plane my dad bought in an airplane. not sure what's the set nr.. the window at the rear of the van looks like a normal window frame without the clips for the shutters. i never knew those existed 8-? might come handy for ship building. thanks for the review yoda!

1 thank you for the nice review pity of the stickers but the design is nice 80ies on!

1 great review *yoda* (i find myself saying that line alot :-d ) i love these two little sets *wub* tlc continues the great city line that started in 07 and continues into 08 its also nice to have other sub lines besides fire and police :-| :-p i hope there are many more postal sets, like a post office!!that would be sweet! hope these are mainstream and not those damn exclusives >:-( postal on! p

0 i need to do some catching up here :-p matn, on jan 5 2008, 05:16 pm, said: could you tell me how much you payed for them? i think i'm gonna buy them tomorrow if they have it already (or if i don't see any cooler sets). i paid a tad more than the s@h price: i paid 15 for the plane and 8 for the van (sure its a tad more expensive but i didn't want to wait for tru to get them) freddie, on jan 5 2008, 06:10 pm, said: am i the first one to notice the new doors used in the back of the van. not only is it using the popular new frame, but the old container doors have been redesigned to fit with the new frame as well. pity they're not yellow, though. great remark there, i guess i totally missed that one :-$ and i agree that yellow doors would have been better but those dark bley do not look that bad !! mr hobbles, on jan 5 2008, 09:10 pm, said: can you tell me though, the wheels on the van, are they rubber or plastic? they look a bit tacky... rubber off course ;-) they do look a tad tacky but its because they are the thin type (like with the racers) and i am not a fan of those |-/ phoinix, on jan 5 2008, 09:35 pm, said: cant wait for your next one tks ;-) me neither though :-p marvinblue, on jan 6 2008, 03:31 am, said: i reckon lego could enhance this sub-theme by releasing a post motorbike (with or without a sidecar) and post office. obviouly the office would be the hub of all the activity, while the post bike would take care of the postal run. this would free up the van to take or recieve bulk mail or parcels to or from the airport. it could then also do the parcel deliveries around the city. the office would also serve as the reciever for all the parcels the new goods truck might deliver. so true 8-? at one point i was thinking of a impulse set with a yellow bike, postman, post and letters (that would rock !!). i hope tlc adds to this sub theme and keeps that retro feel *wub* a yellow dirtbike with sidecar would be a sweet 5? set !! also a small town feel post office would be so cool: like a 20/30? set ;-) we can be sure of one thing though, this year's advent calendar will have a postamn and small post office ;-) post on !! *yoda*

0 while the plane does look nice, i don't particularly care for the van. but the van does have some good parts, which is the only reason i would by one: yellow mud guards, the new windshield, and the small door on the rear.

-1 well first off, thanks yoda for the great review. :-) hmmm... well, i have to say, i'm not at all impressed with any of these sets. i mean, there nice and all, but the van just seems way to small. it would have been nice if you could fit more than one package in it. i guessi'm one of those that are more of the fan of the 6 wide trucks. and the plane.... hm. this has a "cute" factor and all, but i mean com'on... you have to open a hatch on the roof to get your packages in?? and what about getting them out? you have to flip the plane upside down? :-| weak. they should have had a hinged rear end or a hatch on the side.

0 thebrickster, on jan 5 2008, 10:12 am, said: i wasn't real fond of the postal truck at first. it's so different than those in the us. good point b... this design is just too foreign to my eyes for me to enjoy... i don't like either of these sets, very disapointing - the postal theme has so much potential. i don't really like the torsos either - too plain/cheap as kanal suggested. and i will agree that the wheels on the van look cheap. i was sooooo impressed with city 2007, this is a real let down. though, i am happy to see a small set with a postal box. so, even though, all that aside, i'll probably buy 6 of the van - just for the yellow mudgards, postal box and stickers to populate my city. and i think this set will provide some excellent piece to moc a yellow civillian convertable with *sweet* - bm

1 hey everyone, my first 2008 set is this one, 5613. i thought i'd share a review of it. *sweet* i'd like to say sorry about my photos, they were taken quickly. first, we have the box: it is the smallest lego box i've ever seen, and actually looks cute *wub* it will be heavy competition with playmobil's specials... back of the box, showing an action pose: the contents of the little box, with a very tiny instruction manual *wub* the manual unfolded. notice that every part has its part number beside it :-) the back of the manual, showing some fire sets and the other impulse sets the parts, 30 in total: the small set built. the firefighter has a small fire to extinquish, armed with an axe, chainsaw, other saw and foam... psssh thing x-d . five extra parts in a 30 part set! we get an extra black hatchet, yellow bar tap, light bley 1*1 plate, red 1*1 plate modified with fingers and 2*2 dark bley radar dish. besides the plate, i've never seen these as reserve parts... but i'm not complaining x-d here is a small "alternate" model i created with it: a small bbq... what? he's hungry and he needs to put something on the bbq >:-) x-d overall, you can't go wrong with these impulse sets. i paid 2.89 euros for this little set, so thats a great value! sadly the only impulse avaible were these 3 city sets (no police) and the alien mars mission... looking forward to the knight and magician as well as those indy sets! tt

1 thanks for the review, tanotrooper! this is a nice little set, with 2 axes (*wub* >:-)) and some nice parts. cool alternate model too! x-d tanotrooper, on jan 6 2008, 09:07 am, said: 9.3 cm by 9.3 cm by 4.5 cm x-d tt x-o cute! i can't wait to see these impulse sets in stores. *wub* ~peace

1 beach house reviewed by dunamis set 4996 522 pieces $29.95 from target build time 90 minutes yet another interesting creator theme house. this one comes fresh of the 2008 line of sets and promises 3 different models. packing 522 pieces (albeit a lot of 1x1 plates) for only $29.95 it was hard to pass this one by as i was foraging for the new 2008 star wars sets at the local target. plus, i was itching to do another review since i had finally fully recovered from my marathon ucs falcon review which took the better part a month to complete. the box: the box is pretty standard creator type box which shows off the three models (beach house, caf? and ?towering? apartment building.) the back of the box shows some of the features of the three models. interesting features of the three models prominently displayed on the back include: - food counter complete with coffee (espresso) maker and food warmer (with chicken leg!) - home office complete with laptop (and the ubiquitous coffee cup.) - flip up roof granting access inside of beach house. note the satellite tv dish and even rain gutters along the roofline! opening the box is a matter of breaking two seals. we?re back to the reusable cereal box type tab system that we saw so often in 2007 sets. note the parts inventory is on the side of the box as well. this is a nice feature. once inside the box, we are greeted by eight sealed bags plus two yellow 16x2 plates and a green 32x16 baseplate. thank goodness there is no dss (dreaded sticker sheet) but alas there are no minifigs. in addition, there are the three manuals (one for each model) and they were stuffed into my box with the care of kid trying to put 10 gallons (or liters if you prefer) of candy in a 5 gallon bucket. but hey, we?re not collecting manuals here so who cares if the manuals are all bent and warped? the manuals: the three manuals are 74, 72 and 48 pages in length. they are laid out well and are pretty standard with all the usual trimmings: - piece call outs for each step - parts inventory at the end of the primary model build - page numbers color separation in these manuals were fine for me. plus, we get the usual verbose lego instructions on not dumping all your pieces outside in the grass and not to dump all your pieces into a single pile. thanks for the tip, tlg! parts list the pieces: pretty standard stuff here and as i mentioned, lots of 1x1 plates and tiles (at least 100.) however, we do get quite a few windows and a couple of doors. a majority of the color is black and yellow. i did see a few pieces that i was not familiar with so i?m going to show them below. keep in mind i?m not a parts jockey so bear with me if i think a part is brand new for 2008 and it was actually released with the classic space line. 2x2 window (fixed) and 4x3 window that opens: the follow photo shows the window glass (same as in corner caf?), door glass and new black parts. turns out these black parts are used as wheels. i showed the window glass because it still contains the molding circle just like they did before. it is hard to see from the photo, but it is there. the door glass i think might be new: i don?t recall seeing these 2x2 round plates with clips before and i thought i would show the mail only because it is printed and not a sticker: i know these are common, but didn?t they have four studs on top? these only have two: how about this sloped 4x3 window that opens: overall a nice assortment of parts with nothing juniorized. the build: the build was fun and was fairly straightforward. once you figure out which of the three models to build, it goes pretty quick. here are a few shots: see how the inside is made: look at the detail with the flowers and even the outside water faucet! outdoor seating area: upstairs being built: upstairs with opening roof (notice the satellite tv dish): check out the patio on the upstairs complete with outdoor light and rain gutters! here?s my favorite, the bbq grill. at least we know where those new parts go: finally, check out the tree. no juniorization here! here is what is left over: so far, i have only built the primary model. the others look interesting, especially the caf?. the design: the design was well done. very rich in detail. i love how there are no juniorized parts. the house is accessible by taking off the top floor (like caf? corner and market street). there is an internal staircase as well. there is no interior to speak of in the beach house, but there is in the other two models. the only real negative is that it is kind of small when you get it done. it would be nice if it was about 50% bigger. here are a few views of the beach house with a few minifigs thrown in: check out the close-up of the caf? which i think looks great: also, here is a photo of the interior of the apartment building where you can see the office and computer: overall thoughts: it is a really nice set. a tad on the small side but it has some great detail and lots of features. quick enough to build all three models and would fit real nice into an existing town plan. is minifig scale, but does not come with any. lots of window parts and black slopes. is a nice diversion from the onslaught of clone wars ships that we can?t remember seeing from the movies. final rating: 84% build 9/10 (pretty quick and fun.) functionality 9/10 (it is a creator set so you have multiple varied builds. diverse enough to keep the kids entertained.) design 10/10 (excellent and well thought out. outstanding detail for such a small model.) parts 6/10 (fair, nothing earth-shattering but lots of slopes and windows.) price 8/10 (price ratio is good but you get a lot of little parts. would be better with minifigs.) edited by whitefang, 23 may 2009 - 06:38 pm. indexed

0 i didn't know that the other models in this set came with interiors. this changes everything!

1 takuto20, on mar 22 2008, 04:54 am, said: hey, yesterday i got around to mod my beachhouse too! i bought two boxes so i could have enough material for an extra floor and then i also added a kitchen, a vine in the backyard, storage for the upper floor... try to spot the humongous flatscreen tv! http://www.brickshel...96/cimg2656.jpg very nice... i guess i should buy a second one too.... *y*

-1 a big thumbs down for me. this doesn't look like lego at all :-| *n* *n* *n* *n* *n* out of *n* *n* *n* *n* *n*

-1 i have the big passenger plane so i'll be passing on this one. one big juniorised plane is enough for me! if i didn't have the passenger plane though i'd rather get the cargo plane. there's enough police in my city as it is!

-1 thanks for the review! *sweet* i am stunned at the lack of an interior... not that it makes much difference as i wasn't likely to want this set anyway as i own the passenger plane from last year. sorry to steal your image, but i just had to post this! :-p

0 thks for this caustic review :-d i'll wait for the parts on bricklink. i think you're a bit unfair with this small oversized submarine - oups sorry, i mean plane. here are some advantages i tried to imagine : 1. that's the first submarine with a plane nose, 2. that's the first unprinted nose, 3. that's the first shark that make me laugh, and which has a plain white fin 4. and at last, you should have notice that that the first submarine with a wing made of several plates it is said that this set has more than 200 parts... hide and seek ! x-d you may have lost several bags i'm eager that people buy this set a lot : i'd like to buy a lot of these new white 4x4x2 curved slope for my mocs. can you take a picture of the plane crashing in the sink ? is it fire proof ? i think that will be too easy this year to decide what is the crap of year ...

-1 i have to agree with almost all of the replies here that this set is the most ugliest looking lego set i have ever seen. if i have never seen this set, and ppl showed it to me, i would have thought it would be some little kid's moc or something (no offence!) huge juniorized pieces, bad color theme (i would say it would look better if the wing is white), no interior and huge dss! i will avoid this set like the plague. i own the entire city line (except for the airport) and planning to get all the city stuff that lego releases. but, this set will ruin my plans coz i will avoid it... unless someone gives it to me for free. haha *wacko* boo lego boo! :-x

-1 this still looks like a cool set but the price not so much. do all lego police set come with the polizei option or just ones from europe i have not bought a police set in years. edited by legoman132, 11 september 2008 - 05:30 pm.

1 legoman132, on sep 11 2008, 06:26 pm, said: this still looks like a cool set but the price not so much. the price is now 20 in ireland on s@h, which is reasonable considering the large fuselage pieces. has anyone modded this set to make a reasonable looking plane? i am thinking of buy it to do so, but i don't want to take a risk and end up with lots of useless pieces. aswell as -20.

1 hello and welcome to another redman set review! well, actually, the first redman set review! i'm your host, redman, and today i adorn my medieval outfit to tell you about the impulse set simply titled "the knight". this is a great set, with 14 pieces, 2 of which are spare, and a minifig with 2 weapons, 2 helmets, and some shiny armour. all this is packaged in a tiny box, just short of 10 cm? (or 3? inches?), with a neat little instruction manual that folds up to the size of the weapons rack included in the set. as you can see, this set only costs a measly 7 nzd. (disclaimer: redman not included.) here we see the box, clearly showing what the box holds. on the top we see a 1:1 scale picture of a minifig, for those new to lego, or who have forgotten how big a minifig is i guess. :-/ x-d the instruction manual, showing the nice and easy built, with me for size comparison. :-d (*sorry about the dark image, i had to lean over the light to get a birds eye pic. ;-)*) here we see the 2 different soldiers you can make with the set; a knight, and a guard or standard troop or soldier or whatever you want to call him... (note, each set comes with only 1 minifigure, and additional accessories.) of course you know i'm in the picture just for the sake of it, i'm not really one of the soldiers. x-d the neat little weapons rack, or rather equipment rack, as it holds not only a weapon but a shield (except the ovoid ones), helmet, and armour. nice and easy storage, so your equipment won't get dirty lying around on the ground. :-d one of the spare parts is another of those robot hands, so you can stick that in place of the shield and allow the rack to hold 2 weapons. just thought you'd like to know that. :-$ and here we see the nifty little structure of the thing. it can even support a whole minifig! note the grey stud on the bottom bar is a spare part, i just find it better used there to hold the armour. :-) huh? i don't remember this picture... 8-| it appears i drifted off, and these guys don't look too happy i overtook their weapons equipment rack. :-$ i should go... x-d so, in conclusion this is a great set for army building, at a reasonable price, with nice equipment, and it can be picked up as a little extra with your normal shopping. x-d that's all for today folks! *sweet* [/redman] so, what do you think? should i continue with these redman reviews ? (:-p), or just stop now? x-d comments and criticism welcome! :-$ ~peace

1 thanks for that vader, i love this helmet *wub* it will certainly work great as an asian dynasty war helm i reckon. thanks again. batbrick is back! >:-)

1 thank you for the review, vader! that set looks worth buying! 8-? i think you gave me a good reason to buy it... ;-)

-1 mr tiber, on jan 19 2008, 11:16 pm, said: a troll driven by a turkey leg, what a wonderful little detail!!! :-d :-d thanks for the review vader. very clever, using a flag to hide that crazy firing device. i find it rather odd they used blue pins for this. black or gray would've been alot more discrete. about the big trolls, i think using different colours is good. i don't think a troll force would be very organized, so different colours would make the effect complete *y* . as for your troops, looks quite fearsome! definitely compared to my pathetic number of soldiers.. :-$ a nice set, but i would rather get the attack on tower though.. no matter about the price difference. oh don't get me wrong i love the dark tan troll, i just prefer the sand green one. your right about trolls not being organized, and i like to think that the trolls are from different areas etc.

0 thefrisian, on jan 20 2008, 03:04 pm, said: am i the only one who thinks this helmet looks a bit like the juggernaut from x-men? now you menton it i think you are right, that really would work well as a film version *y*

0 xwingyoda, on jan 22 2008, 04:26 pm, said: tks for the review mate ;-) now i have to bloody wait long because lego france has this line available in freaking march >:-( pissed *yoda* on !! :-d i love the "new" goblin :-p that helmet is really cool. why on earth tlc didn't include that one in the dwarf mine ? such another idiotic move |-/ anyone keeping track of tlc's stupidity lately ? that would be interesting !! i clearly want a huge goblin army now hehe !! and i totally agree with you mate, the troll lokks better in sand green. the cart itself is pretty lame imo - just a sordid excuse to include yet another annoying shooting crappy device. but for a 21? set its okie i say ;-) need my bad guys on !! *yoda* i believe there is a topic around here somewhere based on bad lego ideas. after getting this new helmet i really wish lego had included it with the mining set, it's bloody annoying having to buy yet more of them from bl :'-( the shooting bit is better than some sets that have had one, at least this one is smartly done and of course it can also be hidden.

1 lego city truck & forklift set # 7733 pieces: 343 price: $24.99 (usd) store of purchase: toys r'us release date: january 2008 after discussion of the mysterious yellow cargo contained in this new city transport set and a visit to my local tru, i purchased this set. i was immediately pleased with the price/piece which i think is pretty reasonable (343 pieces for $25). starting with the box, great city artwork boasting "special edition": tha backside of the box (no alternate models comes as no surprise): the dreaded decals (i was looking for the skull and bones for radioactive, but no such luck): my favorite part of the set, a very clever forklift: side view: and the backside: what i like about the forklift is the bars across the top giving the vehicle a "real-life" design. the double wheels in the front with two pieces that can hold the wheels also adds to a clever design: i like the figs (although not much new - perhaps i'll make the driver into a werewolf later): the set includes three cargo pallets, the first some sort of fuel with gauge: the 2nd, two indy containers, and a square 2x4 brick (i have not put the decals on yet): and the mysterious yellow cargo. your guess is as good as mine :-$ . on to the truck, the front section: the front grill: another angle: the back: i like the opening mechanism that is very simple, but works well. also is the large plate tile piece inside. i like this because the entire interior has no studs: and the trailer section of the truck: orange and yellow tail lights: and the rear trailer open: the complete set: summary: this is a neat set that reminds me a bit of classic lego city (but larger). it is very playable and has a lot of accessories adding to the value. the build was very simple, and enjoyable (took me about an hour). it is a great addition to a number of city sets including the cargo ship, container stacker, the world city cargo train, and the new cargo plane. as i mentioned previously, i have not yet put on the decals that i'm sure will really add to the overall look of the set. the forklift is awesome and i like the cargo containers. the truck could have benefited from a few additional details (chrome smokers, and an undercarriage box that really opens). considering everything, i would buy this set again. hope you enjoy and perhaps this mysterious cargo will make its way into a brickster mystery. *y*

0 question: what's different with this "special edition"? btw, nice shots!

0 adik_sa_lego, on jan 18 2008, 11:57 pm, said: question: what's different with this "special edition"? btw, nice shots! im guessing the main difference is the fact that the box says special edition.

0 general kannon, on jan 19 2008, 05:10 am, said: im guessing the main difference is the fact that the box says special edition. it's either that or it's a toysrus exclusive set, as my armoured drilling unit box also had special edition on it.

1 wow, 8-? great review. *y* i usually don't buy city sets but i think i might get this one just for that awsome forklift! *wub* general tarful

0 mr tiber, on jan 19 2008, 10:26 am, said: hmmm, put it in my pirate port and use it to carry rum! perhaps that's the mysterious cargo. mr. tiber replaced the petro with rum... :-d

0 holodoc, on jan 19 2008, 11:10 am, said: although i really like this set i?m sooo disappointed about the big "on the cabin" brick :-x , that i probably won?t buy it. it's really not bad. it is big, but not a show stopper for me.

0 some guy, on jan 19 2008, 11:17 pm, said: i think the special edition is just for making people intrested and make them want to buy that set or something. hmm, that's a thought, but why would they pick this particular set? i would expect they'd do that with a slightly bigger set, like the heavy hauler perhaps. why do you think they'de pick this one?

1 this set looks pretty good to me, it is six wide isn't it? that is nice for a truck like this

-1 highlandcattle, on jan 20 2008, 09:15 am, said: this set looks pretty good to me, it is six wide isn't it? that is nice for a truck like this yes, 6-wide. the only problem with these big trucks is how they look on the city roadplates (i've always thought too big), compared to classic city trucks. getting off topic, i'd like to see lego make a car transport truck. i don't think i've ever seen one in lego. it would definately have to be 6-wide, or even larger.

0 5150 lego, on jan 20 2008, 11:50 am, said: great review! my only grip with this set is you can only fit one pallet in the truck. it should have been the same size as the trailer so you can at least fit 2 pallets. seems like alotof wasted space. if i'm going to transport cargo, i want to use the maximum amount of space aviable!! x-d that's a fair gripe. someone else mentioned it above as well. i thought the same thing when i went to load it.

0 tinypiesrus, on jan 20 2008, 05:05 pm, said: nice review, your camera is much better now. i look forward to more of your reviews :-) i just went to toyworld today and got a wizard and 4 knights :-) and on top of that, they were having a 20% off sale *sweet* i might go back and get some more tommorrow. thanks! 20% off, what a bonus! if only toyworld's sales were nation-wide. :-d i wish i were in wellington, the guy at the toyworld their is really cool, and into lego to! the guy at the martin's toyworld here in rotorua is quite professional, too much so for a toy shop. still, he tells me when they get stock in. anyway, i'm getting off topic in my own thread! x-d ~peace

1 thanks for the review of this nice little set. for it's price (3 euros here in holland) it contains quite a lot of useful parts. the only thing that could have been better in my opinion is the wand, i always liked this one:

1 well, since no-one seems to have done one for this set, here we go.... here's the complete set in all its glory. yes, i really like it, but then, tabletown has the capacity to support it and my green army have their eyes on it as a potential military transport as well. :-) i'll start out with the little airport ground car thingy - very neat and functional, here are views front and back: next up, the steps which allow the plane crew to embark and disembark: and to round off this little trio, the cargo loading platform, here in its lowered position. note the prong thingy sticking out from the rear: and here raised. the prong thingy is now hinged up to support the back of the platform and keep it level: here's a slightly different angle so you can see the pieces under there: the all-important cargo itself! hmmm...not much for a plane this size... the cargo pallet slots neatly onto the loading platform: here's the complete set of ground equipment - all attached: and so onto the plane itself. note that unlike the other large planes, the main wing sits at the top of the row of bricks making up the side of the fuselage: i took it apart a little so you can see the internal construction of the fuselage. note that the cargo area is really small, right at the back. what else is this thing carrying? illegal immigrants? :-) a picture of the rear of the fuselage, just because i like the sticker: front landing gear. way better than on the other large planes. i don't know if this is a new piece or what but i've had no problems with it at all, and my kids have been playing with it as well: the rather sexy rear undercarriage - this area reminds me of one of those giant russian transport planes - wicked: those angled grey slopes atop each side of the rear undercarriage annoy the heck out of me as they keep coming off whenever i pick the plane up. i think a 1x4 plate on top to bind them together might solve that. a slightly blurry view (sorry) from underneath. the gear looks like it might be capable of retracting internally, but alas, no. this is a shame as there's certainly enough room in there and it's a wasted opportunity imo. might have to modify that... a view of one of the four engines, i personally think they look too small and should have something under the wing as well to make them rounder: cockpit: crew door, open. i love the smooth action of these doors and the way they seal flush against the fuselage when closed: cargo door, open: crew door with docked ladder: cargo door with docked loading platform: cargo slots inside and locks into place the same way it sits on the loader, neat: the minifigs, sorry this one is a bit blurry: and that concludes this week's "show and tell". dr. s.

1 thanks dr.s for this great review, this is your what, second one? anyway, this aint half bad, i actually kind of like the bigger planes despite the annoying big pieces, and this one looks to be the best yet. batbrick away! >:-)

1 i do admit the amount of cargo is rediculously small, but it still looks good. say, how much can the plane hold? thanks for the review! *sweet*

1 wow, that's a great review of a great set dr s! *y* as you yourself have already noted, this has the potential to be a fantastic military moc! with a bit of modification you can get the engines to be rounder, or perhaps do away with them completely and replace them with jet engines. *sweet* though i can't think of a system to retract the undercarriage at the top of my head it seems like there's indeeed more than enough potential to do so. it reminds me rather of an ilyushin il-76, one of my favourite cargo planes. :'-)

1 tks drs for your cool review !! i admit tht this plane is way better than i imagined ;-) even if i still dislike the new hull, the engines and landing gear are really improved and the way to operate the crates work really well !! tks for sharing these pics ;-) *yoda*

0 nice review, dr. s! i have been thinking long and hard about the scale of the planes in my town. i would like to keep my passenger planes in their classic 4-wide fuselage style, but i really don't mind the new plane hull pieces if they are used as an enormous transport plane like the ilyushin-76. unfortunately i can't afford this lovely new green one at the moment (which would be perfect to go with my green army) as i took too much of a hit buying the new 2008 star wars sets! but i have modified my white one to take huge cargo loads, in fact my apc is designed specifically to fit inside. unfortunately i'm a bit busy to take pics at the moment, but hope to put some up soon.

1 dr. s: i was not planning on buying this set after my disappointment with the other large airplane, but after looking at this image review, i just might buy. the green color is really the aspect that makes this airplane stand out. i think it looks great! thanks for the review.

0 if i do end up geting this set it will be for my slowly growing army. btw nice review *y*

-1 thank for the review doc! the only thing i like in this set is the small car. so i will not buy this set just for it! i really dislike those new planes, toooo bbiiiigggg! with this size, this cargo plane can carry just fiew things! what a shame! i think that the way tlc has made the wings is not very good... like the rest of those big pieces... just my thought. the positif point of this it's that it makes me saved some money :-d

0 at my local wal*mart there was most of the 2008 sets including the indiana jones ones :'-) i picked up this one and the motorcycle chase! name: 7621 lost tomb price: $20.00 parts: 277 figs: 3 *box art first off we have the great indiana jones box art!! i must say the designers did an excellent job on it! i love the little temple design with skulls! as well as including indy in the right hand corner. the back of the box is just as cool showing all the neat play features of the set as well as an advertisement for the indiana jones game *figs first off we have our hero, indian............. what the hell? why is there a freaking cw anakin head on indy!! there was a production slip up as instead of indy's head i get anakin's! :-| |-/ i open the box up and there staring me in the face is his ugly face!! tlc is defiantly doing to here a gnarly complaint from me!! >:-( ok now here we have the " real" indy fig that is supposed to come with the set :-d i just noticed that his fedora hat goes down in the back! bonus picture time, here is a jacketless indy with his sleeve torn off, like he looks in the temple of doom *sweet* the next figure up is our lovely marion *wub* *wub* *wub* plus her head is reversible with a scared face x-d love the new hairpiece in black!! finally we have our undead skellie with second style head and poseable arms *the well of souls the set itself is a nice model and playset! the anubis statues are very cool and i love all the hieroglyphs on the walls 8-? here is the sw link with artoo and 3p0 x-d the ark in its resting place the ark removed, its very cool indeed, but tlc should have made the whole thing in chrome gold |-/ not metallic gold with brown and yellow!! the closeup of the anubis statue, yes the eye is a sticker but at leasts a gold color! *playability first off you can pull the pin on the anubis statues which send them falling and taking out the walls. behind the wall a skellie swings out! there is a lever in the back of the model where you push down and the snakes shower down upon the figs hehe with the snakes all around, marion is both modeling with the new carrot torch and fending off viscous cobras :-d in the meantime indy uses his whip to scale the wall and avoid all the snakes which he is afriad of. in the meantime leaving marion behind to fight them off. :-p the whip is bendable but it will always snap back into a coil, its some type of bendy hard plastic *scoring figs- 9/10 model- 8/10 playability- 8.5/10 overall satisfaction- 4/10 (would be 9/10 if it wasn't for the stupid anakin head error!) in the end this is a charming set and could easily fit in with the adventurers! it has the cool anubis statues as well as the ark. plus indy, marion and a skellie, great selection of figs but sallah would have been better since he actually removes the ark with indy however i am still wondering the point of the anubis statues, this set does seem pretty silly :-p p

1 thank you for this review! it is a brilliant set! i am definitely getting this set once indy is released in new zealand hurry up tlc! >:-( ps:could i have pic of what indy looks like with an old classic whip?

1 thanks for a nice review, piranha. *y* a lovely playset, with a classical egyptian adventurers touch. although i?m not completely sure for the robot arms for the statues.... somehow, a little more details could?ve worked well for that set.... 8-|

0 wow i can't believe other people have had this same head error mistake! x-o i thought it was one of those extreme cases of production slip up! the good thing is i will get a replacement indy head, and get to keep that anakin head!! i forgot to mention that my set was also missing 1 black ear piece for the anubis statues there also are extra stickers for my set, i can't figure out what they are for though? hehe, i too like my tod indy fig 8-| :-d p

1 dammit indy, you weren't supposed to open the ark!!! i really like this set, i only brought it for marion but its a nice set and fun to build.

0 i like the new station but the truck is a good question. i still like the classic 1994 one and the 1980's can that was one of the first units i got

0 it looks to me that the little building is supposed to be like some sort of customs checkpoint between one nation and another or like a toll facility on a highway. i like the little checkpoint but i think that should be part of a separate set and 7743 just having the police mobile command center truck.

1 great review, batbrick! iamded got what he deserved. x-d

1 i am definitely getting this set. thanks for the nice review!

1 howdy how , my batman fellows! today i was in a toy mart - and i was looking for a sw set - but all were that expensive! then i saw this batman set ! for -> 13 ? yea ! 13 euros! :-p i had to pick it up! as i came home i started building! figs: i really like them both cause they are new to me ! the green dude x-d looks cool! batman is also very cool! building it : first there was this speeder boat from this green dude :-p , it looks really cool and these shark eyes ( or what are that) look also really nice! then there came batmans speeder boat - its a nice little ship! then the boat : its really cool the simple makes it that good ! at the end i got that : ranking : figs 10/10 parts : 8 /10 playablity :8/10 price 10/10 -> 13 euros there .. thats a good price! overall ranking of aayla : i think i got batman feever - am guessing wich set i pick up at next .. any ideas wich is good - or wich you can say me .. was good is good?! batman collection deffinitly on!!! aayla

1 hi! asuka, on feb 18 2008, 09:25 pm, said: congrats to that nice review.... i like the batcave set, you should also been able to find it at discount.... try epay. i found it there for 38 euro (and picked up two of them). nice price for loads of nifty material.

0 first i'll comment on the review and at a later date i'll comment on the set. you've done a top job lord of pies *y* you've captured the set from a variety of angles and posed the mini-figures interestingly.

1 great little set! i bought this set only a few years ago misb and i am still very happy about it. the hut is simple but very effective as a castaway building on some deserted island, the palmleaves are a good addition to any lego collection. this set had a nice amount of weapons, two for each pirate and two of those weapons are flintlock muskets as opposed to just pistols. nice poll as well, but you made sure nobody can give this set a 1 which is very nice (but probably a little mistake :-d ). i gave it the top-rating. *y*

1 another first-rate review! it's a nice little set with a big number of minifigs. and 2 flintlock guns is also a nice bonus.

0 a nice review and a nice little set for anyone's pirate collection. a 5/5 for the review.

0 well since this topic has resurfaced, i would add my 2 cents about my appreciation of this set. it was the first and (unfortunately) the largest pirate set i owned as a kid, but i played the wazoo out of it. some of the minifigs have lost almost all their face printing after so many play sessions! theres just something about the hut that appealed to me more than the cheesy skull-face islands we keep getting.probably that it wa kind of neutral, good for my pirates, settlers or islanders. though the palm leaves were rather fragile and used to break off the studded parts. it would be nice to get more of these "beach village army builder" sets. edited by ardelon, 21 september 2014 - 03:40 pm.

1 tks for that nice review, brainbox! i recieved the construction diggers set like this last year. gee what a nice parts pack. i like that orange lidded set, the truck. so nice. i won't get it though.

0 thanks for that very fine review, brainbox! *y* lovely little creator goodies, with very neat alternative models as well. :'-)

1 thanks for these great reviews brainbox, i never expected you to do a review for some reason. i love these mini sets, the train in particular is great. i won't get any though, those indy sets are coming in fast and i'm gonna need all the money i can muster. still they are nifty little sets. batbrick away! >:-)

0 mmmmh, i *wub* love the train... great review. it looks like each model can be connected to the other to make a complete train. *y* *y* it makes me want to get 3 of them (or more) to make a long one. :-d

1 so here it is finally, my first ever review of a lego set..oh wait, it's actually 2 sets. so i don't really know how to do it right, but i'll try the best. (sorry if some pictures are a litte bit dark, but i'm not really into photography and i got bad light here) let's start with the dwarf's mine defender: theme: castle 2008 set name: dwarf's mine defender number: 7040 pieces: 86 price: ?9,99 (eur) first, as always, the box: the back, a few instructions on how the defender works, for those how don't know ;-) : and the instructions: we continue with the minifigs, sorry i forgot to make a closeup of the dwarf: and finally the mine defender itself, i personally think it isn't as bad as maybe some people think. the chain for the catapult is great i think: i kinda love those controls, the mechanism with the rubbe rband actually works pretty well, but only on a not-glossy underground. that's pretty much all of it, it's small but i like it a lot. so let's go on to the tower raid now, which would be my absolute favorite of those new sets. -------------------------------------- theme: castle 2008 set name: tower raid number: 7037 pieces: 364 price: ?29,99 (eur) again, first the box & instructions: we got 2 sets of instructios here, one for the tower and one for the siege tower: the minifigs, we got one archer and one soldier here, both with the torsos of the 2007 sets: now thw orc side, starting with the great leader, with the new armor and the golden helmet (i love those pieces!): closeup of the armor & helmet: then we got another orc-knight: and the prisoner, with handcuffs! the crownie tower looks great overall, though there is something i don't really like about it, but later on that. now the back, and that is what really bothers me, there areno walls on the first floor except the one with the wall-piece and the door, and theprison also is open at the back. the orc easily could jump out there: not sure what these are all about, they really don't add much to the set: enough rant now, let's go on with a pretty sweet detail, the golden crystal on the little table: the wall piece on the first floor you can ram in: and finally the very best thing of this set, the amazing orc siege tower! from the front: the great working ram, you can pull it back very far and it got pretty much power: here we got another sweet detail, the siege "platform" that moves out by pulling a cord in the back of the tower: finally a picture of a bit siege action: if you ram in the lower wallpiece, the brown shelfs of the prison-floor collapse and the prisoned orc is finally free! summary: likes: as i mentioned before, i really think that's the best ever produced siege tower, it's got so mich details and works extremely well, also the overall look of it is magnificant. the destroy-mechanism of the tower is pretty cool too, the brown door is a fine detail too. nothing much to say about the mine defender, i like this little set, and there's nothing really to bother about it. dislikes: the back of the tower. that's really the only thing that's a bit bad imo, they could have put there 2 more walls on the first floor and something to lock the prison easily. final thought: the tower raid for me personally is the best of the 2008 sets so far, it's got great playability and looks simply good. my opinion: buy it!

1 tks for these cool reviews metalandi !! i love these orc sets !! i am so going to get these ;-) i'm happy to see that scared face again (i love it really !!) and the use of that handculfs !! that new armour looks really cool that tower is really nice and i wont mod it that much which os cool and the battle ram is freaking sweet !! tks again for sharing ;-) *yoda*

0 tks for those so much!! :'-) *y* nice reviews! i love that tower raid, and the defender, and will buy them both. quote really don't add much to the set: oh, but they do. more pieces= higher price. ;-)

0 thanks for these fantastic review. it's the first time i take a good look at these sets. there is a good chance i'll buy the dwarf's mine defender, especially for that price.

1 cheers for the reviews. they're both nice sets, and i think i just may have to buy both. or maybe i'll get two of the dwarf set? the figs in each are really cool as well. the dwarf, well, they're just cool anyway, but the troll with the golden helmet and armour, that's just *wub*

1 thanks for these great reviews! *sweet* the dwarfs mine defender looks interesting, the figs though are *wub* the only thing missing is a weapon for the dwarf and some shields the battering ram and tower are awesome! 8-? the troll king with new torso, helmet, and body armor is simply amazing i like how the troll is handcuffed :-d the tower shows nice detail except for the poor "brig" . i love that gold crystal! the battering ram is a thing of beauty! $30 for the tower and ram and $10 for the defender are very well priced! i still want the battle wheel more though! damn exclusives! :'-( >:-( p

1 thanks for the review, i personally think the siege tower is probably the best one which lego has ever produced.

-1 xwingyoda, on mar 1 2008, 06:32 am, said: its still looks good but the crappy rubber band system is really not well thought off. *yoda* i totally agreed with your comments. the rubber system is not effective at all. i bought 2 defenders recently and i found out that when the wheels move, the rubber just stuck there without rotating the blades at the front :-/ i have not really found a solution for mine yet. so far, i only took out the rubber band, placing the blades on the ground, removing of the red technic part on the left side. in this way, when the defender is moving on smooth ground, the blades will move too ;-)

1 hello eurobricks! my first post yesterday i will buy this two sets! i'm waiting for the packs! sorry but my english isn't good

1 damn you to hell dunamis >:-( now tks to you i really want the 3 sets put together x-d wow that is what i call a sweet review 8-? tks for taking the time to make once again such a fantastic one ;-) the overall look of the building is brilliant and i love the nice additions they did: the cheese and mouse (jerry :-d ) is hilarious !! i didn't know green grocer had a rodent infestation !! and the use of the new built furniture and detils like the radiator is freaking awsome !! also that set has a definite plus for me: its the back details !! i love the stairs, the deck with table !! wowx that is what i call sweet backdoor details !! now its clear that i will need to buy the 3 sets asap !! tks once again dunamis ;-) *yoda*

1 what a beautiful set, tlc give the designer a pay rise immedietly. i was lucky to order one of these while they were on sale to us aussies ;-) but dont worry lego the $100 you saved me will be spent on more sets like this. carn't wait to watch my kids rescue residents in distress from those upper level windows with the fire fighters.

1 great review, great set. i can't mine until after easter. *weeps*.

1 wow,, thanks for the nice review! i have the other 2 sets and waiting for this to come to our shores. stupendous design and details! i really like the "hammer-rails" on the roof. cant wait!!! *wub*

1 o. m. g. i must have that set!! :'-) *y* *wub* i remember you telling me that you were going to do a review of this set, and i was so anxious! i love these reviews! thanks so much! great pictures. *wub* *y* *y* this will dent my wallet. 8-| i am so envious!

0 afol sf, on mar 8 2008, 06:29 pm, said: a very informative review, indeed. thank you so much for doing so. now i know that the price is worth every penny leaving my pocket. ;-) what do you guys think is tlc putting up as the next modular set? is it asking too much of tlc to produce 1 modular set each quarter (4 times a year)? i would vote for a bank next.

1 great pictures, especially the perspective from overhead. this is one of my favorite technic models because it packs so many features in a relatively small space. and i'm working on documenting this one in technicopedia right now! thanks for the photos, eric

1 thank you very much for that review!

1 i bought it some years ago for the b-model, and like it so much :d

0 this was my first pneumatic set

-1 the only original stickers are the front headlight-patterns on the 2 red 1x2 bricks. the others have been destroyed - must have been the bad decaying sticker quality that breaks when you'll remove it - so i printed them. i didn't print the flag for only the alternate model needs it, although it's a neat idea...! and lordgalewind: clickey! i keep that in mind. one of my 8880 is already dusty enough!

0 hmm, seems like the wheels are recycled into the harley truck in the 2008 batman set!

1 natelite, on mar 10 2008, 05:57 pm, said: hmm, seems like the wheels are recycled into the harley truck in the 2008 batman set! nope. the harley-truck-wheels are thinner and somewhat more modern. i do believe they're the same like in 8274. aaaaaaaand: for a long time in my life these wheels have been the best and coolest looking i've ever had! so where's your deference? :-d recycled... |-/ x-d

-1 i've seen a few cases like this where the box pictures are slightly different from the actual model. the airtech claw rig compressor is another one that comes to mind. the changes sometimes seem pointless and make you wonder why they bothered. :-p quote the only original stickers are the front headlight-patterns on the 2 red 1x2 bricks. the others have been destroyed - must have been the bad decaying sticker quality that breaks when you'll remove it - so i printed them. i didn't print the flag for only the alternate model needs it, although it's a neat idea...! the other stickers on mine have held up pretty well, although i didn't try to remove them after i put them on. the flag started to break after a year or so and just fell off its axle at one point. i taped over it and it's holding up well now, although it's a little frayed along one edge. this is actually the earliest set i've seen that uses this crappy sticker material (which is unfortunately very common today). even other technic sets had good stickers for many years after that.

1 wow, that first picture is great! you must have a very wide angle lens with the capability to focus very close (macro). the perspective makes the model look huge. nice work. i think the suspension on this set is my favorite of all technic. it has such large travel and is so.... what word should i use..... "bouncy". hey, why do you only review sets which are red? :-d eric

0 blakbird, on mar 10 2008, 09:35 pm, said: hey, why do you only review sets which are red? :-d i exactly thought that today as i made the pics for my signature...! x-d at my school leaving examination i made a model in blender3d and explained to the board of examiners how to build a car and how to animate it. it needed a color, so i took red "because all beautiful and fast cars are red..." my physics teacher contradicted. :-)

1 i can remember that i've seen a few color variations on brickshelf and on ebay (they sold well). it's new and familiar at the same time. that makes it more interesting!

1 reread your review today! great pictures! this is a fabulous model. got this model a few months ago for just  25! it is small and has great working parts. i love the way the front-suspension is made! epic! i only had the light-stickers replaced with trans-clear bricks. btw: the gear rack has been used in this years 8048 buggy!

1 i also happened to receive this set this weekend, virtually misb (the seals on the side of the box were loose, however everything inside was untouched). this little beast a joy to build and even more so to play with! as indicated by eric on the technicopedia page, it's crammed with functions for a medium-sized set. i think i love it even more than my son does

1 i read blackbirds technopedia page on this truck the other week, went onto ebay and picked up a misb copy for 25 gbp bargin, great to get old sets unopened, peeling the plastic off of the specialist parts was always cool! love the front suspension

1 hello, my dear friends! here's something new. i am actually making a review with pictures! yes, i got a new camera for christmas. now i was testing to see how the camera would reflect, so some of the pics are a bit blurry. i have based this review from dunamis's reviews. he is my inspiration.so, without further ado, i bring you the review! set #: 7693 name: etx alien strike price: $19.99, ?12,99 pieces: 246 box: okay, so as you can see below, the box is pretty simple. as always, european versions won't have the piece count, name, etc, just the number i believe. mine, having the american version, has the info on it. as you can see, it has the classic mm logo, and the red planet, as well as the set in a pose itself. very nice. i linked it because the pic wasn't resizing. http://www.brickshel...ke/dscn0017.jpg below is the back of the box. it shows the other sets and some features of this set. contents: next we have the contents. this set includes a medium sized dss (xwingyoda), a bag labeled one, and huge bag labeled two, the 1 bag contains a smaller bag, and the two bag includes two smaller bags. 5 bags in all. also pictured are the instructions. i have linked it due to the non-resize. http://www.brickshel...ke/dscn0019.jpg figs: included in this set are three figs. two jellies, and 1 astro. the jeelies are fine, but i pefer the lom ones. but they glow. those new alien commanders for summer look promising though. the astro is nice, and includes an extra gold visor. moc on! astro miner: in all mm sets there is a human and alien set. the astro par of this set is a mini-miner. here is a pic of construction and that wonderful space logo sticker. not much of a cockpit. :-/ finished miner(the set number, too): overall i like the miner, and it is nicely designed. i feel the cockpit is lacking though. aliens: the alien vehical is the main part of the set. this pic shows the beginning steps. solid and sturdy. but those four axles/pin parts(blue) are pointless. no support, and they don't get used at all. nice tlc. :-| now we get cooking! this pic shows the tail added on and the more bulk being built. we get a little repetitive and build the craft up in this pic. and this pic from the instructions shows how the alien craft transforms for battle. the completed set and extra bits. parts: 8/10 figs 8/10 price per piece ration: 9/10 playability: 9/10 overall: 85% the alien craft is great. the attack feature is nice and there are a ton of trans green parts. the alien falls out of the cockpit when turned upside down. i love this set, and it's perfect for mm fans or beginners.it has nice parts, and read the above part for more details. gallery when moderated. keep an eye out for future reviews! please comment. :-)

1 thanks for the great review vbbn! *y* i already own 2 of these x-d on your camera there should be a little flower sign, switch to that to go to micro mode ;-) it's a really good first review *y* *sweet*

1 a great review for a great set. *sweet* i too own it and it's still in one piece. ;-) kliq, on mar 13 2008, 05:20 am, said: the only negative for me is the cockpit of the mining unit. not really because it isn't detailed, but because mine is top heavy, and keeps falling forward. it's kinda funny if you think about him driving along and then falling forward...but not funny at all when you're playing. |-/ may i suggest this mod?: http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=2848762

1 bernddasbrot, on mar 21 2008, 07:07 am, said: hi! this is my forth (old-school) technic set review! since blakbird pointed out that all my technic reviews are red, i chose a yellow dune blaster for today! this is my second 8829 and i also noticed that the engine turns very hard. the alternate model is really (sorry to all those of you who like it) crappy. i mean- a nice idea, but not with this wheels! :-| anyway: a really beautiful technic-set! *reminiscing* (this word exists, does it?) thanks for viewing the pictures, i hope you enjoyed it! please comment if you want to! a great set review, as always. nice try making a review of a set that was not red. it almost worked! maybe next time. *sweet* one thing i noticed is that a bunch of your pictures are missing the beam that goes over the left hand wheel as a fender. like this picture: what kind of camera do you use? the pictures have very good depth of field, meaning that both the foreground and the background are in good focus. this is usually hard to do without a very small aperture. yes, "reminiscing" is a word. it means to fondly remember the past. i also noticed that the engine was sticky. set 8408 has the same problem. it took me forever to figure out what the problem was. if you take the engine out of the model, it turns nice and smooth. then when you put it back in, it works terrible. it turns out the key is that, in the back, there is an 8 tooth spur gear and a 24 tooth crown gear used as a spur. if you look at technica, you will see that there are two different crown gears. one of them works well mated with an 8 tooth on parallel axles, and the other one doesn't. the difference is only supposed to be longer teeth, so it really should not matter, but it does. if your set works bad, try switching the crown gear to one of the other variety. worked for me. eric

1 blakbird, on mar 22 2008, 03:56 pm, said: imho, 8829 is much better than 8296. first, 8829 is a lot bigger. i really like the huge rear balloon tires. they both have rack and pinion steering, and they both have trailing arm rear suspension with a v-2 engine. i think the body on 8829 is a little more well done. for 8296, i think the alternate tractor model is much better. for more comparisons, see technicopedia. eric wow! 8-? thanks for that cool link, blakbird! x-d i agree that 8829's body is better. i especially like 8829's rear spoiler and its angled side beams. :-) -toa of justice

1 hello all apologize for digging out a such old post. recently i got a bag of lego technic parts where there have been mixed three sets: 8858, 8829 and 8235 the resurrection of 8858 has been described by me in a separate post. going back to the dune buggy  when i saw it for the first time back in 1994 i did not like it, as i was always big fan of 8840 (which i consider to the day the best looking buggy) and set 8829 looked to me ugly. so there were those all parts in the bag then i though why not build it ? and i started to do it. when i finished i was very surprised how the final look of this set is! really taking my words back. unfortunately in the bag there were missing some parts and i could not rebuild the back spoiler. so i made some changes to it and make it from spare parts that i have and it came out acceptable. i also added some additional parts such as fake steering wheel, rally logo, antennas. i have also reverse mounting of the rear tires  why lego did them like that i never know  as i think they look better this way. set: well the review has been already made by owner of this post so i will only add few things into it. engine  v2 (aired cooled?) is driven by 4 gears -> from the single wheel (no differential as in 8840) using two old school z14 tooth bevel , then by z24 tooth crown and z8 tooth type 1. actually the (as in most old sets) the pistons are moving very fast (not as in current sets) and smooths  i needed to extra clean all engine parts as there was a lot friction. suspension  set has engine bay working using two old gray shock absorbers 6,5l  the movement is not big but works very nice, better then in 8840 in my opinion. steering  this is a bit odd as there is no direct connection to hog as in most old sets, but first the gear rack is moved by z8 then two z14 tooth where reverse movement is taking place. later connection of two old school z14 tooth bevel goes to hog details  this is the most that i like in this set, specially how the use of axle pin connector perpendicular and 1x10 bricks with 3x3 cut corners and plate 1x5 toothed ends 2 studs with center axle hole are making the body shape  is just wonder. tires  the balloon rear are pretty nice the front is a new version of those that were in 8840. what i do not like: 1. missing of technic figure (8840 had it.) 2. no steering wheel in the original set 3. no differential  but having in mind that lego has introduce 24-12 teeth would be difficult to build the transmission in such small space where the engine is. i will shortly upload new pictures and post them here later on . over all  i think it is worth buying it as it is very payable ! actually very payable and runs smoothly , the steering, suspension  perfect thank you and regards

1 thanks for the review, i think i'll certainly get these sets. they look very nice and have nice minfigs (i love racing, as long as minifigs could sit in them). the fact that there are so much stickers make me think this is an model building theme, like when you build plastic cars (with all those tiny pieces and a load of stickers). but that 's'-shaped thingy does already exist, doesn't it? edited by matn, 23 march 2008 - 11:40 am.

1 nice review the set doesnt seem as good as the crystal hawk and there colouring mistake with gun is just well bad and not the kind of thing i expect tlc to do something that stupid edited by pencoin, 03 june 2008 - 04:51 pm.

-1 i don't even see why you reviewed this set... it didn't tell us anything that isn't perceivable from the box, being so simple. though i do appreciate the effort.

-1 legobear, on mar 23 2008, 09:05 pm, said: big or small we all love our legos, and for that i thank you for the review. i would have had liked to see your opinions though, about the price, the playability, or anything else you'd care to share about it and perhaps how it fits with your collection. i've always been hesitant about getting this set because to me i feel like i have it all already, but i'm missing that dog, radar gun and, 50 mph sign :-/ it's too pricey and the playability only really kicks in with other sets - there's already a speed gun with the recent police car release so this seems a little redundant, but it goes well (of course) with the very large tabletown pd. maybe worth it if you want dogs. dr. s.

-1 when i went to blue water they have dogs in the pick a brick wall so i have plenty! ;-) yes i think i have everything here thats why i havent baught this, the fireman, or the construction worker, they need to bring out something unique.

1 a great review for a great set! it even had the old technic t-pieces and bevels, which i actually prefer to their modern counterparts. cp5670, on mar 24 2008, 08:14 am, said: the turntable on the back doesn't turn very well though, as the weight is all distributed on one side. the screw axle prevents it from popping off but there is still a lot of friction in it. i got mine for 20 in a second hand shop; it said complete, but one of the screw knuts was missing! x-o so it's practically impossible to keep the back arm on with only one |-/ and they're rather rare on bl too |-/

0 yesterday while building, i accidentaly dropped a axle nut. of course i'm working in a total mess and so it tool some time 'til i found it again. there are ~324 axle nuts on bricklink with an avg price of $0.89. i didn't know of this accessory-set: 5110-2... you can buy it for $40.00 8-?

0 quote how long of a shutter speed did you use? 15 seconds. quote by the way, don't forget to build the alternate model of 8862. i will review it too and post it in this topic! quote "slewed"? i think that's a word. how about "slewn" or "slain" or "slewifacated"? i think "rotated" is best. actually i took it from your site! x-d quote white is pretty rare. unfortunately i don't own 8480 but i think 8824 is also a very good (though small) white set! 8462 rocks as a blue set. i just got it a few weeks ago. let's see... 8462 also is one of the last technic sets i would call old-school. 8479... okay too, but 8458 is imho not. 8868 and the totally mysteriously black set will follow...! quote i was thinking you could somehow attach a 16-tooth dark gray gear (the one that spins freely around axles) to the nut, which would make the axle move in and out when the gear turned and convert the gear's rotary motion to linear motion in a fairly compact package. did you had something like this in mind? if the toothed 10l axle rotates the axle nuts want to rotate too but they can't because of that 2x4 technic plate. so they'll decide to move along the axle. the 1x6 bricks on each end make sure that the axle won't move in or out. thanks for your feedback!

1 thanks for another classic review! man, i wish i had this set. the shovels should have been black though.

1 some time ago i sort of complained about the fact that there was not much technic represented in the eurobricks community (this was the topic, if someone is interested). i am glad to see someone took that complaint serious and started reviewing technic sets on large scale to show us how fascinating the theme really is! this review is once again an excellent one, i really enjoyed reading it. i must buy this set sometime soon because i always liked the three-way pneumatic system it came with and the overall look of the machine. for many years it seemed out of reach, much to expensive and hard to come by as a kid. now as an adult there are many ways to acquire this wonderful set. keep on reviewing! *y*

1 those are some beautiful cars, thanks so much for the review! *sweet* of the two, i like taejo's one best, as red is my colour. >:-) a perfect car for you and the bird to roll round in. :-d i like the windscreen pieces, they're new right?

1 a fine review of a fine set, thanks lasse d! *y*

1 thank you for your detailed review, lasse d! *y* the only problem about this set is, that most of the people here will regard this as a pure parts pack. x-d oooh - i just found out about the red "teeth" - cool. i want that! *wub*

1 thank you for review very good army builder i see

1 thanks for a lovely review! i only recently bought this set off ebay (pretty good deal: misb for 30 euro's!) and i enjoyed putting it together and mixing it with the other piratesets. when you put two sets of two baseplates together you'll get a large pond with an island in the center, just to achieve that i bought two more baseplates off ebay. the result is this moc. i always loved the islanders and have most of the sets, not all of them but that is going to change in the future. *y*

1 excellent review of an outstanding set! i love the main image. i want this set so bad!

1 yay! pictures! thank you for the review. you made me actually consider looking it up on ebay, but i already have so so many things to get on my want list. drat my easy ability to get sold on something lego!

1 for some reason i never considered buying this set. but your review changed that. i'll try to get it on ebay. thanks for your efforts to make this wonderful review for us. it's now added to our index.

1 wow, that is one great review you made sly! i gave it a four, only thing i don't like is the raised baseplate. it does get you a lot of figs, two ships and some nice assecories, great set!

-1 i realized that building the chess set from the new pirates theme, they are two grey heads that reminded me of the king kahuna throne, which goes to say that i am hoping they bring back new sets, i just wish they were bigger. i would love to build the old ones, but i would side more towards the newer model if they ever released them.

-1 judging from your pictures there seems to be many interesting torsos and new fleshy heads but i don't think this set is for me. fueling my dismissal of this set is that i saw the trailer for this film at the cinema today and it looked pretty terrible! :-x thanks for taking your time to review this set though ricecracker! ;-) edited by casewindu, 29 march 2008 - 10:18 pm.

1 hi! i've promised a lot lately. i'll review 8868, 8880, space police ii, blacktron ii... and i will. it's just the time that is blocking me. and my university. and the fact that i just picked up 8460 in original box for only eur 36,50...! *sweet* the other reviews will follow - please bear with me. and this set review is also a gift to this nice fellow who gave me the title! that's what i'm talking about: #1 useless information with high numbers: this set contains 841 parts and was released in 1995 in the technic / tech build / advanced (sub-) theme. the bricklink price guide displays for used a qty avg price of $125.85 and for new a qty avg price of $212.82. i got it for $56,98. still cant believe it. :'-) this set was rereleased two times (8431 in 2002 and 8438 in 2003). #2 the box: front: back: open: the box is higher than other technic boxes. why? i dont know. 8460 doesnt have any real large parts. whatever. inlay: i wonder why tlg doesnt make inlays anymore theyre noisy and brake easily but are great for (pre-) sorting. #3 building instructions: i will quote myself from the 8862 review: quote wow these instructions are used! i'm not used to this after all this sets with unread instruction booklets... triple-wow! nuff said. this is the first page. (fortunately peeron offers scans!) the last step for the alternate model and a few nice photos showing how the pneumatic pump will be erm- pumped. yeah. random page: i forgot the overall thoughts to the instructions: these are technic instructions as were used to them: part count, easy to understand (okay, the string part at the end was too much for me) and the color distinction is okay too. 100 pages long and if i can trust my eyes the pneumatics page can be fold out. (i dont have this page but i assume it.) #4 the parts: #5 building: an easy and fun build. okay, this could take some time. my longest building review up to date. the front steering: the rear steering. the axle pin between the rear steering is for the axle which rotates the crane. the two worm screws in the front are for the outriggers (theyre not linked. one for each side.) the small wheel in the back is for the rotation. adjusting front and rear steering. outriggers are finished. you can notice a 8 tooth gear that will rotate the technic turntable. a steering wheel has been added. could be the same stickers like the alternate 8880 used to have. the steering can be operated with both actinic lights (?) no. were far from finished. ive got a lot of parts left at this point. wow. a 4x4 corner plate! pneumatics and a winch: if you cant recognize it on the photo: the technic beams are the erm- wrong/other side up. the 1x6 technic beams on the left side are normal. the axle that will extend the crane: 7 gear racks 1x4 the 1x6 technic plate will keep the two pneumatic cylinders straight. *sad* 8-| huh? did you blink? you missed a special part: the whole rotatable thing will be attached to the technic turntable using two long technic pins. the pin on the right side should be in the middle of the three turntable holes. on the right side, its the first hole. asymmetric! why? because well add a cute cab! #6 functionality: you can find the features in comparison to other technic cranes here. technopedia, of course. i made one "sentence" out of it: (please dont find any mistakes.) :-p two axle rack and pinion steering, pneumatic luffing and gear driven telescoping via crank for the boom which can slew 360 on turntable driven via gear, crank driven hoist and gear driven outriggers at four corners which snap over center. #7 random shots: comparison to 8854: uuuh once again a depth of field. i tried to make it look authoritarian like 8858 but i failed. somehow 8460 looks cute. #8 comparison to 8421 mobile crane / crane truck: i feel that a question concerning this will be asked, so i deal with it right now. first of all: i dont own 8421 yet. i know. a technic freak really should own it. anyway: 8421 has more than twice as much parts as 8460, is motorized, features a v6-engine and a very neat mechanism to extend the crane/boom twice using a braided string with end studs. try to find out how! of course 8421 features (far) more than 8460. imho 8421 should have been a copy of 8460, a set so successful that it has been rereleased two times, but the designers overshoot the mark. 8421 is a (breathtaking) monster. compared to it, 8460 looks cute - not pale! #9 final thoughts: i got it on ebay in kind of good condition, for about 50 dollars. i know that it has been worth the money in any point of view. *wub* i didnt use the word old-school for now. ill change that: 8460 belongs to the favored few of old-school technic sets! thanks for reading and viewing the pictures, i hope you enjoyed it! please comment if you want to!

1 ah, thanks sommuch again for that great review! *y* *sweet* man, i am so happy they made this set. the new one seems too boring. ;-)

1 somehow i competely missed your review when you first made it, i saw your pics on brickshelf and wondered about the review... you have managed to review my all time favourite technic set! it was the first large technic set i was given by my parents, when it first came out in 1995. i played for hours with this set, making minifig seats in it (it was so huge there was room for four minifigs to sit next to eachother in front....) i made various applications for it, a bungee-jump system with a large rubber band, and lots of containers to be lifted. the first changes i made included the inverting of the wheels and the disabling of one of the flashlight-steering wheels because they obstructed eachother. by the way, the nob for your winch is yellow instead of black (i know this set by heart, so watch out :-p ). i always liked those nobs. i do own the 8421 and i can tell you: this 8460 is much, much stronger, it can carry more weight because the boom is lighter then the 8421: they are powered by the same two pistons... you know when you made it right: when the crane is in upright position, fully extended and you release the brake from the winch. does the hook lower without having to pull it? if it does, you succeeded in constructing the set right. the alternate model was great fun too, the pump is cleverly hidden and the crane folds up great between the cab and the loading platform. you could easily mod it with a pneumatic claw on the crane, a motor to turn it and a compressor. the only flaw was the loading platform which had no floor (only some axles). thanks so much for reviving my memorie concerning this great set! *y*

1 front, on apr 6 2008, 05:19 pm, said: btw. boxes are expensive, so at a given price point, it's a choise between more bricks or nicer boxes. i have no doubt what most people would chose. yeah, it's certainly understandable why they did it, but bad for box hoarders like me. :-p

0 set ref: 7624 name: jungle duel number of minifigs: 3 number of pieces: 78 price: 11,90 its the smaller set from the last indy movie, the kingdom of the crystal skull. here we go! a general view of the set: we have a tent, some food ( a chicken leg is always welcome!), a fireplace, the things with all the swords, a bench with a broken table, 3 ants, a map (printed tile) and other accessories. dont make that girl hungry or... yyyyaaaaaaaahhhhhhh! ho no! our diner, a giant ant, has gone away! those giant ants are made in a smooth plastic, in dark red and trans black colour: and here a closer view on the two new hairpieces: the new girl hairpiece is really cute, and im a bit disappointed by the new man hairpiecethose hair lake some volume but im really happy to see that tlc has made some new moulds for hairpieces! its the good part of the theatre lines! so, its a really interesting set because youve got a lot of useful pieces for a city mocers, with the two new hairpieces without spending a lot of money! edited by imperialshadows, 01 june 2008 - 11:59 am. updated stats/title

1 anger the woman in charge and thou shall have no dinner. great review, the sets looks good, and the retunr of the tent is something to be very happy about. and also, those giant camp-attacking ants look really great, they can be use as bugs in a tod spike and bug room diorama.

1 thanks for this review alex54, this looks like a great set. i love the new hair molds and faces, plus al those extra pieces are fantastic! batbrick away!

1 can't wait to get this one (ants!!!) i don't have a tent either, so that'll be a great pickup. i'm surprised, though, that it includes the gold exo-force sword. i didn't expect this to come in any other sets besides the tower. <faramir-<

0 i have no idea why they dont use that female hair piece on trixie in speed racer. it would be perfect! greta review!

1 thanks for the excellent review alex! this is so far my favorite crystal skull set (released) the cargo plane is however the best i love the small accessories like turkey leg, banana, golden sword and giant ants! mutt's torso is very nice! i love the leather jacket print irina is just a another hottie, but i would like to see her smile oh and another indy...........

1 great review; i will definitely get this, if not only for the hair but the ants, melee weapons, and new faces and torsos!

1 i simply that tent! i guess ill have to buy three of these just to make a proper expedition moc somewhen.... a great little set indeed, with marvelous new mf torsos and that new black feminine hairpieces also great and very useable for creating some characters related to the sixties and seventies. and finally a pan thats not black and a knife in grey. thats very handy indeed, the chrome one always looked a bit too shiny to me.... thanks for that sweet review, alex!

1 nice little review here alex, i like your idea to make the aquatic car into one for a geologist! i really like the little details in this set such as the little petrol can and the propeller at the back of the car, a must buy in my view! thanks again!

1 must.....have......

0 shoc, on apr 15 2008, 10:31 pm, said: is that a laptop it's on? does it come with the set? yes it's a laptop, and it was in the set! when i opened it, i understood why this little box was so heavy! asus is my official sponsor, so i have to show the logo! i have to add that i don't have put on the stickers...

1 merci beaucoup for the great review alex !! where did you get the sets ? that set is called river chase this is a great set !! i love the amphibious vehicle with all the darj green part !! i agree with you that the the dark green croc is fantastic !! i'm also happy to have a dark bley zodiac and a new marion torso. that "tree hut" is a fun feature where the playability doesn't screw the design !! i really love the commies !! its fun how lego reuses those fleshie heads and i really don't mind at all. so its evil for evil since one of the commie has the zazi face i also love the ptrol cans !! ingenious !! i still have rants on that set: * why oh why another similar indy !! arghhh i can't stand it !! * why oh why the same marion head !! can't wait to have those sets !!

0 darthperson8, on apr 15 2008, 07:12 pm, said: what are those bricks with the guns attached supposed to be? great review and set btw... some people have obliquely mentioned this in their responses to the set/review, but to specifically answer your question, it's supposed to be a jerrycan, a.k.a. a gasoline (petrol) container...

1 just like 7626 this is a must buy in my opinion. i just the amphibious vehicle,very nice for army building.

1 set ref: 7626 name: jungle cutter number of minifigs: 4 number of pieces: unknown price: 39,99 a general view of the set: weve got 5 giant ants, two russian soldiers, a general, indy of course, 3 trees, a small entrance of a cave, and the debroussaillor vehicle (i dont know the english name of it). you cant enter into the cave, because there is a spider web with its spiderunless unless you know how the mechanism works and the spider web go up and reveals a case with diamonds and accessories. a closer view on the mechanism (which is simple but works well), and you can also see the difference, or maybe the same, size of a spider and a giant ant! and ive always thought that those spiders were very big compared to the minifigs! so those ants are really giant! poor small frog! the three trees with the entrance make a nice jungle layout! dont speak too loud, you will wake up the soldier dont worry for him, he will be waken up by the vehicle before being eaten by those giant ants! a front view, making the vehicle really menacing! a back view: push the red part from the back and there are two parts that fall down from the vehicle. i dont know why the movie will clarify this i think and here you can see how the two big circular blades turn when you push the vehicle simple but effective! run indy, run! this set is really nice. the playability of the different elements is great, the colour scheme is nice too (i like those dark green tree parts!). the vehicle is really impressive without being too big and its very well details! in general the designers of the indy sets have made a really nice works, with a lot of efforts in all those details everywhere! ive got some project for this set, to integrate it in my city... im a city mocer, and not an indy fan. so i dont have bought the temple, the bigger set of the series, because it has nothing special for me in term of part selections or in the design, in relation with the town theme, and because my supermarket doesnt have it yet! so, we are waiting for a member to review it and make the part 4

1 i like the creatures in this very much, and it is good to see the vehicle from different angles. thank you i think i shall buy this.

1 excellent review alex. thanks for sharing. i can't wait to buy this set once available. i really like the dark green leaf pieces. i like the cave/temple which will look great in my jungle diorama. blending the dark green and light green works well for the vehicle. overall, a neat little set.

0 thanks for this fantastic review, alex! those trees are a neat add on to any jungle, as is that sweet cave. but the main part of this set, the jungle cutter, man, that is wicked! packed with that awesome dark green and with those wonderful treads, not to mention the smoothly spinning buzz saws. however, this set's a tad overpriced in my opinion, and looking through the instructions they have that crazy colour syndrome again, using blue, yellow and red parts in the internal build. still, thanks for this sweet review with neat pics! *thumbup* ~peace

1 ahhhhh now this swamp vehicle looks great to me, when i first heard lego were making it i was worried that it would be a poor version. however im pleased to see that it's not, even though i'm not a great fan of those treads. the trees don't really add anything to the set which is a shame, still the parts are welcome at least. the entrance is good though it could do with being bigger, but i guess we can moc that. i really like the commie general, he looks like a real bad megablocks

0 xwingyoda, on apr 16 2008, 05:37 am, said: great review again alex !! same question (in case you didn't se it in my reply to the other set): where did you get those new sets ?? i really love that set !! its called jungle cutter the trees are really cool and make a great adition to it imo. that temple entrance or monument is really cool !! those bionicle parts do make fantastic vegetation !! you mean the spiny dk. green things that hang from the holes around the secret entrance? they were in the indy: temple escape. i totally forgot about that green frog !! thats cool , those are so cute !! 5 more ants is great !! the vehicle look really sharp (ah ah ah). 2 more commies yeay !! that officer is really freaky actually !! could have been a high rank under pol pot's regime in the s21... yeay looks more asian than russian imo yeah, tlc's really cranking out the new molds for both food and wildlife! so let's see... if i get all five sets... i get... 11 russians! and six are basic soldiers, although two are duplicates and triplicates. yes, that officer definitely has an italian look to him; those cheekbones are a little too high. now its time for my gripes: * same bloody rant about indy !! * i haven't read the instructions before but once again there are so many parts in crap colours that need to be changed look at all the crap red and yellow in there !! i will need to look for those parts before buying the set like i always do !! mod while building on !! same rant! any chance we could see the rpg? i am really soimpressed with that indy line !! i sincerely hope it will have a long and healthy life !! agreed! responses to the yodameister's review of alex54's review of the jungle cutter are in red. now to my opinion: great review! more reviews on!

1 looks great

1 what a marvelous diversity of plant parts, very nice mfs and a cool and detailed harvester. that conventionalized cave with its neat opening features also very well done. thanks for that fine review of a pretty cool set, alex.

1 here's a review of the second largest set in the dragon masters subtheme for castle month, dark dragon's den! figs: the set comes with 3 dragon knights, two of which have the dragon wings on their helmets(sad thing is, one of my knights was missing the left wing on the helmet). there are also the definitive dragon, wiz the wizard (or majisto if you prefer)two horses, and a hawk( try to find him in each picture!) the set: there's a large spot under the mountain for the dragon to guard the treasure chest. the chest has 2 red and green 1x1 circles in it. another gate in the back, along with a door for knights. the right side of the mountain has a ladder and a removable rock face. the left side has some stairs leading up to the top. i love this tree design. simple yet effective. a shot of the top- hey, what are you doing?!? no!! throw him in the dungeon! overall: this set when first released in 1993 was priced at $43usd, although that might just be because of the juniorised pieces (6 burps!). it's a fun set that provides excellent playability. if you can find it at a $20-$30 price point, pick it up. overall grade: 8/10 edited by kimt, 10 august 2008 - 01:33 pm.

1 great classic dragon den! i love the old green dragons very much! there were my fave. i love these theme very much after the black knights era. this is a very very good set! i wished i can have this too.

0 the wizard somehow "controls" the dragons i think, like, for example the wizard of the new castle line does with the undead skeletons. but i think it isn't sure that the dragon master's wizard is evil. as it is still unclear which factions of the older castle series are "good" or "bad".

1 i own this set and i think its a great for a smaller fortress building. there is a good selection of mini figs, the burps do detract somewhat from the set, but they do make it feel as if its in a large cave. the cloth flags that are included are really nice and mine have lasted a long time.

0 i saw this set at my tru for only $20.00. now i might go get it! thanks sinner for another nice review! quote hoped to find a figure the right size for it, but none of mine would fit. well, just sit your booty down and ride it wourself... ... okay, well, maybe if you have a bionicle lying around or a halo figure.

1 a very good review, thanks, sinner. thats really a pretty cool model, very detailed with useful parts too.... hmm, perhaps that ones gonna get the first technic set ill buy, beside that 4481 hailfire droid.... um, thank you, sinner....

0 sinner, on apr 23 2008, 10:37 am, said: i'll try to take a photo this weekend. well, i took the photo but didn't get around to posting it! here it is with a smaller gear. i think it looks better... ...the problem is that it's too tight and it doesn't rotate as freely anymore. adding another link makes it too loose! thus the set is probably the way it is as it's the gear that fit best.

0 how did i manage to miss this review? i must have overlooked it somehow... thanks for making this one sinner, it's always nice to see reviews of technic sets. i'm not so sure whether i like this set, i am not that much into motorbikes, but lego did a good job on this one. it looks a lot like an upgraded version of one of the first bikes lego made, namely the 8838 shock cycle. i also believe the back gearwheel is somewhat oversized, it looks better with the smaller one you attached. it is good to see that lego is back to making the technic sets the way they were (except for the green, that is )

0 great review! i never have been interested in this set. i am saving my money for a grey technic set or thatt technic ferrari set...

0 thanks for the review! i bought this set when it first came out and it is still in the box. it is stuck in my fairly lengthly backlog but after seeing your review, i'll have to put it to the top of the queue.

0 wow, it's a smarty set with drive shafts (we are everybody!) and technical junk. the specs and stuff kind of lose me but the walrus looks really cute in the cherry picker! i imagine he's saving a kitten. but really, this is a great review and has a wealth of detail and knowlege for techni-philes! thanks for providing such a cool resource for eb! i really did enjoy delving in to the world of technic for a few moments. the walrus rides it ... oh, he's so smart.

1 set: 7627 - indiana jones - temple of the crystal skull pieces: 929 price: $aud149.99 out of all the indy 4 sets, this one seems to cop the most flak - which may account for the fact that the other 3 were reviewed weeks ago and this one has sat, unloved and alone, waiting for someone to turn their eye upon it (or, y'know, buy it). luckily i'm a sucker for spooky old temples, filled with devilish traps and hidden treasures, hissing fountains and overgrown foliage, creepy skeletons and crumbling stonework, so here it is: indiana jones 7627, temple of the crystal skull. part 1: the figs first off, the figs - 6 humans and 4 skellies (or should that be skullies? ) indy, mutt, irina, and that sneery russian guy that's in the 2 smaller sets. nothing new here. aha! what have we here - two natives. i wonder if hair is a sign of power in this culture, since one guy is completely bald and the other one has the most extraordinarily luxurious black mullet. somehow i doubt the movie will answer this question. back view - as you can see, the scalp tattoos are also popular in this tribe. fashion conscious! (note in the background the paws of the fearsome black jungle panther, ie my cat, curious as to see what the tribe was up to.) also, don't ask me why these guys are carrying axes rather than, say, spears. and what everyone's been waiting for, the skullies - three of 'em and a conquistador skellie - very cute. note the backs of the crystal head have a plume-sized hole - or maybe that's just where they injected the blue brain-plastic. spooky! i love these skulls, i wasn't sold from the initial pics but they have a very creepy smile and the head shape is just... weird. with the large eyes, it's kind of homer simpson-esque. and here we have the token vehicle in the set - a weird little tank thing with treads. kind of looks like a cross between the amphibious boat and a mini-tank. i'm sure there's a military expert around here who can tell us exactly what it is supposed to be. the treads are nice, but the rest of it is a bit thrown together. you can tell they wanted to keep the dark green colour scheme but the budget only allowed them 5 parts to do so . all in all, a mixed bag with the figs. 4 repeats from the cheaper sets which means we have one new native figure and the crystal skullies. there are heaps of the old-skool skele heads scattered around the sets so those that prefer can replace the skullies with ordinary skellies. bizarrely, the top of the box which has the line of 1:1 figs pic (you know what i mean) doesn't have names for any of the characters, whereas all the smaller sets do. part 2: box, parts front of box: back of box: two instruction books: parts. this set has come under criticism for being overpriced - myself included - but the official piece count is 900 plus, which is pretty good considering it also contains the baseplate. 6 big bags and 2 of those 12x12 bricks in dark tan. (note: set does not contain live black jungle panther) the dss, helpfully comes pre-scrunched thanks to tlc. even in a $aud150 set they can't get that right... sigh. the dark tan baseplate. say what you like, i'm in love. i know some people don't like these, but they were such a staple of castle/ pirates for so many years that i don't consider them a juniorised piece at all. this one, recycled from the 05 police hq and 06 hospital, is much better in design than the king leo's castle one as the different heights and asymmetry make it look much more like a natural piece of ground. perfect for mocs. and it's dark tan - how could anyone not love such a huge slab of dark tan? note this love doesn't extend to applying the stonework stickers which are, frankly, crap. random instructions page: part 3: temple of doom - or just a doomed temple? the complete set, front view. isometricish view: back view: top view: first impressions? it's very dark tan, isn't it? and green. and bright green. and dark green. and dark red. and normal tan. and dark bley. and pearl gold! in fact, it's a bit of a mish-mash of colours. i'm of two minds about this. i kind of prefer the palette to be a bit subtler, but i can see that a playset designed for kids isn't going to sell bucketloads all tastefully done in shades of tan with lashings of dark-green foliage. there's a huge amount of dark red in this set, which is always a welcome colour, but i'm not convinced it quite works with the 2 shades of tan on offer here. on the plus side, there's also a huge amount of dark tan in ordinary 2x2 bricks, tiles, plates and 1x1 and 1x2x3 slopes, which is great for anyone wanting to stock up. let's take a closer look. i'll do this roughly in order of the build itself: a) the big scary face. this is a simple, fun build and very effective at projecting menace at the temple entrance. it actually detaches very easily from the temple (as pictured on the box art) to allow easier access to the inside. the eyes are flick-fire missiles, with scary face's hair conveniently providing ammo refills should you run out. all in all, from me. (b) the back spin the skelly head and stone steps appear - we haven't seen this feature in a while. nice to get these pieces in dark bley. a conquistador hides under the stairs - this is a bit useless as the stairs can't fully extend while he's there . moving right... a trapdoor - what could possibly be behind it??!!??!!? answer: not much, really. a little red stair. i really like these 2 stickers though - very intricate. the staircase leads to what i like to think of as the crystal skull transmogrification chamber. now, i know nothing about the movie except that it's supposed to be have a kind of 50s b-movie plot rumoured to feature (look away, spoiler-haters)..... aliens. these weird, creepy gold chairs look made from the bones of aliens if you ask me, with their strange vertebrae and silver claws. it wouldn't surprise me if bringing these aliens back to life was part of the plot of the movie... hence the crystal skull? i guess we'll find out may 22. in any case, transforming aliens clearly like a disco whirl as when you pull the handle, the whole of this assembly spins giddily around. a very clever and simple trick - it's basically just a wheel under the platform but the effect is great. also under here is a bottomless pit (stickered)... i would very much expect a villian to be thrown down it at some point. "so, do you come here often?" "i don't know who designed this club. these chairs are really uncomfortable." nb. i am really, really over those pearl gold 1x2 roof corner slopes which started popping up in the 2006 castle range, infected exo-force and have now spread here. can we please have these in a different colour? or a different pearl gold piece? pretty please? ( c) left tower (looking from the front) a small tower with a trans clear gem. (d) right tower waterfall with booby trap. i like the sticker, it's very cartoony, which fits with the set somehow. when you turn the wheel, flick fire missiles spray out and hit whoever is on the stairs. both towers have a trap where if you move the skull, another one pops out from the dragon mouth. (e) central turret thing this thing is kind of annoying and doesn't really sit or work well. it's kind of like a laser beam sending messages to space, i guess. as the central dome rises, the two plates peel away. i find it is a little bit tight to work smoothly and the two plates doesn't really sit well together at the top. maybe i just need to rebuild it. i'm sure this will also be explained in the movie. (f) final trap - the stair that isn't there the final trap is at the front - as indy goes down the staircase, you can push the red heads and all the 1x8 bley bricks come tumbling down. simple and works well. (g) alternate view here's how it looks as pictured on the box with the head removed. as you can see, this allows better access to the centre of the temple. as you can see, sadly there is nothing actually interesting there except a staircase to the turret and 2 dark tan slopes which are just stuck there and look a little out of place. i mean, come on, everything else has a splash of dark red and gold! your destination: nowhere! part 4: in conclusion so after all those endless pics, what about the set itself? cons:as a playset, 7627 doesn't quite make sense. admittedly, the traps that are there are well-designed and unobtrusive. on the other hand, there's a great big whopping entrance at the front - but i wasn't sure if the figs are supposed to sneak in through the backdoor and go up the spiral staircase and past the waterfall (as shown in the box art) or if they were meant to end up in the golden skull room. the middle area doesn't really connect with anything, nor does the giant space turret. it may be that some of these questions are answered in the film, but whereas with 7624, 7625 and 7626 i could at least picture a story myself (eg with river chase is fairly obvious what's happening - a chase down a river with a croc and a communist staking them out)!, the temple set is a little all over the place. the design feels a little off to me - not really bad but not really great either. pros: on the plus side, the natives and crystal skulls themselves are great. at 900+ pieces, this is also a great parts pack for dark tan, dark red, plant pieces, gold oddments etc. i especially love the baseplate in that shade. i like the overall shape of the temple - a big staircase with secret nooks and crannies. the build is reasonably interesting and there are some clever tricks with the traps. but upon reflection i shouldn't have to sell this set - it should be able to sell itself! as i said before, i'm a huge fan of dark, mysterious old temples so for that i have to give it some love. it reminds me of the big old adventurers sets and the whiff of nostalgia is itself a powerful intoxicant. however, for the price lego is selling it in australia/ europe/ canada i couldn't recommend it as a must-buy for full price when the smaller sets in this series are themselves so good. review done - woo! edited by imperialshadows, 01 june 2008 - 11:59 am.

1 thanks, svelte_corps. i was really hoping that the conquistador helmet would end up being silver in the final set, but i suppose it's good to know that the helmet is being porduced again anyway. and is the armour the skellie is wearing pearl gold? thanks again, i look forward to the rest of the review edit: the dark tan baseplate is in fact very nice although the fact that you have to put stickers on it is a real downer. but i suppose it is good for those who want it plain. edited by tinypiesrus, 01 may 2008 - 02:19 am.

0 damn, you've convinced me to get it now, thanks for the review, tan is my favourite colour in lego! batbrick away!

0 great in-depth review!!! svelte, i love your cat! :) :)

1 nice big set ! thanks for the review. the skellies seem to me as the only really big plus of the whole lot. i agree on the homer simpsons' paternity to them...

0 wout, on may 1 2008, 10:28 am, said: thank you for the nice review. off-topic: i heard something on lowlug that tlc cancelled 2624 (little set with indy, mutt, irina and tent). have anybody heard something about that? that would be not so nice. absolute hogwash. i wouldn't trust anyone on a forum i've never heard of. i don't believe they'd cancel it. it's still on s@h, right?

1 i know that alex54 had already reviewed this set beforehand, but i wanted to give my 2 cents (it is really more like $1.50) on this set i bought from toys 'r' us on friday (guess what, the price had not been increased by a dollar like all other sets, ). this is my first review of a set ever, don't be too mean. 1) box it captures the potential (i don't know how the scene plays out... for now ) action of the scene nicely and is very pleasing, good job tlc . on the back it shows some of the play features of the set and a net little comic. indiana jones seems to be surprisingly calm considering that he is about to be captured under a net and attacked by a snake (the thing he fears most). 1a) comic not much to say on this... 1b) screw up at the top of the box, both "russian guards" have the same grining face, in the set one has the generic bad guy face from 7620. 2) contents the box opens up to reveal a quartet of bags, an un-crumpled manual (yay!), and a sticker sheet (boo!) 2a) dss yoda said every for of rambling imaginable about this accursed item, i have nothing to say. meh... 3) minifigs the only thing that has not really been discussed about the figs that you get in this set is that marion has a slightly new torso. 4) parts of interest when i opened up the baggies, these were the components that grabbed my attention. a dark green alligator, a net piece that i know has appeared in sets before hand ( i needed it for a moc i am working on), some raft part that is probably very old, a ladder with two pairs of hindges, and a dark brown version of this part. 4) build (amphibious vehicle) this i one of the more enjoyable builds of the new line. but that is just my opinion. you start of with some thing very simple... by the end of the next page, it starts to bulk up more detail... beginning to look like a car... 4a) build (rear attachment) bulk it up and add taillights... done... slap it on to the main vehicle... 4b) build (front attachment) i am running out of things to say... bulk it up... add some detail... add a gun and headlights... and attach to the rest to get the completed vehicle... add stickers... i honestly think that the amphibious vehicle looks much better with the stickers than without... 5) build (boat) this build goes by rather quickly and adds to the playability of the final set. base... apply clamps... add more to engine... build more detail and a gun base... finished boat... plus stickers... i love how lego slips in the product number into their stickers. 6) build (tree fort) this is the weakest part of the whole set. but i find my self liking it more and more for some odd and inexplicable reason. that tan 6x6 will most likely see use in a pirate themed vinigete soon (not mine ). install net-launcher... you spend the next two pages building this... and putting it on... a tree branch that is an ugly mix of brown, dark brown, and frown... (our commie friend seems to like coffee a lot) second branch... 3rd... (a wee bit to much on the coffee there, don't you think?) final step... the only redeeming value of this section is how well the net launcher works, fantastically. the rest is just utter fail. 7) spare parts very little in terms of what is left over... finished set... all in all, this set is a fine build and an excellent parts pack for dark green components. i recommend this set strongly, despite its few weaknesses.

0 nice review! although you need to use the macro setting(a.k.a. the flower setting) for better pics. are you using a digital camera? you really need macro... the idea is, turn it on and hold down on the 'take picture' button halfway until the pic focuses. then press it down all the way to take the pic. i'm glad this one also comes with the new uzi; i wanted an extra...

0 a very nice review of a very lovely indy set indeed, thanks wilhelm screamer. but you need for sure a better lighting for taking your pictures....

0 nice review wilhelm screamer! very thorough. the pictures are a little dark and blurry, though. i made a tutorial here for amateur photography tips. i also edited your first post to include a link to alex's review. great job!

1 while i truely fell in love one more time with the older lego city sets, i thought, why not make a review of one of the, in my opinion greatest city sets of all time. let's not talk too much, here we go! set nr.: 6395 name: victory lap racetrack number of minifigs: 13 (!!) number of pieces: unknown release year: 1988 starting with the beautiful old legoland box: front: back, with some cool alternative models: inside: we continue with the great minifigs, which are not less than 13! i don't think there is any city set with more figures, is there? civilians: race crew & assistant personnel: drivers: all: here's a overview of the whole set: the "rescue rig" (don't exactly know how to call it) with trailer: the score board & traffic lights, which would be one of the details i love the most about this set: the next sweet detail, the camera + cameraman! of course we have a doc, if there is some kind of accident: the pit stop boxes, i love the small tool-holder with the axle and wheel behind it: the control room high above the racetrack: ready to go?!! that was it all in all,all i can say is, if you see this set anywhere on ebay ore somewhere else, get it!

0 metalandi thanks for this wonderful lovely review. i enjoyed myself very much when i am looking through at the lovely pictures. i must admit, this is what i called a "real classic" race prix i miss those cute sweet little race cars which is able to contain a mini-fig. furthermore, this set offers 4 race cars and 13 mini-figures in addition, if town collectors remember, the car number tiles are printed instead of using stickers. this is the other set i owned, which holds the similarity above. 6381: motor speedway overall, great review! simonwillems, on may 9 2008, 02:20 am, said: i recently made an entire racetrack together with this set and to promote myself i will place a link here i saw your entire racetrack. it looks real exciting and i love your layout, real nice! edited by whitefang, 15 may 2008 - 09:56 am.

0 nice reveiw i would fork out $100 aud for that set its just so bueatiful if only tlg re-released this

-1 i'll be passing on this set, thanks for the review anyway, is everyone supposed to be bald in the film? it looks weird

0 warning! this reply may contain several minor movie spoilers. if you haven't yet seen the movie and want it to be a complete surprise, do not read. batbrick, on may 10 2008, 06:05 am, said: but it is cruncher block, his lady driver taejo that really shine. look at those awesome suits! the cool faces! taejo has a ripped shirt! i was originally skepitcal about the driver figurei like the head, but i was trying to figure out why they put in a female minifig with no hairpiece. after having seen the movie, i now understand why; cruncher's driver is a fairly manly looking woman, and most of the lego hairpeices would make the minifig look too girly for the character. :) now that i know why taejo's shirt is ripped up i don't mind the bits of fleshie color that are printed on it, but i do wish they would make some of the new torsos a little more head-colour agnostic...there's no real reason why cruncher and his driver couldn't have had ties that came all the way up to their necks instead of having those little wedges of flesh showing through loose collars. yeah, they are low-level mafioso type scum, but they aren't complete slobs. batbrick, on may 10 2008, 06:05 am, said: front view, the new windshields are fantastic: they are indeed very nice, it's the main reason i started looking at the speed racer sets in the first place. batbrick, on may 10 2008, 06:05 am, said: while a very cool car, it is rather silly of tlc to give us the exact same one we got in the smaller set. i didn't get the smaller set with this car, so i'm still happy, but it is a bad marketing move: i think the error they made was in the smaller set though. in the movie, the only time we see cruncher's semi is when he's being chased by racer x. racer x and taejo do end up on the same team for a cross country rally race (along with speed of course), so i guess that's where they were going by putting those two together in the smaller set, but it would have been much more interesting for them to have made up a set with taejo and one of the cars from the very goofy, comic book-gimmicky teams they are racing against. especially since one of the teams (that is chasing taejo specifically) is a bunch of army-wannabee looniesi'm sure more people would have loved some sort of dark/sand green racer with one of the ij soviets at the wheel than another racer x. to summarize: two racer x's is bad, but it is the smaller set that should have been changed (imho). batbrick, on may 10 2008, 06:05 am, said: annoyingly enough, this part opens up to shoot a pointless rubber projectile: thus blowing the front part open and launching it.....well, not far really as much as i normally don't like the stupid techic launcher thing, and would rather not see it in a set ever again (although one of these days i will make a giant multi-launcer rig out of them just for fun), at least there is a reason for it to be in this set, as cruncher's semi has a missile launcher in the front end of it in the movie. i think you're supposed to lift the panel that hides the missile before launching it, similar to the way that panels slide out of the way on the semi cab to allow for firing in the movie. batbrick, on may 10 2008, 06:05 am, said: and now for the most disappointing part - step three, the trailer: that's right, almost the entire thing is open, even the "filled in" side has holes! i'd certainly be cared to be back there, one bumpy hill and back you go i'm gonna chock this up to the standard lego philosophy of "playset" rather than "model" design for a lot of things. the semi rig and raver x's car are the models, the trailer is the playset. seeing as how the trailer is cruncher's mobile office (rather finely appointed with lots of paintings and his pirahna "babies" in their tank behind his desk), and the intent seems more or less to have a playest bit in order for kids to re-enact the scene from the movie, i'm not going to give them too much grief over this. they tried to capture the basic bits of the movie set (which we see mostly from the inside during the movie) and translate it into a playset type environment. that being said, i do wish the back walls were more solid, as i see no reason for there to be gaps in the back wall when the front wall (or the "fourth wall" as the case may be here) is already conspicously absent. batbrick, on may 10 2008, 06:05 am, said: there are some pluses too though, like the ridiculously awesome minifig paintings i'll be using for wayne manor. also note the "control" on cruncher's desk that when turned, turns the gun at the bottom. it's an alright feature: could have been a little better, but it's such a minor bit of this scene in the movie that i can see why they didn't spend too much time and effort on it. it would have been nice to have more paintings though, had the back wall been more complete (and i like your idea of how to use them :) ). batbrick, on may 10 2008, 06:05 am, said: and though i'm not a massive fan of stickers, this is just too cool. the little aquarium is very simple but very clever, using a printed piece between two clear windows to create the illusion of a tank: definately a feature which is not showcased nearly well enough on the box art. since it is one of the major features of this set in the movie, it's nice to see it translate rather well into brick. batbrick, on may 10 2008, 06:05 am, said: design: 2/5 - pretty poor considering the best part is available in a cheaper set, and only the front part of the truck looks cool, but still not truly awful. that may be a bit harsh (but not much) given what i've said further up this post, but it probably only deserves a 3 at best, so i'm not realy going to quibble the point. :) i still think that racer x should be exclusive to this set and a different car should be in the smaller set with taejo, which would have improved the cachet for this set overall. batbrick, on may 10 2008, 06:05 am, said: price: 2/5 - overpriced easily, but rogue shadow is worse! true...this should have ideally been about a $30 set (especially given the general awesomeness of the ij race for the stolen treasure set), unless they made the trailer a bit more detailed (better back wall, perhaps some drop down gun ports like in the movie) or at put least one (or more) of cruncher's goons in the set, then maybe i could agree more with the msrp. on that note: if i remember correctly from my visit to my local tru yesterday in search of the new ij sets (since local targets seem determined not to get them in stock yet), they had this set on sale for around $35 along with an offer for a coupon good for $7.50 towards the purchase of a ticket to the movie with any speed racer toy purchase over $25. i may be wrong on the sale price, but i know the ticket offer was there. so, if you haven't seen the movie yet, and are interested in this set, tru may be the place to go right now to get both at a slightly cheaper price. batbrick, on may 10 2008, 06:05 am, said: fun: 4/5 - the mere concept of such an open truck kept me playing with this baby for hours! so you did enjoy the playest aspect of the trailer, even though you didn't care for the design...looks like they didn't do too badly then on what they wanted out of that bit. :) batbrick, on may 10 2008, 06:05 am, said: overall i'm really glad i bought it as the minifigs are fantastic and the paintings and fish tank are cool. it's fun, stupid and downright ridiculous, but while not a great set by any means, certainly isn't as bad in the brick as it looks in photos. i was actually thinking about going and getting this set now that i've seen the movie and i understand what the heck is going on here more. your review has definately added an additional impetus to that notion. my pocketbook (does not) thank you!

0 thank you for the nice review

1 i bought this set a few days ago and agree with what you have said about it. the trailer is fun to play with but just so plain. overall great review.

0 nice review--i'm surprised these are out already. i'll probably end up passing on this one. even with the surprise. :)

1 it's on the way! and also the buggy!

0 great review, as always! although i know you don't take many pictures in your reviews(imho, ) but can we see a little more about the tumbler? is that little windshield down near the bottom front a third seat? what is in the framework of the back, behind the cockpit? i know there's a blunt shooter and flick fire missiles, but is it all framework?

1 nice review i really can't believe that it is out already! i love that new batman suit and the tumbler have they made the posicles before? this is sure a must have!

0 dunamis, on may 16 2008, 07:01 pm, said: two parts technic and one part human one part kaleesh, actually

1 this is a very nice, i never gotten to chance to own or buy one of the sw big sets. i'm definitely getting these one.

0 nice review! but id rather save my money for the indy and clone wars sets.

0 legoscum, on may 17 2008, 04:03 pm, said: you forgot to add the stickers to the chest plates too. jeremy yeah, i know. i mentioned it in the review that i completely blew past the other two stickers. if you look closely, you can see that the big grievous nameplate sticker is off-center as well. me and stickers don't get along...

0 nice review i hope to get this set for my birthday!

1 thanks very much for the review brickbitz! i love this year's mars mission line, and though this is the weakest set, it is still a major improvement. the mech is very cool and well made, and the commander is one of my favourite alien figs ever. the alien ship is pretty good, better than last years ones but not extremely good either, but i still like the set. batbrick away!

1 thanks for the sweet review, brickbitz! that really is a neat little set, that walker is fantastic, most likely the best part of the set. though the alien craft does also look neat, and it's cool how it can fold down into aa walker. or rather, a sentry turret, seeing as it can't really move while in that mode. still, it's nice. my favourite part is the mini mining robot though. so cute! ~peace

0 thanks for the review!! that makes me wanting this set even more!!

1 thanks for the review nice little set and its around $20.00!

1 this is much much much more promising than the 2008 batman set for $10.00. the vehicle looks like someone took time to design it, but the batman one looks like . lego dear lego, where is the quality for batman??!?! i really like the new cyborg arm, and the propellers on that thing : ), it is a really promising line although i would get rid of all those bionicle pieces.

0 this set looks wicked! thanks very much for the sweet review oky wan! the pics are perfect, great quality and the perfect size, well done! this sets got everything, a new hairpiece, tank treads, a gem, well, i could go on but you can all see everything from the great pics. thanks again oky! this is one set i'll definately be getting! ~peace

0 huhm .. i like the idea of the agent-id .. but offcourse all they want with that is that you buy all six sets .. but it can be a good idea for children, they wouldn't think of "hey they get all money only because i have a little card with stars" or something. well, not to rant, i think it's good. also, can you make that name yourself? maybe set 5 comes with a extra stickersheed with all letters, that would be nice "agent rupee" a very nice review oky wan kenobi. =rupee

0 is there any chance u could post pics of the comic and the box i love legos box art and instruction art?

0 they are already on the shelfs? that's kinda weird, since there aren't even the instructions online yet

0 thanks for the great review oky wan! at first i didn't think i liked the agents sets but the more i see them the better i think they look. i will definitely pick up 1 or 2 of the sets. i really like the jet pack, and the figs look great. that double face is very nice. tlg should make more figs with these faces in my opinion.

0 that would be great! i still wonder why the instructions aren't up yet, though..

1 mmm this set looks amazing. lovely pieces. and i actually like the minifig faces. that jaw helmet is cool aswel . are those stickers on the crocodile heads or is it printed?

1 great little set, nice to have a small building instead of all vehicles. plant pieces and dark green crocs always welcome. good parts selection for the price. thanks for the review! can't wait till we can get our hands on these!

0 can't..resist...the unibrow...must obey.

1 i always joked that our house would have a moat around it with mechanical alligators. now i can build the house in lego! thanks sirnadroj for the review and pictures. this is definitely my favorite agents set.

1 great review and a good confirmation of exactly what i suspected... this is a parts line for me. much like exoforce before it, this will be the theme i pick up when i'm out of other things, or it's on sale. plus those dark green alligators bring tears of joy to an old pirate. alice, on may 22 2008, 12:43 am, said: i always joked that our house would have a moat around it with mechanical alligators. you were joking? what about the monkeys and the miniature golf course? don't ruin my dreams ...

1 thanks for the review. i the bike and the bad guy's helmet.

0 why do all of the reviews that we have for agents sets have the agents getting hurt? is this a new trend? plus unibrow man doesn't have a unibrow. his eyebrows are really close together and bushy!

-1 agentrick57, on may 23 2008, 09:17 am, said: why do all of the reviews that we have for agents sets have the agents getting hurt? is this a new trend? no, it's an old trend. and it's because villains are cooler. actually, it could be long-simmering resentment towards the not-highly-regarded alpha team/ dino attack sets bubbling forth. see dr lucky's hilarious post here for an example of what i mean... i'm sure the new agents will learn to fight back soon

0 very nice review riddler!

1 nice review, thanks! i really like those little go-kart thingies, they've got a fantastic mario kart look to them

0 thanks for the review... ill probably get one copy of this set. mr. freeze and his cart look neat. i dont like the huge wing on the back of batman's buggy so ill probably mod that out.

1 grevious, on may 23 2008, 09:54 am, said: indead. the only reason to get this set is if you couldn't afford the batcave back in 2006 and want a mr. freeze fig for a cheap price. and anyone who did get that kit really have no reason whatsoever to get this. i'll get it, i admit the vehicles are extremely poorly designed, i mean really poorly designed, but the mr.freeze fig is fantastic, and i would buy two of this set just for him, as his head and gear are very useful for mocing. it also comes with some nice pieces, like the grappling hook, little wheels, exhaust pieces and such. still, a pretty bad set build wise, but it has atleast inspired me to make my own batbuggy thanks for the review theriddler, appreciated. batbrick away!

0 as others have said, this really is a set for those that didn't buy the batcave. thus i want it! the cars are pretty horrid though... thanks for the review ???theriddler???!

0 hollisbrick, on may 23 2008, 02:39 pm, said: thanks for the reveiw the figs are bloody great! but those cars are a bit... well i'll put it blantly, retarded!!! although they shall be good after some modding! and whats with that grapple hook? does it even have a rope, so i guess batman will hokk it to mr freeze so his ride looks more ugle anyway, can you pleese take some pics of the figs i'll do! and do someone also another review of the 7888, the tumbler?

0 thank you, the riddler! ) for this highly informative review. despite the fact that i still consider it to be one of the weakest sets in all batman line, i guess that now i may even get more than one of these for the same reasons as batbrick. ) good day, gentlemen! )

1 thanks for the extra pics, i don't think you could have gone into much more detail than that! nice pics of the joker van too, will you do a review of that one? batbrick away!

1 in actuality, i think that this may be my favorite batman set of all time. i know, i know - it's a small set with crappy tiny vehicles; so it probably sucks for the fan who likes to display sets; but look at the mocing side and you see this set has a ton of potential: -new batman fig. well, mainly the torso; but it looks nice, sleek, and armored! a definite plus whether you're a mocist or batfan. -mr. freeze. because nobody bought the batcave when they should have...and by nobody i mean me. plus, i love that head! -cheapest way to amass the lightning piece. the other sets that have it are lolhueg (well, not really, but i don't have $50 to toss around on a little skeleton tower...), and it's a great piece. -two little blue gems. i may be alone on this, but those are my favorite parts (the gems), and that's my favorite color for them! <3 <3 <3 -several other useful parts, including a +o piece in black, some light/medium blue bits from mr. freeze's kart, the oddly placed grappling hook, and some cheap wheels. now, i don't know about you guys, but this is as close to a batman battlepack as we're going to get, lol - i'm buying at least three, maybe more once i get my summer job ^.^ (oh, and the fact that the us price is only $10 helps a little, but this year you guys can't complain - you got practically every set first, especially the new castle! t.t) ~trexxen

1 looks cool, one of the best in this line. cant wait for review!

1 chrome..... can't wait for the review, deino!

0 yay! can't wait for your review. i plan to get this and the giant truck. the brick rat, on may 23 2008, 07:31 pm, said: 2)this set contains the best lego sound brick ever (it's just begging to be incorporated into my arkham asylum). what is a sound brick?

0 mr. mandalorian, on may 24 2008, 11:58 am, said: what is a sound brick? ditto. maybe its like the exo-force light-up brick, only with sound instead of light. that would kick [innapropriate word deleted].

0 the brick rat, on may 23 2008, 10:31 pm, said: 1)my set came with defective instructions. in 2 places pages are missing and duplicates of other pages repeated. for instance, the car instructions are missing steps 16-21. fortunately, i was able to make out what pieces went where in the missing steps by studying the illustration in step 22. i hope you have better luck with your instructions. everything was just fine with my directions. sounds like you just ran into some bad luck there, my friend. quote 2)this set contains the best lego sound brick ever (it's just begging to be incorporated into my arkham asylum). i agree 100%. and i didn't even see it had a sound brick until i read this last night. usually lego promotes stuff like that pretty loudly on the packaging. not here though.

1 wow! thanks, deino, for this great review! i can't wait to get this myself, but right now i gotta save for the cw sets! the car is with no doubt one of the most mind blowing things tlg has come up with and we can only hope that there will be more models made out of almost only metalic colors! the spider cyborg, while not as innovative as some of the other cyborgs, is a very nice fig, and his head will be very usefull for splinter cell mocs! and those intake pieces are only relatively new btw, they are in almost all of the current $10 racers sets. any chance of you taking a pic of a line-up of all the silver parts in this set? edited by oky wan kenobi, 24 may 2008 - 11:32 pm.

1 i love it ! fun, playable, cool looking, and killer minifigs! sweet!

1 wow, thanks for the great review deino this set is really a must have for me. the sound brick seems great, the helicopter looks very nice and the car is superb! all of the james bond features are really cool, though i'm very interested in how the ejector seat works (or doesn't work..). the car itself is very sleek and full of beautiful silver, and the inclusion of the new rims and windshield mean that i won't have to buy many speed racer sets. as for the minifigs, they all look great, especially spyclops. though it looks rather easy for him to fall off of his spider legs. can you confirm this? a great review of a great set, thanks deinonychus

1 thanks for the awesome review, deinonychus! this really is a sweet set, a bit expensive a set for me, as i only get the cheaper non-castle sets, which is a shame because i love that head! it would be great for some more cyborg troops. the car is awesome, i didn't expect it to have that many silver parts, that's fantastic! heaps of play features too, that ejector seat mechanism sounds interesting. thanks again for the sweet review! ~peace

1 wow great review thanks! this set looks absolutely great!!!! but i'm afraid of the price oh weel i'll just get the 2 smaller ones. i'm really liking this theme! well done tlg

0 es.jpg 47.94k 110 downloads the ejector seat a long technic axle runs the length of the front of the car. it comes in to the seat area here and nests into the gray joint which is attached to the small gray technic beam. the beam is attached to the ejector seat (bottom white 3x2 plate) with a technic pin. the seat, in turn, is attached to the side of the car with a technic pin. the result is, when the axle is pushed forward, the gray joint and beam tilt the seat and "eject" a minifig. after about 20 shots the minifig only went outside of the car 3 times...the rest of the time he just bounced around the inside of the car. so they get an a for effort, but an f for execution

1 great review deinonychus i really like it! can someone record the sound os the sound brick(maybe on youtube?) i really want to hear it. this sets are really cool deino can you post a picture of the agent card it comes with?

1 thanks for the review!!! it wasn't "really" a request but more of an imply to do it anyway great review! can't wait til these come to aus. probably when the rest of the castle comes out in september though

1 thanks for the review i wanted to see what was in this set looks good! is it sold in stores? edited by mammymarf, 25 may 2008 - 03:38 pm.

1 thanks for the review whitefang! your additions look great, i like your mace much better than the use of a small technic cog, your looks much sturdier. and that helmet looks really great on skellie soldiers, i never thought to use that before. very cool indeed! ~peace

0 thanks for the nice review whitefang! i got the knights bp just for the scared face.

-1 i don't think these new skeletons do it for me, but thanks for a good review

1 great review for a great set! man i loved the adventurers although the new indy sets are good they will never match up to johnny thunder! most of all no stickers great review!

1 i'm gonna start searching ebay!

1 this set is awesome .......... gr8

1 great review voltio, i never actually owned this set but my friend does, he gave me some of the peices, but he burnt the base (don't know why)

0 so i just piced up a new digital camera and i thought what better way to try it than doing a review of my newest set. the new 7738 coast guard helicopter! itsmy first review, so go easy on me! lets start off with the small stuff. first the mini figs. you get 4 figs total. two helicopter pilots, a diver and a civilan to rescue. the torso's are nothing new on the pilot and diver. same ones as in the last coast guard line. but i like the colors alot better in this coast guard line than the previous generation. the yellow and blue really work well together and the coloring on the badge looks great! the civilian looks to be just a dock worker with an overall torso and a beenie. the diver has nice vented helmet and a pair of flippers that suits his duty perfect! next we have an absolute work of lego art. the rescue raft! the orange flaps can be moved back for easy entry to the raft, as well as the white "support" beams with the caution tape. i put support in perenthaces cause they really don't support anything. just there to fill in the gaps. at the top of the raft is a red locator beacon, ccommunications antenna, and a cargo loop for lifting the raft. lets move on to the interior of the raft. not much here. but you can see the techinc beam that attaches to the top loop,and to the floor of the raft. so far this has proven to be very sturdy and has supported the full weight of the raft quite well. you can also see the white box that holds the equipment of the raft. here you can see the life saver tube. here's a shot with our dock worker peaking out the side. the raft says max ocupants 4, but with the storage box, that might be a tight fit. now lets move on to the helicopter! in my opinion this is one of the best helicopters tlc has come out with to date. i really felt they captured the look and proportions of a real coast guard helicopter. it uses a lower hull and tail section of the new airliner, and cargo airplane. it really seems to work well with this application. the engines have good detail using new "cheese graders" as vents, as well as the new engine stacks that come in the new speed racer sets. the rotors also appear to be new as well. lets move on to the cockpit. we have two seats for our pilots with a sticker sheet for intruments on a flat 4 wide plate. there's also an antena being used as a flight stick. another shot with our pilots at the helm. now lets moveon to the high lihgt of this heavy lifting machine. the med bay, and lifting winch. http://www.brickshel...icopter_020.jpg here you can see the winch arm at rest, along with the medical strechter. the bad part is that the med. strechter doesn't include the ussually included fold away wheels. here's a shot with the winch arm extened ready for rescue! in the second shot you can see the drum that the wire coils up in. it coils up via a recently new power functions "pull" back motor. to operate, just pull out the winch cable, hook on your load, and presse this orange button on the side... the bad part of the new power functions winch is that although its very smooth in its operation, its not very strong. it will only lift the raft a couple inches before it runs out of torque. it also has a tendency to want to pull the crane arm backin while its lifting. it doesn't matter if its a light load, or heavy load. the bay doors open on both sides for easy postioning of the figures and accses to the strechter. here we have our diver looking over his rescue-e. nice and roomy if you don't mind a crane arm being in your way!! at $39.99 and a peice count of 445, i felt this set was a great good considering what your getting. the raft construction is very creative and is probbly the highlight of the set by itself. the helicopter is probbly one of the best, if not the best helicopter tlc has ever came out with if you can get over its size. in a scale of one to five.... price- peice count- playability- design- overall- .5 i would have given it a full 5 out of five, but since the winch can't pull the raft all the way, it didn't fell it right. even with this minor flaw, i still highly recomend this set!

1 wow. i was skeptical of this coast guard line. though getting to see some detailed pictures of this set i really want to get get it. alas, i have not the money to get it and it isn't available in my town. oh well. maybe i can catch it on a sale at some point. good review!

1 nice review. a must have for my city collection.

1 great review! this does look like an excellent set; great chopper!

1 thank you for that fine review of a really excellent set, 5150 lego. i never saw a little 'juniorization' done that good before!

0 that's a very nice set. i'm having my doubts about getting it though still. the overall shape and size of the helicopter remind me of the real-life ch-53 military cargo helicopter. a very nice review. you've got the photography down very well i feel. perhaps a bit of nitpicking but at the end where you assign a rating, if you do a rating with faces (which is fine by me) you may want to seperate the faces by a line. otherwise it may become too crowded to the eye.

1 this is a very good review, thank you! but i have some questions about the grey new parts in the life raft. are they 1x1 like their counterparts with the clips or 1x2? and can they be held by a minifig by the handle? if so, these could be very useful for brick-build weapons & tools! also, i'm looking forward to some orange eta 2 jedi interceptor mocs now! who wants to be the first to make one? btw, which jedi has an orange eta 2?

-1 i'm rather fond of helicopters and have built many different types. this doesn't really remind me of any particular model, other than perhaps an eh. 101 merlin and even that resemblance is very superficial. just for the record: this is a sikorsky sea king and this is a sikorsky mh-53 (a derivation of the ch-53). the only resemblance i see with the former is the colour scheme and with the latter the fact that it's got a fat rear-end, sponsons and six blades. it doesn't matter though, because i really like it. the colour scheme is great, the shape is nice, it's got quite a bit of detail and i just have to get my hands on the cockpit window and those new rotor blades. when i first saw the large aircraft pieces a few years ago i figured they were very much single-use parts, but the tail end doesn't look too bad. pretty clever. i like the raft too. it really does look like the real deal. that the helicopter can't lift it really isn't an issue, because in real life they wouldn't lift the raft either. they'd use the rescue hoist to lift the occupants of the raft into the helicopter one by one (or perhaps in pairs). imagine a storm with a helicopter hovering over tall waves with a big fat raft strung from a cable underneath it. the raft would catch a lot of wind and flop around quite a bit, causing it to loose all its occupants and also yanking the helicopter around, possibly causing the pilot to loose control and crash. bad idea! cheers, ralph edited by ralph_s, 30 may 2008 - 11:09 pm.

-1 i noticed that you said the torsos are the same as the last line; the last line had orange torsos, this one has yellow torsos. -chuck

0 oke thanks for the tips, but you see that not blurry pics, i've taken them later, so now it will be totaly great pics! who want's the second riddle?

1 i love batman

0 looks like a nice set, thanks for the review! i can't get over how enormous the tumbler is, they should have made it smaller (the price too )i fthey did that and threw in a dark knight joker and henchman i would totally buy it. enjoy your new set! darthperson

1 i think this is a great set, great price and really detailed tumbler, which looks exactly like the tumbler in the movie. the only problem i have is the joker's hair piece.

1 i have been thinking about buying this set just for the tumbler, and now i am sold one more set for the shelf. great review!

1 i bought this off ebay, while not having been collecting space as a child, it was mainly wild west and city... i have decided, upon reading kdog's m:tron bar brawl mania strip in his space comic, to buy as many m:tron sets and figures i could find.. except i got distracted and bought some different sets as well... to start off with, here's a picture of the box: here's a general shot showing the entire set: a front view: the buggy: another shot of the buggy without the minifig: the flyer: the flyer without the minifig: m:tron crate with some equipment and hoses, i don't know the use of the hoses though : the cockpit open: the cockpit closed with the crew: the magnetic crane: another shot of the crane: rear view with hatch open: one of the side slots that can carry either the buggy or the flyer: top view of this excellent vehicle: excellent for getting spyrius or blacktron out of your way : final shot: excellent set, one of the biggest space ground vehicles and one of the best sets made by lego. undoubtably better than it's newer counterpart the mt-101 armored drilling unit.... a great addition to any collection and has a lot of cool neat features that make it have a lot of playability. simply excellent! five out of five!

0 great find and thanks for the review. inertia, on may 28 2008, 11:08 pm, said: undoubtably better than it's newer counterpart the mt-101 armored drilling unit.... care to explain why? personally i think that aside from the colour scheme the new one is far better. why? suspension, more enclosed cockpits, bug-like appearence.... i suppose it's a matter of personal opinion though.

1 great review of a great set. i always figured the hoses were welding torches (attached to jetpacks, yeah!) as the whole thing had the vibe of a mobile repair center. much like many of my favorite sets, this one has a base of simple bricks and plates and then from that solid foundation the rest is built out to be decorative or have the action features. this gives sets a very solid feel as demonstrated in this set, the first snowspeeder, and galaxy explorer. the mm armored drilling unit has a more technic base giving it a less solid appearance and though i like the set, that jet that luanches from the back is horrible, partially because of the useless orange containment things. the mega core has a nifty crane instead of a big useless jet. -tohst

1 thanks for those wonderful pictures and congrats! i think buying this on ebay was a good decision! i have no m:tron sets at all, but i like the mcm very much. it's just a wonderfully big set with many nice detials. lots of playing possibilities! i wish i had it too.

0 cp5670, on may 28 2008, 08:52 pm, said: first time i've heard of that. what are they going to do for the train couplings? new couplings are going to be available soon. there is a thread with pictures of the new couplings here.

0 thanks for the review, maybe i can pick one off ebay.

0 zero1312, on may 29 2008, 08:22 am, said: thanks for the review, maybe i can pick one off ebay. yeah, i got this for only like 19 pounds, pretty cheap. it's a great set! cp5670, on may 29 2008, 08:55 am, said: it looks like you're right about the old magnets. i got a few off pab two months ago but they no longer have them. i guess i should grab some while they're still widely available on bricklink, as they can be useful in a number of situations. on a side note, one interesting thing about this set is that it seemingly had two us/canada names, mega core magnetizer and multi core magnetizer. brickset, lugnet and all the other sites i've seen call it mega, but i have some north american catalogs from that time period that call it multi and the box also says multi on it. i actually didn't know the mega name at all until many years after the m:tron line. hmm... i've never seen it listed as multi, but now i guess it has three names, strange that m:tron is basically the only space theme that had different names depending on region... clonecommando007, on may 29 2008, 10:11 am, said: this does look alot better than the new mm drilling tank. great work! yeah, i should take a comparison, yet the boxart on the mt-101 was pretty cool. sinner, on may 29 2008, 12:29 pm, said: thanks for an answer. i'll shut up now so we can focus on your review... it's okay, i have a question kind of not related to the review.. is there still a space review/moc index now that docking bay has closed? thanks again!

1 i really enjoyed the nostalgia review of the m-tron mega core magnetizer. this was the first wave of space lego i didnt get when i was a kid, though i remember looking at this set in the shops. i stopped with blacktron1 and space police. i look forward to more reviews once your ebay stuff arrives cheers isc

1 thanks for that fine review of a really classic and impressive m:tron set, inertia! tohst, on may 28 2008, 04:55 pm, said: the mm armored drilling unit has a more technic base giving it a less solid appearance (...) yeah.... its pretty sad, some of these new sets just look very cool at the outside, but appear to be hollow and blank at the inside, especially with the annoying use of studless technic beams. to mod these sets often means to change the whole inner frame, leaving us with a bunch of imho not really very useful parts. its not a very honorable marketing strategy to produce set designs thatre aimed to look impressive and cool on the box art, butre pretty useless in their inner structures. of course i dont want to offend some technic lovers, and although i always was more the system kind of guy, why cant they just use some technic beams with studs at least? i grew up with 'just imagine', with pictures of alternative models on the box, and i dont think its that easy, especially for younger kids, to mod some of these terrific blown-up sets like it once was with sets like this one here.... implosion off!

1 this super set contains many of the city sets you can get for your mini city hospital. the smallest set is the 7902 car with a doctor. i thought it looked a bit too slow. here is a car you can build with the same bricks. the instruction manual for the ambulance does contain a picture of an alternate model, but it is actually quite hard to build something significantly different. this sets lacks some snot-bricks, so i had to be a little more creative and came up with this ambulance. it is more a hearse than an ambulance. the helicopter has a lot of slopes, so i built a speed boat for those special emergencies. unlike the first two sets, i used far from all the bricks in this. this set does really have some great parts. the brickshelf gallery with some more pictures. is anyone up to the challenge and build some alternate models of the last set in the super pack - the hospital?

1 a great and very creative work, i especially like the speed boat and the smaller car, just splendid!

0 thank you very much asuka, but i get the hint. last.

1 these are great! i especially love the speed boat and your ambulance reminds me of ecto -1! (i would take you up on your challenge but i don't own the hospital. it seemed overpriced to me...)

1 brilliant, a huge amount of creativity there. to do what you did with such limited piece counts is exceptional. they're at least as good as most of the alternate models lego show on sets.

0 what a showman!, guess you have to get in before someone else does the review! looking forward to the review....

0 darn i was going to review this set. i gues my review will be second.

0 i look forward to seeing the review. novelty sized hammer on!

1 a very nice review, thanks deinonychus. that batcycle looks pretty neat.... like a hells bats angels version of that tumbler, a really nifty idea. the truck looks simply sweet, a smooth design and, this time, tlcs new habit of vehicle oversizing just works very fine. a wonderful and very comical vehicle indeed! and harley.... oh my, this bill ill have to pay for myself.... clonecommando007, on may 30 2008, 02:22 pm, said: truck: flick fire missiles!!?!?? lego have you no sanity! sure they're great but you're putting them on every single action set!! yeah.... this starts to become a little annoying. these things simply dont work in a that much satisfying way.... when i was a child all i needed to play with my mfs were some old fashioned classic space blasters.... zoom zoom, zzzaaap.... honestly, do they really think that this tiny rockets deliver that much fun?? just imagine on!

0 thanks for that great and creative review! ) could you, plese make a picture of hq's back? ) goiod day, gentlemen! )

1 thanks for the review, great set, definitely the first of the batman sets i'll be getting. i love the truck and the batbike isn't as bad as i thought it was, a win for me. batbrick away!

1 this set looks really fun! the figs are sweet, can't wait to see that jester in the flesh. of course, the jester i'm talking about is the castle one but that doesn't mean harley isn't a sweet fig! thanks for that awesome review, deinonychus! ~peace

1 hi all, so i was at "the wal-mart" yesterday and had the munchies and was looking for something to eat. somewhere along the line, i stopped caring about food and decided to browse the toy department to see what they had lego-wise. usually, they have jack squat, but on this particular day they had a lot of new sets. i impulsively picked this set up, along with harley quinn's hammer truck and the new little campsite from the indy 4 line. i must say, when i first saw images of this set i wasn't exactly thrilled or anything. i mean, i didn't really see anything particularly special about it, but after purchasing it, i must admit that i would consider it a must buy for any lego fan. but enough babbling about myself. onward with the review (my first of an official set)! in this picture, you can see everything you get with the set. i thought the box-art was pretty nice looking. the manual, on the other hand, took somewhat of a beating within the box, a common problem with most more recent sets. i do have to say that i wish they would at least make some effort in fixing this. they could just make a little thin cardboard "folder" to minimize bending and tears. for batman minifig collector's, the highlight of this set are the robin and penguin figs. previously, you could only get them in the pricey bat-cave set, but this set provides a much cheaper alternative. one thing you will notice, however, is that robin's hairpiece is a new mold, as it is actually a black version of mutt's hair (from the indy 4 line). personally, i think it actually looks better than the hairpiece used on the older version of robin. as the batcave had before it, this set comes with some bricks to make two cute (but deadly) penguins. they help add more charm to an already charming set. when you're finished building, you'll end up with a nice little assortment of extra parts; 1 black "cheese slope," 3 1x1 tile (black, yellow and white), a revolver, a technic pin, and a 1x1 red round plate. here's robin's scuba jet. it's nice and sleek looking. notable parts of interest would probably be the green turbine engines. my only complaint on this one would have to be the use of decals on the 2x2 round yellow tiles. for that type of a part, printing seems as though it would have been the best way to go. now for, in my opinion, the best part of the set...the penguin's sub. this set has more decals than robin's scuba jet, but they seem more necessary in this case. i actually wanted to put the decal's on the sub, as i think the it looks great with them. obviously, it looks like a penguin, but wow, does it ever do it with style! it has a lot of interactive features, the first of which i will mention, being the periscope which raises up and down. and for the collectors of parts in new colors, it has a few parts in medium orange?, such as 2x2 tile. here's a shot of the bottom of the sub. another nifty little feature is how you can lift the top off and fit the penguin inside. and there is enough room inside, so that you can firmly place top on again, and without interference to the movement of the periscope. another little feature is the rear spring-loaded missile. you just tilt the small lever toward the front of the sub, and it fires. and the last small feature are the flick-missiles on each side. overall, this is a great set with a lot to offer for a decent price. a lot of fans might view the only drawback to it as being the use of decals, but if you plan on keeping the kit together they make it look really fantastic. buy it if you can. matt edited by imperialshadows, 01 june 2008 - 11:42 am.

1 thanks a lot! ) i've already ordered it but now i'll be waiting for it even more! ) thanks! )

1 thanks for the great review, brickadier general! the sub looks very nice, and i like the idea of a raising periscope (did the batcave sub have that feature?) and the details on the sub look very nice. the inclusion of the penguin, robin and two of those great brick-built penguins really confirms that i'll be getting this, considering that i didn't purchase the batcave. however, i am rather dissapointed that this set is so similar to the vehicles of penguin and robinin repectively in the batcave set. i feel that it only really caters to those who havn't bought the set, and i would've much appreciated different vehicles. overall, a very nice set, perhaps the best of the 2008 wave, despite it's lack of originality. thank you very much for the review bg

1 set: 8635 - agents - mobile command center pieces: 1154 price: $us89.99 those dedicated agents. they've fought chainsaw-armed villains, battled radio-controlled cyborg crocs, chased pallets of badly-stored golden loot and wrestled killer sharks with vicious, toothy grins. finally they've caught the notorious dr inferno and imprisoned him in their cavernous mobile command center. but dr inferno won't go down without a fight! can the agents stop the evil dr 'disco' inferno fleeing? will spy clops laser gun burn through the door in time, or will dr inferno simply use the lovely agent trace's enormous ponytail as an escape ladder to freedom? more importantly, will there be a riot in the streets of lego city as afols go apopletic at the thought of a 12 wide truck roaring through their ordered town layouts? stay tuned! part 1: the box, instructions, parts as the largest of the agents sets (so far), the box is easily the biggest. trainee agents, examine the following three pics and see if you notice anything odd. box front: box back: box middle: spot it? that's right. the printed cardboard which has supposed to be the bottom half of the fold out middle section is on the back, slicing the ultra-large set image which would form the foldout in half . the way the cardboard is printed as one piece before it's folded i think this would be very hard to do 'accidentally' so suspect a major stuff-up somewhere along the production line. i bought this set off bricklink so would be very interested if anyone in the states who has seen these boxes actually on the shelves can tell me if this is common or rare. basically i want to know if i should be annoyed that the bricklink seller didn't list this in the set description, or are they all like this? the instructions come in 4 booklets. the parts list comes in at 5 pages, which is a lot even at half-size pages ! large images of the parts inventory are in this folderwhen moderated for anyone interested. here's also some cute agents-type artwork at the end of one of the books. instructions show piece call-outs and are divided into sections according to numbered bags. as you'd expect for a set with 1100+ parts, this baby comes with a lot of bags. it's a treasure trove of dark blue. as well as the obvious large slopes and wall panels which make up the body and the roof, there is a wealth of smaller navy blue pieces as well - small 1x1 bricks, 2x2 bricks, 1x1 plates, 2x2 tiles, heaps of 2x plates, some slopes, 22x cheese pieces... basically anyone wanting a lot of dark blue should think about this set. the roof panels alone, for example, could provide a dark blue sea for a modernised pirate moc. 2 dsss (dreaded sticker sheets). quelle surprise - stickers! the grey parts of the stickers here are metallic silver ink, which is a nice touch. actually, as sticker sheets go, they're not too bad. fairly subtle for the most part and the navy blue actually matches the bricks themselves. however, after looking at the sticker sheets i thought i was missing something. what about the pieces used for the projection screens showing dr inferno and the sharks - why weren't they on the sticker sheets? there must be another one! frantically i checked and rechecked the box and flipped through all the instruction manuals to find the elusive 3rd sheet. where was it? ten minutes later i noticed something which had honestly never occured to me - there were actual printed pieces in this set! so obvious and yet so unthinkable. it's horrifying how years and years of exoforce and speed racer set releases can mentally condition people's thought processes. tut tut, lego. what have you reduced us to? here they are, folks - actual printed pieces. (yes, i do believe this news deserves the caps.) i also noticed this nifty modification of the usual 2x3 cupboard - you can now fit drawers in it! very clever. this may have been around in belville sets for years for all i know, but it's new to me. the drawers slide in and out very well and the top one sits on slight indentations in the middle of the cupboard. part 2: the figs! our trusty agents - charge, chase, trace and fuse. (high powered agents don't have time for names of more than one syllable - that's why the bad guys always lose ). chase and fuse have the mutt hair in black and dark orange. the lovely agent trace has an exquisite new hairpiece in dark brown, perfect for 'rapunzel' themed mocs. as you can see, her ponytail is loooong. makes it hard to sit down, the poor girl. i feel sorry for all these female figs with such intricate hairstyles that they can never relax in an ordinary lego chair. however, at least she has two breasts unlike the recent harley quinn fig. compensation indeed. seriously though, it's great that there's a separate torso print for the female character and this attention to detail is typical of the set as a whole. three of the agents have reversable heads - nice touch with the headsets and i like the id cards on their pants. obviously the agents security system is based on some kind of crotch measuring device. this would make sense considering the conspicuous bulges in the pants of dr inferno's men (see the other agents set reviews.) the villains - spy clops, dr inferno, gold tooth. dr inferno's hair in all it's glory. this is a great piece, although the orange colouring is a little rough on the front. it's so 3d, it deserves a back and side view (and indeed eb thread) all of its own. as mentioned elsewhere, this is different plastic to the normal minifig hair, but it doesn't quite feel as soft as the exo-force hair. it doesn't fall off as much, anyway. the figs get 10/10 from me. awesome hairpieces in great colours for the agents and a sleek navy blue/ neon green uniform. the villains' faces are great and they are all very distinctive. the attention to detail is outstanding and it's great to see a lego in-house theme with characters as memorable and cool as figs from the licensed themes . part 3: the build the build is divided into three stages - the small vehicles, the front of the truck, and the massive command center section. (a) small vehicles first up, all the small vehicles. we have a small flyer, 2 buggies, jet ski, and a speed boat - all in glorious navy blue with little bits of silver detailing. top view. these vehicles are all simple, small and well-designed. probably the weakest is the flyer, only because the cockpit looks a little large. in fact, the small flyer is probably the weakest element of 8365 overall, which tells you how good the set itself is! in various threads here, this set has been heavily criticised for being way out of proportion. there's a reason for that, as we shall come to. however, the existence of these small sets should appease some people. with the new coast guard sets, for example, all of these save the flyer wouldn't look out of place on a city beach with a little modding. here's an example - agents beach party! (spongebob couldn't help but crash.) the villains only have one small vehicle, but they've been well-served in the smaller sets, and this one is a unique and clever design. i love the triangular shape and the simple but clever technique of making the arch slopes meet up around the propellers. it's sort of insectile in black and orange, and looks very different from the usual assortment of helicopters etc. (b) truck front this thing is a beast! seriously, look at it. it's chunky and mean looking. you don't want to mess with this baby. the build is really nice. like a lot of star wars vehicles, it's all based on technic beams pinned together. unlike a lot of mars mission sets, underneath isn't all technic beams with some plates slapped on like a facade. the majority is a lot of plates and bricks which all fit together solidly. you can see from the detailing of 'cheese grater' slopes and silver pieces on the front how effort has been made to give this vehicle a distinct feel different to other lego sets. sure, the silver slope mirrors might be a bit too much for some, but this baby is all about attitude. you can imagine it roaring down the road en route to dr inferno's diabolical lair! after all, these sets are 'agents' sets - nobody said they were *secret* agents (c ) command center - whole assembly here's a view of the whole thing assembled - inside and cool details to follow at the end. it's kind of hard to show here as it is extreeeeemely long. this is indeed a big set. the build for the trailer part of the command center is fun and very satisfying. yes, there are large pieces but there is also a huge amount of detail. it is also solid as a rock. i remember being annoyed building the big ferrari truck a few years ago - everytime you looked at it, an 8 x 16 plate fell off. the mobile command center is solid - even with the hinged roof and special features, it is not delicate at all. kudos to the designers, again as it is mainly a brick build rather than a technic one. i also like how the command center part connects to the cabin - it's not a special piece at all, just a technic axle going through two circle plates, but it works and it's solid. (please note i've been selective about which stickers i've applied during the build.) top view: the rear: here's an example of why i like the build: (a) the designers have enough sense to put a ladder so a minifig can climb up to the interior when the command center is open (b) notice that although the ladder clips at the top, there is an *extra* clip there in the middle purely to hold it in place so it doesn't flap around and holds firm. i don't know if most designers would even think to put a ladder there let alone go the extra mile and put a mechanism to hold it in place. pure class. oh, and notice the greebly detail stuff to the right there too. the other side. this is probably the other weak part of the build - the bricky gaps at the top where the hinge to open the roof sits. it's a little gappy but the set is so big you don't really notice. (d) and now for the fun stuff - inside and neat details! ok, so we've built the thing. it's big. it's blue. the top of the trailer itself would make a good warehouse moc for a harbour layout. but what about inside? is it any good? what about all those small vehicles from the start of the review? where do they go? well, i'm glad you asked. because the solution is superb. the small flyer folds slightly and slides into place here: lift off the roof and you're away! the large buggy and the speedboat go under here: the jetski slides out of the rear here, attached to its own little platform: and the small buggy goes inside the main cabin. there's even a crane so you can lift it down. so now we know why this set is so large! to fit everything in! it's amazing that this functionality doesn't affect the aesthetics of the set as a whole. but we still haven't finished on the details. the front section has a very easy-to-swing-open roof section and missiles: there's also a command section underneath the bit where the flyer lifts out: and now for the interior. i have to say i really like this space. not only is it packed with great stuff, there's also enough room for minifigs to move around. i hate bases where the figs only have about 2 studs to actually stand and walk. aquabase invasion is a nice set, for example, but the actual functional space inside the base is teensy. claustrophobia! you know within a week they'd be fighting to toss each other out of the airlock. no such problems for these suave agents, who have plenty of legroom *and* the ability to launch missiles from their ceiling. the whole of the interior: zooming in: moving from left to right. first off, the medicine cabinet. looks like someone's been leaving secret mission dossiers lying around. the projector area for mission briefings. dr inferno recently changed his hair colour from purple to orange, it seems. why are all these minifigs so obsessed with their hair? the projector folds down when the trailer is open. push the button and the light glows on. now dr inferno's hair is orange again! this is one of my favourite parts of the set. it works a charm. the batteries for these lightbricks can also be replaced - instructions are in the manual. agent charge considers shark-fin soup for dinner. did i mention these projection panels are printed? the detail is very fine too. the tool section. laptops sit in the middle compartment. you get some flippers, yellow scuba tank and various implements. i'm so impressed that the helmet is pearl silver with a different coloured visor too - there's so much variation in the parts in this set, you don't get the sense the designers are using the same thing over and over to save money. it all feels luxe and top-of-the-line, just like the command center itself. two laptops - yay! the aforementioned rooftop missiles: the dr inferno cage. nasty electric shocks! bzzt! (you can see my reviewing skills are burning out now - sentences.... truncated...) another example of detail - nowhere else in the set is a 1x1 transgreen tile used - they could have used a 1x1 trans green cheese wedge piece as there are others in the set, but they didn't. how does dr i get out? flick that lever on the right hand exterior and the door pops open. spy clops the loyal minion awaits his master on the other side. and there we have it. take a bow, guys! there's a lot of spare parts. a suspicious amount of dark blue small slopes but i checked the instructions and didn't see anything missing. i have to say, i do like the new policy (since speed racer i think) of including these small slopes as extras. part 4: overall rating if you've made it this far, you've got more stamina than dr inferno's army of cyborg animals themselves! as i said earlier, this set has drawn criticism for the size of the truck. however, large vehicles do exist - i grew up in a wheat farming area and as a kid the size of the lorries that thundered past carrying grain was probably intimidating to me as this monstrous espionage machine is to the good citizens of lego city! on top of that, it *does* contain a plethora of 4-wide vehicles inside ! criticism of this set on the basis of size to me also seems misguided as this is basically a playset - and it is a very good one to boot. as you can probably tell, i love it to pieces and wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone, whether for parts or for play value. check out the parts list in this folderwhen moderated and you can see just how many excellent pieces it contains. a light-up brick, a flood of navy blue, metallic silver bricks - we're spoiled. 8635 is also an enjoyable build, with fantastic figs and top-of-the-line detailing. in a year when i've found city a bit disappointing after the run of great sets in 2006-2007, the agents line has been one of the surprise hits for me and i can't wait to see what the designers come up with next. edited by svelte_corps, 02 june 2008 - 12:46 am.

1 i see you've also learnt to call dibs. looking forward to seeing your review!! edit: oh, i see! i just arrived early. a truely fantastic review, you make me not want to pass this set up, even though i can't possibly afford it without leaving my beloved castle collecting. it really looks like a fun set, so many neat vehicles, and two laptops, i can't wait to see what other sets we'll see them in. thanks again, great job! ~peace edited by iamded, 31 may 2008 - 09:56 am.

1 me want this set

1 that's an awesome review. and a great set, it seems. with all of this year's star wars (i still haven't got rogue shadow) i can't afford agents too, which is a shame looking at this.

1 omg! thank you, thank you, thank you! you made my day! so that means dr. inferno's hair isnt rubber! but one question, is it like that weird funny soft plastic like the ants from indy 4? please answer

1 great review, thanks! that's one hell of a set. i think lego has reached a certain kind of peak with the design, cleverness, and fun of this one. i'm so relieved that agents seems to be shaping up to be even better then i thought it was going to be...and i thought it was going to be cool to begin with. agent "charge"? not only does he look like dash justice, but he has the name of one of dash's alpha team squadmates? i call shenanigans!

1 these new sets are just totally off-the-wall radical :d. it's the little details like the scoops on the blades and the alternate alien energy source (lego didn't even have to include those, but they did!) that show lego are really getting back into their groove this year. the ability to add power functions is just so cool as well, i'm going to pick-up the creator monster dino set for the electronics when the sales hit as svelte has suggested. a very entertaining review, just like the agents mobile command center one :d

1 isn't it a lovely set? i too have one. (modded, of course )

1 svelte_corps, on jun 3 2008, 12:09 pm, said: the only thing is... just don't torture that poor jelly i smell another "dont hurt the dragons/jellies" or something group nice reveiw i dont realy like the mm sets [we want more starjustice/space skulls!!!!!!] but this one looks ok i guess suprised they dont say that it has power functions on the box

1 really nice review! i love those sweet looking power functions on it, if only the orange bits could be replaced, then you could have a futuristic and motorized jungle cutter anyway, the alien bit was disturbing, but the overly-tall new commanders look very, very cool! all in all, a great set, but i won't be able to buy it, because, in a few days, s@h will become 600$ richer and my wallet will writhe around in pain on the floor.

0 well, title says it. the description, you'll understand later. i ordered this off of s@h last tuesday, and oddly enough, it's listed on s@h as mx-81 hypersonic airplane... i'd like to apologize for the random, horrible, faded pics. i took the review outside, and the clouds kept shifting, changing the lighting, and then i had to go inside because it started raining. it's been raining for a week. it's raining now, as i type this. so, i foolishly went outside to take pics. the front of the box. not bad, as far as boxes go. it features a lift-up tab... ...which shows the various functions. back of the box. still not much to say... two manuals. i think this is just right- not too thick, but not too many manuals, either... oddly enough, the box came with a little folded up piece of paper telling us not to mix the bags. it comes sorted into 4 bags, by the way. minifigures the set features 3 normal mm figs, 1 normal jellie, and one of the new commanders. i really like this guy. he has a few issues, like his hands being stuck sideways, and still being hollow, but still a great improvement. he'll make a lovely addition to any halloween moc. stickers the set comes with a fairly big dss for the spacecraft. pretty normal, but i do like the dragon sticker. then, suprises of suprises, a technicolor sticker sheet for the aliens! how cool is this, huh? the tops of the actual stickers are shiny, which is hard to see in the pic. even the bottom is shiny! who said stickers can't be cool? the mining craft the little guy is pretty cute, and well built. my only gripe is that there's nowhere to spin the drill! it seems so lifeless without a feature... the alien craft you'd think a commander would be important enough to have a seatbelt, rather than be stabbed with a clip and stuck on the ship like those other grunt aliens... i think this thing has some potential. shiny stickers, different body shape. and when you look at those engines, this thing could be an alien corvette! but then you look at the back. pretty bare, no flares or anything. it's a cool little craft, but it just...lacks. the modules these things have some potential, as well. with some modding, they could be pretty cool. unfortunetly, it's pretty boxy, there are no engines, and the wings are too small. the top is pretty nice, though. the greebles are all right. the controls, as usual, are a sticker. pretty spacious, mind you. the cockpit doesn't stay flush with the body, though. the front plate underneath it can be easily replaced with a brick to fix that. ...i'm not gonna comment on this. the main body too bad. the 'labratory' isn't much of a lab. a trans-red panel and some tray thing are all that compose the 'lab'. i was expecting more, but true to form, this mars mission set has no impressive interior to speak of. there is a lot of space, though, so it shouldn't be hard to mod. phew! the lab folds up like so. pretty simple, and would allow access to the lab, if there was one. and then we have this thing. what is it? defense laser? communications array? satellite t.v.? the modules connect like so (sorry, out of place...): too bad the pins stick out... various pics... as you can see, this thing has more of those bars than an at&t commercial... (there, you understand the topic description now? ) the rear. it uses a white city plane wing for the...wings. when i first saw the prototype pics, i thought they slanted downwards... that would've been really cool. ah, now to the platform. from the position of the drill, i think this could be a really cool turret location when i mod it to more military space. back to the bars. if we had space monkeys, they'd love this. this set has more bars than a jungle gym.( ) here we see the button that drops the platform. pretty clever, and it's not in the way. best of all, it really works! really well, actually. good job, tlc. 2 more bars and a shooter mechanism. jeeze, this is really setting itself up for a joke. a shooter mechanism walks into a bar... never mind! here we have the handle that allows you to pick it up safely. a good idea, but it's placed waaaay to far back, way off the center of balance. you have to hold on to it pretty well to keep it angled up, though it does stop your hands from getting in the way of the platform. ah! the platform in action. this is really a neat little feature. not only can the ship land in a reduced footprint, but it also prevents the nice white paint job from getting red dust all over it... it's centered pretty well, too, and you don't have to worry about knocking it over, just don't shove it back at all. here we have the latch. when the button on top is pushed, this gets pulled inward... ...which pulls out of this hole and allows it to swing neatly down. good luck, and happy mining!! again, sorry for the lack of in-progress review. i would've liked to take pics of the mechanism and so on, but typical of the mm sets, you can't really take it apart. well, this is really a nice set, which can hopefully be upgraded with a better lab with little difficulty. some of my military mod plans include: -strip the lab and install a command center -get rid of lots of bars. the thing has more bars than alcatraz. -install some turrets. this is a big command ship, so why all the forward-facing weapons? it'll need some aa defense... -mod the landing platform to be a troop dropper with installable aa turret. -mod the cockpit pods to be more aerodymic. so, that's all folks. shall i include one last "bar" joke?

1 thanks for the review, mr. mandalorian! this is an, er, interesting set. lots of frontal fire-power. very big too, and i like the idea of those two little craft that attach on the sides. sort of like little escape pod things. anywho, not one of the things on my to buy list, but i do like that radio-active sticker, that could come in use. looking forward to seeing your modifications, too! ~peace

1 thanks for the review mr. mandalorian. the alien craft is a bit small in my opinion could have done with being just a little bit larger. the main craft however despite its few minor flaws looks very good. while space isnt my normal theme im certainly being tempted this year.

1 iron moose, on jun 4 2008, 02:34 am, said: that certainly feels like an homage to the deep freeze defender... which itself feels like an homage to the galaxy commander. thats the observation i had when i saw the first pictures of this set online a few months ago. i am a proud owner of the 6973 deep freeze defender and 6980 galaxy commander, so i'm looking forward to see how the 7644 stacks up next to them. there is a definite lineage here, and these sets clearly demonstrate the evolution of lego set design over the years. the mx-81 may not have the most playability out of all the new mm sets (although it has alot from what i can tell), but its hard to beat the look of a large sleek space cruiser sitting on your shelf or dresser, at least for myself. anyhow, this is my first post to the forum and hope my welcome won't wear out here anytime soon. edited by spacefan, 04 june 2008 - 06:43 pm.

0 thanks for the review. i have to concede this does appear to be the weakest set of the summer mm lineup. i've noticed a trend that the larger sets have plenty of parts potential but when assembled the model is not more than the sum of the parts... eagle base certainly didn't seem worth the asking price, at least this is one large model. on a positive note the lame aero tubes, darts and martian carrier pods have disappeared. don't get me wrong, i love mm and most of the lineup is great, this one just seems to fall a little short of the bar.

1 algernon, on jun 4 2008, 09:34 am, said: i don't understand why there's so much negativity... this is actually my favorite of the new mm sets. the finished look is very sleek and not very gappy at all. the deployable landing pad is great, and it'll make it easy to put on a shelf without taking too much room. lots of greebles... although i will concede that it's just begging to be modded. still, though, i'm definitely buying this one. :) it has a really great look to it! i don't understand the negativity either, one man's treasure is another man's trash i suppose. that said, having grown up with lego during the 80's this set has a certain nostalgia factor in its overall look and feel that harkens back to that earlier period in my life which i fondly remember. aside from the factory star justice set (elements of which i loathe), i expect the 7644 to be the closest thing to a classic space revival that we'll ever see again from the lego group, but i hope to be pleasantly suprised someday. though i'm not living in the past, and do appreciate everything lego is doing now and will do, and has done since. and, like you, i'm one who's definitely buying this set. no matter how few of us there may be.

0 iron moose, on jun 4 2008, 02:15 pm, said: do tell. (i'm being curious, not confrontational. ) well, first and foremost like many other people i'm no fan of those dreaded unprinted minifig torsos and stickers. but also the cost to piece ratio of the set, it just seems too expensive for everything that you get, such as too many small parts and a lighter than usual piece count for the price. though if it had included printed minifigs and other elements, i maybe would of been able to swallow its 100 usd cost a little easier. but star justice is still lego space in the most classic sense thats available today, and i will probably pony it up just because... anyway, i hope were not breaking forum protocol by not discussing the 7644 review of the original poster or that particular set in general.

0 i'm looking forward to getting this set, as well. the hippogriff will become the valiant steed to my princess minifig for her comic adventures. i'm really annoyed that the harry potter sets were released during my "dark age". i so would've wanted all of them.

-1 seeming as there were no reviews of this set in the index i have uploaded mine from jabbas hutt . here is my review for lego set 10178 motorized walking at-at because i live in the uk i got this set with 6 free duracell batteries which was great! (it's just twice as expensive as the us) heres the basic set that is from the instructions. this is the cockpit but please note after i took this photo i realised it was slightly built wrong. heres one of the feet in proportion to a minifig to give you a general size. this is luke skywalker swinging on a wire trying to destroy the at-at i really wish lego didn't make so many luke's because i want differnt minifigs. it would also be nice for a thermal detonator piece. underneath the at-at you can see the shaft that moves the back legs, the motor and squeezed in on the righ t the massive battery box. a load of cogs that move the legs. these are the included figures snowtrooper, general maximilian veers, at-at driver/pilot or whatever you want to call him and luke all whithout there wepons. please note veers should have a dark stone snowtroooper torso with 4 red and blue badge things not 3. these are the figures with weapons i gave them and the included ones snowtrooper has new style blaster, veers has standard light grey pistol like the ones from the old adventure sets, at-at driver has old style blaster which i call heavy blaster and luke has shiny handle blue light sabre . the shiny blue light sabre was included with the set which is a bonus because i really dont like the grey ones. http://www.brickshel...sc00521.jpg.jpg this is the switch which is attached to the battery box on either side of the at-at underneath the lift up side panels. you push the forward to walk forward and backward to walk backwards simple eh . a front veiw with the the panels open. here are the drivers controls which are simply a cotrol panel and 2 exo-force robot hands which are joystick things seen in the film if you look closley. the almost useless carry handle. this is the weird back piece. looking down the at-at from the back where you can see the the battery box and switch. troops decending from ropes and cables and vader leading the assult for this i hadnt got any more imp's so i used clones pilots. (i now have a whole load more snowtroopers) solo and chewie sabotaging. more troops to squash rebel scum huzahh! a very bad picture of everyone packed up inside. the size incomparison to its predecessor overall i would give this set 9/10 because it should come with more snowtroopers or it could be and endor version with loads of strormies and scout troopers. aswell as this you can really sit any one down because of the battery box but i stilll find space to put all the shown figures on this review in the interior as you can see on the above image the chains and ropes are hanging down a bit. tjis set is now limited to 5 per customer in the uk and now no longer comes with free batteries. the walking on this is a bit wonky and dosen't really walk like they do in the film as it moves two legs at a time. i am currently attaching a motor to the head to make it move independently.

-1 nice review, i have the original at-at and i like it a lot. considered buying this one but it being motorized made me not. also, i think a set this size could really come with some more snowies! benny

0 smith_boy, on jun 20 2008, 06:01 pm, said: i doubt that. the atat was used in the clone wars. well you never know, maby veers was around then, just because it was used in the clone wars dosent mean that veers didn't design it. to wookiepedia!

1 thank you for the review, skipper. i never got this set because it was too expensive, and motorized. it completley reminded me of the old robotic toys called zoids, or maybe even gundum. at least the figs are great. a chrome lightsabe hilt for luke, ecxellent. and the pilot is cool too, and another snowie doesnt hurt. and i didnt even know about the commander guy (whatever you call him), so people could have made a custom ds this whole time?! thanks again!

-1 even though i never liked ucs, i absolutley hate this one. sure, its great on display, but the build looks extremley boring to me, just stacking plate after plate. and as you said, its going to break a little if you touch it. the only intersting part for me is the firing laser. although i do have to say the proce isnt too bad, i still wouldt buy it. and no minifigs so thanks for the review, but ill pass on this one. the new minifig scale ds looks awesome though, and this might have hyped some up who are buying the new ds,

1 great review kimt . i like this set (even if i dont own it) because it looks simple fantastic to display. i just have one question: the mini executor can be moved around the death star ii or its attached to that place? thanks for the review .

1 morten_sonne, on jun 25 2008, 03:36 am, said: it will be interesting to see the size of ds2 ucs compared with the new death star playset. i was thinking about the same!!! as for the review - thanks!!

1 great concise review kimt, though its not for me, you held my interest all the way through! thanks isc

-1 i think it's a very weird and boring ucs set, but... what a lot of grey plates! you could build something much better out of them, but it would be fairly flat. it looks very fragile though , my ucs at-st is... edited by shoc, 25 june 2008 - 10:28 am.

-1 wow, what a letdown. i recently picked up this set, and i looked up this review to see what i was getting into. not good news. the silver lining is that it was a "damaged box" deal at brickworld, so it only cost me $100 (half off the already lowered price) so it was definatley worth it as a parts pack, if nothing else. it's the last unopened/unbuilt "large" kit in my collection, so even if it is repetetive, i am going to build it anyway. it is likely however that i may substitute pieces to do away with the colored interior. i've already determined that after it sits on display for a while, i want to do a zepplin as an alternate build. looking at the parts list it looks like its the perfect set for such an undertaking.

1 dang! so much negativity on a such spectacular set! this baby provides an amazing backdrop to any lego inspired star wars diorama. and lets face it lego tends to be a rectangular brick and somehow we now have a sphere!!! guys... its a ucs. it accurately depicts the on screen icon and put plain and simple is a wonderful sculptural piece of work in its own right. i agree with kimt in that the removal of the laser and super star destroyer gives it more authenticity but to call it a gray golf ball or ignore its inherent accuracy is simply to miss the point. it proved to be the best build to share with someone, be it family or friend due, to its repeated sections and impressive finish. its a clever build and to criticize it for lack of playability or (i suspect for many) its absence of minifigs is just absurd and possibly why lego has not released a proper ucs in nearly two years. i reckon many out there would love a ucs tyderium, imperial walker or slave 1 with a spectacular piece count be it minifig scale or just darn impressive in its own right. sadly for those who love these sculptural masterpieces we're stuck with simple toys with 'play features' and cute minifigs. clever in their own right but lacking the clout and purity of the old ucs line. let's hope some diversity of product is just around the corner else 10179 was the last of the truly brave financial gambles of the star wars line....

0 neoconagenda, on 24 june 2015 - 11:29 pm, said: i decided to re-read this review because i just got this set today. i dont really have a concern over the design or repeating build process because owning this set was never an option for me as i collect ucs sets... but i am surprised to see an almost total lack of positive posts. i really hope that i enjoy this build. hi, you may find this thread interesting, i really enjoyed bricklinking it

1 i've just ordered the bits for this from bricklink (i'm awaiting the final order now) so i'm interested in these comments. i can see that, since i'll be building it with the kids, i'll have to plan in plenty of breaks and do lots of parallel building to keep us all from getting bored!

1 7656 general greivous's starfighter release: 2007 number of pieces: 232 minifigs: 1 brickset welcome! this is my first review, so contstructive critisism is very much appreciated! on to the review: first, we start out with the box: the box art is the same as always since 2006. nothing special. then we start the build. the build is fairly easy, and will take the seasoned builder about 15-20 min to complete. here is the finished model: and bird's eye view: as you can see, this ship is very sleek. the fins or "wings" each have an outer slope and an inner one, with the guns in between. there are also cones on the front of the fins, which give the ship an even more sleek look. in the middle of the wings there is the main body, with a big slope and stripes decorating it. this set has a very good playability factor, as i'm about to show you now. the guns on the ship are pretty cool looking to begin with; a bley slope attaching a lightsaber hilt and a trans-neon green stud to the fin on each side. but theres more than what meets the eye: yes, the guns flip up! ...and they can flip all the way back to hide them, for whatever case they need hiding. lets have a look at the back, there is a tail fin used as landing gear and some lightspeed boosters: but wait... the tail fin can flip up for flight thanks to a hinge attached to the back of the cockpit. heres another playability factor: the cockpit can slide open very smoothly and easily. heres how this is possible: a clever system under the hood allows the cockpit to open. see those two bley pieces on the black ones? those bley ones attach to the tan plates under the hood, and the hood and windsheild attach to the black peices. the black and bley pieces work together as a sliding system, so the cockpit opens. viola! and then the cockpit snaps in place thanks to the red hook and clip. its a very accurate system, and works very well. you'll want to open and close it over and over again! now, finnaly to the fig: the general himself. a very impressive fig, with a new head and torso mold. in this set, (which is one of only two with greivous in it) he comes with 2 green and two blue lightsabers, all with bley hilts ( ). i was hoping for chrome hilts, but its a minor fault. grievous also comes with a new mold pistol blaster (not pictured). heres the general in the cockpit (sadly a weak cockpit, no details): he just half lays down on a small slope. in this set, he doesnt come with a cape beacuse with it on, the cockpit doesnt close. thats about it, heres the... final verdict: build: 7/10 fairly easy but fun. a little bit weak. playability: 8/10 many playability factors, but some are boring or pointless. swooshability: 8/10 very fun to fly around, sometimes pieces break off. minifigs: 10/10 one amazing fig with 4 lightsabers and a new blaster. what more could you ask for? design: 9/10 very sleek, but hardly any real texture. i like it, but others might want greebling. price: 10/10 overall score: 9/10 a very cool ship with a very cool minifig and accessories. one of the best sw sets i have ever seen for its small price i highly recommend it to any kind of sw, lego, or sw lego fan. hope you enjoyed my review, please leave feedback! edited by jimbutcher, 15 september 2008 - 03:01 am.

0 you should have posted the entire review up! i am about to look at the gallery for the rest of the pics. edit: as soon as i post the images came thats weird. nice review, is there more it says i'll be back? good first review! edited by skipper 24, 26 june 2008 - 09:11 pm.

0 the set no longer looks as ugly as i've always thought. thanks for the review - i might have to pick one up now to go with the magnaguard fighter.

1 that's a neat little set. i like the design of the fighter. thanks for the review - it's been keep it up kimt

0 hey, thanks for all the feedback, guys! ill try to do the sith infiltrator this weekend.

1 great review! i would get the set, but i'm saving for the clone wars sets.

1 hello all eurobricks members, i will be doing the second wave of the 2008 impulse set series, which had released recently. i bought this set earlier ago, and will like to share this comprehensive review with everyone of you. name: troll warrior theme: lego system / castle year: 2008 pieces: 19 minifigs: 1 an image of a 5618, troll warrior let the march begin the mighty brave troll warrior, carrying a dangerous cart equipped with a "flick" fire missile. marching into the lands of the crown kingdom. crown knights must be ready for this new troll addition. from what i see, this set has a very minimum piece count since it's an impulse set. there is no unique parts found in this set. however, this set has a couple of useful accessories, such as 2 spears and 2 wooden wheels and a grey mouse running around. this set is another alternative for castle army builders to buy multiple sets, to build a massive troll armies. in addition, the flick missile really works. use a little bit of force from your finger and flick it, the missile will fly. well, it certainly does not impress me at all with such playing feature. base of the cart different angles there is one thing i dislike about this set. the wooden wheels are too big, and it is the same as the ones in the crossbow attack. i prefer the smaller wheels that exist in old castle sets that produced smaller cart. since this cart size is similar to the old cart size. the old wizard's cart is a very good example of the proposed wheel. bits and pieces close-up on the warrior and the mouse summary review playability: 5.5/10 (the playability feature is not fanastic.) design: 6.5/10 (design is adequate. if the wheels is much smaller and the flicking thing disappear, the score will be much higher) price: 8/10 (an inexpensive set to get a troll warrior and a mouse.) overall: 6/10 (to conclude, this set is good only for army builders. a new range of millitary vehicle to be added. that's all) hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine. comments and critics are strongly welcomed. pictures can be found in my brickshelf (when moderated) edited by kimt, 10 august 2008 - 01:29 pm.

1 ah, sweet! thanks for the review, whitefang! i hope this set shows up in nz soon, i can't wait to get my hands on it! troll warrior on! ~peace

0 whitefang, on jul 3 2008, 04:06 am, said: now, will there will be a dwarf impulse set in the future? i supposed that will be much interesting. i certainly hope so. i only have one. hollisbrick, on jul 3 2008, 10:25 am, said: thanks for the review, cant wait til i get this comes to oz! hey, i'm still waiting for somewhere in the uk other than tlc itself to get the first wave of impulse sets...

0 whitefang, on jul 3 2008, 04:06 am, said: i thought by calling it as a "mouse", it will be a little much friendly unlike calling it a rat. why is mouse friendlier than rat?

1 guys, thanks for your kind comments. it seemed most of us here love this impulse set, mainly to build army. guess, i am a little bit too critic in my review. i was expecting a little bit more! nevertheless, i intend to buy multiple sets of this and build on my orc armies and split them into different battalions. this is indeed one of the better ways to acquire orcs. wilhelm screamer, on jul 3 2008, 11:30 am, said: i got two of these in the mail today and was so eager to do a review of it. thanks for saving me the work. opps, i was eager to do a review as well, when i bought these sets. i hope you enjoyed reading this comprehensive review. nikola bathory, on jul 3 2008, 04:08 pm, said: hey, your review is great (as usual!!) as for the set itself - well, it's an impulse set after all - small and cheap, nothing special. well, the rat is special, hehe, for me the rat is the most interesting in the set (cause i don't have a rat). i don't have a troll warrior either, but i'm not very interested. give the new theme a chance. i feel tlg have made an effort to revive certain elements that are present in past castle themes. although it is not as good as the past, but it is certainly better than the recent castle themes. shoc, on jul 4 2008, 01:00 am, said: why is mouse friendlier than rat? well, mouse sounded more friendly, because it can associate with tom and jerry. but, calling it a rat equal calling it a pest.. it's just a matter of putting it in different terms. that's all. edit: instead of posting another post to explain why i used mouse. i will write it here. tom and jerry is reflected as a cartoon. children associate jerry as a mouse, since its supposed to be heart-warming and make us laugh. in real life, there are many different pets we raised. one of the possible pets we considered is a mouse. mouse are supposed to be shy and friendly creatures that live in harmony. while rats lived in packs, hunt food in the dark and is widely regarded as a "pest". in this review, i am trying to illustrate rat and associate it with mouse by presenting it in a much friendly approach. there is no right or wrong answer. it's just making use of different words to represent how i feel towards a particular thing. edited by whitefang, 04 july 2008 - 08:08 am.

0 whitefang, on jul 4 2008, 05:43 pm, said: well, mouse sounded more friendly, because it can associate with tom and jerry. but, calling it a rat equal calling it a pest.. it's just a matter of putting it in different terms. that's all. the thing i dont get is how jerry is friendly

1 this is a nice way of building up orc armies, but i do wish it was designed like the knight impulse set. there you have a minifig, enough weapons and armor for two figs and a weapons rack made out of basic pieces. add a generic fig from your collection and you have two knights and the pieces from the rack can be easily used in mocs. the pieces that make up the siege weapon in the orc impulse are not as easy to use in other creations. i'd rather have seen a "orcish" weapons rack (different from the knights rack, but like it, using basic elements) with a second helmet, another weapon, the orc armor and a shield to put on it. still, although not as good as the knight impulse, it's a nice little set. whitefang, on jul 4 2008, 03:43 am, said: tom and jerry is reflected as a cartoon. children associate jerry as a mouse, since its supposed to be heart-warming and make us laugh. in real life, there are many different pets we raised. one of the possible pets we considered is a mouse. mouse are supposed to be shy and friendly creatures that live in harmony. while rats lived in packs, hunt food in the dark and is widely regarded as a "pest". where i come from people keep both as pets. however, if either are found in the house uninvited, they are considered pests. and if you look at the chinese zodiac, rats are very well thought of and are symbols of prosperity. the brick mouse rat

1 thank you for the review. the set is nice, i didn't need the flickfire missiles and would have rather a orc/trol shield instead, but i think i will pick one up.

1 hello all eurobricks members, i will be doing a continuation of my impulse set reviews. i was pretty excited when i laid my hands on these new impulse sets yesterday. hope to give most of you a good insight for this set. name: street cleaner theme: lego system / town / city year: 2008 pieces: 22 minifigs: 1 an image of a 5620, street cleaner let the cleaning begin the street cleaner has a job to do. it is to clean the rubbish on the streets, after a new year countdown. it seemed the cleaning agency have a new equipment to use. it's not as big as the previous street sweeper machine. the cleaner will need to operate the equipment manually, by pushing it. look at the mess after sorting out look at the pieces offered. it's not a very complicated set, since it's an impulse set. there are some pretty useful parts lying around such as the broom, spade. however, i was quite surprised when i could not find the lid of the rubbish bin. i can't used this rubbish bin to place it around my town, without a lid on top of it. i believed it is not a norm, by not including the lid. look at that bin well, that rubbish bin seem to be containing his equipment in it, instead of the rubbish. the cleaner's face looks pretty sad. i think he wants to have a change of job. front view i love that blue brush very much. quite fun to play with, especially pushing the rubbish aside. that's why a spade is there to help him to dig out the litter and the broom to brush it away. ok, now i know why his face looks so sad! where is that street sweeper machine? summary review playability: 6.5/10 (not bad to play with) design: 7.5/10 (the design is relatively interesting, with the use of the technic part, to be its foundation.) price: 8/10 (an inexpensive set to get another cleaner and some neat accessories.) overall: 7/10 (not a bad set after all. pretty average, but still quite good to buy if your towns required more cleaners.) hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine. comments and critics are strongly welcomed. pictures can be found in my brickshelf(when moderated) edited by whitefang, 04 july 2008 - 03:44 pm.

1 thanks for the review . not a bad price (of course, its impulse) for a fig, a little cleaner thing, and two accesories. the brush, fig, and spade i dont have yet, so i might just pick this up.

1 looking at this is making me want to build one of the favourite sets of my childhood, 6649 street sweeper (might do that today actually). cheap. good pieces (despite the lack of a bin lid... that's just inviting disaster isn't it?), nice fig, and one of those blue brushes, which i've always loved but never managed to use. thanks whitefang.

1 hello all eurobricks members, i will be doing a continuation of my impulse set reviews. this will be the third review at a go. hope everyone of you will find this review useful in a way. name: coast guard kayak theme: lego system / town / city year: 2008 pieces: 21 minifigs: 1 an image of a 5621, coast guard kayak roll roll, roll your boat it seemed the coast guard has a kayak of his own, roaming in the sea, making sure that swimmers will be safe in the beach. now, i am illustrating him as a life guard instead. this set is simply wonderful. among the 4 new impulse sets, coast guard kayak is the best looking set in my opnion. the kayak design is very simple but looks realistic . furthermore, if you don't need it to be a coast guard kind of stuff. use it as a leisure water spot instead down in the marina. i will think any lego citizen will love to have some water spot in their busy life. so come down here and wind down with this new sport. bits and pieces kayak and the bouy the bouy is very useful to position it at the coast of your water to highlight the boundaries in the sea, and warning incoming ships or vessels. oh, i did not make it tilted purposely. there is a white round base which allow it to tilt on both ends. useful parts these parts are useful to add on in your city. somehow, when i see that red cone, i can use it as a police stop, to inspect vehicles on the road or form a barricade with it. the bouy base shape is unique too. i like it very much. it is great to attached it by the side of the boat as a life bouy. the coast guard's life vest and helmet are very useful for water activites. the life vest was produced in past sets, and now it re-surfaced again. i am glad these vests made their way back. a look of him, without the life vest summary review playability: 7.5/10 (fun to play with, especially the bouy when you see it moving up and down.) design: 8.5/10 (design is simple but straight to the point, especially the kayak design.) price: 8/10 (an inexpensive set to get more coast guards and more kayaks.) overall: 8.5/10 (a very good set to have in your lego town. the kayak is simply so lovely to me.) hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine. comments and critics are strongly welcomed. pictures can be found in my brickshelf (when moderated)

1 whitefang, on jul 3 2008, 03:18 am, said: this set is simply wonderful. you know, that's exactly what i thought. i love it! it's simple, well designed, and cute. there are some nice pieces in there as well, and i really do quite like the fig- the new coastguard torso looks great. thanks!

1 hello all eurobricks members, this will be my last impulse set review for the second wave. hope everyone of you will find my reviews useful and helpful in your purchase. name: crystal hawk theme: lego system / mars mission year: 2008 pieces: 26 minifigs: 1 an image of a 5619, crystal hawk alpha 3 in sector 5, reporting to base alpha 3, crystal hawk, reporting for duty, sir! may i present mars mission, latest scout craft, code named "crystal hawk". this spacecraft looks very sleek and cool with its usual white and orange color combination. i am not a fan of mars mission, but these white mini-figs simply attracted me for it. in fact, i only owned its impulse sets, and none of its main sets. nevertheless, this set has the "swoosh" factor. i was swooshing around in my home last night. well, i am not swooshing it like kimt though. am i seeing double? haha, the answer is "no". it has double sided face. i combined the pictures, to illustrate the two facial expressions. bits and pieces different angles love the way how the wings bend upwards and downwards. the only thing i find it a little bit wierd for spacecraft. normally, i thought joystick is the typical navigation controls for a spacecraft instead of a steering wheel? i am not complaining about a steering wheel in a spacecraft. to me, it's quite an uncommon sight. anyway, the white steering wheel is an useful part for making vehicles mocs. summary review playability: 8/10 (fun to play with when you bend the wings up and down.) design: 8.5/10 (design is simple, but creates a sleek and cool look.) price: 8/10 (an inexpensive set to get more scout craft and mars mission mini-figs) overall: 8.5/10 (a very good set to have for any mars mission fans, and for collectors like me whom can't afford all mars mission sets, this set is a very great alternative.) hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine. comments and critics are strongly welcomed. pictures can be found in my brickshelf (when moderated)

1 nice review good little set probable one of the only impusle sets i will be geting untill/if they make agents theme impulse sets and i like the neat double-sided face edited by darth_legois_619, 03 july 2008 - 10:35 am.

1 i really like the look of this impulse set! even though i sold off my mm sets to buy sw i kept my astro fighter and this impulse set really appealed from the moment i laid eyes on it. i feel the swooshability and cool extras like the double sided face far outweigh the lack of cockpit. thanks for another great review whitefang!

-1 honestly i'm too much of a space fan to be interested in this set. i'd rather have the sub. good review though. :d

0 awsome review dude im proably getting this though the main downfall is there is hardly an inside

0 ah, great review! i have always wanted this set since it came out, but with the price, i think i will get the mobile command center first. this will need serious interior mods, like i did with my dino attack chopper(pics soon).

0 great review!!! realy thank you svelte_corps! maybey you can put al the agents villains round dr. disco like a sort of dicussionroom or something...just an idea undersigned mowo

1 thanks for the review svelte_corps, i have yet to purchase an agent set but i think that will change shortly. i am not a big fan of the stickers but the huge laser gun, the unique minifig design, and beaucoup trans-orange pieces have me sold.

1 omg iamded's torso! [ spoiler] oh my god!![ /spoiler]

1 when i got this set, my first rock raiders set, i thought it was the best set i ever had. maybe that was a little bit of an overstatement, but i like a lot, the pieces mainly, and this is a nice little review! are92 rowar, on jul 10 2008, 08:22 pm, said: omg iamded's torso! [ spoiler] oh my god!![ /spoiler] what would be more appropriate is commenting on iamded's torso saying "omg jet's torso!"

0 unfortunately i dont have any other sets yet, i think i got one of the bigger vehicles back in the time, but i don't have any sets from this time anymore. but i certainly plan to get the loader dozer and/or the chrome crusher soon. i found an ebay auction where somebody is selling the sets 4940, 4950 and 4970 new & sealed hopefully i have luck with that. it's only at 4 euros right now, but it's still running 6 days... http://cgi.ebay.de/w...t...a:it&ih=005

1 great review . man, this brings me back! i still have like 5 of those rock monsters. in response to your statement, rock raiders does belong in this forum, being everything space related. 1) it's on an alien planet 2) in the computer game's start and in the story (yes, there was a computer game-my cousin has it) they are in a space ship 3) there are huge alien rock monsters trying to kill them.

1 rock raiders was one of my favorite lego themes ever.

0 7663 sith infiltrator year: 2007 number of pieces: 310 number of minifigs: 1 price: 29.99 usd brickset hello everyone, and welcome to my second review on eurobricks, the sith infiltrator! lets start with a pic of the box, shall we? as you can see, its a limited edition set, meaning the fig and set could be worth a lot in the future. this set takes about 20 minuets for the seasoned builder. an overview of the infiltrator (also know as the scimitar): as seen in the picture, this ship is very sleek, with very few studs on top (snot= studs not on top). basically, its the cockpit with two wings (with two "fins" on each wing), attached to the hull. heres a side view of the scimitar: very cool- looking! it lands on two "feet" in the front while the cockpit rests on the ground. rear view: the back. the outer cockpit is beautiful, a printed piece on the back (no dreaded sticker sheet! (dss)) and a large printed disc on top: heres a look at the middle: there is a flick-fire missile (trans-red cone attach to technic pin) on the inner wing, a trans-red lightsaber blade in the back of the hull, and a trans-red lightsaber blade in between the fins on either side. all of those lightsaber blades may come in handy... hey, look: the fins open from the wings!: the fins open due to double hinges on each fin. unfortunately, you have to hold the ship up in order for the bottom fins to open. now, lets have a look inside the cockpit: to open, you lift the back printed part, which is attached to the printed disc on top, which is attached to a hinge. it opens pretty smoothly, but is somewhat loose, so sometimes it closes on its own. also, the disc isnt secured well enough to the door, and often breaks off, even with the smallest movement to it. inside, there is an elevated control panel and two sliding pieces near the floor. this ship also comes with a small speeder bike: its very cleverly built, and is a really neat addition. see that clear disc on the bottom? it fits perfectly into the sliding pieces in the cockpit: hmm... whats this?: a hidden compartment! now this was a very cool idea by tlg, a secret compartment found by taking off the top slope of the hull contains darth maul's weapons and tools which include: a (chrome!) lightsaber hilt, a pair of electrobinouculars, and three probe droids. a closeup of a probe droid: just a plain, black minifig head with a black lever on top. finally, the fig: darth maul in the flesh plastic. a good fig altogether, with a black hood and lightsaber blades taken from the ship. he did come with a crisp, new black cape (packaged in a small, white cardboard box), but i am currently using it for another fig. note that this is a limited edition fig, so stock up. a comparison pic of the two mauls: the 2007 version is on the left, and the 1999 version on the right. note a few key differences between the two: the new one has smaller red tattoos and a smoother torso. also, the new one has bigger eyes and a more cartoony look. maul on the speeder bike: of course, he fits perfectly in the cockpit wile sitting on the bike, and he can reach the controls: well, thats about it, here is the... final verdict: build: 8/10, easy and fun, breaks every once in a while. playability: 7/10, this set has many features, but is very fragile between the cockpit and hull and between the two cockpit pieces. swooshability: 1/10, too fragile to fly around, plus the flick fire missiles fall out. minifigs: 9/10, a great fig with a chrome hilt and a double sided blade. a little cartoony. design: 7/10, very clever techniques, very sleek, but very fragile. price: 8/10, fair enough, could be a few dollars cheaper. overall score: 6.5/10, a very sleek ship with clever building and play techniques, but very, very fragile, and shouldnt be picked up off of the shelf too often. and with that, my review is over, but all of yours are not: comments and thoughts very welcome!! edited by jimbutcher, 15 september 2008 - 02:59 am. indexed

0 nice review jim, i think i would only buy this for darth maul though you definitely showcased all the cool features really well!

0 i got this set last year. and i think you made a mistake when you have remove a piece to access the probe droids and equipment, you just have to slide the entire main part. and i have a question, is this equipped with the new flick-fire missiles that don't fall off?

0 thank you for the nice review. i like the design, although i didn't want to buy it. the new little speeder is very nice, but maybe a little to small.. darth mauls eyes are looking a bit more dangerous now.

-1 i'm not real fond of slimeface. he looks too much like the joker-bombs. i was hoping for something newer. the slime printing is a nice touch though. steve

0 svelte_corps, on jul 11 2008, 09:14 am, said: i would have liked it if they'd gone all the way and made it some kind of giant robot jellyfish or squid *cough*alphateam*cough* anyway i was about to reply earlier and say : great review svelte then i realised it was not you nice reveiw anyway! the only reason i would get this set would be if i got all the other agents sets + all the sw cw sets + all the pieces i need on bl + all the new city ect.. sets....then i would think about geting it

1 darth_legois, on jul 11 2008, 10:28 am, said: [color="#0000ff"] *cough*alphateam*cough* i'd forgotten about ogel's mutant vehicles i guess i meant a bigger cross between the 8636 sub and the big squid from 7775 aquabase invasion - that is such a great design. sort of keep the retro feel but make it bigger. with the 8636 sub, there's really only room for one agent to sit and despite its size, there's just a few (not amazingly great) functions such as the hidden chest and missiles.

0 it was 34.99 so usd its likely to be $45-$55 i would imagine.

1 nice review, thanks! tlc is really going all-out with the agents theme. i wonder if it will last longer than one year (unlike other recent one-and-done themes). my only real criticism of the theme is those freaking stickers. my god, look at the size of that dss in this set!

0 great review!! really thanks i slime face, even slimey as my slime sense nice that break jaw is also in it! undersigned mowo

1 aside from the price, i love this set! when i saw the prelim pics of agetns i did not like the theme, but all the sets are starting to look more attractive now i can see the cool features and details! as for this set, i really like the bad-guy boat for some reason and the submarine looks good - i love the dark blue colour.

1 i forgot to comment on this review! great job rezourceman, like svelte-corps said your pics really show off the set and what there is to it. i just ordered this and the volcano base off s@h and i can't wait for them to come, so i'll comment on these reviews i forgot about i love the inferno boat, as you say in your review it looks very heavy duty and ready to take on the agents. the sub i quite like from the look of it, though there is the problem of too little space i will try and correct that. the dark blue is especially good. and i love slime face, his torso is very cool. svelte_corps, on jul 11 2008, 09:14 am, said: i can't say this is my favourite agents set; the boat is a little oddly proportioned and the sub, although retro looking, has practically no interior and would be difficult to customise to put more in (unlike, say, the clever job batbrick did with the penguin sub in his review). wow, thanks for that little mention is it impossible or just very hard to mod? svelte_corps, on jul 11 2008, 09:14 am, said: i do agree with you about slime face - he has a fantastic torso with all the slime dripping down which is a bit obscured by the air tank. it's really encouraging that in the last 2 missions we've had great extra villains added in. the only thing i would add about the octopus is that the glow in the dark plastic is mixed in unevenly with the aqua blue, so it doesn't glow in the dark evenly - it's kind of like the mars mission jellies in that respect though much cooler! the octopus sounds great, thanks for that, is he meant to be on any side? i'm guessing he's a mutant inferno creature. about slime face, is his head much different to the joker bombs? i know he has slime marks on his head, are they very apparent? thanks again for the review! batbrick away!

0 batbrick, on jul 19 2008, 09:53 am, said: is it impossible or just very hard to mod? nothing is impossible to mod! probably the easiest part to change would be the front where the missiles are and the treasure chest slides out - you could make a sizeable compartment there. however the middle section is so narrow and the end fins are just that - fins - that it might be harder to expand without changing the shape of the sub. you'll find out soon when yours arrives! batbrick, on jul 19 2008, 09:53 am, said: the octopus sounds great, thanks for that, is he meant to be on any side? i'm guessing he's a mutant inferno creature. about slime face, is his head much different to the joker bombs? i know he has slime marks on his head, are they very apparent? it's not really clear but since all the other mutants are evil (or at least controlled by dr inferno), it's probably a safe bet the squid is too. slime face's head is different to the joker bombs - different eyes and teeth (although the smile is similar i guess) and the slime marks are much more apparent in the flesh (or abs) although they don't photograph that way. joker bomb face below for contrast:

1 great looking set. and that glowy blue octopus is really cute, i might just get it for that. be great in a space moc.. wondering, from the pdf instructions i saw, it wasnt clear what the agent in the sub is sitting on, hows his seat work? and it looks like theres a compartment below him...

1 6927 all terrain vehicle year released: 1981 piece count: 167 minifigs: 2 list price: $14.50 a very unique vehicle in the classic space collection was this "all-terrain vehicle" which i always considered more along the line of a mobile lab. the set introduced/infused white and black bricks with classic blue space pieces. the result was this great classic vehicle. the set includes two figs (still red and white): here's a view of the vehicle which is really two components, the vehicle itself and the lab section: i absolutely loved the the blue windshield slopes (2 included), and the unique upside-down large blue slope: in the back of the vehicle is the blue lab: the back section of the vehicle has hinges that allow the jets sections to open: the brick design fits perfectly into the lab, and when opened, the lab falls to the ground: note: the little round trans. red 1x1s allow the lab to slide up and forward when the jet sections are closed. i tried taking off the red 1x1s and the lab does not lift as easily with them. the design is very clever, esp. for a classic set. here's a shot of the stand-alone lab: unlike earlier classic space windows, this set has train window frames with yellow windows. the top of the lab lifts up for playability: inside the lab are several computers and a swivel chair: back to the vehicle, here's a shot of the cockpit with white steering wheel: the left side has an upside-down wrench and black antenna: the right side, a walkie-talkie and another antenna. the antennas can be used as breaks to keep the middle wheels from moving: here's ashot of the under carriage: and a final shot of the complete set: for those of you following my classic space reviews, this is review number 9 of 10. my final review of an-all time favorite will be coming soon. hope you enjoyed this review. comments are always welcome.

0 thebrickster, on jul 10 2008, 10:48 pm, said: for those of you following my classic space reviews, this is review number 9 of 10. my final review of an-all time favorite will be coming soon. no more of your great reviews? why? a good review right here, got into the thick of the set without becoming boring with an absence of pictures or not having enough text. this looks like a good set and i'd better catch up with the rest of your reviews, asap!

1 thanks for the review. this is one of my favorite space sets of all time. i even had 2 of them back in the days. my only complain about this set was that i found that the wheels where too small , i had some trouble passing the rover over the little "craters-mountains" of the space plates

0 quote great buy on this one. what did it cost you? it was $30, which was a pretty good price given the condition. it had no box or instructions though. this set is actually fairly common on ebay though, considering how old it is. i see them pretty frequently on there. quote it's a real nice set. however, there is one thing i don't understand about this design. why is the driver seat has a wide back with no cover behind? and, the command center has no door at the back? i understand that these space guys are always carrying their helmet around, for oxygen supply. i wonder if there is a better answer to it. i just modified mine to make everything fully enclosed: edited by cp5670, 11 july 2008 - 06:39 pm.

1 this set never got me as a kid. i suspect it was because of the wheels; i had mostly basic sets so it would have been more of the same. looking at it now i can see i have misjudged it, and i love the lab-lift method. i'm going to have to build this to see it in action! thanks for another great review.

0 great review! all-terrain vehicle was one of my two favorite lego sets ever. i have to include a shot of the back of the box, because i love the ideas lego provided for this set: hewman, on jul 11 2008, 01:11 am, said: very nice blacktron-themed 6927! cp5670, on jul 11 2008, 01:39 pm, said: i just modified mine to make everything fully enclosed: i love your modified 6927 with the enclosed front. 2 weeks ago i modified my all-terrain vehicle as well, in a similar way, but just *slightly* more modified from the original. i call it: 6927-c 'all-terrain vehicle improved class' a few clues for anyone to easily build this themselves: also, a much more extensive modification/moc that i call 6927-w "all-terrain warrior" quote 6927-w 'all-terrain warrior' i wanted to make a combat variant of 6927, so i used the 6927-c improved class as the starting point and went from there. i added a completely new forward-cab, close to the ground, for a ground--observer to monitor the terrain. i added even larger wheels, allowing this variant to truly be "all terrain", ...besides, what good is it having a combat vehicle if it gets stuck in the middle of a firefight? the 6927-w has a five man crew: a driver, a gunner who also serves as overall-commander, a terrain observer in the very front. in the lab are the weapons systems officer and computer/tech specialist. the all-terrain warrior vehicle portion is armed with lasers and blaster cannons, with options for other weapons. there are short-range nuclear rockets on the lab, guided by the rader control. the lab now has blast-proof shutters on the windows protecting the crew from rocket blast. additional protection can be added to the lab, if-need-be, such as more extensive blast-shielding. all-in-all, the all-terrain warrior is a beast of a machine. two 6927s can protect an entire convoy of standard 6927 or 6927-c. these are my very first attempts at modification and doing a moc of classic space lego! edited by parallaxscroll, 29 august 2009 - 03:03 am.

1 yeah, first time that i am getting a set before everyone.^^ first of all: the package the european version has no "limited edition" button. hooray!!! sorry for the blurry back-shot. we see the hospital back, a few bubbles with set functions and a little comic. comic: bubbles: the figures are injured spongebob, patrick and the new fish doctor. spongebob has a headprint... ...and a backprint (other than the normal spongebob). spongebob and injured bob: the set comes with two litters. the ambulance car is a bit extraordinary. i dont know how the car is like in the show (and i saw a lot of episodes) but it looks a bit strange, mostly because the weehls are too small. of course we get another ss (not so d this time). the litter fits in the back, with help of this lid. i wish it would be the hinge-lid from before 2004... now we come to the meanpart of the set: the hospital! the entrance has got babyblue traindoors and a hudge sign that shows "emergency". the tubes are nearly everywhere in this set. i was getting insane when i came to the part, where i must put the stickers on the tubes. this parts are very usefull, but i wanted that the set looks good, because i will display it. so i stickered just two of the parts and not all four. now we come to the interroir: the doctor has a desk with computer. sadly its not very well placed and he must duck because of his fin. next to the door, we get this little case, wash basin and two drawers. again we get stickers... not that i dont like stickers. its just: everytime i get to the part where i must put the stickers on, i think how i can re-use the model and if i rebuild the model, later and and and... i hate it to deside! a few posters are in it, too. the set is a great addittion to your own bikino bottom, but the playability is not very big for the kids. they can just play that patrick steals the ambulance car, like shown on the package, and is hitting spongebob. than the drive back, the doctor gives spongebob two medicines and let him go. i bought the set mostly because of the parts (tubes in lightbley and a few woodpieces). but i am thinking about let it stand in my little bikini bottom (just consist of crusty crab and chum bucket). playability: 3/10 figures: 10/10 price: 8/10 design: 9/10 total: 30/40

1 thanks for the review, looks like a great set. i'm surprised that spongebob's bandage has a full body headprint so kudos to lego for that

0 oh so spongebob was the injured one. i thought this set depicted the episode wherein mr. krabs was the one rushed to the hospital.

1 i love the sponge bob sets, i have all of them! nice review.

0 great review. as much as i hate spongebob lego, i just might get this set. it has a good number of useful parts, like the computer and keyboard, and all of the brown pieces. how much does this set cost in usd?

1 how much euro did you pay for it? it looks a great set, great interior, nice figures and funny posters. :) it's also nice: the newest spongebob sets are now also available in our stores and they are the coolest (belgium)!

1 nice review, the set looks promising.

1 i'm not a huge fan of spongebob, but this set i might want also have. maybe i can combine it with the city hospital.

0 my fish doctor has the torso from 7902 doctor's car, which is unfortunate, because the other torso is more stylized and cartoonish, i think. however, i did have that mad scientist lab set, so a bit of digging through my old collection will hopefully yield the better torso.

1 baby catapult you say? puts a basenet to shame! top review by the way, lego drink bottles for the win! edited by mrs pegleg blockbeard, 12 july 2008 - 06:37 am.

0 i was sort of hoping for a flick-fire baby. still, this looks decent, for what it is, i guess. obviously, it really is all about the accessories, and it's got 'em, but not enough to make me spend that kind of cash, and i don't even mind having a pile of pink parts around. if you throw in a complete turkey or some birthday cakes, it's a slam dunk, but as it is... eh. thanks for the review, though, it's very nicely presented and leaves no doubt in my mind as to just how easy this set would be to misuse for other purposes.

0 the lego lives on!! but you are one evil parent, getting your kids addicted to belville like that! but uh... whats that doll doing on the bed? whats underneath it...? and look what you found... a bucket!

1 a nice review with a nice touch of sinner which made me laugh. the playfull puppy set has saussages i think i would buy a playfull puppy, it has nice pieces and the puppy can also be used for minifigs as a big dog. why haven't they not made a saussagesseller for city. maybe in the future. there are already more chickenlegs in minifigs sets.

0 i'm confused... the finale of big brother australia was last week. so why only now are we seeing pictures of housemates brigette and ben performing a striptease? and where is rory in his signature g-string? very odd.

1 i bought this today, mainly because it was 25% off, but i'd been eyeing it for a long time. the accessories truly are brilliant! there's so much here to be pillaged for other uses, as people have said. i picked up heaps of new parts i've never had, or rare ones in even rarer colours. to be honest, i was surprised and impressed by the range and versatility of the regular bricks as well. when you look at the box art, what jumps out at you are the giant pink walls and curved pieces, but there's a nice amount of white arches and lime green bricks, not to mention all the windows and the trans blue 1x2x5 bricks. and plants! it's a good thing the target audience likes stickers though, there's more here than i've seen on any set except the 7709 sentai fortress! i think they were aiming for one sticker per page of instructions i hope belville returns in 2010 thanks for the review, sieggy! did your daughter ever go back to it?

0 svelte_corps, on may 23 2009, 04:54 pm, said: did your daughter ever go back to it? on and off. she's been building (very odd) spaceships with the big pink pieces.

0 siegfried, on may 23 2009, 07:02 pm, said: on and off. she's been building (very odd) spaceships with the big pink pieces. it will go nicely with your alien dump truck!

0 paanjang16, on jun 17 2009, 11:25 pm, said: belville looks horrible to me too barbie-ish and does not look lego at all. i think that is the idea! so that means you wouldn't think much of scala then?

1 nice review! i got over the gun problem with the shockie since the rebel in the y-wing doesn't need one. i wish i could have gotten more of these but i'll know for next time.

1 when i saw this topic i was like : "oh my god this set is out since 2007. this guy is so late!" but i read your review and this idea got out of my mind! thank you jim! i have 2 of these and i even have twice more droids than clones! i should have buy more but it's sold out now

0 thanks for the review very much jim! sooner or later i'll have six sets of this.

1 7654: droids battle pack. year: 2007 number of pieces: 102 number of minifigs: 7 price: 9.99 usd brickset hi everybody, and welcome to my fourth review on eurobricks. today, i will review the droid bttle pack set. note: this set originally came with four megaphone blasters for each battle droid, but i replaced them (along with the crooked arms) with the new blaster pistols and new twisted arms. a picture of the box: as it is on the shelves of major-retail stores. a small box, as expected for inexpensive sets like these. note the "build your army" button on the front: tlg obviously is encouraging customers to buy multiples, and with good reason, which will be explained later in this review. an overview of the set's content: you can see a droid carrying vehicle, a stap, and some battle/ super battle droids. a look at the carrier: a light tank. note the guns on the front: the guns and cockpit can turn a little bit left and right from the main body. also, the guns can move up and down, free from the cockpit: and check out the cockpit: two 2x1 center studded plates side by side for the pilot to stand on. now, moving on to the stap: a small, very useful vehicle in the sw universe. these are seen frequently in both the movies and games (as well as other multimedia). the design is very clever, using vertical building and a clear stand. rear view: the guns/ handlebars can go this far back: and finally, the figs: the figs are very good, but very common. we havent seen sbds in a while, and now instead of metallic blue, they are metallic dark grey. the worst part of this set is that the battle droids have the old arms and guns, while the droids in the mtt and clone pack (both of the same year as this) have the new ones. i wonder why tlg decided to do that... again, this set originally came with four megaphone blasters for each battle droid, but i replaced them (along with the crooked arms) with the new blaster pistols and new twisted arms. so thats about it, heres the... final verdict: build: 8/10, very easy, should take the seasoned builder about 5-10 minutes. playability: 6/10, has a few play feature, but nothing exciting. is good for mocs and army building. swooshability: 8/10, i suppose you could fly around the stap... minifigs: 7/10, the battle droids are good, but very common, and the dont come with new arms or guns. the sbds are very nice, and in a new color. all figs are great for army building. design: 8/10, the stap was clever, but the carrier was a little bulky. price: 10/10, as fair as it gets. overall: 7.5/10, the figs are great to have and make mocs and armies, and the vehicles are pretty cool (the carrier is a little lame). the main problem with this set is that the bds dont get the new guns or arms, so they dont fit in with all the new sets. also, droids arent as cool as clones. but the price is very fair. and now, my review has ended. unfortunately, i believe this will be my last review for a long time for two reasons: one, the remaining sets that arent done (according to kimt's index) i either don't have or are broken or have missing pieces. and two, my budget is low right now, and i wont be able to get the clone wars sets right when they are released, so someone will probably beat me to reviewing them. too bad, because i would love to do an rgs review... well, as always, comments very welcome!

0 thanks for the review. i want to add that the few parts which are contained in this set are very usable for own mocs. the rancor, on jul 12 2008, 11:11 pm, said: ...unfortunately the droid battle pack is discontinued for the uk s@h ooops - it's also not available in germany any more.

1 thanks for the review jimbutcher . i think this set is cool especially the cool redesigned stap i just it.

-1 hmmm.... i probably would not have bought this as a kid in 1987, unless i had money to spare or the shop had no other set from space or castle, the two other big lines in 1987, and no better set in the town section. i think it's a great parts pack, but the model itself does not look very attractive. i never really liked those wheels, honestly. they're from the basic sets, mostly, and they work pretty well in those, but i'm just not a fan... the roof, on the other hand, was very popular and the blue modified bricks at the front were quite rare in those days, but generally speaking, this was not the star of 1987. gave it a "3"

1 dear afol friends, due to leakage of production plant in our country one member of our lego club had bought a new promo set. until now he placed only photo of the box, later on promissed to make a review. heavenly god, i wanna one at all costs! most were found here... edited by sinner, 17 july 2008 - 12:47 am. put photos in

1 o....m.... g!!!!!!! that looks sweet! how much did he say it was?

1 wow, it does look really cool. i love that...oops! it's gone. can't post pics of that yet, sorry. it was requested that we remove those pics. sorry everyone. have a nice day.

0 i wish i had seen it.... judging by the reactions it is a pretty good set!

0 whitefang, on jul 14 2008, 11:23 am, said: hinckley, is it ok for me to share a picture or two on the vestas exhibition that happened few months ago in singapore? don't worry, it's not anything related "directly" to the vestas promo, wind power plant. er...is this a test? are you working for tlg now? i'm being watched you know. they're outside my window... so, no. not if the set appears in the pictures. and if they're just of the convention, post them in community...

0 god save the save as-function

0 wow! managed to find a pic on brickshelf and this is a great set. hope it going to be released properly and not just a promo. one thing though, would it not be quite noisy if you lived in that house

0 that sounds amazing! a wind power plant as a lego set is absolutely awesome and helps the lego city to get environmental energy. regrettably i missed the pics. when browsing through bs i didn't find them, too . can someone please post a link or sent me the link/picture via pm ? thanks. klaus-dieter

0 i also found the pics, and most of what i can say is: it's kind of funny how it's a small house with a gigantic windmill over it, though.

0 ok guys, respect tlc? crazy policy (they dont take care about thiefs selling those sets long before official release,but they complain about one small photo on web ). if someone still needs photo, simply email me on josefzizka@post.cz, i will be glad to send you three pictures

1 jsn, on jul 14 2008, 08:35 pm, said: i think the great thing about the cottage is its very reminiscent of classic holiday home type houses that lego used to make like this one from the late 80s which a lot of people (me included) believe lego need to make more of. i totally agree with you, jsn' date=! this house in your link reminds me of the old weekend/holiday cottages ( ). hopefully the cottage in the wind power plant set cottage includes a nice interior, too. the outside looks amazing anyway ! i really would like to see more apartment holiday homes, too, but how it seems tlg is on its best way towards doing that! klaus-dieter

1 i recently got a few still sealed and new sets from the 90' on ebay, and after the rock raider's hover scout this isthe second one i'll review. i really like the space port theme, even if the sets may be more simple than earlier space city sets, i like the overall look and the color scheme. but enough of that, let's go on with the pictures! set nr.: 6455 name: space simulation station number of minifigs: 3 number of pieces: 240 release year: 1999 first again a few pics of the boxes and the instructions: the main box: this theme had a kinda strange seperation of the pieces, the parts for the control center and the shuttle are in seperate little boxes, and the others are in polybags with the models printed on them. also seperate instructions for each step: a general overview: we got 3 lovely minifigs here, from left to right the control engineer, the mechanic and the astronaut: the -i dont know the english word for it- testing-thing, the astronaut is being tested to hard nerves there the mechanics little car, on the back an extinguisher and a radio device is attached: the take-off station for the little shuttle with the shuttle itself on it: and without it: tools, tools, tools! the shuttle as stand-alone: i think that would be fuel tanks, i like this little detail: and finally we have the controll room, would have been better with seats, but it's alright: a really sweet mid-sized set if you ask me, a few juniorized parts, but it fits perfectly with the set. the theme itself is also great, and i wish that tlg brings it back, i could see stunning sets with the quality city sets have right now!

1 the spinning machine is a centerfuge. (not sure of the spelling ) i remember wanting this set because my friend had the larger station with full rocket. seeing this makes me want it again.....

0 dfenz, on jul 17 2008, 11:42 pm, said: nice review with very clear pics!! i have pre-ordered this item at a local (belgian) store and will be getting it on july 29th, together with the 7676 gunship. wow 59,99eur is a lot of money!! what country do you live in??? here it costed me 46eur, so quite a price difference!!! imo the set's certainly not worth that much money! reki

1 the figs they're possibly the best part of the entire set, all in all. nice new head, although the glasses limit its usability. i am in love with the head on that fig. it's perfect for any number of figures - a good 'scarred hero' face has always been on my want list. i'm turning him into my viking warlord after i post this review. again, a new head. great stubbly beard thing going on. my second-favorite head of the lot. great for warriors, especially with helms. the torsos are fantastic for special forces figures, if anyone's planning to do something like that. not too fond of the lime green on there, but it's still extremely usable. this is actually a really cool machine gun. i like it. i think this would be a good point to note that all designs you see - outside the figures and dinos - are stickers. that means a crapload of stickers. if you can't stand stickers at all in a set, don't buy this.

0 mr. lego_bildur, on jul 24 2005, 09:35 pm, said: as unexpected as it was, this was very helpful! ;) two questions, though: 1. is the front green rubber missle a traditional launchable missle, or does it have another firing mechanism? 2. concerning the guns on the side, are they fixed in one postition, or does it have any functions? 3. why did you decide to buy this set? (just curious!) 1. oh, i overlooked that, didn't i! in response, it's an upside-down launcher, so the switch is on the underside. so no, no special mechanism. 2. the gatling guns can be raised, but not turned. 3. i found it in toys r us, and was after a few of the figs, but after seeing the box up close and personal, decided 'what the heck! it's a good break from vikings!' :-d

0 sam89, on jul 25 2005, 01:11 pm, said: that looks like a really great set, although i don't think i'd have anywhere to put it. i don't think i'll ever be able to get the set anyway, since it doesn't come out over here. sam, missing your point. the set _should_ come to europe, as 7298, but without guns (large crate instead).

1 that's interesting news about the european release. i'd definitely be interested to see how they modify the set - chains, ropes, and crates are definitely useful pieces. can't wait for pictures. to everyone looking for just the figures - don't skip out and get the smaller set and the tank. spend the extra $20 and get the t1. it's well worth it. i might pick up the steel sprinter and the fire hammer myself, still trying to decide. if i do, i'll review them.

1 the... weapon. whatever it's called. this uses the same mechanism as the longboat (for those that don't have either, you snap the little sports stand thing, which hits the 'missile', which fires, and since there's nothing holding the technic beam up to that height any more, it drops down so that the next missile drops into place. pretty cool, if unrealistic.). the two on the side do not fire, i think they're mainly there for 'extra ammo'. my biggest problem with this set. open bed. this could have easily been remedied with a few plates. interior opened. the fire hammer next to the t1. they look very cool together, don't they? you can also see my curio shelf. final score: 7.4/10 dinos: 1/10 fig: 8/10 (but that's just me) hummer: 8.5/10 parts: 9/10 i'm a harsh reviewer. i still think that if space/vehicles are your thing, you should buy this. however, if you're a bigger castle fan, or just like to get all sorts of lego, i would still suggest buying the viking catapult before this. however, i do think that these are some of the coolest sets of 2005. this is something you will eventually want to get. until next time, bloody jay

0 thanks bloody jay! any chance you could be reviewing the other dino attack sets?

0 mr. lego_bildur, on jul 25 2005, 10:11 pm, said: thanks bloody jay! any chance you could be reviewing the other dino attack sets? possibly the steel sprinter and urban avenger, but i can say with finality that i will not buy the tank until i find it available for $30 or less. on that note, if anybody does find it for $30 or less, shoot me a pm. ;)

1 very nice review and nice set to boot. lots of little features that increase the playability. great pics too (i remember you had trouble before with the tower raid castle set, as i just got mine and was looking to review it, but saw your review in archives.....shakes fist at how slow aussies get sets ) great reviews on!

0 thebrickster, on jul 18 2008, 02:35 pm, said: excellent review metalandi. it's always great to see early pictures of new sets. this set really reminds me of an oil rig, and could probably be easily modified as one (if one wanted an alternate model). the two components that i like most are the boat crane and the control room, but other sections are pretty slick as well. are those printed pieces in the control room, or stickers? i'm really starting to gain an appreciation for these new coast guard sets. they've come a long way over the years: http://www.majhost.c...guard/09set.jpg 575 coast guard station -released 1978. i picked up the control boat & tower (7739) a few weeks ago but haven't opened it yet). in any case, thanks for taking the time to review this set and share it over eb. first, thanks to all your great response for my review, i'm glad you like this set aswell. as it comes to stickers, the tiles ant slopes in the control room are printed pieces! the rest as coast guard logo patterns and so on are stickers. i forgot to make a photo of the sticker sheet unfortunately

0 is there any way to order one of these if you don't live in france or one of the countries where s@h sells it?

0 i don't know really. in which country do you live? i haven't been to my local stores for a while now, so i don't know if they have it there, but maybe i'll find some time tomorrow to check it out.

-1 the worker looks like he soiled his pants um oh yeah... nice reveiw! very cool set... im not sure about the bottom floor glass being dark grey and the top floor glass being light blue.

1 nice review! this is just the "crown jewel" for the coast guard theme. i love the layout of its platform. it looks real neat to have it placed it in the midst of the deep blue sea, awaiting of any emergency rescue. sometimes, i feel that this set can used it to merge with my aqua raiders sets. i thought of using it as a land base, for the raiders to dock in their stuff before submerge into the ocean. ok, it's just a wierd idea of mine. just feel that aqua raiders and coast guard can work hand in hand, since they are naval expertise! it seemed, i can't view all the pictures somehow. nevertheless, i can still view some of it quite well. i love the command center. the amount of computer printed pieces simply make me smile, with the monitor, keyboard, radar screen and etc. the helicopter is cute too. however, i pity the victim that is loaded at the back. it seemed a little bit too dangerous. in addition, this set seemed to have quite alot of stickers, which can be quite discouraging. i do hope to see this set soon. so far, i quite like the current coast guard sets.

1 that's a great review of a great city set! thank you very much, metalandi! first of all i wanted to buy the 7999 cg petrol boat & tower. but now i surely will buy this amazing platform instead of the 7999 if my local toy seller sells the 4210. reason: 4210 is something very unusual set (i think we won't get a set similar to that in the next 20 years) and because of i don't like the petrol boat inside (no backwalls , nearly no interior ). klaus-dieter

0 great review metalandi! thanks for posting it with a number of pictures, the only question is why lego decided to produce so many sets i want to buy in one year!

0 paramedic unit set #: 6364 year released: 1980 piece count: 140 minifigs: 2 list price: unknown well, let me first say that the english name, "paramedic unit" is not really a good name for this set. the function of a paramedic is to take a patient from an emergent situation, and deliver them to a hospital for treatment, generally an emergency room. this is a rather small "clinic" that i would imagine is more for family care than an emergency room. in addition, the car looks more like a doctor/nurse's car rather than an ambulance or emergency response vehicle. i would call this a "clinic" rather than a paramedic unit. in any case, it's a great set, esp. for table towns that need medical services. what i like is that this set is small enough to place anywhere in your lego city or town. starting with the instructions: like all the classic town sets, alternate models are pictured, although i never tried building one: i like the little medical bus/van. the set includes two minifigs, that include a female doctore or nurse, and what i presume is a patient, based on the torsos: i really like the vehicle. it's a 4-stud wide two seater: the colors work well and i like the use of the white bar between the seats (and the 1x1 blue plates for lights). unfortunately, the emblems are stickers. here's a shot of the neat little "clinic": i like the use of the blinds for the exam room. it shows that lego considered patient privacy when making this set. the interior includes an exam room, desk, and two blue swivel chairs: and a neat little eye chart: although the letters l e g o would have made a nice touch. lastly, a picture of the complete set: i must admit that i remember buying this set back in the 80s and i regreted it after taking it home. i'm not sure what i didn't like about it (perhaps the "girl" back then), but now i really think it's a neat set. well, there's a line of patients waiting to have their eyes checked... comments welcome.

1 thank you for all these reviews, thebrickster! and: the idea with the polls is a very nice and interesting idea. (it will only take a while until i will have commented on all - so please give me some time. ) i gave this set a four: the vehicle, the minfigs and the design of the house are excellent - only the interior could be a bit spiced up (telephone, some other equipment). klaus-dieter

1 i rate this a 5! one of my last sets before my dark age. suspension wheels are superb and are rare! the minifig, although smiling, really looks tough because of the tanktop. oh did i say im giving it a 5?

1 u took me long way back in memory. thank you as it was a great memories with legos edited by vintagelegoera, 04 august 2015 - 07:04 pm.

0 how would this one look compared to the new gv pickup tow truck? i would like to see that one tow this one.

1 exxon gas station set #: 6375 year released: 1980 piece count: 254 minifigs: 3 list price: approx. $20 one of the gems of my sets from 1980 has to be the exxon gas station. it has very nice colors, lots of great details, and a high level of playability. starting with the instructions: the backside with a great picture of the complete set: the set includes three minifigs including two gas station attendants and my favorite, the urban cowboy: one of the best things about this set is that it includes not one, but two very detailed 4-stud wide vehicles. here's a picture of the red one which is a two-seater: the car has two working doors, a hood that opens, and a little holed brick on the other side for pretending to "fill 'er up". here's another image at an angle: isn't she a nice set of wheels! here's the yellow car. i always liked this one better, perhaps it was the color with the black pieces in the back, although it is a one-seater: the set includes four fuel pumps that are numbered (with decals) and included a string as the hose: here's a little accessory rack for oil and tools: and another rack for tires: the set had a nice exxon logo on three 1x6 bricks: a large jack allows the cars to be lifted high into the air for tire and under engine repairs: i love the office with its large 5x6 window. inside is a chair and desk. and the entire set: happy motoring in legoland!

1 skipper 24, on jul 19 2008, 07:25 am, said: cool set i really loved the classic town sets. this set has lots of detail, great reveiw. do you know what is exxon? thanks skipper. exxon is a big fuel company here in the us. there's a lot of exxon gas stations throughout the country.

0 i much prefer the shell version of that station which had the full awning over the roadway, and the special road plate with the extra lane to pull into to fill 'er up...

1 brickster, once again, this is another excellent gas station, awaiting to be in the limelight! i don't understand why i always loved these classic gas station such as shell, exxon and octan. they just look so lovely. no city or town could ever survive without these important key installations around, to pump gas/petroleum for all vehicles, that depend it for fuel consumption. as always, all gas station will always inculde a road plate, and i am glad i am still seeing roads included in such sets, such as the recent 7993, service station. however, town plan's gas station, did not include a baseplate though. nevertheless, let me continue with this review. 3 lovely mini-figs, included in this set. it's not common to see exxon torsos these days. i just love that lady staff very much, especially with its classic hairdo. 4-studs car just simply rocks, with such fabulous simple design. furthermore, it gave you 2 cars instead of one. what more can you ask? you don't see tlg giving more cars in recent sets these days. what surprise me about this cars, is the ability of opening the front engine column. i remembered vividly that only trucks or massive vehicles, does have this playing feature. nevertheless, it's an excellent addition. for a 1980 gas station set, this is a perfect set, even when it's going to fit into my current town buildings. i am sure, it won't have a hard time to match with the rest of the facade. i can use this gas station and stationed it near the country side. this set is so hard to resist, with such elegant design of its fuel pump. there are a total of 4 pumping stations. the vehicles won't be fighting against each other, for slots then. the reparing area is very nice, it will be even better if it include a shelter on top of it. the office is simple and nice. i had never expect an office to exist in gas station. most of the time, there are groceries stores, for the consumers to get off, buy off some stores and load it in the car. no major complains from me. i am not trying to be selection bias. i had demostrated key points which is good enough to justify my score. and, i gave it a "5". outstanding classic gas station set.

1 okay guys, i have built the set! so let's review! set name: 7649 mt-201 ultra drill walker price: $69.99 pieces: 759 bought from: tor r us in michigan, us. the box: first we have the front. it shows the set, it's functuns, and the limited edition sign. the box is huge, about the size of the dino attack chopper set or the mars mission base. nowadays, most set that are $50.00 or more have a flap displaying the sets functions. opening theflap on this box reveals a gigantic picture of the set. and the back. the bags, numbered: next, the manuals. they have piece call outs, page numbers, etc. there are 2 manuals with this set. sticker sheets: they actually aren't all that bad. random manual image: build: first, we open bag 1. this will build the alien craft and the minifigures. now here we have some interesting parts. a green spine from exo-force, and a black rim for the set container stacker. next we start the build on the alien craft. it is pretty sturbdy, but has no cockpit for the alien. the alien stickers are really cool. they are rainbow-ish, and has a silver back. next come the build on the wings: and the finished craft. it is pretty good, and has a nice sleek design. however, i think i will use the large ship for the commander out this year to fight the driller instead. next is bag 2, which builds the rover and astro ship. first is the ship. it starts off with doctor inferno's colors. it builds up very nice, and the detail is absolutley amazing. next the roof is built. it has some speed racer slopes. the hinge piee now has a hole through it. sorry for the blurry pic: more is added: then comes the bottom piece. the detail is very nice, and the hinge piece has a use later on. then you build the crates. each one holds two crystals. added to the ship, also a pic of the finished ship. here we start the rover. it sports anice detail- the orange studs get coveded by the grill to look more like an engine. the detail in this thing is pretty good. it has a gun and shovel. here is how it fits into the ship: it slides in... and is secured thanks to the hinge. okay, so next we open the number 3 bag, which builds the body. here are some interesting pieces: then we start the build. it begins nice and study: i just love these stickers with the bulldogs on them: more of the build, with the stickers added: next we add in the front part. the detail is again, outstanding. with the turntable added. it can move down as well. the next step is to build the water tank. it utilizes the bionicle boosters(big white things) and added to the walker: then we build that drill. it uses a lot of rims and such. with the gears added: the front part uses a lot of those new droideka 3-prong things. and bionicle eyes. the drill can spin thanks to the gears. and added to the vehical: next is the cockpit. it has a nice space for the astro's bckpack. added: the final stage is the legs. thank god they aren't like striking venoms. they are all the same, however. see those two rubber parts? those keep it in place when on surfaces like glass. next come the large part of the legs. these are similar to the assault tiger's legs. the final result is very sturdy, thanks too... notice the amazing classic space sticker? so we finally come down to this: the final result is amazing. it is sturdy, and has great detail. it is very realistic. and, when the ship is removed, the drill goes down, and the turret is aimed up... hope you all enjoyed the review!

1 wow! this is a great mm set! and i wouldn't say that, but wow! this looks awesome. it's not the theme i really want, but if i get this set by accident ( ) i won't mind! hope to see your review soon.

1 excellent i cant wait to see the review, this set looks very interesting.

1 ok, minus ten for the placeholder, but plus about ten million for the review. this set is just amazing. it's really earned it's colors, and i'm sure no classic space fan can complain, even snefroe . i didn't know it had the tilting function for the drill- s@h is so pathetic with its pictures, and they really missed this amazing function. the detachable ship is so cute, it's almost classic space in it's design. major thumbs up to tlc. hell, make it a hug, even.

1 wooha! i thought i never would see a nice mars mission set, but this walker ist the best proof i was wrong. it really looks good and i love the bricks used to make the shape. the airtank is cool and for once i have to say even the stickers are looking good. man, did i really say that? normally i hate stickers. nice review (some pictures would have gotten better with macro on, but as it seems to be time to forgive i wont point on that any longer) thank you very much vbbn!

-1 nice review! i don't mind the set, but, at the same time, i'm not particularly fond of it.

1 looks like a great set, i may consider making this the first mars mission set i buy. nice review also. but quote lol, thanks. i just wanted to claim my place for the review. personally i don't think you had a place to claim. somebody else could have also gotten this set and had a proper review ready before yours but felt it was wrong to post because you had posted a placeholder ( clubninja in this case). i think placeholders should be banned and if you are not ready to post a full review you should not post anything. simple really. either that or what is the policy on here regarding more than one review of a set being posted - then you could have both posted reviews and it wont really matter i guess. just my 2 cents worth thanks for the review though.

-1 nice review, good close-ups and a good, unconventional choice of a set. as for the set itself, it has it's pros and cons in my eyes. i like all the minifigs, but especially the witch. the fright knights are probably the closest you can get for an evil human castle faction. as for the building itself, on the other hand i like the fact that it can be modified, but some of the design choices are just stupid. the holes in the wall, the one huge tower (as opposed to several smaller ones), the huge empty space in the center, and the excessive usage of bright yellow. i guess for a smaller kid the play value is great, it's easily accessible and it looks sturdy enough, but to an afol, it's not much else than a source for bricks and figs, in my opinion. oh, and they did have telescopes in the medieval times (the witch most probably uses it for astrology). and even if they didn't, we're talking about a castle with a dragon and a wicked witch in it, so it's not exactly a good example of accurate history.

1 i have this set, and ilike it! 6097 have many usefull parts! greate review!

0 metalandi, thanks for doing this fright knights review, by opening up a misb set which you have bought recently. i am very sure the feeling is very nice, especially touching the bricks which is preserved for 11 years sealed in bags. i am quite fond of the fright knights theme. unfortunately, this theme was released during my dark age. i never really bought sets from fright knights. instead, i bought plenty of minifigs to build an army. if i could turn back time or find another misb set with a reasonable price, i am very sure i will get it. my soldiers need a castle to stay in. i will be looking forward to your next review. keep up the good job

1 i read this review not long after you posted it, but i'm not sure why i didn't comment... if dragonator is the one to post everytime he sees a dragon related topic, i would be the one to post if i see a fright knights topic. fright knights is one of my favourite lego themes, and this review is really good! i got both of the castles in the theme and loved them, and your review presents basil the batlord's castle well. i too thought it was a bit weird that there is a green base when it could be grey, but i guess it's a useful piece to use in other things. fright knights on!

1 ahh... i remember how badly i wanted that set when it was new... oh well... definitely one of the most original castles, if not the most. i actually liked how the 1st floor was made into a throne room. the tower looks pretty impressive, too. of course, the castle has a flagrant flaw -- the walls on the sides are open. i also think it lacks in the minifig count, though that is understandable for a castle with a dragon. quote the fright knights are probably the closest you can get for an evil human castle faction. totally agreed.

1 fire station set #: 6382 year released: 1980/1981 piece count: 368 minifigs: 4 list price: approx. $20 lego's third fire station was this little gem, 6382. the set offered new design elements not previously offered in previous sets. what really stands out for me is 1x3 car doors and torsos with printed designs. a decal was used for the large sign on the building and the #1 on the hood of one of the vehicles. i think this was also the first set to offer the sliding garage mechanism, a feature that added a great amount of realism and playability. the set also included two blue doors and the new fire hose with pre-connected faucet/spicket. getting on to the pictures. i saved the cover of the box for this set but lost the instructions over the years. i was able to download some instructions from the web. here's a shot of the box cover: and the back of the box: the set includes four figs, three of which are fireman, and a lady who can serve as a dispatcher. as mentioned above, the torsos are printed on: my favorite of the two vehicles included, i love the design of fire engine #1: i always loved the fire hoses included in this set. no string to have to tie or freyed ends: engine #2 is this much larger engine with ladder. i like how it contains an oxygen tank and fire axe: on the other side of the engine are two shutter doors that reveal the hose and ladder controls. these are stickers: the ladder is much wider than previous lego ladders and extends a good length: i like the baseplate of this set which has the numbers one and two marking each garage: the building is simple but has a nice design. i love the sliding garage doors: note: notice the two windows of the 2nd floor. the actual set should have blinds on these windows. i've lost one of the stickered windows, so placed the single blinded window on the 1st floor. each of the two sides of the garages are the same. here's a shot of the right side: on the first floor is the dispatch area and a classic blue space computer: the 2nd floor has a bed and a chair: here's a shot of the entire backside: and lastly, a shot of the entire station: this set is one of my favorite fire stations that offers a great amount of playability. hope you enjoyed the review.

1 great review. i love tis set too, the best firestation ever made by lego. mainly because the '80s sets are the favourite with me. only i miss a helicopterplatvorm, well i made a little modification:

1 thanks everyone for the comments. it's great to see that you enjoy these classic reviews, esp. this set. panda9001100, on jul 20 2008, 03:10 pm, said: i made a little modification: excellent! you've also got some other very nice sets there, like that awesome monorail! you should share a review. rupi, on jul 20 2008, 04:25 pm, said: i am a proud owner of this set it's great to hear that some of you have this classic fire station. it really is a nice set with great vehicles and accessories. i also think the overall design is excellent.

0 great review of a great set! sadly, i don't own it. as for the alternate building idea's on the back of every box - yes, i miss that as well! i really miss it!

1 no question. this is a "5" one of the best and most influencial town sets ever, imo

0 i honestly glad i got the latest fire station [cant remember set number] its waayyy better i voted 3 its realy not that great but its ok.....

0 carrera124, on 05 august 2012 - 07:35 pm, said: great review, great set. nice look, great features, very playable. please don't bump old topics unless you have something substantial to add. for our policy on topic bumping, see the eb faq. thanks.

-1 a nice little model with some neat features for it's age plus the all-yime classic fireman as a bonus. however, this design of chopper (the police station around the same time was the same design) i think dated very quickly. while is was good to use the hinged car roof - which was relatively new at the time - together with the inverted screen it was superceded very quickly by designs that stood the test of time far better (for example 6657). also, i don't think i could everbuy a lego fire helicopter because it is not something we have in the uk/eire. police, coast guard, ambulance, military, etc, etc but no fire helicopters. not something i would therefore want in my lego town. great review though. many thanks again for doing these. cheers rog

1 i vote outstanding because it makes excellent use of the pieces that were available at the time. that cockpit makes excellent use of an inverted windshield.

0 guys, thanks for all of your wonderful and encouraging comments, towards this set. this was one of my most favourite set in the late 1980s, and i am glad to restore it somehow, with a small little part missing, which could not be that hard to replace. bernddasbrot, on jul 22 2008, 12:06 am, said: but this review induced me to get over this humiliation from my childhood ( ) and check ebay for the 6358. bernd, i am glad reviews like these, mananged to change your perception towards this set. honestly, this is a very good set to pass by, and i hope i had highlight the key features in this set. hope you will have an easy time, getting it from ebay or bricklink. rriggs, on jul 22 2008, 12:31 am, said: great classic firemen and - in your version - a suspiciously blue fire extinguisher good job, by spotting the replacement part, which is hiding among them. that's why i show the orignal image. lord of pies, on jul 22 2008, 12:34 am, said: i can't help but feel thought that these reviews are being churned out to quickly, you should leave a gap, i am being flooded with all these great reviews! you should really take some time off, and sit in front of the town and trains forum, looking through at your childhood memories, where classic reviews like this are released in this forum. i am leaving some gaps in between my reviews now. i supposed brickster will slow down soon. captain green hair, on jul 22 2008, 02:07 am, said: this definitly is a nice set, i think this was also the first set to use that white basket cgh, you are absolutely right. this is the first set that made use of the white basket component. in fact, there is only 2 sets in the entire lego theme which have make used of the white basket. it is the 6477 which is released in 2000. i am quite surprised after 13 years, they are able to produced it again. thebrickster, on jul 22 2008, 10:10 am, said: what an awesome little set! i really like this engine but don't remember seeing it during the late 80s. it must have been out during my dark ages. i love the basket/section for the firemen. equally nice is the fire hose which extends a good length. the color combination of red with white and the trans. blue windshield looks goos as well. this is a great engine and one that would look perfect in a classic tabletown - and it's 4-studs wide! very nice review whitefang. i look forward to seeing more of your classic town reviews. you shared the same sentiments as i do. it's a pity that set was released during the dark age of yours. on the other hand, these sets are my childhood sets which i grew up with. more classic town reviews, all the way! edit: this is my 1000th eurobricks post since i joined! it has been another great milestone for me, in eurobricks! edited by whitefang, 22 july 2008 - 06:46 am.

0 quote i am not against with the newer sets. it just that, part of the reasons which reflected in the review had fufill the basic key factors of a typical fire engine. in addition, it was my all-time favourite under the "fire-fighting" theme. yes, i agree! this set is wonderful even today, and is one of the best fire kits ever release. and actually, realistic scale is not really a necessity in lego - it's just my personal taste. for example, i've never liked the tiny planes in the old airports that much, but i can see why a lot of people like them better than the new ones. edited by grevious, 28 july 2008 - 03:17 pm.

0 navy trooper fenson, on jul 21 2008, 07:25 pm, said: nice pictures, but three questions: 1. how many pages do the instruction books have? 2. what are the spare parts? or: does this laaty come with two clone-commander-equipment sets and four assaij ventress lightsaberhilts? 3. where did you get it? 4. how much did it cost? i can answer one! he comes from norway

-1 this sounds very similar to the first one. i'm glad i'm saving this one till later in my purchasing cycle. all the sw walkers have a skeletal fram with almost nothing inside. it's very disappointing, but i guess filling them in would up the piece count considerably. does this beast have any good handholds for picking it up? i seem to recall a handle or something coming out of the top in the pre-release pics.

-1 i just got this set sunday, and it's so huge that i can't put it anywhere. it is pretty sturdy and heavy, that's where the handle comes in. i'm pissed that you only get 2 clones. rex has to fight on the ground while you need more clones to man the guns/cockpit. the legs were the most annoying and time consuming part of the build. and yea i agree, that if tlg had made numbered bags, it would have taken only 2 hours rather than 4. edited by ih master 13uilder17, 14 october 2008 - 11:38 pm.

-1 probably my most wanted set(rgs is too much), but this seems a 'lil overpriced, i mean $90 for a skeleton? ii'll wait fr it to go on sale(which i doubt it will)

0 exactly kim, that's what i meant. i pondered and wondered that for a long time :) i decided to ask here when a friend wondered the same thing. i hope it fits with the new droship. it would be really cool. and it's also great that tlg knows what they'll be prodcuing a year later..

0 jimbutcher, on jul 28 2008, 12:56 am, said: thank you oky wan, and apologies to the rest of you guys, i guess i was rushing a bit and didn't think this through, it was wrong of me to reserve a review, if someone does an in-depth review before me, someone please close this topic. otherwise, i guess i will do it. again, many apologies for opening this topic before i actually had a review, bad example from me, very sorry! its ok, just remember you dont have to reserve them!

-1 the cockpit piece doesnt hold well when you try to "swing-it-open" most of the time it just pops off

0 i wonder if the only way to have a "functioning" open/close cockpit is with super-glue

0 dovchenko, on jul 29 2008, 01:04 am, said: good... but you said that you thought that cody was orange, but he turned out to be orange? heh, i caught that too. on topic: nice review, jimbutcher! can't wait to get my hands on one! dsr

1 very good review! i just checked my ep. ii vehicle encyclopedia (yes, i'm a total sw geek) and tlg got it pretty accurately with the rgs.

1 thanks for the review jimbutcher . i really like this new gunship but i cant own one until like two or three months and this is with all the clone wars sets .

1 hey everyone, my wife took me to legoland for my birthday just last week. we had a fantastic time and it gave me the chance to pick up some of the new castle sets and battlepacks i was really impressed by the sets i bought and decided to do my first review... let battle commence! set name: tower raid set number: 7037 price gbp: 19.99 pieces: 364 the models here's a shot of the complete set: the set is made up of two models, the crown knight's tower and the orc's siege tower. let's start with the crown knight's tower: a knight readies himself for battle! my favourite model from the set, the wicked orc's siege tower: please note that for the purposes of display i mounted the orc's banner onto a small cone set on the top platform of the siege tower. this doesn't come with the set but saves any orcs having to hold onto it all he time! there are other areas it can be placed without using extra parts. features both models look great and have excellent features. the set as a whole has great playability and seems to have been concieved with a storyline: the crown knight's have a captured orc within the walls of their tower so the orc army has been sent out to recover him... or are they merely after the gold the knights keep horded away?! the orc's siege tower has a powerful ram - spring-loaded by the simple arrangement of an elastic band - so pulling it back sends it flying out the front, knocking down the wall on the side of the knight's tower... ...and releasing the captive orc! the floor panels inside the prison are laid over a lip on the inside of the collapsible wall, so fall in when they're not supported. there's a string at the rear for extending the boarding ramp... ...and letting a fearsome orc warrior charge across! flick-fire action! the battle heats up as the orcs close in! the minifigures the crown knights: i really like the crown knights. they're metallic helmets look great and they come with nice accessories. the archer has a double printed head with a frightened look on the other side too! i'm not surprised, i'd be frightened when staring over the ramparts at these... the orcs: these guys really do look the part, worthy advesaries to the crown knights! the details are superb: the printed elements, weapons and helmets, all set the orcs aside on the battlefield. the set comes with a great new molded armour neckpiece too. the mighty orc leader looks wicked in his full battlegear! overview there's so much to this set it's hard not to be impressed. the orc's siege engine is a thing of beauty (or terror!) and would look great on any battlefield. the crown knight's tower although basic, looks good and has great playability. i'm a big fan of the new castle knights and fantasy minifigures and the inclusion of five of them is just enough for this set and as a booster to any army. at 19.99 in the uk this set is well worth the money for content and quality. i'd highly recommmend this set as a must-have purchase for anyone a final shot of the siege tower with a host of orcs ready for battle: i hope you enjoyed my review, i'll be posting my next one for 7040 dwarves mine defender soon!

1 hey, good review and good photos. i also got this set just recently, and i wasn't very enthusiastic about it at the beginning, but after i built it i could appreciate it. the siege engine is very nice, but my complaint has do with the proportions of the knight's tower in respect to the trolls' machine - it's a bit smaller, and less bulkier. that complaint has to go with some other sets too. for example the troll warship is really humongous - it feels like it can load the evil wizard's tower and sail off. other than that - a good set, i like it, 4/5 from me.

1 very nice review pedro! you beat me to it. there was a review done about january, but i wanted to have a go, just haven't opened the box yet..... great pics and well demonstrated action elements too. i rate this as one of the coolest castle sets just for its playability and 5 figures. this will def add to my orc army, and i may purchase more of this set if they dont release a orc bp. keep up the good work!

0 thanks for the positive comments everyone id noticed that although much discussed, no-one on eurobricks had written a comprehensive review for it. i thought this set more than deserved one! ive just posted my newest review of the dwarves' mine defender here: http://www.eurobrick...showtopic=19931

1 when i first saw this topic, i thought, "oh, great, another review of this set..." however i'm glad you posted it now, your pics are great and, well, it was just a generally good review! i'm looking forward to seeing more... ~peace

1 name: jungle duel set ref: 7624 number of minifigs: 3 number of pieces: 90 price: $9.00 a basic review of 7624 (my apologies for the blurry and grainy pictures my camera is acting up ): the build is nothing speicial on to the figs indiana jones, mutt williams and irina spalkoi, nice array of minifigs although i think they should have included a russian soldier or two. if you look to the right on mutts jacket it has his name in script, the tent is great aside from the fact that the fabric bends easily a nice amount of speicial pieces the weapons rack is pretty nifty so is the table when you swap the white piece with a black one overall it is a very nice set, the $10.00 price tag isnt so bad either, thanks for reading. playability:10/10 price:8/10 figs:8/10 build:5/10 overall rating:8/10 i recommend this set to all indiana jones and lego fans. edited by wulf, 29 july 2008 - 02:50 pm.

1 the only indy set i considered worth purchasing so far. great source of various parts - plus you gotta love spalko's hair! edited by dreamweb, 01 august 2008 - 09:55 pm.

-1 too many pictures .... we dont need to see every step

0 hello again! wow, this really is an in depth review! at first when i pictures of the set i thought... "yeah, kinda boring." but after reading your review, i think i might buy it (when it's cheaper). the pieces look very good, and i love the droids and their accesories! thanks for the review! also, awesomestar, i knwo it is a default thingy but it would be good if the quote was taken out of your post as it does clutter up the topic (or "yopic" as dsr calls it).

1 it's definately the street sprinter for me! there are many reasons for that, most of which have been mentioned by others already: i hate yellow, it's the most useless color, but i love tan and dark red. it's bigger and more detailed than the coast guard one. plus, i think there is a hinge in the back of it, so there is apparently some more playability to it as well. i love the post-apoc style fig! it's detailed and simply looks cool! also, while the digger fig has quite an individual look to it, the coast guard driver has the generic hero head and coast guard uniform. it's an overal better deal, especially if you count the ludp which gives the set a whole lot more playability, no matter how u the ldp may be. tan & post-apoc figs on!

1 that was an intresting race and i was split between the two until i saw whitefang`s reply and the fact you can use the sprinter as a militery thing(which you could do for both but sprinter just pulls it off better) and i like the radar on the back of it so i`ll have to go with the street sprinter. thanks for the nice topic brickster

-1 i know it would really go well with the rgs but it is not enough for 50. ill wait for the sales at christmas.

-1 im really mad. this isn't even out in the us. i want this set really bad.

0 one question... do the top panels on the rotating rocket assembly mounted in the skids pop off regularly when you flip them back and forth? the ones on the version i built from the instructions posted online seem to eject with the slightest provocation

1 nice review, thanks for taking the time to share your thoughts. looks like a really nice set and i'll be picking it up eventually when it makes it to the us.

-1 thank you for the first ever review of the fighter tank. i like this set and every features it offers. but i think that the engine could have a better look than just four green cylinders in a grey piece.

1 great review! i really like the look of this set, and having played a lot of battlefront i am quite keen to pick one up in australia when it comes out (after the ds is paid off) looks like some nice greebling and cool colour scheme too.

1 i am 100% going to get this set! it should be about $55 and if it is, i'll get it without a doubt! i just hope that this set is $50-$60. if it isn't, then we have a problem...

1 i personally think this is a great set, but a little pricey. i wish it was available in the us though.

1 4478 geonosian fighter review parts:169 figs:4 price:?15.00 (i think) here is a review of the amazing geonosian fighter set, it was my first ever star wars lego set! here go's... 1. manual not much here although it's an old style manual cover. random shot. back. 2. general set and minifigs a pic of the entire set, it has 2 reddish tan battle droids geo pilot, geo soldier, geo star fighter and geo turret. the 4 figs, the droids come with backpacks. geo soldier. i prefer this gun. give him a cane to become poggle the lesser the geo leader. detailed legs are always nice. the bodies are a little fat for geonosians i guess but nice printing on them. the head. the wings. 1. 2. 3. voila! all done 3. the star fighter it has a landing gear type thing. the detail on those plates. the pilot in the cockpit. cockpit with canopy. 1 of 2 ball joint things, this is the engine. 2nd ball joint which is the front gun. 4. the turret the turret by itself. turret with the soldier. a printed round plate. 5. overall build: 7/10 a little repetitive but enjoyable. minifigs: 9/10 4 that's pretty good for a set this size. design: 6/10 the fighter dosen't really look right nor does the turret but they are both strong. parts: 8/10 lot's of interesting parts and comes with two of the ball joint things as well the minifig parts being good. price: 10/10 cheap (for the uk) considering the amount of minifigs and parts. playability: 5/10 not much but you can have mini battles with the turret and starfighter. overall: 8/10 i gave it 8 because of the design which was not accurate and the low number of parts. thanks for reading and hope you liked it as much as i did . edited by kimt, 04 august 2008 - 11:42 am. indexed

0 i wish they made more sets with those colored droids as well. we should have got them with the hailfire droid and dwarf spider set i think. i also just noticed look the ball turret on the manual there's no markings on it.

0 ~vbbn~ the pics were 12 mega pixles which is quite a lot i think, although i had to scale them down to 800x600. i used to dream that tlg would bring out these sets of the geonosis arena and you could join them together to make a massive arena but i doubt they would ever do that. also look out for my forth coming reviews of 4500 snow speeder, some tie fighter with a lul dv, and gg wheel bike chase. i have taken all the pics all i need to do is upload them. also i would review the jango fett's slave 1 but i have customized it so much i don't really want to revert it back to it's original state. edited by skipper 24, 02 august 2008 - 07:18 pm.

1 thanks for the review. i actually like the older tie better, since it had a stand for the tie. not really a fan of the lu figs either. no matter - a tie is a tie and this is a must have fighter for any lego sw fan out there. never can get enough ties, except the tie advanced or vader's tie...they don't rock... kimt

0 and now for something completely different: tiny turbos belonging to the racers line! when i saw 8147 bullet run on s@h for half the price i couldnt resist buying it. we had a lot of fun celebrating a bag-build at our event using the 8150 zx turbo of that theme so i knew what would expect me with this "extended" set. price: normal 49,99 now 24,99 (well i paid 34,99 in a lego store but thats another story...) bricks: 796 minifigs: - hey, this is tiny turbos, stupid! stickers: dont ask (or read further) the open box reveals seven polybags, some with more smaller polybags inside, the instruction booklet, 2 ramps and the sticker sheet. of course i put all of the bags on the table and not on the floor hey, tlc didnt print this on the first page of the building instructions! and you wont see any piece callouts as well. on the other hand this is not adifficult build, so why show them? still there is an inventory list of all bricks at the end of the instructions. note the giant sticker sheet! we all now the dss, but that is a new kind of extra super large sticker sheet. it holds 82 stickers! more to that later on. the build is quite basic. the only non-conventional parts of the build were the two slammers. and the most annoying part was fiddling the rubber band of the holder without destroying it. bag 1: easy beginning: building the lime car, the limo and the two slammers. nothing exciting about the lime car, but the limo was neat. its an 18 studs long car! the normal racers are abot 10 studs long. nice way to put the horns on the back! the slammers. mmmmh. nice invention if they would actually do something. they are supposed to give the tubros a kick in the butt to speed them up, but the result is a 80 cm long "run" and thats it. i had expected more acceleration from the slammers. but its also fun to play with the cars without slamming them. bag 2: convoy time: the tow truck and the fuel truck the tow truck is a great idea and a good addition to the set. the cars are supposed to crash - how do they get back home? well, heres the answer. quite american layout of the truck and its very well done: horns, 5 flashing lights and a right color choice. you can move the arm up and down and pull out the hook. note the metallic silver antennae. the fuel tank has got a "secret" function. it may break on the middle of the trailer. therefore it has a hinge build in the bottom. city fire mayhem! and theres no fire engine... bag 3: long, longer, how long can a "tiny" truck be? the pipe truck, an unexpected buggy and the red racer. 36+ studs long: the pipe truck breaks every convention. the cabin is almost the same like the tow truck and the fuel truck and that is the good part of it. the trailer has to carry pipes and is functional as well as it can commute sidewarts. it looks quite unrealistic as well and you cannot drive this beast on tiny roads. good for another crash. but there are more cars in this bag. now this was a surprise: a buggy? this is the only 6(+)-wide car, but just because the wheels are large. monster truck madness? i dont care for those cars. personally a disappointment, i would have preferred another racer. + for variety though. did i say another racer? here we are: the red devil. great looking, a real fast shape and red. the best racer in this set. vrooommm! this is the most "played with" car of the set. (not only from me ). as you may have noticed i didnt put any stickers so far. i dont like stickers especially when placed over two or more bricks! and here you are supposed to do it several times. of course the cars look better with stickers on, but they are also great without stickers. only the fuel truck looks boring without. my sons didnt know there were supposed to be stickers and they didnt ask for them. so everything is allright! heres a closeup of the sticker sheet (did i already mention it was 82 stickers? ): the only exception i made using sticker was for bag 4: bag 4: you go here? you pay! the highway toll booth. the only immobile part of the set, but great to brake though the barriers. that is fun! i only put on stickers on 2x2 plates where i had the idea to use those plates further on on different other mocs. this looks a bit boring without the other stickers i admit. but still no cut off to the playability! there are also two ramps belonging to the set. these only make sense if you are able to speed up the racers with the slammers and hit the ramps correctly. i had problems with that, so they are on the shelves now... could be a lot fun making a contest though. like this (picture of the inventories frontpage) all cars put together: the usual leftovers: all in all this is a great set to call ones own! i did not regret buying it, especially when it was 50% off! even normal price would not have been too much. build: great for smaller children, boring to afols: 5/10 special bricks/colors: none, all basics: 3/10 design: i love the tiny turbos size and design: 9/10 playability: -1 because of the slammers, another -1 because no minifig-scale. but that is not the intention of the set: still 9/10 price/piece ratio: dang! its not on sale any more. but if you hurry you could still grab one in the lego stores. 10/10 all in all: 8.5/10 and a clear recommendation! it was and still is a set to play with your children. the size fits perfectly to matchbox cars and that was exactly what my younger son did: can you find all of the cars included in the set? p.s.: after buying this set i won an ebay auction with another tiny turbos set - 8135 bridge chase. this is even more fun! i will soon care for a review with some never seen photo-tricks as well. stay tuned! edited by whitefang, 23 may 2009 - 07:02 pm. indexed

1 this set was on my wanted list for a long time and the sales at s@h came just in time i also loved the set, and like you only put the stickers on the toll both (it looks great on a town layout with almost no modifications). the racers are great. the trucks and the limo are the best in my oppinion. the sticker sheet is huge, but i've seen bigger. stickers over multiple pieces are the worst the slammers are ok, but not great. i played with my 4 years old son and we tryed to do what shows in the box (the cars passing the toll, jumping the ramps and crashing the trucks) but it is very difficult to get it right. but the crashes are very fun.

1 tiny turbos are good for parts, but i'm not so keen on them as they have no minifig drivers. so, i wasn't sure about this set. but your review has made me like them more, i probably won't buy the set but i appreciate it more. thanks for the review!

1 kimt, on aug 3 2008, 01:06 pm, said: thanks for the review. i'll definately get this set sooner or later. you better hurry. they are not at s@h any longer! quote a fine set, carwise.. dump the slammers and buildings into the spare bag and keep the cars. thats exactly what i did. the slammers are already seperated to our color boxes.

1 thanks for the review! i have quite a few tts.(tiny turbos). i never got this one, but if it's on sale....

1 as my summer holiday was kinda wet for 2 weeks, i decided to shop some sets. i crossed the german border and bought me this one mainly for the parts. to get time going, i built the models and made this small review for you to enjoy (or hate) high resolution pics can be found here when public. set# 4994 title: fierce creatures price: 9.99 euro / 12.99 usd pieces: 193 minifigs: 0 the box: the box looks awesome! it has some great animations of the 3 models in the instruction. the rear of the box shows some nice up-close-and-personal drawings of each model. i think it works better having the models drawn instead of a mere photo of them. somehow it allows the great colour-scheme to really show. the instructions: the instruction is easy to follow and shows which pieces are used in each building step. that makes it all a lot easier, especially with so many small pieces as in this set. the bricks are divided into 3 polybags and the instruction is a fine small book, which can be easily stored along the rest of your ever-growing amount of booklets and pamphlets printed by tlg. the models: model 1 is a spider and its nasty. the 2x2 modified brick with the hole would allow one to hang it from a string. this beast is sure to give you several nightmares, were it hanging from a string in your bedroom.  so i wouldnt do that (plus the fact that my wife threw away the box and ordered me to take the spider apart when she saw it  shes an arachnophobian and does not take spiders lightly). it looks real, in a brickish-non-real-way. model 2 is a snake. theres not much to say other than the head is awesomely designed and the rest is bad. the body is poorly designed and does not live up to the coolness of the head. build the head, ignore the rest. model 3 is a flying scorpion or something. not as realistic as the spider, but still a great model with a cool head. the tail is a bit poorly designed, but itll do and it does offer some good ideas on how to use bricks. all in all verdicts: this is an ok creator set. it holds a lot of fine pieces and the models are an ok inspiration. given its size, its an ok set. but its nothing more than that. ill give it an average score. i enjoyed building the models and fumbling with the bricks in the shade during a siesta on my vacation. and thats what it is, an enjoyable build and a little inspiration on a hot day with a erdinger dunkel weissbier in my other hand. kimt edited by whitefang, 23 may 2009 - 06:29 pm. indexed

1 thanks for the review. this is another good sw set. a true classic. i especially like the colourscheme of this set. the rebel gun is crappy though, but overall the set rocks. kimt

1 i once bought a entire lego collection including this set. however, i never have build it. seeing this fine review has given me new motivation to do so. nice work again skipper!

1 skipper, thanks for doing up all these sw reviews. it certainly had given me some valuable insights on these sets especially on the snowspeeder. it kind of making me regret to pass off this set. however, i had bought the hoth base instead but had never built it. i am just wondering if the snowspeeder had any difference? keep up the good work and always strive your best to make each upcoming review a better one.

1 thanks for the rewiev! a nice set indeed, to bad i dint buy it when it still was in the stores.

0 7255 general greivous wheel bike chase review parts: 111 figs: 2 price: 10.00 the first set to include gg. 1. general set and minifigs (not manual because i don't have it) the contents of the box after being built. both minifigs. the set includes 5 lightsabers! my own design gg. gg's cape on the outside. gg's cape on the inside. 2. the wheel bike front view standing on legs. side view. gg can't hold the controls because of his arms. roller mode. the legs are a bit to chunky so to roll it has to be tilted forward. 3. boga the lizard. grey tip to the tail. the front back and saddle split in to three sections. 4. overall build: 4/10 there isn't really much to build. minifigs: 9/10 it comes with gg with the special cape and obi-wan in rots gear which is hard to find i think. design: 5/10 not really to scale but otherwise okay apart from boga which just looks like any old dinosaur. also the controls on the wheel bike aren't really right. parts: 6/10 comes with some dark green bricks and lots of rods ( the guns on the wheel bike) the boga feet are also nice. price: 8/10 10 for 2 figs isn't bad it could have a few more parts though. playability: 10/10 you can easily recreate the movie scenes with this set. overall 7/10 it would be better if the bike and boga were more to scale and more accurate as well as the set having more parts.

1 i have all three of the slave i ships, and i agree with kimt...although it is a very small, compact ship, the first slave i (boba fett) is still the sturdiest. the newest slave i (boba fett) is not bad, and is of much better construction than this slave i from jango fett. even though i like the size and scale of the jango slave i and the newest boba fett slave i...when you pick that very first one up, it had the feeling of....."you can throw me against the wall, drop me off the roof of your house, or let 4 two year olds play with me...i'm not gonna break!" at least thats's my opinion. good review

0 thanks for the review. it looks like an interesting set, even if not as good as boba's. skipper 24, on aug 3 2008, 08:11 pm, said: i never got the original boba fett's slave 1. i wish they would make one to scale with the minifigures. i would be so cool. you mean it would be so cool? i agree that it would be, if they made a large minifig scale version like with the ucs millenium falcon. i would probably try to buy that. edited by shoc, 03 august 2008 - 08:31 pm.

0 nice review! i will say i like the latest slave i the best as it is longer than jango's. i haven't seen the first one so i cant really comment.

-1 that was indeed a set that never appealed to me. its build was just plain wrong and awful. i only bought it because i found it on clearance at around 15 (and they had 4 of them. if i had known better then, i'd have bought all 4; seeing how much that jango fett minifig is worth now... ) but i ended up heavily modifying it in its propoions and now it looks ok next to the new slave one (which is the best one of its 3 incarnations, i think)

1 i got the original jsf for christmas, which i might buy and review. wonderful set, the obi in this one is really awesome and it's really just a great ship, sticker free. probably my favourite, i'd fly it if any ship from star wars. maybe i should get it and the slave i from episode ii... after all, i like jango despite having a crap story.

0 you added some decals to the jango figure, right ? they seem to be suffering a little. i remember buying this set from the discount tent after my first visit to legoland windsor. i wasn't sure whether to buy it, even in their sale ... but i was glad i did once i'd built it :)

0 yep those decals are suffering. i am going to apply some new ones now with proper paper.

0 good review. i always wanted to know how it was different to the boba fett slave i. i would probably only get this though for jango fett. the newer one looks sturdier and proportioned better imo.

0 i remember having this set (actually i even still have it, at least the pars are somewhere ) when i was a child, and i used it for making races, as it is there for. all these many reviews let me think again at that i also planned to make some reviews for the town section. i got your message thebrickster, don't worry! i got a lot to do at the moment, but i should find some time this upcoming week.

1 manta, on aug 3 2008, 10:33 am, said: wish it was still around. even though, little sets <$10, like the new coast guard 4wd & jet, and the quad are great little city sets. lego seems to be returning to good quality small sets with their latest city line-up. metalandi, on aug 3 2008, 10:46 am, said: i remember having this set (actually i even still have it, at least the pars are somewhere ) when i was a child, and i used it for making races, as it is there for. you should look for them and resurrect it. it really feels good after you've found all the pieces and put a set back together again (as it was when you first bought it).

0 this little set really makes my point small playable inspiration to build the set into a few other models, great set i wish i had it my town is going to need more vehicles. i really miss main model instructions with alternate build idea's.

0 i hate how the original release had the light-up windu, which was really lame, and one less clone trooper. i bought it when it first came out, so missed out on a good windu and another clone trooper.

0 thanks for the review, i'll index it later. i've added a poll, so that members can vote their opinion and refrain from useless comments like "awesome!!" (this has been done to all reviews in the sw review index). keep up the good work. this is one of my favourite sets - i have both versions and as it is known, the only difference is the minifigs. i really like the tank, it has great playability and if it had wings, i'd definately swoosh it. kimt

0 did your version without the lul mace have trans blue grill things (like the ones on the back of the speeder) ? or was my set a one off.

0 good set, but it's flimsy as sin (but that may have been my rush job building it). mine got shoved off a bed oh, and i lost my light up mace >.> propably somewhere within the blue bin 'o' doom (aka the brick bucket, or block/null ) edited by maiq the liar, 04 august 2008 - 10:15 pm.

1 nice review again, skipper. i passed on this one because of the price, but it's a nice set. good for you for getting the newer version with non-lul mace and an extra clone. that purple blade sure is a beauty. the tank itself is alright, just an at-at on wheels, in my opinion. the turret is great, though, and so is the speeder bike. i didn't realize that the jet pack had two "nailguns" (harpoon guns) on it. i thought that the nailgun was a new piece... but the jetpack is very cool.

1 6701 space minifigures review set#: 6701 set name: space minifigures released: 1983 pieces: 36 (including minifigs) minifigs: 6 brickshelf gallery peeron.com bricklink brickset.com introcomment: as i reignited my love for classic space a few years ago, i decided to start hunting sets i didn't have. this small one fell into my lap very cheap. with box and minifigs in great condition. so now i've resized the pics and done the review. and no i am not envious of this forum...really...i'm not.... the box. the box is pretty neat. it has a very comfortable size (compared to modern boxes) and the back of it shows what you get. i like the way they (tlg) split the minifigs and arranged everything neatly. front: rear sadly the box has seen better days. but it's age taken into consideration, i think it's just fine. the figs: a fine collection of red, white and yellow space figs. some great accesories to go as well. not much more to say, except this was a great "army-builder"-set. a true must have for most classic space fans. the verdict: it's kinda hard rating this set, since it's a minifig supplemental set. no design or colourscheme to comment on. it has a lot of playability since figs will always come in handy when building/playing with your space sets. kimt

0 erhm... where's the review? it would be nice to have a few pics of the v-19 itself and a few comments on it. could you please add that? kimt

1 thanks for the review, simonjedi. this just re-affirms that the v-19 is my highest priority this fall. behind the rgs, of course. is that new printed piece a 2 x 2 tile? it looks like an excellent detail part for mocing. those black pieces used on the landing gear look very bionicle-like. if they haven't been used before, i'd suspect they will be. not that i'm a bionicle expert or anything. it is a shame that this set only includes one clone. that seems to be the only drawback to the set. everything else looks spot on.

0 pedro, on aug 5 2008, 12:29 pm, said: it looks pretty big compared to other starfighters too. did it take a long time to build? it took me 3 and a bit hours to build it, although i had some problems with the technic and i had to take pictures during the build.

0 rayman, on nov 29 2008, 10:16 pm, said: yes i believe that the yellow technic is only used for the building. however i didn't find it neccessary. what a strange step... its to hold the wing connectors in the the same place while the wing is being attached.

0 actually we should care that there's only one fig in it since it's kind of expensive (though that's my opinion) , but the ship is really awesome . it's too bad there's not a battlepack that includes clone pilots. edited by bricklanta, 30 november 2008 - 06:15 am.

1 i voted outstanding, this is simply an amazingly good looking train and comes with indeed 11 minifigs! i sold this one because i need a budget to build my ship, but i kept one because i love it! not bad for a first review ruben!

0 ah, i wish modern trains had 11 figs... but seriously, why is there a civilian train stop in a cave?! did 1 too many people get lost playing zork? edited by maiq the liar, 04 august 2008 - 10:21 pm.

0 thanks for the edit hinckley! it's my first poll (and review) and i wasn't quite sure if i got it right maiq the liar, on aug 5 2008, 12:20 am, said: but seriously, why is there a civilian train stop in a cave?! did 1 too many people get lost playing zork? yeah, i also wondered why the included timetable includes not only real life cities, instead of brick ones. even more so since the train track just goes round. =d

1 it's great to see someone reviewing a train! this set is definately a five! lego hasn't made a complete train set like this in a long time. the metroliner is really a legend among classic trains. the great level of playability and detailing makes it a terrific model. specifically, i was just noticing the details of the passenger car. it has a sink! - how cool is that? and 11 minifigs - when was the last time lego included 11 figs in a single set? a truly outstanding train set. thanks for sharing images as i've always wanted to see it up-close. it would be awesome if you could share some single side shots of the cars.

1 nice review i collect all metroliner i can, i have 3 metroliner and when i can, i buy a other . my aim : have the more big metroliner collect, in france ( in first time ) it's my favorite set

1 this is a great review of a great set, hairy ruben! i voted for outstanding since the only thing you can say about this train set is that it is outstanding. it has been the best passenger train in all the time from lego's beginning on until now. i bought the rereleased version of it in 2003 - and i really, really do not regret it! klaus-dieter

1 i also voted "outstanding", for the simple reason that i've owned this set for a long time, but for most of the time it's been an anonymous heap of bricks mixed with all the other bricks i have. so about a year ago i started rebuilding it, and it now sits proudly next to (also rebuilt) 2150 on my shelf. imo; it's an excellent set, best of the 9v passenger trains, no doubt. and it combines the best of the 80's trains with that of the 90's - it's not some futuristic panorama-glassed low-slung train, but an honest, realistic-looking train that captures many of the features that passenger trains used to (and in some cases; still) have.

0 i don't like the set and i do like the set. the reason why i like it: it looks good. the reason why i hate it: this train was the first train for the new 9v system and it means to me the end of the beautiful 12v series. for this last reason i own this set. i voted average. only strange they named it metroliner. in holland when we speak of a metro, i need to think at short distance trains only used in big cities like rotterdam. and your minifigs at pic ain't right according the instruction .

1 my favourite, favourite, favourite old set. it's too bad i was born 2 years after its release, i would have had a major interest in classic town. i might actually get this one on bricklink... not that it'll go for a good price (i'll only buy if it does you see). an "outstanding", a highly useful and well-made set that really just stands out from its counterparts. edit: nevermind. edited by dovchenko, 16 august 2008 - 10:25 am.

1 i never got this set i spent a long time after one christmas trying to get and failed miserably, admittedly i was much younger then. it has however remained one of my most sought after items but ive still never got around to getting one. the set generally makes me rather nostalgic for a time when the trains were painted in simple liveries like that one! anyway it seems an excellent set from what ive seen and the figure selection is amazing. i hope lego produce something as good as this when the new trains are released next year.

1 nice review hinckley. i just got mine as well by paying quite a high price for it since its exclusive to us. however, i had not opened it yet and i left it in my friend's car. i gave it for an above average for that cool little jeep. for an exclusive brickmaster set, this is certainly one of the best vehicles i had ever seen. i like its construction built. if this is ever released in the main stream, i am sure it will be a hit to get a small sized indiana jones set.

0 outback amazon crossing g'day mates! another fine review from the legoland's desert down under. this set makes for an excellent addition to your jungles, deserts, outbacks, or other wild and untamed places. set #: 6490 theme: outback year released: 1997 piece count: 117 minifigs: 1 list price: $15 (usd) starting with an image of the box, one can conclude that this doesn't look like the amazon at all, but rather the outback: on the back of the box are some great alternate models, including a creative idea for a crocodile zoo scene: the instructions have the same images on the front and back: the set comes with one outback fig, a man dressed in green with a bright red cap - i call him the crocodile hunter. also included in this set is a crocodile, some bones, a skull, backpack, pan, and a few extra trans. round 1x1s. the tools are pictured on the truck: now here's a great desert/rugged terrain truck: ready for some 4-wheel'n fun. i love the liftable top window/sun roof and the windshield. i like the use of these colored trans. blue pieces that contrast against the yellow, rather than hide like regular clear pieces: the truck has a few hooks/clips to attach a pick, rifle, antena, and camera. also attached is a water/oil can and an extra tire that just rests in the back section: the front end of the truck has a great winch and hook to help the truck out of hard places: working suspension helps the vehicle travel on rough terrain: the truck is just half the fun. this set also offers a nice bridge/creek bed for the truck to drive across: i like the use of six fence/ladder pieces for the bridge. the two in the center have double open sides. here's the left side: and the right side with a single burp as a mountain/hill: i really like the use of the tan and brown baseplates representing desert and water. the complete set as the crocodile hunter tries to climb back into the truck after attaching the winch: final thoughts: i've always liked this little set. it offers a great amount of playability with the wonderful little 4-stud wide truck and bridge scene. a few years ago, playmobil offered a desert racing theme and had this set as my favorite of the collection: desert racing and adventures through dry creeks and rough terrain make for a great theme. hope you enjoy this review and consider picking up an outback set (or two) if you can still buy at a reasonable price. happy outbacking! the complete outback theme: 6444 outback airstrip 6487 mountain rescue 6490 amazon crossing 6550 outback desert racer 6553 crisis news crew edit: i dedicate this review to the memory of steve irwin (1962 - 2006): tribute

1 stauder, on aug 7 2008, 06:17 am, said: the great thing about the copter was it had 2 suitcases, which as far as i can tell ain't a common part, not rare, but still nice to have. and it had the guy with the green jacket. the winch wasn't bad either, the only flaw was it was a "standard" lego copter, meaning similar ones where avalible in quite a few sets. do you plan to review it? oh, i wish i had it. i don't recall seeing 6487 in the stores back when i purchased the other outback sets. i'd love to see a review.

1 nice review of an interesting set. but i have a query... anyone know why it is actually called amazon crossing when it's meant to be in australia? also, the amazon runs through a jungle anyway. edited by shoc, 10 august 2008 - 03:44 pm.

1 very interesting indeed! i especially like the folding ladder. i never thought of making such a clever function. i might have to use it in my future lego models. another great reveiw bloody jay! ;)

0 this is an ok set....

1 nice review cobra. thanks for sharing. i think arctic was one of those neat themes that never really took off. i like these little poly-bag sets as they make great starters/introduction sets for themes (or) serve as a nice supplement or add/on to an existing collection. i've always liked the thick green hood piece used in the arctic theme and have thought about using it in a sw hoth scene. in any case, nice review! i've got an arctic set that i built recently and will share a review soon.

-1 i'm confused there's two topics of this . anyway allon-sy,nice review i quite like this set i'd buy it if it had just 2 plain clones please tlg how are we supposed to army-build!!! edited by foxy, 08 august 2008 - 12:59 am.

1 so it comes with an extra gun-holding arm? it looks like it, and that's great. that way you can make all of the droids gun-totting ones.

-1 hollisbrick, on dec 29 2008, 10:20 pm, said: this is a great set it's too pricey though if it was $10 or so cheaper i'd get it! actually its on sale now. or at least for americans.

0 cloneme, on dec 30 2008, 04:23 pm, said: actually its on sale now. or at least for americans. damn americans jk nah i'm aussie mate

-1 i got this yesterday on sale (only 5500 yen>>>$60 american) and was a little disappointed. i'd avoided it, but all the new sets are at least a month away here. it looks a little weird in photo, and the actual build is worse, just a flat little disc with a cockpit. only special points for the color, which will probably just look better with those 2009 sets.

1 wow, and people complain that a military type line would be to violent. here we have half dead soilders and a space shuttle bombing people with severed skeleton heads! i have to say this is the first time i've heard of this theme. i like the colors as most have pointed out. the base plate is preety cool two. could use it to moc up some garages.

-1 i am a proud owner of this set. like others, i got it discounted and couldn't resit the parts pack. this is the type of lego sets that bothers me. when you look at it now, you'd be tempted to say "hey not bad", but at the same time, some years ago, it wasn't good enough to buy it full price. i was kinda disappointed because usually sets using that kinda baseplates are excellent (castle, paradisa), and this one is just "ok". one really minus point would be the lack of any opponent faction in the set

0 thanks for the review pmj . i like the play value in this set even if i dont own it . the way the orbs are put into the rocket is awesome and i really like it, but at the end the set have some lack of detail .

1 thanks for the review. now i thinnk i will buy this set. btw, i really like what you did to the back. i might do the same to mine....

1 zzz, on aug 12 2008, 09:00 pm, said: and i simply love that there is space inside. you said there is not really some cause of the landing gear mechanism, but it seems it should be easily fixed. do you think there is enough space to put some plates over the landing gear and add some beds, kitchen und tv? i think this set is so perfect to mod it into a clone wars mobile home, your back garden ist just perfect for this. it does have that homely feel! there is room inside with technic beams to lay plates etc on, the only issue is that it's kind of fiddly to access. you could do it from either the side door or rear door though, maybe move that tow line at the back. i have to say, it is a set that grows on you

-1 i will not be picking this one up. the main thing is that it simply looks akward. it is big and bulky, and seems to have random pieces on it with not reall streamline feel to it. i also agree that for an exclusive that it $100, it needs more than just 3.5 mini figures. anikan and ashoka and rotta already come in the at-te, which is cheaper and has more figures. r2-d2 is a figure that i am sure everybody has at least 4 or 5 of. for that kind of money, i expect something with at least one unique figure, and more than 4. i also want just a cleaner and better designed set. this is probably the letdown of the collection so far. every collection needs one.

0 joebot, on aug 12 2008, 04:17 pm, said: seems like tlc has done a pretty accurate representation of the ship. the real fault for the ship's messy design has to go to lucasfilm, not tlc. my guess is lucasfilm is trying to recapture that "what a piece of junk!" magic of the millennium falcon. i guess we'll have to wait to see the movie to see if they succeeded or not. the idea of a "space mobile home" reminds me of the winnebago from "spaceballs." great review!! informative, entertaining, and opinionated. so many people shy away from stating an actual opinion in their review for fear of offending anyone. what's the point of making a review if you don't state what you think about it??? nice! its $99 = 52, but our price is 80-90! that ugha warrior looks like man friday from robinson crusoe!: edit: also i am going to use that wing technique for ww2 mocs! its perfect! edited by joey lock, 12 august 2008 - 11:00 pm.

1 i think some people agree that this ship is better than when we first saw those pictures, at least i do. it looks like it has some nice accessories that come with the ship as well. my favorite of you custom things has got to be the octopus it's so funny and a great use for the headdress thing. great review. edited by skipper 24, 13 august 2008 - 11:24 am.

0 [/quote] part 3: a closer view[/b] close-up of the main body of the ship: front-on. it is well-designed how the figs appear in line of sight (unlike the 6211 where jabba and leia were photoshopped in to the box art). don't ask what rotta is doing out of the line of vision there. some things are better left unsaid. [/quote] rotta: can i get on your knee to look outside? anakin: no! rotta: can i pull this lever? anakin: don't touch it! rotta: i want to drive! anakin: if your not quitting i will get you back to that mean white woman. rotta: i need a clean diaper! anakin: ashoka, get of the toilet! it's my turn to get some rest. ashoka: i thought i would become a padawan, not a babysitter! [/quote] [the rear deck is so large that it is wasted just being used so ahsoka can bungee-jump. i came up with a much better use for it. outdoor garden! despite having one roboticised hand, anakin was still quite the green thumb. and his light-saber was very useful as a hedge trimmer. so much so that he set up a side business between rotta-rescue missions. here's a promotional postcard: and to finish on a light note, i'd like to remind you that you do get another ahsoka hairpiece, which can be used for all sorts of things. ugha warrior upgrade: dr inferno hair transplant: and finally, attack of the deadly blue-ringed octopus, native to australia's beaches and oceans! thanks for reading! [/quote] lol, the garden would be lovely to see in gardeners world. never thought patrick star also liked gardening.

1 argh! what i was typing kept getting deleted by my stupid keyboard!!!!! on topic: this looks like a great little set, i could use a few of these, but i haven't seen any at a local store. too bad for me i suspose . great review, and i like the green plate on the bottom, never can have too many greens for my small but expanding swamp i'm building. hope i can pick some of these up eventualy.

1 this little bugger brought me back from my dark ages! as a movie fan, i just couldn't resist the thought of making an animation with living lego skeletons (i'm referring to ray harryhausen's work on the classic jason and the argonauts here). buying the indy sets stopped me from getting a lot more castle sets. though in time i added the final joust, the wizard and the impulse knight to my collection, as well as buying more unique figs (king, princess) from expensive castle sets off bricklink. so yeah. great little set. two crownies, a skeleton and a skeletal horse, you just cannot resist that! even if you hadn't been buying lego for 5 years. as far as i'm concerned, this set is one for the ages! i love it!

1 this is an awesome set in my opinion. i scraped my crossbows for mocing recently, but the set is still an amazing army builder. for the price for the sw battlepacks, which have 4 minifigs and a cheap vehicle, you get 4 knights ( this is 2 sets to equal the price of a bp ), 2 skellys and 2 skelly horses, plus 4 crossbows, 4 good wheels, and some other good dark blue and brown pieces for my ever expanding castle town. great buy.

1 i've been waiting to hold this set in my hands for about a year and a half. thanks to a silly tlc decision, 7009 was not available in italian stores. i finally decided to buy it on the net (2x , plus some other sets) and those morons at the custom charged me quite a lot. after i bought it, while waiting for it to arrive, i found out it was available in a store in switzerland, not far away from home... that's for the storytelling. as for the set, i thought it was great, and still think so. a good army builder (as quite a few sets in the 2007/2008 castle line), and a time traveller (6021 being my first lego castle set ever). rating? 5/5! edited by the cobra, 13 august 2008 - 09:04 pm.

0 i should really get one more of these for the figures, shields, and weapons. this set is the only one with the scythe in pearl-grey, by the way. "the only thing that puzzles me is; why would a crown knight joust a skeleton?" good question. for a joust to make sense, this set should contain two human knights instead -- which would be fine with me so long as they had differing armour and colours. edited by tenorikuma, 13 august 2008 - 03:51 am.

1 this set is a great little bundle, the kitted out knight, skellie knight, weapons, and the few bricks for the fence and weapon rack. the castle 07 barding here is very nice, indeed the colour scheme of the new castle guys is great imo, the light blue and blue work nicely together and against the grey background. i don't really like the pearl grey helmet - it would be nicer in metallic silver like the visor i think. interesting comment re: the skellie helmet - i guess black normal knight's helmet with visor would be quite nice for him. i got this set as part of the complete castle collection from s@h. however, i have extras of all the smaller sets and skeleton tower, except i don't have another one of this set. it's on my list of sets to buy. unfortunately it wasn't on s@h for ireland when i was making later orders - quite an odd omission. also last year castle '07 was exclusive to argos (uk catalogue retailer) who only had three sets (not the joust). i should see if the local toy store has it now though, as they did stock some '07 castle in addition to '08 at the start of the year. i think small sets like this should be well stocked in shops for a year or two - it surely doesn't do their sales much good to be so sporadically available? sorry, turned into a bit of a ramble. anyways, the point is that this set is good enough i'd pick up another. the cobra: that sucks about customs. i try to keep my orders to within the 23 duty-free limit for here in ireland. if your imports are waylaid you pay 20% import duty, 21% sales tax, and a postage fee for the diversion to customs. nasty! edited by brickzone, 13 august 2008 - 11:15 am.

0 kimt, on aug 13 2008, 05:00 am, said: the quality of the set. feel free to comment on the review and/or set also. thanks . the set is average. it's useful for picking up a few knights, but i'm not really partial to the skeleton. the idea of a knight and a skeleton tilting just strikes me as being odd. my biggest issue with the current castle line is that most sets force you to purchase a mixture of skeletons/knights orcs/knights orcs/dwarves etc.. this is fine for those of you who love your fantasy, however it makes the line a bit underwhelming for the rest of us. still, as mentioned earlier the set does have an upside so it is worth a purchase. the review on the other hand is aces with great photos and a detailed description of the set and its contents. nice work.

0 perhaps he meant the pearl light grey lance, which is not that common.

1 first things first. the knight's helm does have a spot for a plume. now, i really like this set and it was the first one i dug into when i got my collection in the mail. it has a great selection of equipment for good or evil figures and the barding for the horse is outstanding. my only wish was for one of the long chrome swords for the knights. i think the new knights with the tall shield and chrome sword look excellent on foot and on horseback. it would definitely be neat to revisit this set with another human knight instead of the skeleton. make that change and add a lady to joust for and it'd be bang on.

1 great review, and great set! i just wanted to comment on the beauty of the car included in this set. it gets no better than a four-wide car and hinged roof (with sunroof!)

1 hairy ruben, on aug 13 2008, 05:03 pm, said: somehow, i feel like watching south park now ... that was such a good episode i thought it was simpsons, but you're right-it's a sheila braflowksi line. isn't it in the movie, though? right before "blame canada?" on topic, i find it funny that people find that car so great. i don't like 4 wide cars but i also think it's beautiful just because of the nostalgic feeling i get looking at it-like hot cocoa on christmas morning with a new teddy bear in my stocking. get out of my socks teddy bear! my feet are cold! is that santa's boot dangling from the chimney? what's that smell? anyway, does anyone long for the days of 2-wide cars with 2 x 2 slope windshields that were more suited for a skateboard than a car? i suppose someone has to have affection for those things. who was around back then? copmike? gylman? hobbes? do you like 2-wide cars? seriously though, anyone? my point is, as much as i like the realism of the six-wide and wider cars, the 4-wides make me feel all warm and fuzzy.

0 well, technically it is 4 wide...

1 this is my favourite house which i owned during my childhood. although it's in the crypt, but i hope to build it back one day. looking at your review makes me so envy of you to own a complete set. the baseplate is very unique especially for its stoned pattern. classic lego telephone is just so lovely especially when its printed. the entire house layout is simple and very nicely constructed. in fact, the simplicity just showed how much lego could do with such parts. there are many nice furnitures included in this set such as the little oven/stove, dining table, bed and car porch. the little black car is a classic example of a true 4-studs car. i love this house very much, and my verdict is a full "5". no doubt about it. thanks hinckley for this lovely review.

1 thanks for the wonderful review. this is really a beautiful set - i love the old lego houses from the 80's and 90's - they were always very quaint and well designed. actually, i like the old car designs too, but only for their nostalgic value (in reality, they are very unrealistic and look more like go carts). that said, not all four wide cars are silly looking - the 4-wide cars in these city sets are awesome and fit in with the modern city style great.

1 i just bought this! it's truly a wonderful set and i love the houses from that era as well. very charming. great review!

1 this is an awesome set, man... and a great review. just too bad it is so rare! i voted 5. by the way, does anyone know if there is a review for this? or other sets that come with a camper, perhaps? also, i was wondering if the creator houses are in scale and could be used with minifigs and such.

1 hello all eurobricks members and town lovers, today, i will be doing up the third item in the shell promotional series in 1998. three out of the eight promotional sets are under town theme. the third in the line is the exterme team sub theme which is promoted in 1998. extreme team is a bunch of adventurous, daring, breath taking individuals that risk their lives for an unforgettable excitement of the lifetime. their vehicles range from land, air and sea type of extreme taking types. extreme team is one the unknown themes ever released in my "dark age". i only had this small lovely set in my entire extreme team collection. hope we are able to see more interesting reviews under extreme team as well. name: extreme team raft theme: lego system / town / promotional / shell year: 1998 pieces: 19 minifigs: 1 price: usd$2.00 an image of a 2537, extreme team, raft this will be an exciting water adventure! this is another great addition to your female population count. she is one of thhe daring individuals in the extreme team, that take her raft beyond limit, into the rough waters where she might face possible dangers. look how confident she is, with those witty eyes of her. i am very sure she will survived the course of her entire journey. raft's design this is a very simple design, with just a big piece of wooden plank and a couple of logs tied together on the side, and it is ready to take it down to the water. speaking of some real adventure, do you dare to take this raft in the unknown waters? there is a small holding area, where she is able to place her critical equipment to ensure her safety throughout the journey. bottom of the raft excellent range of equipment this set actually provides very good range of equipment. there is a pair of oars, hammer, life vest and backpack. the most wonderful piece of equipment is the pair of dynamites. first of all, they are printed. next, they can be used in wild west or any playing possibilites which involved in explosives. this is a very good impulse set to stock up these accessories. i wondered what she need to use these dynamites for? her extreme team black jacket is very nicely designed, with their logo "x" or another way of saying "xtreme". i find the green arms and black jacket matched pretty well, with that blue cap. front view relaxing herself, listening to the calm sea to summarise, this is one of the better impulse sets ever produced. it comes with a simple raft with tons of good accessories, and a very cheap way to obtain dynamites. in fact, these are my only 2 piece in my entire collection. somehow, this set managed to find its way to my collection in my dark age, and i am very pleased to have this. no major flaws on this set, it fufill the conditions of an excellent impulse set! summary review playability: 9.5/10 (high playability involved. you can used it as an indy, adventurers or whatever purpose for the raft) design: 10/10 (very very simple design with superb great accessories. for a promo/impulse set, it's very good) price: 9.5/10 (a very inexpensive set based on the 1998 pricing. great way to buy this to add in some adventures of your own) overall: 9.7/10 (this is a fanastic set, mainly for its accessories. get it if you still see any of these. it's defintely worth the money, if its reasonable) i gave it a "5" based on my review score card. what about yours? hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine. comments and critics are strongly welcomed. pictures can be found in my brickshelf (when moderated)

0 again a great review, whitefang! i voted for average: the minifig and the accessores are excellent - but the raft itself is very poor. klaus-dieter

1 aerial recovery set #: 6462 theme: town res-q year released: 1998 piece count: 201 minifigs: 3 list price: $25 (usd) my personal favorite of the res-q theme released in 1998 was this helicopter, 6462 aerial recovery. the set offered a pretty modern helicopter, raft, three-wheeler, rescue gurney and net, and three figs including a diver. the set is action-packed and offers a high degree of play value. starting with the box, front side and back: front back i always liked the rough ocean/sea water pictured in the boxart. the same image from the front of the box appears on the cover of the instructions: but the back of the instructions picture a plain view of the copter: one sticker sheet with a few "res-q" stickers is included, mainly for the tail section of the helicopter: interestingly, the set includes three figures, one being a diver. what i always found strange is the inclusion of an "x-treme team" diver who has the logo on his torso (although it's a very nice fig): back shot: i think this was my first set with a lego three-wheeler. i always liked it a lot: the set includes a yellow raft (also found in the divers sets) and some scuba gear: note: the raft has a black piece in it's center for lifting up by the helicopter for sea and emergent rescue, a gurney can also be lifted by the helicopter: the set also includes a net with hook to lift the three-wheeler and other items. an extra string pulls the net closed: here's a shot of the helicopter: the front section has a large trans. blue piece enclosing the cockpit: inside is a printed radar slope: a smaller trans. blue piece appears a bit higher for access to the middle section of the helicopter and/or a small storage area: in the middle section is an place for the gurney and a box for storing some of the adventure gear: here's a picture showing the gurney: on the side is a pulley mechanism that swings to the right when not in use: on the opposite side is the winch to raise and lower the grappling hook: here's a picture of an open storage box: i like the tail section with propeller: decal is not shown here's another shot of the copter from a different angle: and the final image, the entire set: final thoughts personally, i think this is pretty nice set. i like the thought of using the helicopter to rescue people at sea using the working winch. extras like the trike/three-wheeler and the rescue net make the set even more fun. hope you enjoy this res-q review.

1 thanks for this review thebrickster, i also have this set and think it's one of the best helicopters tlg made in the 90's. it's quite big and has got place for 2 minifigs in the cockpit. i also like the fact that there's a victim included in form of the x-treme diver, which also is a theme i always loved as a kid. do you have any other res-q sets left to review? it would be an honour for me to also do a review of one or more sets which are left, but unfortunately i got not much time at the moment.

1 this helicopter is so cool and i agreed with you that this is a high playablity set. it's not common to see such a big scale helicopter which has two cockpits back then. the color scheme works well for me. with so much features such as the lowering of the grappling hook, storage box, storing of the gurney and etc. one thing which can be improved onto the helicopter is the rotors. it could be extended a little longer as the size of the helicopter is too big. it makes the rotors rather weak as it is not able to support the weight. i am confused why there is an extreme team personnel there. i thought he was supposed to be recovered from the res-q team? although there is so many questions in my head such as why include the black tri-cycle bike, extreme team, and etc but this is still one very good set to play with. too bad, i had never seen this before. somehow, through your review, i like it very much. the only big scale helicopter which i owned is the 7738 coast guard helicopter and lift raft. neverthless, i gave this a "4". thanks brickster.

1 the helicopter looks nice and the resq minifigs were nice. the diver minifig had once been a personal favorite of mine.

1 a neat set with lots of accessories, but i never liked any of the lego helicopters with long streamlined canopies, as they are obviously more influenced by military helicopters and space ships, than by real civilian transport helicopters. i'd give it a 3 at best. very good and thourough pictorial review though!

-1 i think the set is too unrealistic, i like the new resq sets better (and i'm somewhat a lifeboat freak so i'm always following such a sets with interest). i would like to see some rigit inflatable boats some day ;) but about the chopper, i like the accessoiries.

1 well i for one really like this set it has to be one of the nicer ribbies that tlg has made tons of playability and nice options for redesign, great set overall. thanks for the review.

1 very nicely done - this cart is a striking resemblance to the crossbow cart we got in 2007.

0 nice review i agree with thok its quite similar to the more recent crossbow attack, though this one has the added benefit of two shields. this set would i fleet be more useful to army builders than most of the modern castle sets, even though many people dont like frightknights.

0 looks great, and the figures up there are old, and kinda rare. i don't really like fright knights though, so i probably won't get this set.

0 i gave it above average. it was a nice set and included some nice pieces, but it is only an impulse set after all. edited by newright, 19 august 2008 - 01:06 pm.

1 this is really an ideal small set. in spite of its size, it has nearly everything:  three minifigs  a vehicle  a building  numerous minifig accessories  numerous rare and useful parts  nice model design (especially for the time period) too bad outback came out during my dark years.

1 this was a cool set i thoght of it as i was building the post plane.

1 i have had this on my bricklink wanted list for ages, and yet noone with my criteria has it. nice review and brilliant set.

1 nice review i realy like this set, two nice minifigs in an affordable set and i do like the speeder but that lift thing is strange, but now at least i know what it is, thanks for letting me know!

0 thanks for the nice review kimt . i like this set especially by the fact that it is the only set containing the dooku minifig and the curved lightsaber , i also think that the minifig is cool but i also own the dagobah x-wing and the wookiee catamaran sets so i have enought minifigs (a clone wars version would be very cool ) and the extra-thingy is well, just ok. the bad part is that i don?t buy the set when it is out and now is go for $40 on ebay and bricklink . edited by darkrebellion, 18 august 2008 - 09:51 pm.

0 oky wan kenobi, on aug 18 2008, 02:41 pm, said: wasn't this the only [yoda] that was ever released except for the one in the dagobah/x-wing set? sure, he is not the best fig with the unmovable legs and all, but still: it's yoda! edit: i'm pretty sure we got a yoda in the wookiee catamaran set from revenge of the sith ...runs to check brickset... yep, there's a yoda in that set, as well. but the jedi duel is the only reasonably priced set with the green force-guru. nevermind, looks like a couple of other members already covered yoda's availability in other sets. back on topic: great review, and a real blast from the past. i never did get this set, just didn't care for the speederbike or the weird piece of equipment. thanks for explaining that it's supposed to be used to "force-jump & spin" yoda all over the place. i never knew that's what it was for. anyway, wish i had known yoda and dooku were going to be impossible to get later; i may've picked this set up just for the minifigs. edited by bamaker, 18 august 2008 - 10:39 pm.

-1 i think this is a pretty lame set. it came with dooku, who i think only came in this set, plus a unique lightsaber. still, they could have made it much bigger, added anikan and obi-wan, and added structures and made it more like the scene from the movie. also, the speeder doesn't seem very accurate.

0 cheers for the review kimt! of the initial episode ii lego releases this set was the least inspiring, but the minifigs were must-haves. you can't go wrong with count dooku and yoda! i like the design of dooku's speeder in the movie but lego missed the mark a bit with it here and gave him a dodgy flying boat instead! the speeder cradle/yoda jumping mechanism was just a waste of parts unfortunately. i'd like to see dooku's speeder re-imagined by lego. they've come a long way in the way they design a lot of the new star wars sets

0 i know we have another review of this set, but since i just got it, i thought i would share my comments on it. set name: droid gunship platform number: 7678 pieces: 329 price: $29.99 before we begin i will say that i like having a droid gunship, but i still hope we get a maf: hmp droid gunship: maf droid gunship: on to the review. here we have the box. it is really shiny, and smooth, and fits the set's size okay. it has a clean, bright look, and is truley outstanding. the back of the box, which has the features of the set, as well as the other three cw sets. the contents the siticker sheet. no to bad, and the stickers have clear backs, which is always nice. instructions here we have the figs(two new droids and one older armed droid for the cockpit), and the extra parts. the build starts with the flat base. pretty simple. the bottom. the side lasers. next is the head: it starts pretty soild. the side buble laser turrets. loveing the detail. on the ship: the "lid" and eyes. the finished cockpit. cozy interior... would have had more room if it were the maf though. the front landing gear. simple and effective. the back landing gear. the rockets. the clips are annoying. but it make the rockets work so, i guess it was nessecary. mounted on the bottom. not very secure, but that's why they are meant to be dropped on the clones.... the finished ship. --------------------------------------------- let me say that the droid gunship is a nice set indeed. final rating: 86% hope you enjoyed the review! please, if you have a ny questions, pic requests, etc, then by all means, ask! best regards, vbbn

0 nice review! thanks for the clear pics. also, if you place a brick so the axles on the bomb mechanisms tips are touching the brick, the bombs should stay on. jifel

1 you're me want to buy this

1 i don't know what it is about this set but i love it. i can't get enough of it. it looks amazing. nice review.

1 i remember getting this for christmas, and despite the earthy grey parts i relly enjoyed it, and it is nice to see pictures of it again- thanks.

1 thank you for that very interesting review, metalandi. a cool set with a lot of features and some nifty vehicles, very playable and well designed indeed. perhaps a bit too colorful for my likings, but pretty impressive in its conception for sure. i wish we could see some more landscaping coming along with todays vehicle sets as well...

1 i rate it a full 5 too. and i wish lego would make a set like this in 2010. a town needs pizza! edit: don't always trust peeron. sometimes they miss some pieces, and sometimes they just can't count them! edited by the cobra, 24 august 2008 - 11:41 am.

0 got this one as well, not much surprises in such a small set, but the fast-food pizza idea is pretty cool. as far as i know only the small mcdonalds promo and this set are related to food/restaurant thing (until the cafe corner that is) but since i have a classic lego city i can't miss this set.

0 whitefang, on aug 24 2008, 04:12 pm, said: flyut, if you need decals for the stickers that are featured in this set. hang around here until imperialshadows drop by to give you a little surprise if he is free. imperialshadows, on aug 26 2008, 10:53 am, said: surprise? free? i'm not even close to free, i'm rather expensive, but i do have a surprise for everyone! i think you'll be interested in the companion article to this fine review, my first set restoration project. that's great, maybe i'll be restoring my 6350 - pizza to go in the near future, thanks . now to figure out how i can get my printer to do what i want (sometimes that thing has a will of its own ) great thread about restoring pizza to go

1 i got the original version as a surprise one christmas. my parents liked the design so much they got it for me. this is one of the best town sets. if it didn't have the delivery van it would have been on par with 6683 hamburger stand, a great set in its own right. the van, and they way the back holds the pizzas, is ingenious and bumps this set up to the highest levels.

1 i remember having this set when it was originally released a good few years back, but i don't think i have it anymore. i remember i thought it was really awesome though. i thought the oven and pizza storage in the back of the car were the greatest parts, the little sink on the inside was cool too. didn't realise they had made a legends set out of it... i'd love to own this set again, but misb examples on bricklink go for an extortionate amount of money. ah well, se la vie...

1 i used to want this set so badly and i almost got it when it was rereleased. i still wonder why i didn't because with a building, van, 5 pizzas, and a then very rare female fig. this set would have been perfect for someone with a smaller collection like i had then. what surprised me the most is how well this set still holds up to others today. off to bricklink!

0 do you mean this one http://www.brickset....aspx?set=2962-1 ? i would also like to get that, alone for the fact that it's the only res-q set with a female fig

1 there are very few late 90's or early 00's sets worth ever having and i wish i had this one. with it's futuristic look and yes, that tow truck too, oh yeah heaps of equipment ! it's not over junorised, there is still plenty of building in it. thanks and have a happy new year, 'metalandi' !

1 thanks for the really cool review baby . i think this is an awesome first attemp for your first review: it flows well, really good pics and many pics . in the set, i think this is a good purchase i will buy it when it comes out in the us and i think it is cool looking and the fuctions look neat . edited by darkrebellion, 26 august 2008 - 11:12 pm.

0 mattzitron, on aug 13 2005, 11:30 pm, said: the strange thing is, for the first time i can remember the minifigs came decapitated, and there's no neckwear. i recall jake saying something about it being new lego policy to supply the minifig heads and torsos separately. what with the expenses-trimming and all, it's apparently one of the many little quirky things they've discovered in the manufacturing and packaging process that people have done for years without thinking (in this case, putting the heads on the torsos) but that turns out to be a surprisingly significant expense (timewise, i suppose). think it was in one of his blog posts, but not sure. too tired (ie, lazy) to go hunting for it now, sorry >-|

1 thanks for the pics so far. will you have high-res pics of the other sets in the instructions?

-1 mattzitron, you have done well to display images of the dung stain hull... its a darn shame that it can't be extended. however, i see no reason why lego couldn't produce a special middle hull piece that is compatible. although the way they've made the hull is a bit stupid. the old system was a lot more flexible. better still why can't lego design a hull that can be extended in length and width... then they could be as made as long or wide as desired and that would be great!

1 yoda601, on aug 17 2005, 02:53 pm, said: it's a shame it only comes with two figs. it would be great for my ancient middle-east project. if you ever get a moment, i'd love some pics of that. i've been tooling around with something along those lines in my ever expanding fantasy setting. akkh

1 woohoo!!! thanks for these pics. i'm probably more excited about the dark red 1x4 arch than anything else. i have a large project that i'm doing in dark red, but there has only been the 1x6 arch made in that color....until now! now to figure out how to score about a hundred of them :/ -jeramy

1 very nice review of a set that i've been dying to get, but my friendly neighborhood lego store never seems to have in stock. the yellow seat is most definitely not a new piece. i had two of those in my old beta-1 command base, almost 30 years ago!!

1 thanksfor this review, i also got this set recently, and i'm very happy about it. i live the design of these new trucks, and the forklift is also great. not to forget the good amount of cargo. btw., i think the "mysterious cargo" only are normal fuel barrels

1 nice review, vbbn! i stumbled upon your yellow seat as well. didnt you have one already or what made you think its new? the big letdown on this set is the big canopy. i would have preferred single bricks for that. and for this truck there is no real need for a hollow canopy - it could as well have been made of solid bricks. maybe we get another set with different use of the canopy. this is one of the reasons i didnt buy it so far. and im especially not interested in another forklift, i have plenty of those... i agree its the best one we have seen so far though.

1 metalandi, on aug 27 2008, 07:50 pm, said: that explains why it isn't in our local stores. i also got it from s@h, but my box hasn't got the "special edition printing" on it, surprisingly. just like dwarve's mine is exclusive to target. holodoc, on aug 28 2008, 04:16 am, said: nice review, vbbn! i stumbled upon your yellow seat as well. didnt you have one already or what made you think its new? the big letdown on this set is the big canopy. i would have preferred single bricks for that. and for this truck there is no real need for a hollow canopy - it could as well have been made of solid bricks. maybe we get another set with different use of the canopy. this is one of the reasons i didnt buy it so far. and im especially not interested in another forklift, i have plenty of those... i agree its the best one we have seen so far though. thanks! i have a yellow seat, but i just thought it was interesting. as for the canopy, it really looks good on the finished truck; i like it. and that forklift could be the official one, and the rest could become parts...

1 today i shall be reviewing 8290 mini forklift, which i recieved when i went to tru to get a technic set. so enjoy! set name: mini forklift number: 8290 theme: technic parts: 89 price: $10.99 1/box the box for this set is suprisingly small. it's about the size of a $3.99 set. it shows the main forklift, and the set information. the back of the box features the dragster. a very cool model, and the suspension works perfectly. 2/contents we have two instruction booklets; one for the forklift and one for the dragster. the bags: here are a few interesting pieces: the long double pin in blue, a bionicle connecter joint, and a yellow l joint. 3/build we start off build nice and solid, with your average technic build: the following steps build up the detail of the bottom part. next comes the cab. it's pretty simple yet effective. after that comes the forks. they work very well, but if you have the palatte on them, and you let go, it might topple off. hint: put the edge of the palatte on the small lip on the pieces that connect to the forks. this will hold it on better. the finished product and palatte: extra pieces(keep them, as they are used to build the alternate model): here is something that i found- how to put a minifigure into the cab. first, remove the side doors. then, set the fig into the cab, with his arm sticking slightly out the gap. and finaly, seal off the cab. a nice way to put system into technic for your towns. ---------------------------- parts: 9/10(loving them all.) price per part ratio: 8/10(somewhat pleaseing) playability: 9/10: works in any system town, and has a great dragster alternate model. overall: 26/30 86% b+ overall i would definatly recommend this set to anyone, whether you are a system or technic fan, this is perfect. it has great parts, and is pretty cheap. the alternate model is also very good. i hope you all enjoyed my review! i have made the pictures the requested size on my camera. i look forward to hearing your comments. edited by ~vbbn~, 27 august 2008 - 07:02 pm.

1 nice work vbbn i'm not really into technic myself, but you've definately done a fine review on this set funny that it actually fits a minifig. perhaps we'll see fans design forklifts with technic and having it minifig sized

1 thats really a sweet and charming little technic set, thanks for that fine review!

0 nice review. the figure fitting inside is great. i think the price might be a little high but you did get it from tru so what else is to be expected.

0 the y-wing is the work horse of the rebel alliance. its well armed and heavily armoured, but youll need it because youll be moving like a sleepy hut!  general rieekan set name: y-wing starfighter set number: 7658 number of pieces: 454 figures:2 released: 2007 list price: 39.99 lets us begin with the box. the front shows it in all its swooshing glory. http://tdy.org.uk/images/7658-02.jpg the back shows some of the many features of the set and also others you might like to buy in the star wars range. after opening the box we find a single instruction booklet now we come to an important aspect of any star wars set the figure, here were provided with an anomalous rebel pilot and his faithful r5 droid. the pilot comes with the fairly standard lego star wars non-hero helmet printing. whats he going to do with the blaster taken on the entire empire? one of the more interesting parts is the assembly of the engine, which if like me you dont pay enough attention to the instructions when building you can end up getting wrong. the key detail i got wrong. just before fitting the last engine. if we look carefully on the side we can see a missile launcher. i didnt think torpedoes or concussion missiles were fired from there but i may be wrong. after fitting the engine the models looks like this. in all its glory. manning one of the alliances fighters. not so ready to take on the empire was he? so overall we have a well designed model, which is in my opinion far superior to the original we were offered with darth vader way back when lego star wars was new. this y-wing is sleek and looks great in my opinion, the firing missiles are also a great touch. the rating system figures: 5/10 (for the same price the last x-wing had far more figures) parts 6/10 swooshability 9.5/10 design 9/10 price 3/10 grand total 32.5/50 not to shabby. conclusion. so finally the answers to the questions youve no doubt want to know is the set worth the price. ill be frank 39.99 is too much for this set. despite this i currently have a squadron of three y-wings, the reasons is this set has been on sale a number of times at 30 its certainly worth the money. lego recently placed them online with a price of 20, this i think was a great price for the set and well work picking one or more up if you wanted to start your own rebellion.

1 a wonderful set and a really charming design, well detailed and pretty smooth at the same time. perhaps that small gap at the cockpits an a little weak point, but we can always mod a little. thanks for that very neat review, cardinal brick!

1 great review! the y-wing is an awesome starfighter and the detail in this set is superb. funnily enough i was just swooshing mine today! edited by pedro, 27 august 2008 - 08:25 pm.

(yoda has my email :p hehe) actually i had read of the naked swooshing before, but alas, my y-wing swooshing was in my workplace where it's generally accepted that you keep your clothes very much on. it's a completely different story when i'm at home though...

0 i've built the y-wing and the imperial landing craft (7659) more or less at the same time and, for about the same prices, i think the imperial landing craft (ilc) is much superior to the y-wing. the y-wing doesnt have much functionality besides an awkward dropping bomb device and a moving cannon. the missiles firing system is  your fingers. the ilc has an awesome missiles firing system (i wish i could get it individually for mocs), a clever bomb dropping mechanism, 5 minifigures with weapons, the wings fold up together and the cargo can be detached as a play set. ive built the ilc first so i got quite disappointed with the y-wing.

0 kimt, on aug 28 2008, 09:08 pm, said: you've got to be kidding? the ilc is bulky and doesn't even come close to the design superiority of the y-wing. it's smooth, it's beautiful and it's awesomely designed by the designers at lego. "it's got greebles, man!" i was not talking about the looks, of course the rebels have got to have nicer looking ships

1 the y-wing is a truly beautifull ship, and lego has done a great job on this one, lacking landing gear is a minus point though. and nice review by the way!

-1 siegfried, on 04 september 2011 - 09:27 am, said: please, check the date prior to asking questions in old topics. three years ago in this case. it's rude to expect people to answer questions like that, especially since it's such a generic question. besides, how is he supposed to answer the question without knowing a lot more about the new y-wing... sorry!

0 i think it is a fair to ask questions here with the expectation of a new y-wing in the coming year. i came here to look at the review even though it is a few years old. no images to go with the review. bummer. i'd like to see a more friendly tolerance on dated threads being bumped.

-1 etav8r, on 19 september 2011 - 03:16 am, said: is that a threat? is it fair to ban someone on the forum because they revived an old thread and made inquiries? thought this was a forum to discuss lego and that is what he was prompting. i don't really care why he was banned but this isn't the only time i've seen this type of behavior and discourse here on eb. not a threat at all - i was simply pointing out that yodalikespie made the mistake of inquiring about the new y-wing before we had any information on it. to my understanding, it's not so much the fact that he bumped the thread as the fact that he bumped it for no good reason. i'm not certain where the moderators stand on this issue, but i feel that yodalikespie's question would have been better received had he posed it after a substantial amount of information had been gathered on 9495 - as i've said, there simply isn't much one can go off of at this point to determine its value relative to 7658.

-1 maybe the thread should be locked or taken down since the pics consist of broken links. kind of a pointless review without the pics. and for the record, there are other websites with preliminary images of some the new 2012 sets that are not on the eurobrick star wars 2012 rumors thread. perhaps that banned fellow was hoping some of the lego insiders had some knowledge about it. i guess we'll never know now. edited by sharky, 22 september 2011 - 09:22 pm.

1 thanks for the review!!! one of the best sets in the entire line.

1 the assult tiger is pretty cool

-1 i voted "average". i think this is the least attractive among the 2008 exo-force sets. i saved my money to buy some of the 2006 mechas.

1 what do you mean the trolls should outnumber the crown knight? how are you going to manage that? well heres the answer. theme: castle set name: troll warrior set number: 5618 number of pieces: 19 figures:1 released: 2008 list price: 2.50 (gbp) $3.50 (usd) 2.99 (euro) 5618 peeron.com 5618 bricklink catalog 5618 shop at home lets us begin with the box. the troll warrior and his might cart. set sets for children to pester for at christmas. now for whats inside. the contents of the box, it doesnt look like much. now for the troll himself, im glad they selected this troll torso rather than the other one for the impulse set i think this one is the superior one. also he comes well armed with a spear and sword but no shield sadly. someone really needs to look at the rodent problem in the castle sets.. now the cart, nice easy construction as with all impulse sets, im still not convinced by the flicking missiles. a line of those would do some damage. what an oncoming army can expect to see.. all together now and it looks rather good. so there we have it a cheap way of bolstering the troll army and outfitting them with some more weapons. also for anyone planning a pied piper moc another set with a rat in it. the rating system figures: 8/10 (|preferred troll torso and helmet style. ) parts 7/10 (two spears and a sword but sadly lacking that all important shield.) fun fun fun 4/10 (somewhat more to do on its own that other impulse at least the troll can fight the rat!) design 7/10 (well designed even the flicker missile doesnt look bad) price 8/10 (at 2.50 more than the other castle impulse.) grand total 34/50 (lack of a shield and to small to stand alone for my rating system..) conclusion. castle fans got a great army builder with the knight and theyve been lucky enough to receive another one with this set. im glad weve got a troll impulse as it allow for enlarging the armies of evil some the crown knight dont totally outnumber all their opponents.

1 best impulse set so far. thanks for sharing your thoughts and yes, someone should look into that rodent issue. i'll add this to the index within long

0 wait a second, a "troll"?? isn't that an orc? i thought that this is a troll:

1 wow. i like this set. but have no money to get it. guess i need to be fast and get it before it was sold out.

-1 thank you for the nice review. the set is not that bad, but a shield would be a nice addition. i also don't like the flickfire missile. a camp site with a fire and a chickenleg would also be nice about the rat; isn't it just foodsupply for the troll? the only problem would than be that the food is running away.

-1 more firefighter, there must be a pyromaniac in legoland somewhere! theme: city set name: firefighter set number: 5613 number of pieces: 25 figures:1 released: 2008 list price: 2.00 (gbp) $3.50 (usd) 2.99 (euro) 5613 peeron.com 5613 bricklink catalog 5613 shop at home starting as always with the box i didnt know red cylinders were flammable. interestingly an action shot and not other sets you might like to buy. the contents of the box. looks much like every other impulse set. firefighter, not sure theres much else to say apart from i wish theyd included breathing equipment. looking pretty pleased with himself if you ask me. the equipment rack is fairly standard and easy to build, it does however include a fire hydrant. inbuild shot, will i be able to finish this complex build.[/. unsurprisingly i did. i nice selection of kit is provided. all together, i think the fire is a bit odd but it does add playability. if you want to increase the number of your firefighter and their equipment this is a great way, though there is something missing in my mind. the rating system figures: 5/10 (fairly standard i already have a fair few) parts 6/10 (good selection of tools, but lacks the breathing apparatus id expect in a set like this) fun fun fun 5/10 (theres clearly something to do even if you just own this set.) design 5/10 (not going to win any awards but its robust) price 8/10 (nothing to complain about, you get a lot of accessories for the price.) grand total 29/50 (reasonable design and good accessories a good set to improve any fire department.) conclusion. this isnt a set id necessarily buy, but while i was at bluewater today i decided i should try to review every impulse set myself, so that why i bought it. still i think it has some good playability and a good set of accessories if you need more firefighting kit, i just cant get passed the lack of breaking apparatus, that would have made it a better set in my view.

1 brick built robot, surely we?re getting near classic space now? theme: space, mission mars set name: mini-robot set number: 5616 number of pieces: 24 figures:1 released: 2008 list price: 2.50 (gbp) $3.50 (usd) 2.99 (euro) 5616 peeron.com 5616 bricklink catalog 5616 shop at home let look at the box first. space man approaching the robot from behind. i?m not sure you can still buy the base easily anymore. the contents of the box. the contents of the box, it?s rather white. fairly standard mission mars spaceman, he?s got printing front and back but sadly no air tank! how does he breath? *as has been pointed out he does have a printed tank but i'd rather a physical one* note the megaphone is in flashlight mode not weapon mode, that?s important.. the robot itself feels a bit clumsy the metal detector is never going to touch the ground and it feel a bit wide. i don?t like the look of him something in the eyes. the reason why so we can have a box to put crystals in. both together and ready to explore new worlds etc. sadly the robot was homicidal, remember in space no one can hear you scream. it?s not a bad impulse set and if it marks the return of brick built robots to space then it?s a good thing. i just feel the robot could have been better built. the rating system figures: 6/10 (not to bad but nothing wonderful) parts 6/10 (lots of white and not much orange, but where?s the air tank!) fun fun fun 6/10 (probably the best impulse set as a stand alon toy lots to do with a robot and his human boss) design 5/10 (the robot feels clumsily put together i think it needs work) price 8/10 (can?t fault the impulse price.) grand total 31/50 (not well designed but does have more play value than other impulse sets.) conclusion. i was surprised that mission mars got impulse sets as it didn?t seem to sell as well as other lines last year. however i think this is a fairly good set, it has more playability than other sets and does come with a metal detector been a while since i?ve seen one (though i could be wrong) sadly the robot isn?t as good as it could be. edited by sinner, 01 september 2008 - 01:30 am.

0 opps well thatll teach me to do reviews without my glasses! thanks for pointing that out stauder.

-1 i wasn't all that impressed with what you get in this set for the price. but you have an interesting point; that the robot can be considered a reference to the classic space bots. makes me think i ought to try modding the robot later...

-1 nice review and quite funny now i'll never turn my back on a robot again. poor set. i find this set bad, even for an impulse,. the robot is poorly designed and without any use. the space minifig is ok. i'd rather get another impulse set than this. except the other life on mars mars mission impulse sets.

1 very good, informative review. i really want this set but i never got around to buying it. i thought all of your photos are great and of good quality. keep it up!

1 i love this set... indy is what got me back into lego.

0 i keep looking at this set to buy. since i have 3 10$ cards now maybe i will go pick it up at the lego store next month. so many things i want.

-1 good review, thanks! for the mail van, while it certainly adds interaction and fun to a lego town, it alone lacks details and playability, and thus not a good set, especailly taking its price into consideration. its value is pretty much just like, if not less than, some impulse sets, in my opinion...

1 thanks for this review. i was thinking of getting this set and having read your review went out today and got it. what a great little set. what i particularly like: very sturdy build. feels very solid as you build the pickup (compared to the fire pickup & trailer i also have) the orange pieces (my first pieces in this colour!) the tyres which give the smoothest ride of any lego town/city vehicle i've ever built the raised suspension and side runners the coast guard dude (again a first for me) and his mega-cool flippers and aqualung the jetski controls - the handlebars actually move left to right which is a great detail little details that lego didn't have to do (the grey handle by the ball joint; moving handlebars; the new tyres) as you can probably guess, i have voted outstanding for this set! erdbeereis1, on aug 29 2008, 06:02 am, said: color separation is not a problem here, and since it is a small set, the piece call out is not a necessity. you do get a piece call out with this set (i did anyway). it's on the back of the small poster that is included in the set! thanks again cheers rog edited by rriggs, 02 september 2008 - 02:53 pm.

1 erdbeereis1, on sep 2 2008, 09:15 pm, said: i meant the piece call outs during the build that show which pieces you need for that step. oh! cardinal brick, on sep 2 2008, 09:05 pm, said: one question though do you think the jet ski is as good as previous ones? i have to agree that the jetski is an awesome little piece of design. apart from the handle bars it has a really cool orange piece on the front (a piece i've never seen before) - the 4x3 wheelarch sort of thing... cheers rog

1 arrgh me hearties! let's join the pirates as they try to steal the sacred treasure from the islanders' hands. it won't be easy, king kahuka and his loyal warriors closely guard the treasure 24 hours a day. will the pirates with their trusty pistols and cutlasses be able to defeat the islanders' spears, pet alligator and powerful leafy skirts? we will find out! 6262 king kahuka's throne set info set name: 6262 king kahuka's throne theme: pirates-islanders released: 1994 price: ??? (i don't know the original price. i got it from bricklink with no box for $17. unfortunately, i was not able to locate the euro or pounds price.) pieces: 123 minifigs: 5 off we go! unfortunately, i don't have the box because i didn't like the idea of spending over $50 for a set with under 200 pieces. so sorry, no box pics. instructions i think the image on the front is very good. it seems less setup somehow than the instructions these days. it looks more like someone snuck up on them while they were going about their duties and snapped away rather than something that was planned. the parts a nice selection here. there is a pretty good amount of printed pieces in this set which is always nice. for example, the zebra print tile, as well as the pirate flag nowadays would almost certainly be stickered. the set also comes with a nice dark grey burp and a red boat for the pirates. the minifigs the main buying point of this set for me were the minifigs. this set comes with 5 of them which is quite good for a small set like this, especially when compared to the sets of today. the set comes with 1 alligator, 2 pirates, 2 islander warriors and king kahuka himself. i really like the islanders' torso and leg prints. the leafy skirts are a nice touch and the make-up on the faces is superb. some parts i liked these shields have a nice design on them and i always like the treasure chests. a picture inside the manual this is a feature that i liked in the manual, it shows an overhead view of the baseplate so it's much easier to find where to put the piece. i certainly could have used this feature in last year's aquabase invasion set. a close-up of the king the face print is nice. i wonder who kahuka's make-up artist is.... the finished set! first, the pirates' boat the boat is really nice. the sail is made out of a nice cloth, and connects simply to the mast. and now, the main part of the set, the throne! this is a really nice model. i think the colors and the design make it really feel like a different part of the lego world. the rock sculpture looks fantastic as well. the throne, which is sort of a stretcher thing attaches here. it connects on a 1x2 tile with a stud in the middle for easy removal here is the treasure that the pirates seek the treasure rests on tiles inside of the rock. the zebra print tribal drum this is simple but nice. one thing that's great about this which i mentioned earlier, is that this and all of the other pieces with designs on them are printed. that's right, no stickers to be found here! i have used these zebra-print tiles many times for mocs, as they make a great exotic detail piece. the lovely rock head i think this is wonderful. it really adds a lot to the set. it is well built with grey slopes, curved pieces for the mouth and nose, headlight bricks for the eyes and feathers and horns for detail. the backside the complete set! overall, this looks great in my opinion with great landscaping and some fun parts. well, it looks like the pirates walked all over the islanders and stole their treasure... in fact, it looks like it was pretty brutal. brickshelf folder now, for the the ratings! price: 8/10 (for $17 not a great price per piece value. but when you add 5 figs in, it makes it a decent price. plus this set hasn't been in stores for 14 years so that adds some cost) parts: 9/10 (the set has some really nice printed parts, as well as a baseplate, which in my opinion, is great) design: 9/10: (no flaws that i can think of right away. the rock face is very well built) playability: 8/10 (not really anything to play with, although you can sail the ship and steal the treasure) build: 9/10 (rock face uses nice techniques and the rest of the set is simple but looks good) minifigs: 10/10 (the minifigs are just fantastic. great prints, and just overall fun. overall: 53/60 bricklink entry peeron brickset it looks like the pirates have picked up a new recruit from the island... summary the older lego sets have a really different look to them than the new sets, and i think it's nice to have a mix of new and old. this is definitely a great set with a nice build and great minifigs. add to this the great printed pieces and that old pirate charm, and you get a very nice set that i can certainly recommend. thanks, and happy building! edited by erdbeereis, 17 august 2009 - 02:39 am.

0 i feel the same way about the islanders sets brickster. they are a nice change from the regular pirate versus soldiers that is the norm. i think it would be interesting to see some new islanders sets released in the new pirate line to see how tlc would make them.

1 well, for some weird reason i missed this before, so i tell you now: very good review (as we are used of you, erdbeereis1). i like all the islander sets, and own quite a few myself! for people that don't own any of the islander sets yet, the 6262 king kahuka's throne is a great way to start! lots of minifigs and accessories!

-1 swman, on aug 29 2008, 08:35 pm, said: i do not like the fact that the clones have pure white legs. it looks weird to me. it was also weird that they included shock troopers, but it was probably a way to get people to buy it. this set also seems like one of those that was kind of thrown in with a mix of other sets like the tie crawler. i never picked it up, and with the new clone wars sets out, i won't. me too. i don't like the the shock to have white legs because i am very fussy and i don't mix them. i also expect other clone to be in this set but it came with 2 shocks. i buy it because i like the walker vehicle.

0 i switched my shock trooper legs as soon as i got this set. as for the new pieces, i'm pretty sure that they were also featured in the striking venom set. nice in depth review! i switched my shock trooper legs as soon as i got this set. as for the new pieces, i'm pretty sure that they were also featured in the striking venom set. nice in depth review!

-1 i like this set, but i don't like the pure white legs for the shock troopers. it looked better with the black leg joint piece. i also think the set looks like half an at-te.

0 did anyone encounter the problem with the main turret? apparently, the very tip of the piece (cone shape) can't be put onto the "pole" piece. i check the instructions 2 times and still can't find what i'm doing wrong. is it just me or did anyone else got this problem as well?

1 i did enjoy it thanks for sharing your thoughts in this set and reviewing it. i'll add it to the index. maybe you should consider joining the reviewers academy and rule the galaxy (or something )

1 thanks. keke, imagine the horror that gripe my heart to see the discounted price on the sg's toys 'r' us flyer about a month after its release into retail. anyway, looking forward to your other reviews too.

0 well set out review with alot of great content! gotta ask you though, how does the set look nothing like the box art? with so few pieces i'd have thought one could mentally put it together given the box front.

-1 worst set of the year? worst set of all time? the pictures say it all, no ratings necessary. a waste of paper for box and instructions, and waste of plastic for bag and jelly alien. the little alien ship that comes with the switch fighter beats this one hands down, as well as any other lego spaceship i have ever seen and i have seen many. thankfully this set isn't available in my country, which is something i never thought i would say. anyway, i hope tlg makes these awful jelly aliens disappear forever after this year.

-1 thanks for this review. as for the set? well, i am not to crazy about this set, but i want some sort of small alien fleet vehicals, and this would work well. but i would rather ave my money to buy classic town. edited by ~vbbn~, 01 september 2008 - 02:48 am.

-1 to be honest, i am going to give this set a "1"... that is my lowest rating i will ever give to a set in eurobricks. in fact, this is the only impulse set which i do not have it at all. after looking at your wonderful review, i am going to give it a "2" and actually consider it to buy at least one to complete the entire impulse set series. i don't really like the design and the alien at all. in fact, i prefer the mars mission astronaunt more than the aliens. i don't really like the set but i like your review.

1 you you got it mint in sealed box? it indeed is a nice set. i am not into space, but nevertheless this set is a good addition if you need to get your space environment a little bit more crowded. lego however is planning to release a minifig set again next year (city) and of course the advent calendars are also quite nice to get some figs with accessories.

1 fantastic review! this is one of the classic minifigs pack which is so great for gathering massive number of minifigs. i miss those days where they sell 5 minifigs together in a set. thanks for this lovely review.

1 nice set, lucky you! the only reason i buy the mm impulse sets is lack of good space minifig packs like this nowadays ...

1 7670: hailfire tank and spider droid number of pieces: 249 number of minifigs: 4 price: 19.99 usd/ 25.99 eur/ 19.99 gbp brickset hello everyone, today i will review the extremely underrated hailfire tank and spider droid set. i hope this review does it justice. so, let's start with the box: note: this picture is not mine. standard box for star wars in that time. the background on the box looks like it's from geonosis, indicating that this set is from episode ii, and not iii or the clone wars. the back of the box (not shown) shows the playability functions and some other sets that were released at the same time as this. overview here is an overview of the whole set. it comes with one construction manual and no sticker sheets ( ). this is a very simple set, but with not much to it, it is still a very important part of the cis army, especially if you are interested in army building. i like to call this set a "super battle pack", and you'll find out why soon. let's get right to it, and look at the feature of the set: the hailfire tank. front a front view of the very cool tank. here you can see two triangular shields on the hull. the main body is very simple, but altogether very effective and clever, and making it really look like a hailfire tank, although a little bit sized down from it's movie version. the trans-red stud used as the "eye" makes the tank look more menacing. side the side view. the wheels are very easy to make, but it's a real pain to connect all of those chain links together. i don't see what you could use the links for, except for another tank, but maybe someone creative will find something for these. the dark tan is nice though. the wheels are held on by technic poles, and the tank rolls on the wheels fairly well on carpet or a hard surface. back this is the back of the tank. here you can see eight flick-fire missiles (four on each side) of the new type, so they don't easily fall out. also note the modified 2x2 with extended hole piece sticking out of the back. this may be used to easily push around the tank. i just wish you could fit a droid in the body for the cockpit... now we move on to the spider droid, or what i like to call "the dwarf spider": the front. this one is also simple, but very cleverly built. the main body is two semi-spheres connected together for rotation, and an antenna, a cannon, four legs, and eyes made out of a useful telephone piece. the picture speaks for itself as far as how the gun and eyes are built. side a side view. you can now see the legs better, which are more sturdy then you would think. each one is made out of two pearl bronze exo-force robot arms, a useful bley handgun piece, and a dark bley battle droid body, all connected to the under body (a big knob-like piece). back the back. not much to say here. i like this spider droid because it is very sturdy, and the legs are easy to adjust. finally, we look at the minifigs: there are four minifigs in this set, which is quite generous for a set of this size. it comes with a yellow battle droid commander (i really like this one), two battle droids, and a super battle droid. all three battle droids have the new blaster pistols and one twisted arm. that's about it for the review, so here is the final verdict: build: 8/10, very fun and easy, besides the chain links. should take the seasoned builder less than 20 minutes. playability: 7/10, the flick-fire missiles are fun, as well as just zooming around the tank. could use some clones for a battle. swooshability: 8/10, you can roll around the hailfire fairly well. minifigs: 9/10, a generous amount of figs, and all are pretty good. design: 9.5/10, a really simple and clever set, although a little too small for the movie version. price: 10/10, a very fair price considering the price-per-parts ratio and the coolness of the set. overall score: 8.5/10, a very neat set to have, a great army builder, and great for display next to all of the other cis sets. the price is fair, the figs are good, and the build is very clever. that's all for now, folks. please feel free to give some feedback! edited by jimbutcher, 15 september 2008 - 03:08 am.

-1 kimt, on aug 30 2008, 04:21 pm, said: thanks for sharing this review with us. i think this one of the sets. in europe this thing is waaaay overpriced and thus makes it a crappy set. we pay nearly double the us price. so i rated it poor. also because the figs included does not make it great. the hailfire is well designed and looks great, but that's just about all there is worthy of a positive mentioning. sorry. [on a side note: as a bronze-awarded student, where's the price in eur and gbp? and where's the poll?] [nevermind the poll, i've added that one for you ] oh yes, i will add the other prices, and i was going to make a poll for it (i made one for the homing spider review), but you beat me to it. thanks!

1 thanks for the review, jimbutcher. i really like that set. it combines interesting and good design with some awesome cool parts and a neat amount of charm.

1 thanks for the cool review jimbutcher . actually, i really like this set, it is small but very clever and even if the hailfire droid is undersized, what in the whole line is not under or oversized . the new spider droid is the best small build i have ever done in a set and the droid commander is pretty cool . i am happy with the set and i will get another with my comic-con exclusive .

-1 i just bought this set the other day and i must admit that it gets a "below average" from me. the price is not corresponding with what you get. which would be implied, had jim added the eur or gbp price in the info[hint hint ] the spider droid is flimsy at best. making it stand or even move without tumbling over is hard. also why the brown cylinders on the legs? keep the colourscheme clean, please. the figs are fine, except that i dislike the clone headgear and the fact that the helmets now have holes in the sides, allowing the flesh head to show within = goofy looking. i am soo replacing the clone heads with black ones. great review of an acceptable set

1 i like the theme very much, but sadly, i don't own any sets of it. it brings such a great feeling, it's fresh and has great parts and sets. and it brought the polar bear! your review is very good and informative, thanks! (i voted wrong, i meant above average, but i clicked below average )

1 a very nice review! i really miss the arctic theme. i didn't own any of the sets, but after looking at the pictures in this review and reading the instructions on brickleys words and brickfactory, i want them.

0 i find it amusing that the numbers on the decal (for the flag) were chosen so that it wouldn't look stupid if you put it on upside-down by accident.

1 nice review brickster! the arctic theme is very nice. the minifigs have a great look to them especially with the hoods. the colors for the arctic sets i have always liked, and somehow the idea of minifigs exploring the arctic is fun to me.

1 thank you very much for this review, thebrickster! i voted both times for outstanding because: i really the arctic theme. i only bought the ice sailor but otherwise no sets because of money and place reasons and because i already collect four themes (city, older castle, western and star wars old triology). but a comeback of the arctic theme - perhaps as addition to a winter sports and winter rescue theme would be very welcome! i really all sets - the little and the big ones. in my opinion they all were very well designed (not too big vehicles, not too little and not minimalitic, great minifigs and very nice and lovely details and accessory). klaus-dieter

0 on this, the first anniversary of the news organization that has become so near and dear to your hearts, eb news is pleased to present a very special feature that we've only added recently: the eb news review! this is really our third such extravaganza, but the first one to actually be done right, so it's my great honour to welcome all of you to this event. i'm your hostess with the mostest, er, host, imperialshadows, getting in the way and generally causing mayhem will be staudie, of course, and actually presenting the review will be cub reporter and senior reviewer, whitefang! yes, the ever popular whitefang of the reviewer's academy. you know him, you love him, let's hear some applause! *audience cheers wildly* oh, that's too kind, now how about some for whitefang? name: airplane mechanic theme: lego system / town / city year: 2006 pieces: 26 minifigs: 1 price: usd$3.50 the featured set will be a 7901 airplane mechanic. this is the smallest set ever released in the city sub theme, airport. we will be bringing you to on site experience in the hanger. today our special guest is a mechanic who is specially trained to handle with jet engine turbines. *camera rolls* aren't our pose look so cool? staudie, your clothes are still white. let's just all try to smile until this picture is done. look at our special guest. he can still smile in that weird position of his. quiet you! *interviewing process* i am the airplane mechanic, holding a grade 2 license. my specialisation is to maintain and repair jet turbines of 7893 and 7894 passenger planes. we have many mechanics, 24/7, across international airports, making sure that the planes are in safe condition. we are able to maintain from rolls royce, pratt & whitney and general electric engines as well. this is the trolley to push the turbine engine around. this model is used for passenger planes 7893 and 7894 series. look at the size of the turbine. it required actually 4 engine turbines like this, to power a 7893 passenger plane aircraft. i have all these nice essential tools, to work on that engine behind me. there is a wrench, hammer, oilcan, open end wrench, power drill and screwdriver. *whistles innocently* geez, he thought no one would notice him pushing the engine away? *testing process* as you can see, the crane is firm and sturdy. it is able to lift the engine at a certain height. hey get off there! for goodness sake, this is not a rodeo. yee-ha! whitefang must fixed his loose wires. i knew we shouldn't let him read those superman comics on break. give a man a cape, and he thinks he can fly. *the audience laughs* what's so funny? it's dangerous to stand at that position. staudie, are you done with your measuring yet? almost there. *clang bang clank* oof! get this thing off me! i'll push, you pull! let's get moving! *clang* i think i sprained my pride. no, wait, it's my back. i gave up my pride when i took over this news organization. *shadows flips the engine, crushing whitefang* get that hook off my head... guess, we are heading for a commerical break at the moment. wait up, let me pull the white curtain. that's all, everyone. with me, staudie bringing the end of the show. imperialshadows and whitefang are currently in the legoland hospital where whitefang is getting patched up and shadows is flirting with the nurses, mostly. i really hope you loved this interactive review brought to you by eb news reviews. overall, we felt that this was a very good impulse set with a wide range of mechanical tools and an extra turbine to play with. therefore, we recommend you to get it since it's very affordable. anyway, every airport need mechanics/engineers to maintain the aircrafts to make sure it's certified to fly. this is too formal. i hate reading it from whitefang's script. it's best to do it in staudie's style. yo yo yo, whazzup? er. no, that isn't it either. um... thanks for viewing! i hope to bring you another exciting and information review soon, here on eb news reviews! *camera fades*

1 thank you very much for this review, skipper 24! i voted for outstanding since this set is a little but very lovely set. i really it (although i don't own it yet ) since it's very similar to today's impulse sets: a minifig and some nice additional stuff. and i like the black cat which gives the set a more gloomy atmosphere. hopefully tlg will include a black cat and a chimney like in this set in the new advent calendar, too. klaus-dieter

0 this is a very good review, no doubt about it. about this set, this is a cheap way to buy this set with a witch and some nifty accessories such as the black cat. in fact, i think this is the first time i had ever seen a black cat. it's simple, but not very useful in my collection. because other fright knight sets also offer the witches too. i don't need many witches. overall, i feel that this is an average set.

1 for some strange reason, this is my favorite lego castle set.

0 review of 7670 hailfire droid and spider droid *updated* theme: sw episode ii / clone wars parts: 249 (- figs) figs: 4 price: 20.00, $20.00, ??25.99 year: 2008 i think many people were deterred from this set because of the low piece count and a high price for it although it does come with 4 minfigures. 1. overall set and figs official box pic. this indicates it is a geonosis set from the background but it is no different from any other set same old brown separatist ship/s. the whole set. some red tan droids would have been nice like in the geonosian fighter set. all the minifigs. the super battle droid body is slightly different to the one in the bp. it looks more grainy and silver. i doubt this has any relevance for it being a geonosis set but i like them better how they were in the bp's the super battle droid body dwarfing the commander droids body. i think that the new commander droids body is better than the old one with just the yellow strip even though it is less accurate. new twisted battle droid arm, each droid has one of these. i don't really like having droids with these new guns i think the older guns suited them much better. 2. hailfire droid hailfire droid by itself. it is certainly smaller than the original. seeming as this is the main part of the set i was hoping it would be bigger but i don't mind it being this small too much. wheels and rockets can fold outwards and inwards the wheels which spin round two large clear discs and made from loads of these tiny links. this is probably the best way to make the wheels on this small scale. the only other alternatives i can think of are using the tracks from the wookiee attack set or catterpilla tracks, both of which wouldn't look right. one of the missile pods. these use the new flick-fire missiles which don't fall out are an excellent idea. they should have come with the purple cones like on the magna guards staffs instead of red though because in the film the missiles are purple. one of the new flickfire missiles that don't drop out when the model is tilted forward. i don't know what the holes in them are for though. the 3 "eyes" are made up of 2 trans red cheese bricks for the sides and 1 trans red stud for the center.you can also see how the missile pods are attached to the side of the body. this is the back of the hailfire droid. there is a plate with a hole in, i have found only one purpose for this. the hailfire droid is the commander droids war chariot! what do you use the plate for? 3. spider droid the spider droid. the design has been greatly improved from the wookiee attack set. not only is it more accurate but also more poseable which is useful when setting up battle scenes. the ball joint provides the place to put the antenna which isn't long enough but the dome form the old set looks more like the droid form star wars episode ii. the eyes are made of a telephone piece with 2 trans red studs on. in the original it had orange studs. the eyes can be seen in action 2 pics down. i told you it was a telephone. 1 of 4 identical legs. these are very easy to adjust into what ever position you want and are much better than the originals. but a word of warning never pull them apart as i did they become very loose when put back together so i put some blue tack in the holes. 4.overall build: 7/10 a little to repetitive for my liking. minifigs: 8/10 4 figs for 20 isn't too bad plus they come with new guns. design: 9/10 both vehicles are very well designed but the hailfire's small size let the set down. parts: 8/10 comes with lots of useful (maybe not ) brown track links. price:7/10 not too bad with 4 figs and loads of little brown links. playability: 6/10 not to much on it's own overall: 7/10 if it came with some clones and tan red droids it would be better. afetr jar jar wiped out a small droid patrold he realized he was being watched mesa in big dodo this time...

1 6205: v-wing fighter number of pieces: 118 number of minifigs: 1 price: 9.99 usd/ 13.99 eur/ 8.99 gbp theme: star wars/ episode iii year released: 2006 brickset folder bricklink catalog welcome to this review of the v-wing fighter. this will be my eighth review on the boards. strangely enough, there was another set called the v-wing fighter that came out in 1997 for the space theme. note that i am missing several small pieces to this set, but they are mostly insignificant to the overall look. the box this is the standard box type for all 2005-2006 star wars sets. i can't say that i like it as much as the 2007 or 2008 box types, but it'll do. it features a profile view of darth vader and silver text. overview this is the whole set. this ship is meant to protect the chancellor at all costs. they are usually found in groups of three or four. front this ship is very sleek, and you'll notice that it's colors are dark red, light bley, and dark bley with a touch of black. it starts at the nose very narrow, but as the body progresses to the back, it gets wider, like a "v" (hence the name). back here is a view of the rear. note the trans-neon green discs used to represent the boosters. also notice the dark red r4 astro droid and the hinges used as aromor. flight all four wings (two on each side) can open up for flight/ attack mode. they can open even farther then the pic shows, but it's not an intended function. the wings a great, but it's a real pain to position them correctly, and the bottom wings close when you set the ship down. tail fins this is what the tail fins look like on each side, with two flaps attached to the top and bottom. if you look closely, the tail fins and wings look a little bit like a mini ship themselves, maybe controlled by remote. no, this is not an intended function, either. guns, side the guns are very simple but very clever, using a double technic hole piece, two black bars, and two technic pins. also note the landing gear. minifig finally, here is the minifig: a clone pilot. it has light blue arms and legs, white hands, a helmet with black markings and republic insignia on it, and a double-sided torso. the front of the torso is great, featuring shoulder straps, armor plating, and a life support system. while this minifig is not altogether accurate to the movie, it has still been one of my favorite star wars figs. back the back of the fig that can double as the front of clone marines. this side features shoulder straps and armor plating. cockpit lastly, here is the pilot seated in the cockpit. he fits perfectly, although it is not air-tight. we wouldn't want the poor guy to suffocate, now would we? that wraps up the review, here is the final verdict: build: 8/10, a nice, easy, build, and the last of the small sw ships ($10 or less). playability: 6/10, pretty fun to swoosh around, but that's about it. could use a vulture droid, but that would take away the 'small' factor. swooshability: 10/10, very fun and easy to swoosh around endlessly, without fear of it breaking. minifigs: 9/10, there really is no need to have more, although a palpy fig would be outstanding. the pilot is a great figure though. design: 9/10, extremely accurate to the movie, but the cockpit is not airtight. price: 10/10, you couldn't ask for a better deal! overall score: 8.6, an excellent set. unfortunately, this is the last of the small sw ships currently. the fig is great, and the sleek design is accurate. that just about sums it all up, feel free to leave your comments! edited by jimbutcher, 15 september 2008 - 03:11 am.

-1 thanks for the review. this set never got me, so i didn't get it! i also don't like the droid-head-only thing and i haven't bought any set like that. i planned to buy this on sale... but it never happend.

0 i had a chance to get this set, but i didnt i really wish i did though because i saw it at my cuz's place not to long ago and it's quite nice i wish tlg would do more $20 small sets like this besides bp (although they are nice )

1 i love this battlepack! i bought two last time i went to legoland california, and it certainly gave the knights a good variety of new troops. however, i have one complaint, and that is the guy with the lance. i am wondering why he has a lance while fighting on foot. if tlg really wanted to give him a lance, they should have given him a horse.

0 imperialshadows, on sep 2 2008, 08:46 am, said: ... with that lovely new barding. nobody would complain about the price then, even if it was $15. i sure wouldn't... especially if it was the silver chainmail barding.

0 after reading your review i might buy me one of these. at first i thought it was quite useless, but i must admit that your review kinda changes my mind on this bp. i've added it to the index

0 how were you able to get three small shields. i only got two in mine. i am going to check the trash just in case.

0 swman, on oct 6 2008, 07:27 am, said: how were you able to get three small shields. i only got two in mine. i am going to check the trash just in case. i think it only comes with two. the extra one probably slipped in from another set. sorry for any confusion!

0 it's an ok set, but it's extremely overpriced where i live. i simply couldn't justify paying $17.99 +tax for 5 minifigs. the fact that these figures are featured prominantly in other sets makes this set a difficult purchase. given the price, i find it hard to look at this set with much enthusiasm.

1 i really love these impulse sets at a low price point for lots of minifigs this police one doesn't appeal too much to me at the moment, but who knows, with your reference i may need it with a future project! hmm... it's actually a good way of getting those dogs cheaply

0 i also love the impulse sets, but we have already too many policemen (although i actually bought this one). our bobby isn't looking very nice is he?! we normally but policemen in a pool or sea with sharks at events like legoworld, so maybe that's because of me edited by jopiek, 02 september 2008 - 11:00 pm.

1 a very nice set, but one of my least wanted impulse sets. i eventually bought it, and looky here, i got an extra doggy!

1 set name: crossbow attack set number: 7090 theme: castle pieces: 54 minifigs: 3 released: 2007 price: 5.99usd, 3.99 eur, 7.99 cdn legoshop.com description: ready, aim, fire!it's a battle of brave knights against the evil skeleton rider! includes 2 knights, skeleton and a skeleton horse! rolling wagon has a launcher that really fires! bricklink inventory peeron inventory brickshelf gallery now, on to the review! the box as you can see, the front of the box illustrates the set very nicely, showing the skeleton warrior attacking and the knights firing their crossbow. the back the back of the box shows a small battle happening between a knight and a skeleton, as well as the main feature of the set, the firing crossbow (more on that later.) the instructions not much to say here, its the same as the front of the box. the back of the instructions this merely shows pictures of other sets in the castle line. random instruction page this set does not use piece callouts to tell you what parts you will need in each step. however, the set is so small you should never have trouble finding a piece. the minifigures this is the main reason i bought this set. you get two knights, one with a standard helmet, and the other one with a new mold. you also get a skeleton warrior. the horse the set comes with a skeleton horse that looks great. however, it is a single molded piece that has no articulation. close-up of the warrior riding his horse here you see the brave skeleton riding in on his...ah......er......um......noble steed! the accessories/weapons for minifigure accessories, you get an axe, a skeleton sword, and a skeleton shield. extra pieces i was left with one skeleton arm and one leg when i was finished the build. the crossbow wagon and now, to the main part of the set, the crossbow wagon. it is really just a plate with some whells attached and a lot of those cheese wedge pieces to create the track for the projectile. back view this view shows the mechanism that makes the crossbow fire. it is powered by a rubber band. you pull back on a technic piece, which creates tension in the elastic band. when you let go, the elastic pushes the piece forward, which in turn hits the projectile and makes it fire! it works fairly well, but i would have prefered it fired farther. entire set the skeleton charges at his adversaries! the knights prepare to counterattack! overall build: 10/10 the build is simple, easy and quick. set design: 7/10 the crossbow could have worked a bit better. playability: 8/10 the crossbow is fun to shoot. minifigs: 10/10 it doent get much better than this. i love that domed helmet mold! price: 8/10 the set is very affordable and worth the price. overall score:43/50 conclusion overall, this is a great set and a solid army builder. you get three minifigures for a fair price and the crossbow wagon adds some much-needed playability. i bought two of these to bolster my army and to stock up on those rare domed helmet pieces. basically, get this set! thank you for taking the time to read my review. i hope you liked it!

0 millacol88, on sep 6 2008, 01:55 am, said: i've experienced that problem too. i find my knights outnumber my skellies about 3:1. a crownie dies easyer than a skeleton. it's so hard to perforate the lungs or pierce the heart on a skeleton with a spear or crossbow bolt, isn't it? a great set with a reasonable price. thanks for sharing it with us. added to the index.

1 this was one of the first sets i bought from the new castle theme and i love it. so many figs and awesome skeleton horses in just one set. at the same time you get quite a few usefull black bricks for castle mocs. another perfect set in the new world of castle review added to the index.

1 i bought this set to have the scared minifig, but i found a lot of cool pieces and stuffs... i love this set ^^

1 what an amazing review! i actually have this set and i decided to take it apart. it has a brown horse and a lot of useful pieces, so taking it apart was a good idea. now i have three lego horses! hoorah! the end of the review was the funniest... lego12

1 yaaaay! this set is outstanding! it was first set i have bought for pieces! seriously! if you like skellies its mustbuy for you!

1 great review, erdbeereis1 this really is a fantasic set. let's hope lego makes more sets like these (with 5 minifigs+4 horses at a price of $19.99? ) actually, it's about rm200 here. and it's not even price-to-piece count. anyways, amazing review, ad if i could get more castle sets this year, i might even join the reviewer's academy

0 you say in the review it's great to get 9 minifig's, but there are only 2 minifigs and 3 skeletons??

1 7040 dwarves' mine defender theme: castle released: 2008 price: 10 usd pieces: 73 (3 minifigures) introduction: here i am, with one of the newest castle sets realeased in early 2008. it's a small battle wagon with blades on the front, probably to demolish rocks in mines. but in this case, our hero dwarf has to use his machine against the evil trolls who want to destroy his happy kingdom. there is only one small booklet for instructions, no alternate model: parts come in two bags, one for small pieces and one for bigger ones: apart from the lovely figures, the brown parts will be quite useful for any castle builder. extra parts are not even worth mentioning, there are no stickers: figures are detailed enough, dwarf is lovely with his beard but his legs won't move because he is short: figures are the main attraction for adult players. we haven't seen castle army builder sets for a long while and this is closest we've got in recent years. the dwarf is a little taller than it should have been but it's not possible to do so without creating a completely new mould for figures and that would be expensive. its beard is oversized as well but that gives him a legoish look which i like a lot. the trolls - that's what everybody calls them but i say they are orcs - are obviously evil but they are friendly enough not to scare our munchkins. but i wish they had different torsos or at least different faces like crownies. there are not enough weapons to arm everyone but the flag pole is really nice: unlike the star wars army builders, this set has very little weaponry. only one sword and one pike creates scarcity for 3 figures - star wars sets had 4 figures for same price! so i hope our middle age warriors don't come across any stormtroopers :) building in progress: when you pull the chain the catapult fires a round brick: the set has quite good playability, moving blades and firing catapult should be fun for little children. i wouldn't expect more functions for such a small sized model, it hardly covers my hand. the blades move with the front wheel on the right: there is only one little downside, there is too much friction for the wheel and blades won't move synchronized. you may come over this problem by adjusting the blade height and lining them with the wheels. mow the little buggers! you can adjust the blade height: there isn't enough room for the dwarf: folder when public: http://www.brickshel...ry.cgi?f=338578 rating: -figures: 8/10 dwarf is amazing, trolls are great too but i wish they had different faces. -parts: 7/10 brown slopes are new, rest is ok too. -price: 7/10 acceptable but we have seen sets with more figures for less. -design: 6/10 it looks kind of steampunkish but could be better with a little detail. -building: 6/10 not repeating itself, still nothing exciting. -total: 34/50 castle fans will definetely order this one but average lego player may not be interested. conclusion: overall, it's a nice set and i'd recommend it if you like the castle theme. you'll find some good use for the figures and this is the cheapest figure set of the year - at 3.33 usd each. it could have more armory and weaponry but otherwise it's quite alright. skip lunch today and order this little set! links: brickset reviews bricklink entry peeron inventory

1 lovely review, really. but the sad fact is we've seen it before, twice. http://www.eurobrick...showtopic=20293

1 tacitus, on sep 4 2008, 09:57 am, said: lovely review, really. but the sad fact is we've seen it before, twice. http://www.eurobrick...showtopic=20293 jeez your comments are getting on my nerves. more than one review per set is allowed here. thanks for sharing your thoughts on this set with us. a great set now has (another ) great review. i'll add it to the index. as soon as the poll on "how the index is to look", is over (phew...long sentence) oh yeah and i'll rate this as above average. i think it needs at least one minifig more than there is.

1 i've skipped a few lunches on behalf of this set. it's a great army builder, but so are many of the new castle sets. what makes this great in my opinion is the figs - 2 orcs and 1 dwarf - what else could one want? thanks tlg for making this set and thank you for reviewing it for us review added to the index

1 this set pulled me out of my dark ages. thanks lego!

1 indexed going through the boards i was amazed to find out that no one ever attempted to review one of the best lego classics, the 6399 airport shuttle. while i was studying for exams a few weeks back i decided to take a break, built the monorail and take some pictures of it. resulting in the present review. along with this i made my first ever poll. here we go: first, some data: setnumber: 6399 setname: airport shuttle released in: 1990 in holland, though bricklink says 1991 number of parts: 731 number of figs: 9 price: unknown, prices on bricklink vary from $261 up to $2300 (!) but this was an expensive set even in the nineties the box: mine is a bit battered by the owner before me, but there's still plenty to see. this is one of the largest boxes i have (look at the minifig in the down-right corner for the comparision) and it is a really neat storing facility for many sets. the box shows the set, and in the background the silhouet of the set that is to accompany this one: the airport from 1990. i like the angle of the box, showing the two stations, track and train in one picture. the back of the box shows some really nice ideas for other setups, why oh why has lego abandonned this kind of showing what's possible with one set...? inside flap of the box, showing details of the set and the functions, detail on the front of the box, displaying the dimensions, it really is a huge track layout for one set! the instructions: there is a nice little booklet showing the same picture as the box art with the figures lined up underneath. the last page nicely folds out to show the entire setup of the tracks, the figures: a brilliant selection of minifigs including airport people and a cook. all figures that are supposed to go on the shuttle carry a ticket and there are also some suitcases (tickets fit inside, of course) station # 1: the set includes two stations. here is the first, depicting the airport. there are lots of details: a phonebooth, two seats, some flowers, a map, luggagelockers and of course the streetlights. a detailed shot of the station showing the luggagelockers and ticket-validating machine, part of the beauty of this set is the fact that it is so extremely detailed, just look at the signs to show where to go next (stickers), and the scenery opposite the street... the station has the same shape as the airport shuttle logo, how sweet is that? the station pictured as part of the layout. the stations ends are made with airplane wings to smoothen the arrival of the shuttle. station # 2: here is the second station, my personal favorite: an elevated stop with a little snackbar underneath and stairs leading to the platform. some chairs and streetlights here as well plus two old fashioned trees, the part of the set that can be used in any layout: the snackbar with hamburger sign (sticker). yes, those hamburgers look tasty indeed! also notice the lights hanging from the platform overhead and the ticket-validating machine at the bottom of the stairs. here we have the platform with information panels and seats. also notice the two trafficlights for the train. here's how it works: the train will travel in the direction the arrow is pointing. when turning the knob the two grey blocks will move towards or away from the track-center, activating a button on the centerpiece of the train (the motor) which makes the train start it's journey around the track. there is only one speed and the train can only be put to a stop or change direction at stations. the station as part of the layout. the shuttle: now on with the train: there are two carrriages connected to a centered motor. the power is provided by means of a batterybox containing a 9v battery. the batterybox is in one of the carriages and displays: airport shuttle. a total of five passengers can be seated inside leaving room for their luggage and two drivers. the front carriage with the button for the batterybox showing. the underside showing the gearwheel (metal) that brings the power from the motor onto the geared track. the black pointy things alongside the gear-wheel react with the direction knobs at stations. this is how the shuttle negociates with height differences, everything hinges and rotates, making the shuttle capable of performing steep climbs. the motor is powerful enough to not slow down at such a climb! detailed shot, showing the first set of covered wheels in hinged position. the shuttle on the layout. the full layout: this layout is quite huge, involving lots of track pieces, ramps, ten large stanchion-poles and the two stations. to show the movement of the shuttle i have made a 20 second movie, which can be seen in my brickshelf gallery of this set. conclusion: well, to conclude the review, some final thoughts: this truly is one of the more detailed sets around (at least from the nineties) and one of the largest in dimensions. the monorail system is cleverly thought out and works excellent. track extensions are hard to get however and very expensive nowdays (especially the switchpoints and long straight track pieces). the tracks included with this set will provide you with hours of fun though, because there are a lot of them. it can be quite hard to incorporate the monorail in your town without having a clearly-based-on-the-monorail-alone town. i tried to incorporate it some years ago (link here), posing a real challenge. the ratings: price: 8/10: this is an expensive set, if you can get it for under $200 get it!), this set is rare in any condition. parts: 10/10: lots of rare pieces, cool minifigs, 9v system, roadplates, lots of minifigseats en red trainwindows. originality: 10/10: there are very few monorails released, this one being the only town set. compatibility: 8/10: can be a bit hard to incorporate in a town, but hey: you got the monorail so no complaining here! total: 36/40: i can only reccommend this set to anyone, it is my personal favorite set upto this present time! if there are any questions, ask them, all comments are welcome of course!

1 you chose the perfect set for your first poll, simon! no question this set is one of the all-time-beauties. i rated outstanding of course. i never hat the chance to get a complete copy of this set, but i do own the engine and quite a bunch of monorail tracks. your very detailed review made me think of getting the whole set some day. thank you very much for this! i never realized there were so many details included to this set: the snackbar and the telephone cell and all the other nice things. really strange for a nineties set which often lacked details. the only thing that comes to my mind right now is that the engine looks quite blocky. if the set was released today, tlc would use more of those parts which make a better design imo. and it would fit better to the curved walls of the stations as well. [wishful thinking]how much would i love to see the monorail system back again! [/wishful thinking] i had to lough when reading your comment on the minifig seats. don?t you own many of those? i don?t know where to put mine...

1 this is an outstanding review which deserved to be featured here! after seeing this set, it prompts me to own this set, and match with my 10159 legend city airport. it's very nice to see such outstanding set being reviewed and presented to our very screens. everything about this set is simply outstanding. i can't imagine that such incredible set actually released before. why don't they ever continue with this anymore? sigh, it's nice to see so much detailed from its shuttle, snack bar, stairs, waiting platform, validating machine and etc. this is an instant "5" set! if given a chance to own a misb set, i will defintely seriously consider about it.

1 yes, this is one of the best town sets ever.

1 sets like this just don't come around too often do they... i didn't realize exactly how much detail really was in this set. tlc should bring back the monorail! great review of an amazing classic town set!

1 this remains the definitive city set in my eyes. i never managed to get one but from the instructions it seems to be perfect in just about every way. i got the two space monorails a while ago but the much higher prices on this one have kept it out my reach. this set is a lot bigger than either of those though. i always liked the monorail system a bit better than the trains because you could easily incorporate height into the tracks and spread them out in all three dimensions. quote edit: and bricklink is wrong giving 1991 as the release date. you're right; it was 1990. it was apparently released in 1990 in europe and 1991 in north america, going by some us and german catalogs i have from that time period. edited by cp5670, 06 september 2008 - 06:06 am.

1 this truck is simply beautiful! it's on my brickset wanted list! i love the colour scheme. red and yellow are the right choice for this vehicle! the back part of the truck can be opened, so it can discharge the rubbish like real garbage trucks. you've also mentioned that in your review, and i find it a wonderful detail! thanks for the review, jopiek!

1 thanks for the review. like many such town sets, i would characterise it as cute. contrasting it to the new bin lorry, it's nice that this set has two minfigs (more realistic) and two bins. those bins are a great addition to lego, although wheelie bins would be nice now (need some kind of 2x2 container you can clip a plate onto as a hinging lid, and clip mini-wheels under the back two studs). having two minifigs is a superior point for this earlier lego rendition of a bin lorry. in fact, even though our bins are now emptied by a private company rather than the local council (as was the case up till the mid 90s), and of course for the last two decades there have been wheelie-bins, bin lorries have three guys - the driver and two collectors. however, our bin collectors for sure don't use a broom or shovel! indeed on occasion they've befouled the street themselves if something goes wrong with hoisting the bin on the mechanism! the shape of the lorry in the set is still quite accurate, pretty good for a four-wide vehicle (i must admit to preferring the newer vehicles).

1 nice set, but nicer review! looks like the set has quite some nice parts.

1 a nice set, my brother used to have this. i wish the pilot's helmet had a little printing on it, looks messed up to me.

1 thanks for sharing your thoughts and opinion about this set with us. i've added it to the index. this is one of my favourite ties and i think tlg did a good job at designing it.

0 a very robust set. the fact that it seats two figs plus has l&s makes it a unique set. i definitely liked the big airport subtheme tlg created in the early 1990s.

1 jopiek, i enjoyed this review very much! your first picture, certainly capture the essence of this lovely set. in reality, i am in the aviation line, especially aviation safety. therefore, you re-entact the scene very well. to be honest, i have never seen this set before. this aes (airport emergency service) fire truck is certainly unbelievable. i love it very much. it's a pity i never owned this. this is a set which give me a "5". great job jopiek. i enjoyed viewing your classic town reviews very much. keep up the good work!

0 i have this set the doors really dont much

1 mhh maybe put the pizza horizontally ^^ and gimme some! it was a nice set, it's a nice little crane !

0 i think the 6382 fire station is the better one from the 80ies.

1 this looks like a great set, i like the futuristic fire truck. that might be what i do with my imperial shuttle's glass cockpit.

1 found this set on a flea market in munich, yesterday. just 25 years after its release. the instructions for a total of five models, two of them printed, the other 3 are just photo instructions in the book. it still has the box in good shape, despite some wear from the age. sadly five little pieces were missing, and 5 wrong pieces inside instead (2 complete wheels and a classic 80s-90s plane wing (dumped into my bricks). but i was able to replace the missing minifig torch and the 4 missing plates with identical pieces from my collection. the box and contents the set still has the original box. inside the pieces, plastic insert, instructions and a 1987 technic catalogue, imagine that set livespan today. four years and the 8841 is still in the catalogue. classic technic design from early 80s showing a function drawing of the steering and the main model a small set, but with a flap shoeing the contents. all pieces in the inner box and the papers included. 5th model: soapbox racer this is more or less a soapbox racer with working steering, but no engine. it's got a rather blocky design, but still looks sleek enough and is a simple build little over 100 pcs out of 180. the soapbox at step 2 just included the steering at step 6 completed and ready to race downhill. total: 7/10 simple, but effective 4th model: simple chassis very simple and boring alternate using just 1/3 of the 180 pieces in the set. it even hasn't got a seat construction. it's just a plain steering mechanism attached on wheels with a spartan chassis of just a few pieces. this is the whole model at step 5 just attach the steering mechanism and wheels and you're done total: the worst alternate model of the complete set. just a boring 4/10 3rd model: balance very original small model. it's a small model of a working classic balance. and it works with small parts laid on the scales, altough they've got just a 4x4 footprint. it's a fast build. just 15 minutes and you've done it. the model as it looks at step 3 finished. easy build with just 63pcs out of 180 total: very original model, it actually works with small weights, but a very simple build. still a 7/10 alternate model: tractor with equipment this is the second model. it's a simple but boxy design featuring a harrow and a plough. the tractor has a similar design to the very first tractor set, but much smaller. the plough is about 24-wide and the harrow is completely snotted even back in 1983. has two functions: working steering and the coupler for the equipment. uses almost all pieces of the set. the tractor at step 8, the steering isn't completely attached now this is the completed tractor the complete harrow finished alternate with the plough attached. total: nice, but quite ugly and boxy design for a tractor with 4 wheels of the same size. takes me to a 6/10 main model: desert racer this is the main model, with a nice (for early 80s) but boxy design. it has two functions. steering and a working 1-cylinder rear engine, which is of the old 2x2 piston type, since the small piston design wasn't invented back then. this is the only model of the set, which has piece callouts in the instructions. the printed alternate model has no callouts, they weren't invented on both models back in 1983. the three smaller photo instruction alternates have a piece callout at the beginning showing all needed pieces. the seat is a nice, but blocky design and use a primitive snot technique. this is the model at step five. the piston is already attached. imagine this state on step 5 in modern sets. back then lego had challenging instructions, not the step madness like today this is the engine just made of plates with a hole in the middle for the piston step 9. the piston engine is completed. on step 12 the roll bar and the seat are installed. only the steering isn't completed yet. front view of the finished model. just 15 steps needed back then. bird's eye view of the whole set displayed on the box model verdict: nice design, especially the colorful seat in snot technique, but quite boxy especially the engine, since there were only the huge pistons. still a 9/10 set verdict: design and models: 7/10, very boxy designs, due to the age. the chassis alternate sucks build: 9/10 classic 80s technic building. quite challenging but fun sturdyness: 7/10: rear section damaged after the table fall, but rather easily fixed fun: 9/10 blast from the past. overall: 8/10 mfg widdi edited by widdi, 07 september 2008 - 04:11 pm.

0 nice classic set. are those hoses around the engine pneumatic tubes? that technic catalog looks interesting too. i have the catalogs for the next several years but not that one. quote this is the model at step five. the piston is already attached. imagine this state on step 5 in modern sets. back then lego had challenging instructions, not the step madness like today the most extreme example of this was the engine step in the 8865 set, which uses over 120 pieces by itself.

0 name: electric passenger train set no.: 7725 theme: lego / system / trains / 12v / train set year: 1981 pieces: 485 minifigs: 1 price: usd 70.00$ (which equals about eur 50 and gbp 40) introduction: our most favorite theme is 12v trains. actually i got my first 77-series back in 1981 (5th of december, i was 2,5 years old) just a week before my brother was born. some years later i got the 7740. after our dark ages we (my brother, cousin and myself) got all 12v trains at least once. this 7725 was gathering dust in my brothers' room. the train in all its splendor. as you can see it doesn't occur at the back of the 12v era train instructions although its larger brother the 7740 does. some investigation learned that all the sets at the back of the instructions date from 1980 so the 7725 wasn't released yet. here you can see the front of the 7725 with the driver in the cockpit. the driver is in fact the only minifig that was included in the set. as you can see, our version of the train has a different front than the one in the instructions. apparently the former owner used 7861 (lighting set (12 v)) to upgrade the train with working back- and frontlights. i like the original lights but didn't notice that the train had those double lights until i did the review. maybe we will give the train again it's original signs and put custom leds in it or so so that the train can drive into two directions with accurately working lights. another thing about the lights that puzzle me are the backlights. while typing this i realise that the former owner might have added those, so let's have a look at the instructions then. as it turns out, the lights are there also in the instructions. i recently learned that only the last car or coach of a train has it's red lights on. so unless the train drives with only the front car it will never use those red backlights. here you can see the cockpit with the engineer. the cables don't look very pretty but well, the train at least has working light. here you can take a look at the inside of the engine car. while the 7745 has a nice 'fake engine' there, just the weight bricks and the ugly cables, apart from the engineer and his cockpit, no other nice features here. b.t.w. lego always used tiles in such a trains to make it easier for kids to take off the roof and have access to the minifig passengers etc. here the 'proof' that it is an electric train. the pantograph of the front car. it has the same kind of panthographs that the 7745 has. the middle car has 4 chairs. as you can see, some vandal must have nocked over this one. hope they leave the cables alone. this early morning train seems to have one passenger: a workman. i like the small 2x3 windows from this car very much! they give this care a nice look. also the door in the middle adds something special to the train. as far as i know, no other passenger train has the doors in the middle. here you see the side of the train, just after the train has left brickingham station where the worker, probably from set 6647 (highway repair) that was also released in 1980. a closeup of the last car with steering stand to allow the train to travel back and forth without having to 'make head', in other words: putting the engine in front again. the train, shunted to an end track so it can be cleaned (i think it is apparent that it definitely needs cleaning very badly). this set can be found on: peeron lugnet brickset bricklink entries playability: 5/10 (the train is fine, but with only one minifig not very playable without other sets; also no accessories at all!) design: 7/10 (nice train, the inside could have been a lot better, but i really like to original front lights!) price: 7/10 (the train came with motor so not a bad price, goes now for quite some money at ebay.) overall: 6.5/10 (nice set but the 7745 is a better train i'm sure) well that was it for today. i hope you have enjoyed this review and got tears in your eyes seeing how nice the 12v era was... it never comes back, but maybe lego rereleases some of this sets in the 2009+ train era (very likely that this is just wishful thinking). edited by jopiek, 12 september 2008 - 04:56 pm.

1 freddie, on sep 7 2008, 11:52 pm, said: a very nice review, jopiek! you know, i was wondering how lego could justify having two 12v-powered passenger trains at the same time, but after reading the review, and seeing the lack of figures and accessories, i guess i understand why (plus the train is rather compact). oh, and i can't help but think that the chairs in the middle carriage are somewhat oddly placed, because those placed next to the door are unusable because the door takes up room needed for figs' arms. also, it appears that your set also has the newer couplers, i.e. there's no hooks for the decoupling rail to grab hold of. with the light assembly it really won't matter, play-wise, or if you don't have any decouplers, but it's still a bit of a bummer. the chair was just loose so it should be placed on the 2x2 plate that is also visible in the picture of the middle car. b.t.w. the front magnet is the old type. i have some decouplers but we don't use them because they are not really that reliable. lego just release a whole line of trains at the same time. i just discussed with my parents and they told be lego had those sets longer in store back then. i must have gotten the 7745 somewhere in 1983 or even 1984 although it was released in 1981. i started of with the 7710 (push along train) and then upgraded the tracks with current rails when i got the 7745.

1 a nice old classic, the driver has a nice hat and torso, and the train is well designed, except for that thing on the roof.

0 are you going to review the other 12v sets if you have the time?

0 beach cruisers set #: 6445 theme: island xtreme stunts year released: 2002 piece count: 97 minifigs: 2 list price: $7 (usd) during a trip to legoland california in 2002, their big store had a neat little display of some new sets and themes including island xtreme stunts. the new theme offered great colors including orange, tan, and light blue; which immediately caught my eye. the theme focussed on island fun with some adventure, and included some great figs like the brickster. i had to buy at least one set choosing truck & stunts trike (review coming soon) at the time. the theme was short lived and many of the sets were on sale at discount toy stores not too long after their initial release. i picked up this set, 6445 beach cruisers for $3.33 (usd), which will be my first of three island xtreme stunt reviews. starting with the box, a race between the street surfer and skate boarder: the back shows some alternate models including a sail boat and jet ski: same image on the instructions as the box: but the backside shows the island xtreme stunts video game for different platforms: the set includes a small decal sheet for the skateboard: i love the two figs included within this set. one is a "hippie-type" with shades and leafed muscle short, and the other "pizza boy" skateboarder. check out the "pizza boy" on his skateboard: two green brackets are included for attaching each fig to the long grey bar. using this piece, one can make the skateboarder do tricks and flips. the "street surfer" vehicle is pretty nice to: the sail is placed on a black bar and lance, then attached to the vehicle: here's a picture of the vehicle. to me, it has that old "soap box derby" look to it - like something kids would create to race down a hill: the vehicle doesn't have a steering wheel, but rather two levers which i think work well in the cockpit: here's the underside: the set has three neon orange wheels that attach to technic axle pins to attach to the vehicle: lastly, the entire set with a few extra pieces: final thoughts while island xtreme stunts is not the best city/town sub-theme, esp. for the traditional lego classic town fan, it does have some fun sets like this little beach cruiser. good figs, a skateboard, and a very "rollable" (fun word equivalent to "swooshable" but for vehicles with wheels), vehicle. you can even blow on the sail to get it to roll across the floor. this set is a lot of fun!

0 wout, on oct 16 2008, 01:00 pm, said: the hippie guy is called " snap lockit" and the pizza guy is called " pepper roni". i think the legodesigners had a cosy evening with much beer when they thought about the names. thanks for that bit of info. i'm not familiar with the computer game or the characters, although i may have heard the name pepper roni. do you know the island girl's name (not included in this set though)?

0 hippie dude? thats snap lockitt, island xtreme is one of the best themes ever, im trying to get the sets off bricklink, thanks fo the review i need this now.

0 thanks for the review! i loved this theme, it had some of the greatest pieces ever arranged in any theme, brilliant printed parts and figures, and some good colours. snap lockitt (hippie dude ) is a great figure with a cool name, i own him from another set, but unfortunately not this one. it looks like a very good set, no stickers and good printed parts too. nice review. pencoin, on sep 9 2008, 05:21 pm, said: hippie dude? thats snap lockitt, island xtreme is one of the best themes ever, im trying to get the sets off bricklink, thanks fo the review i need this now. hahaha. that made me laugh for some reason... i don't know why though, i agree with it.

1 this is a really nice small set i think. it fascinates me that those are actual printed parts. that's something we don't see too often anymore. the figures are very good, although i must say i like the name hippie dude better than snap lockitt. does anyone know why the brickster has one blue hand? thanks for the great review! edited by erdbeereis1, 09 september 2008 - 06:45 pm.

-1 it is not very often that i rate a legoset 'poor' (it's the first time actually), but in this case i had no other option. the idea of this set is good, and i like the mostly yellow minifig, but the design of both the airplane (weird 'window'-piece, a propellor that is way too small, minimal skies underneath and a strange colourscheme) and the hangglider (two handlebars on the wings, too many colours) makes the set mark the essence of lego's downfall during those years. i really appreciate the fact that you made a review of this set, brickster, it made me look into the details of 6735, but i am just as sure today as i was back then: i will never buy this. anyway, thanks for the review, the quality of the set may be a disapointment your review certainly is not

0 thanks erdbeereis1 for your kind words. glad you liked this set. just wondering whom has rated poor and below average. i will like to know why you voted this way. perhaps, you could share with me and the rest on your thoughts and views.

1 one of my favourite sets! me and couple of buddies got this set back then. the fig was so cool, sun glasses, fast boat....

1 i love the classic sets of that era and a great review helps show off the simplicity of some older sets.

1 what would we do without the trucks of legoland to clean up our town? well, i didn't want to find out, so i bought this set straight away! 7991 recycle truck set info set name: 7991 recycle truck released: 2007 theme: city price: usd 14.99-gbp 12.99-eur 14.95 pieces: 206 minifigs: 1 review time! leading off, the box the front shows the recycle man loading up... the trash can? one thing here is really bizarre. on lego s@h and everywhere else, it says that this set is called recycle truck. which makes sense as it has a recycle logo on the truck. however, on my box, it says the set is called garbage truck has this happened to anyone else? or is it just me... here is the back of the box which shows some of the things you can do with this set. the bags with this set you get 3 bags which are numbered. and do you see what i see? yes, that's right, the dss is in a bag so it doesn't get bent! why tlg doesn't do this more often is beyond me... bag #1 the set comes with a very nice selection of pieces. a large number of these are orange. manual silly me, i forgot to take a picture of the front of the manual. the picture is the same as on the front of the box. the back shows some of the 2007 city sets in a nice little scene. and inside. minifig here is the friendly garbage/recycle man. he looks nice but with the same head as so many other city figs before him. come on tlg! give us some new heads! the sticker sheet the stickers actually are pretty decent as far as stickers go. i like the recycle sign. after bag #1 this is where we stand after the first bag is built. bag # 2 the parts contained in the second bag. more nice orange pieces here. extra parts some nice 1x1 slopes and 1x1 round plates. everything built now that everything is built, let's check it out! the design of the set is very nice and the color scheme looks great. when you see it, you immediately know what it is. the back has a droid arm that acts as a handle to dump the trash/recycling in the truck. it's simple, but works well. here you can see the dumping mechanism. it works by a sliding technic beam with a stopper on top of the truck you can store the worker's cart. this works really well. i think though that the top of the truck overall looks a bit jumbled up with a few too many different colors. the bottom. trash dumping time! this is a good feature of the set. a very well built snot front section. this looks fantastic with the grills and number plate sticker. someone has left a big mess on the street... brickshelf folder ratings! price: 10/10 (for $15 this is a very good deal at 206 pieces) parts: 9/10 (lots of orange) design 9/10 (a very well designed set. especially the front) playability 9/10 (the trash dumper is fun and the added broom and cart make for good play value) build: 8/10 (simple, but stayed interesting) overall:45/50 brickset lego s@h bricklink peeron taking out the trash... summary this is a great small set for the price with fun features, nice colors and good design. i would certainly recommend this set, no matter what it's really called thanks, and happy building!

1 trop beau

1 a good set, with a nice color scheme. i still prefer the last one that had a removable bin.

1 thanks for this review. i really love this set. it's perfect for my town, and brings a sense of "classic" when i see it.

1 that looks like one of those big strange recycle trucks from new york city, i like it!
