These are my only space base plates from Classic Space. Actually, with only 2 plates, I could not do much serious expansion with it. Instead, I merged it with my old city baseplates, and used it as a docking station for scientific purposes or restricted facilities that is guarded by the police. These baseplates are very useful and is suited for creating a space command center, up in the space.  	positive
These plates are great in setting up your space base and giving your ships a place to land. My favorite, though, is the lunar crater plate, which I use to death in my comic. :)	positive
Quote Oh how I love these plates. Afew years ago I found a local retail store with about 6-7 sets of these in their basement warehouse I was given special access to (along with MANY other old space goodies.. hehe..) I love the things, I have loads, and I've used them for multiple space bases and battles. Along with afew grey crater plates and the large grey plates (1.5x the size of a normal baseplate) you can get quite a monorail layout going. *sigh* I should really clean up and get one set up again, so I can take some pictures! Wow, nice. You probably have enough to make that scene on the box picture. I got one pack off ebay a while ago and have another octagon plate from the Blacktron 6988 base. I'm building my carrier MOC around one but don't have anything planned for the others. These baseplates are still relatively common on ebay for their age. I see MISB packs on there every few weeks and they tend to sell for around $20. The older kind (in the OP) are much harder to come by. Edited by CP5670, 09 July 2008 - 10:18 PM.	neutral

The whole set was suppose to teach children to use their imagination, giving them instructions would somewhat defeat this while trying to figure how to build things from looking at pictures would be a much better educational experience. But I don't wanna use my imagination!	neutral
Year Released: 1976 Piece Count: 53 Minifigs: 2 LEGO brought out floating boats quite early, and in many ways the first were the best. (I'll explain why later...) This set in particular is interesting as it came out in two versions; one that includes the first minifigs and another that included the non-armless type. (Set 709.) The police signs are stickers, and are in surprisingly good condition considering the age of the set. (I am missing one sticker on the front though.) Note the Technic Bush and Axel; they are the old type. The position of the second figure is not a mistake; I think he's supposed to be sitting down.... The first boats out by LEGO needed a weighted keel to prevent them.... keeling over. (I have tested this!) I suspect this is because of the density of the old hulls and the flat bottom... but I could be wrong. (It can't be just because of the flat bottom as the new cargo ship doesn't need one.) The keel in detail. The bottom extension is for a motor. (Not included, nor made by LEGO at the time.) The keel had longer studs. Even now it holds extra firmly. This is why I prefer the old design. You can extend or shorten the hulls as you please, or even insert other LEGO in the middle. You can easily add wheels or any other piece to the bottom of these hulls. I wish they would go back to this idea; the 4+ hulls were of this concept but were too wide. (Probably so the keel wasn't needed.) The old minifigs aside from having odd feet and no arms had a normal stud as the neck. Thus when you turn the head it tends to come off. I love this set!	negative

Nice review Sinner! The old sets... I donÂ´t know - every old set, especially equipped with the old non-moveable arms minifigs look very odd nowadays. I agree with you with the hull shape and its possibility to be extended, but every other aspect, the lack of detail, the keel itself (you canÂ´t float it in shallow water) keeps me from rating it higher than 3/10. In my opninion the best police boat so far is 4021 *click to enlarge*	negative
I love those minifigs, they'd go for alot on ebay I bet. Great boat as well, I love the old hull design.	positive
This set showed what potential variations on the standard brick had back then. I think that TLG was still finding its legs back then and learning new things so this is a solid set for the year it was released. Nice review Sinner.	positive

So, you've been bitten by the classic bug too, Sinner. Great review; but one would think arms would come in handy (pun intended) when you are a police officer, right?

Theme: Hobby Sets Set name: Harley-Davidson 1000cc Set Number: 394 Price (new): 260-280 $, 185-200 Euro Price (used): 14-175 $, 10-125 Euro Pieces: 143 Year of release: 1976 Links: Peeron, Bricklink and Brickset Looking at the release date of this set makes me remember the good old times when LEGO sets stayed in production and could be found in stores for long years. Yes, I hear you younger FOLs say this meant we had less variety at the time, but at least we did not have to go on a frenzy to get them all in just 1 or 2 years before they disappeared (to re-appear on the secondary market at crazy prices). Anyway, I also realise this set is older than me by 5 years (at least the first boxes of this set). I think my parents bought it when I was something like 1/2 year old, or even before, as my Father really liked the Hobby Set line and took any chance to get one, you know, for the kids, when theyâ€™ll be old enough to play with themâ€¦ I am really happy my Father did it, too. As a matter of fact, this has always been one of my favourite non-minifigure scale sets. I know younger eyes will look on it and wonder how we could love and enjoy a model like this, so blocky and rough. Just remember this was the best TLG designers could do with the bricks available at the time. Enough about memories; letâ€™s start with the review! The Box Front The front of the box (here cut and folded to save space) shows the Harley Davidson 1000cc in all its glory upon a nice town landscape. I really appreciate how TLG box designers used a real life photo of the model in a real life environment to give this Hobby Set a better background. Moreover, the landscape does not distract the eye, even with its lights, since the focus is strongly set on the motorbike itself. Back (and sides) The back of the box shows the model on a more neutral background and from another angle. We can see the stickers in place (take a good look at them here, because I did not apply them). The right side we also see a pic of the set from the front, and one with a child playing with it. In this latter shot, the model rests upon a nice black box with a Harley Davidson sign on it. I frankly do not remember if this was some sort of tray or smaller box within the LEGO one or if it is meant for publicity only. Another thing we can notice on the right-most side of the box is a white band, right below the LEGO logo, sporting the sign â€˜Designed for experienced LEGO buildersâ€™ in various languages. All in all, a really well done and professional job. Contents Inside This set includes a number of parts in mainly Black, White and Light Grey. Some Blue and Yellow add nice touches of colour to the total. The partsâ€™ selection is not mind-blowing, as most of the pieces had been in production, in these same colours for years. Anyway, Iâ€™d like to focus on a couple of details: The Milky White Technic axles as well as the Red Technic Bush Old 2 are among my favourite parts. The bushes, in particular, are quite useful to build more sturdy looking tubes than what can be achieved with the newer and slimmer ones. It would seem that the tile pieces appeared in the â€˜without groveâ€™ version as a standard and in the â€˜with groveâ€™ version as alternates (see Bricklink inventory). Notice, though that the box (above) and instructionsâ€™ (below) pictures all show the â€˜with groveâ€™ variety. As said, there are no re-coloured parts in this set. New pieces The few new molds used in this set are: Black and White Slope, Inverted 45 2 x 2 Old Type with Round Bottom Tube, Black Technic, Brick 1 x 2 with Hole Type II and Red Hinge Plate 2 x 4 with Articulated Joint â€“ Male and Female. The most interesting piece from this lot, as many of you will have noticed is the Technic, Brick 1 x 2 with Hole Type II. This kind of technic brick was use during 1976 and 1977 only. It would seem TLG tried a new design variant, which did not meet success and was later replaced with the standard bricks again. Nonetheless, Iâ€™m sure that people who own these bricks like them for the unusual design and the possibilities they offer into adding details to their creations. Instructions Cover â€“ As usual, the instructions are not organised in the form of a booklet, but they consist of a folded double printed sheet. The â€˜coverâ€™ shows again the same shot as the front of the box, with bigger LEGO logo and set number and without the other additional information. â€˜Back coverâ€™ â€“ Here we see the full name of the set: Harley-Davidson FLH 1200. This makes me wonder: why is this set known as 394 Harley Davidson 1000cc when it is indeed a 1200cc? Anyway, what really makes me love this page is the list of stats below the photo, and in particular these two lines: H.P. (?)/(not given). This calls for just one question: why did Harley-Davidson not release this info? My opinion is that since this is a motorbike built for the Police, they did not have permission to share the specifications on the motor, which was probably customised either by Harley-Davidson upon request or by the Police themselves. â€˜Random pageâ€™ â€“ As expected, no call-outs here, but the build is pretty straight forward and does not need them (apart for one passage weâ€™ll see later). The colours are easy to tell apart (in the end there is no Dark Grey in this set that could be confused with Black). Again, notice how the instructions include the â€˜with groveâ€™ tiles and not the older ones. Maybe this was changed during the long time this set stayed in production? The â€˜last pageâ€™ shows other four models included in the Hobby Set line. Unfortunately, I own only one of them: the 396 Thatcher Perkins Locomotive. Indeed, I would have liked to have them all! Building Start The handle bars look a bit too squared to me, but itâ€™s just a minor feature, and the overall shape is still good in my opinion. Notice the red hinge plate, which will be almost totally hidden in the finished model (see below), and the blue tiles which work as indicators. The first steps, used to build the front wheel and windshield are really easy, until you get to the wheel. In facts, the instructions do not show clearly all the pieces needed for it, and I found myself with a â€˜floatingâ€™ wheel for the absence of one of the Red Technic Bush Old 2 on one side (the one not visible on the instructions, of course). Not a big deal, but something that could have been done better. Motor and seat The second part of the build includes the motor, seat and â€˜saddle bagsâ€™. The technique used for the motor, or better the radiator, is very clever. To get the ridged feel, TLG designers used 4 Light Grey plates stuck one on the other but not completely in contact. This way, the studs, while keeping the plates in position, keep them raised from one another at the same time. The Yellow round bricks add some details and colour touches to this predominantly Light Grey parts of the vehicle. The use of the Engine, Smooth Small, 1 x 2 Side Plates for the exhaust pipes, while quite clever, still looks a bit strange to me. Iâ€™m mostly used to see them in airplanes, helicopters and spaceships. â€˜Saddle-bagsâ€™, a simple build for one of the iconic parts of this motorcycle. Here you see them in place, as well as get a look at the finished seat. I like how LEGO designers managed to make its shape with just a few quite big bricks. The â€˜saddle bagsâ€™ are a really nice touch, and they work perfectly when compared to the original. This is the rear wheel. As said before, only when you get to this passage in the instruction you get a real understanding of how the front wheel is supposed to be mounted as well. Careful readers will notice how this is not one of the original wheels in this set. The original ones were mounted using the Technic, Gear Expert Builder 9 Tooth. Unfortunately, I could only find one of them in my collection, an itâ€™s used as the front wheel. By adding the rear wheel (which is shown from a better angle in the instructions), we complete the model. Notice how the two technic bricks supporting the wheel are held in position by two 2x1 plates. I think this was a bad case of â€˜building by compartmentsâ€™ mentality: if TLG designers had considered this a bit more, they would have used 2 4x1 plates instead of 4 2x1. On the other hand, this is not the worst case I have seen in a LEGO set, and they keep up the tradition nowadays too. Finished set Front And here it is our fancy Police Harley-Davidson! Indeed, the front looks blocky and quite horrible to our eyes, but again, it was almost the best that could be done at the time. I only wish they had made it a little less bulky, even though this build is clearly thought to give better stability to the wheel. The Blue tiles work nicely to emphasise the indicators, the slightly unsightly red plate is normally covered by the plate sticker and the windshield, albeit being hard to see through, is nicely shaped. Back The back side is less detailed than the front, but shows the red light and antenna which are typical of the Police motorbikes from this period. How many times have we seen this angle in the chase scenes from TV shows like â€œCHiPsâ€? Side All in all, this model looks pretty sturdy (apart for the antenna, which falls off all too easily) and detailed, especially considering the limited variety of parts available and used at the time. They even got so far to put a 2x2 tile as kick-stand to display it without fear of it falling on the sides! Bonus images Size comparison? What I never understood about this set is what scale it is meant to be. I mean, it is clearly not minifig-scale, and it could not be technic-fig-scale (those came later). But it is not even Miniland scale! Moreover, the only other model with the same scale is the other Hobby Set motorbike, as the cars have a scale of their own and the Thatcher uses still another one! Final comments Overall, this is a great set for collectors of old models and motorbike fans, or both. It does not sport a huge variety of bricks, but was a good choice at the time, and even if the result is matter-of-fact blocky when compared to the original, it implements some good solutions to minimise the LEGO brick appearance and maximise the similarity as much as possible. Design & Colour scheme â€“ 9/10 (The design is as accurate as possible, apart for the front mudguard maybe, and the colours are completely in line for a Police vehicle. The solutions and details included in this set justify the â€˜Expert buildersâ€™ label and add to the appearance, and, why not, playability of the model.) Parts - 8/10 (Not a huge selection, and very few new molds. Nonetheless, a good source of Black and White standard parts for MOCs and one of the few sources for the extra rare Technic, Brick 1 x 2 with Hole Type II pieces.) Playability - 9/10 (A sturdy model which can take some serious play and swoosh-ing without falling apart. The easily detachable antenna and the lack of an appropriate scale interaction with most other models make it lose one point, though.) Build - 7/10 (Pretty straight forward, with few nice solutions and an already mentioned slightly obscure passage in the instructions.) Price - 5/10 (Like most older models, especially the Hobby Set and Model Team ones, this set can be found at reasonable prices only rarely. Most of the times, people are asked shameful prices for such a smallish set.) Overall: 8/10 Very good. As always, questions, comments, and pic requests welcome!

Great job on this review of a unique and rare set LuxorV! Considering the year it was released, this must have been a cool set back then. Even up to now with all the specialized pieces and advanced building techniques, I could still appreciate the beauty of this brickbuilt Harley-Davidson police motorbike. The various elements are instantly recognizable and it even has the unusual 'partly-stacked' plates technique for the motor. Overall, I'd say this is an above average set that is a must-have for any hardcore LEGO collector.	positive
LuxorV, this is a well written presentation on this LEGO Vintage review. I never knew the existence of this set and even though the design is not part of the modern LEGO design concept but the overall appeal back in the 1970s certainly appeal to many. I could not mind to own such vintage LEGO model and put them on display and potray as if it was a chart of evolution of LEGO motorbikes. Thanks for sharing and I can't wait to find out your next review.	positive
Thanks 'LuxorV' for this review of such a classic old Lego set and I do remember seeing these in a catalogue years ago. Excellent brick-built police cycle, I think it's time Lego did another one eh ? Brick On Ride On Everyone !	positive
Theme: Hobby Sets Set name: Thatcher Perkins Locomotive Set Number: 396 Price (new): 369-450 $, 258-314 Euro Price (used): 100-355 $, 45-250 Euro Pieces: 434 Year of release: 1976 Links: Peeron, Bricklink and Brickset My Father assures me this is the very first LEGO set I ever got. In facts, he gave it to me as a present for my first half year. Of course, that is to say he bought it for himself and used me as the official excuse! When I grew up, at first I found it to be quite boring: no minifigures, limited play features; in the end, it was just a locomotive! It soon went to forgotten-land. Then, when I was about 10 years old, I one day found again the instructionsâ€™ â€˜bookletâ€™ and saw this bright coloured big steam engine, and I suddenly wanted to build it again. It would seem I finally got to the right age (at least for me) to appreciate the design of this great set. But enough about memories; letâ€™s start with the review! The Box Front The front of the box (here cut and folded to save space) shows the Thatcher Perkins Locomotive in all its glory upon a nice countryside landscape. I really appreciate how TLG box designers used a real life environment made of sand, gravel and pebbles to give this Hobby Set a better background. Moreover, the landscape does not distract the eye, since the focus is strongly set on the locomotive itself. The box measures about 39.5 x 24.5 x 5.5 centimetres, or 15.56 x 9.65 x 2.17 inches. This is more or less the size of the 4840 - The Burrow, or the Advent Calendars. Back (and sides) The back of the box shows the model on a more neutral background and from another angle. We can see the stickers in place (take a good look at them here, because I did not apply them). The right side we also see a pic of the set from the (3/4) back, and one with a child playing with it. In this latter shot, the model rests upon a nice black box with a Thatcher Perkins sign on it. Unlike the Harley Davidson 1000cc set, the Thatcher Perkins does not have the sign â€˜Designed for experienced LEGO buildersâ€™ for some reason. Contents Inside This set includes a large number of parts, mainly Black, Blue and Red, with some nice Yellow to lighten it up more. Parts of interest The partsâ€™ selection is not exceptional, but weâ€™ll see this set includes some unique pieces which have not been in LEGO sets for long years since the 1980s, like the very nice Black Plate, Modified 1 x 2 with Steam Engine Cylinder, Flat Surfaces, Black Train Wheel Spoked for Motor and the Red Train Steam Drive Rod Holder - Train Steam Drive Rod group. The Wheel Spoked Large, as beautiful as they were, saw the light from the production line for the last time in 1976! The only new mold used in this set is the Black and Blue Slope, Inverted 45 2 x 2 Old Type with Round Bottom Tube. As you can see in the above picture, this locomotive was designed to work (well, be played with) on all kind of surfaces, so the wheels sport tyres. In this picture you can see how they look without the tyres. Of course, builders can use the Thatcher Perkins on their brick-built tracks. Another group of interesting parts are shown in this pic: Red Wheel Spoked 2 x 2 with Stud (and tyre), Black Brick, Modified 2 x 4 with Wheels Holder Old, Clear Bottom and Yellow Minifig, Head (Plain) - Stud Solid. Many newer fans will not be familiar with the last two parts: they were standard fare in a number of sets between the 1960s and early 1990s, but then (unfortunately) they were taken out of production. To be fair, the replacement of the Black Brick, Modified 2 x 4 with Wheels Holder Old, Clear Bottom with the standard technic parts was probably due to the fact that the metal pin used to connect the wheels to these bricks had a shameful tendency at getting off the wheel. Too bad it could not be fixed and these parts kept in production. For those interested, here is a picture of the DSS, courtesy of Peeron. Instructions Cover â€“ As usual, the instructions are not organised in the form of a booklet, but they consist of a folded double printed sheet. The â€˜coverâ€™ shows again the same shot as the front of the box. â€˜Back coverâ€™ â€“ Here we see the name of the set and some additional information, like the year when the first Thatcher Perkins started working (1863) and the type (4-6-0) of this locomotive, which, as shown in the image, is related to the number and position of the wheels. On a side note, the pencil signs on the sides of the sheet were made by my Father while counting the parts in the set. â€˜Random pageâ€™ â€“ As expected, no call-outs here, but the build is pretty straight forward and does not need them. The colours are easy to tell apart. Full page â€“ As you may have noticed, all the building steps are drawn on one side of the â€˜bookletâ€™, making it more properly an instructionsâ€™ sheet. What really makes this â€˜instruction bookletâ€™ stand out in my eyes is the fact that it is indeed a poster: the building steps are all on one side, while the other is a bigger image of the completed set with the name Thatcher Perkins in yellow enclosed in an old styled red tag. Building Start The build starts with the base of the locomotive, putting the 10 wheels in place and strengthening the engine. Notice the use of this â€˜illegalâ€™ technique to build the bumpers. LEGO, as we all know can be a tricky medium to build with, and some details need special solutions to be completed. We then start building the boiler and cabin. Going up fast and steady! In the penultimate step, we build the chimney and cow catcher. Iâ€™d like to spend a few more words on the chimney and how it is attached to the main body. As you can see in the left picture, the 3x3 base of the chimney is asymmetrical, with a 3x2 base on one side and a combination of a 1x2 and a 1x1 plates on the other. In the right picture, you see the top of the main body where the chimney will be attached; it is made of a 1x2 base and 1 1x2 tile. Using another â€˜illegalâ€™ technique (or at least one LEGO designers do not like much nowadays), the holes of the 3x2 plate of the chimney will connect with the studs of the 1x2 plate on the main body, giving a well centred and quite sturdy build. Finished set Front The front of the model sports 3 big headlights, a nice cow catcher and the nicely detailed engine front. I can almost hear it whistle! Side And here it is our good old Thatcher Perkins Locomotive! Indeed, it looks like a classic and powerful engine form one of those Spaghetti Western films, doesnâ€™t it? What I found strange in the beginning is the choice of colours (I was convinced steam engines were all black, at the time). Then I checked some pictures of the original, and I must admit the resemblance is almost perfect! Back The back side is less detailed than the front, with cabin almost devoid of details. I think LEGO could have done a better job on it. 3/4 Front and â€¦ Just see how good it looks from this angle, with all the tubing, moving parts and the lovely 3 headlights! â€¦ 3/4 Back The back view is not as impressive, but grants us a good look at the big posterior wheels and the bumpers. Bonus images Size comparison? As I stated elsewhere, I never understood what scale these Hobby Sets are meant to be. They are clearly not minifig-scale, and they are not technic-fig-scale either. But they are not even Miniland scale! Moreover, they use different scales between locomotives, cars and motorbikes amongst the Hobby Set line! As I said before, the set comes with tyres on the wheels to allow a wider playing experience, not limiting this model to tracks. Nonetheless, builders can assemble their own track (maybe using the vintage blue 4.5V tracks) and make the Thatcher Perkins run its proper environment. Final comments Overall, this is a great set for collectors of old models and steam engines fans, or both. It does not sport a huge variety of bricks, but was a good choice at the time, and even if the result is matter-of-fact a bit blocky when compared to the original, it implements some good solutions to minimise the LEGO brick appearance and maximise the similarity as much as possible. Design & Colour scheme â€“ 8/10 (The design is as accurate as possible, and the colours are completely in line for the Thatcher Perkins Locomotive. The solutions and details included in this set justify the â€˜Expert buildersâ€™ label and add to the appearance, and, why not, playability of the model. Though, I still wish TLG had included more details in the cabin.) Parts - 10/10 (Quite a big selection, but only one new mould. Nonetheless, a good source of Black, Blue and Red standard parts for MOCs and one of the few sources for the extra rare Black Plate, Modified 1 x 2 with Steam Engine Cylinder, Flat Surfaces, Black Train Wheel Spoked for Motor, Red Train Steam Drive Rod Holder - Train Steam Drive Rod group and Wheel Spoked Large.) Playability - 9/10 (A sturdy model which can take some serious play and swoosh-ing without falling apart. The somewhat easily detachable chimney and the lack of an appropriate scale interaction with most other models make it lose one point, though.)

Overall I think it's a really good set at that time, of course judging this one by modern standards won't be fair but at the time I'm pretty sure it was a 'cool' set to have (though less cooler than having the Harley Davidson set).

For its time, this is truly a remarkably detailed and beautiful set, and I think it's amazing how it's still in such good condition after all this time. Do you have any more from this era (excepting the Harley, of course )? I've created a whole new index to put them in Interesting that you had to create a new index for them , but these two are the only ones I have for now. Maybe other members will be ble to contribute to it in the future	positive
Thanks for the great nostalgic review! Great pictures, I love the shiny glow of 37 year old bricks! Sets were simpler back then, but not less exciting in their own way. I wasn't even born in 1973, but one of my first sets was the 1982 update of this, 6630 Bucket Loader. Almost 10 years later, but the very same bucket assembly, only the colours have changed.	positive
I voted 'Outstanding.' Regarding this set, I found mine at a consignment store. It was inside of a larger set from the same time period.	positive
and again those tears in my eyes. with original box...! I really love those classic space stuff. Looks like I need to clean my stuff this summer.	positive
this was my first space set ever!! 1979, 1980... don't know anymore, but i do remember i got this together with 897 for my birthday when we where camping... with a little luck i may even have an old film from my dad, opening the boxes... well what to say... it looked soooooo aggressive with those two engines! but i never knew why you needed two steering wheels on it... they probably just thought a symmetrical model was better .... i can't blame them... what a nice set.... it would even sell today, no doubt... looooots of swooshability...	positive
Nice!!! 442 is the lowest set number I have seen for any Classic Space set, so it must been released with the first wave in 1978. Its remarkable that a LEGO spaceship this old and small can seat more figs than the much bigger MX-71 Recon Dropship of today. Anyway, I just want to grab it out of the screen and swoosh it all over the place, lol. TLG, please make these Classic Space sets again! I promise I'll buy many!	positive
INDEXED Everyone remembers their first time. For me, it was in 19*cough*somethingsomething*cough*. We were at her house, and her mother was gone for at least an hour. She slowly unzi... uhhh. Sorry, wrong story. Um, yeahh. Anyway, I do remember my first time. It was 1977, in late summer. Our neighbor, who worked for a department store called Famous-Bahr, said that the main store had a travelling LEGO display. So my family filed into the car and drove into downtown St Louis to see this display. To tell you the truth, I don't remember much about the display itself, but I DO remember that my parents bought me my first LEGO set. Set # 456, the Spirit of St Louis. Set #: 456 (also sold as Set # 661) Name: Spirit of St Louis Theme: LEGOLAND / Large Vehicle Year: 1977 Pieces: 49 Minifigs: 0 Price: $5.00 USD? (Bricklink MISB start @ $175.00 USD, Used Complete ~$35.00 USD) Links: Peeron, Bricklink, Brickset Packaging Box Front: The original box that my set came in was most likely trashed 5 minutes after returning home. This image was lovingly stolen off of the Peeron page for this set. I feel lucky that I even got this much. Similarly, I have no pictures of the plastic baggies the set came in. Truth be told, I can't be sure that there even WERE plastic baggies that the parts came in. THE SET Side View: Well there she is. My first set ever . Actually, I seem to recall the real Spirit of St Louis was silver colored, not Black and Yellow. If you need a history lesson, the Spirit of St Louis was Charles Lindbergh's plane when he made the first trans-Atlantic solo flight. More details can be found on the Wikipedia page. The overall shape is pretty close, at least. The cockpit window could stand to be moved forward one stud, but everything seems to be relatively close. The tail piece isn't the right shape, but it is likely the only tail piece LEGO produced at the time. If you look closely, you can see the various bite marks that my brother and I inflicted over the years. I know some people would be aghast that there are bite marks, but brick separators wouldn't come out for another 10 years. Besides, we were young. We didn't know any better. I certainly had no idea that it would become my obsession. There are some interesting part choices here. Everything is brick and plate built, as you might expect. The same set nowadays would have lots of slope, wedges and wedge plates to round things out. But LEGO was all about the brick in '77, so bricks are what we got. The black inverted slopes worked pretty well asthetically as the wing struts. The wings are simple 4 x 10 plates, nice and square. There were no minifigs in this set. If I remember correctly, 1977 was just about the time when minifigs made their first appearance. I know I have one other set from '77 that does include a minifg, at least. I don't have a lot of comments for the following photos. I'll let the pictures speak for themselves. 3/4 View Back Back 3/4 Top Front PARTS Interesting Pieces I have no idea if there were any extra pieces that came with this set. I kind of doubt it. Instead I took a photo of some of the interesting parts to the model. That translucent white piece didn't photograph so well, but it is a Technic Axle 8. That's right, sets from 1977 contained Technic elements. The two black parts are the forerunners to the 1 x 2 Technic Brick, as well. Everytime I hear someone on the forums complain about Technic elements in system sets, I think back to this set. The round brick is special as well. Here is a closer view of it, complete with bite marks . Round Brick As you can see, the stud is closed. It is only one of two closed stud 1 x 1 Round Bricks that I own. They stopped appearing in sets in 1981, for those that are interested. The DSS You thought you were going to escape this heading, didn't you? Surprise! Yes, even in 1977 LEGO sets had stickers. The oldest printed elements I can remember were in the Classic Space sets that started in 1979. Again, when people in the forums complain about DSS in sets, I can only help think of this set. And chuckle to myself maniacally. The sticker has held up really well considering it's been stuck on the brick for 32 years. No discoloration, very little curling. I think if all stickers held up this well over time, there would be less DSS complaints. THE RATINGS Playability: 6/10 - The set is quite swooshable, and the propellor spins. Outside of that, though... Minifigs: N/A Design: 6/10 - The overall shape is quite good, especially given the era. The color choice leaves a lot to be desired. Price: 1/10 - It's been retired for 30 years. It's going to cost you to get your hands on it. Overall: 13/30 - This set is for true collectors only. I can't imagine anyone wanting one because they want to play with it. It was a great set back in the day, but the design feels REALLY dated. And if you're wondering, mine is NOT for sale. Ever. All the photos, plus more, can be found in the Gallery.	neutral
I'm sorry you had to move this topic, White Fang. When it was in the Reviewers Academy, the teachers agreed it belonged in Other Themes. *shrug* I guess it ended up where it belonged eventually.	neutral
fantastic review! IÂ´d love to read more like this, trivia about old/rare pieces is almost as fun as the set itself.	neutral
In 1977, trans or yellow slopes existed already, and using them would have made the plane more realistic. A third rear wheel would have enhanced playability and design, rather than this ugly black round brick. It's the reason why I voted "below average" even considering 1977's standards. However this set is nice and simple, offering good playability.	negative
daoudbazaar, on Jul 15 2009, 05:26 PM, said: [...] There is no 45Â° slope in the original plane design ... and no front cockpit window. [...] Except that it wouldn't have been the Spirit Of St Louis. Oooops, you're completely right, the Spirit Of St-Louis didn't have any front window nor rear wheel. Anyway, I think a standard Ryan M-1/M-2 plane would have been a better choice. Less a legend, but more a flexible plan for multiple uses!	negative

Hey EB'ers, i got my Market Street on Monday and finished building it last night. I know it?s not such a nice review like *yoda* did the last times, but i hope you enjoy some of the pics. First a pic of the complete building: The 3 Minifigs: and i pic of the stairs (one of my highlights at this set): More pics you can find here My opinion about the set: I like this set very much, it was really fun to build it. I?m happy that that i got some more cherries and a croissant now *sweet* , a funny idea is the salad in the one box at the front. i think normally it?s a hairpiece of an exoforce fig. I also like the colours of the house, the dark blue is sooooo nice. I think i have to take more of this soon. The lighter blue is also nice. This set has really nice details like the stairs, or the owl at the entry of the market, or the balcony. I paid 89,99 EUR, a fair price for a really nice set!! Greetings Sandra	positive
thanks for the great review! *sweet* now that i've seen the set, I'm afraid i'm a bit disappointed 8-| 1) the color combination doesn't really do it for me. blue, dark blue, grey, black, tan, white, they're all mixed together without any over all design... 2) is there any interior? it doesn't look like it, and in any case, you can only reach it if you remove the modules... hm... |-/ now it looks too much of a box... 3) there are most certainly some nice ideas in this model and some great parts. the best part of the model is the staircase 4) i don't think he spent much time in thinking about the design. As apo said, the chimneys on top of a garage is kinda weird, there's also a gate, next to another gate which is weird as well... also, if this is supposed to ba a grocery, then the owner has done a lot to hide it. The croissant is nice, but next to the brown box with vegies, there's nothing that suggests this is a shop... 5) the white lamp and the the yellow cylinder are at the same level of the tiles. IMO it should be above the level of the tiles... 6), IMO not worth the 90 euro Edited by snefroe1, 20 June 2007 - 09:03 AM.	negative

Thank you very much for that interesting review, Ickelpete. *y* Well, the color scheme?s pretty bad and the design of that Dino?s a bit to blocky for my liking, but the two alternative models you?ve built?re quiet nice. At least there?re a lot of possibilities coming with that set.... :-)	neutral

I bought this set last night and it is great. My biggest surprise was the wheels that were included; I didn't even know they existed and there aren't even that new. Back to the set, he is such a cute dinosaur. :-D Since he is so tubby I think he looks like a baby! I suspect my wife wanted him more than me.... my biggest interest in the set was to have more motors and IR parts so I could make an IR car. Overall, I highly recomend this set, but as others have said, be warned that the box is very oversized. I wish Lego would give up on this whole 1:1 picture thing. *wacko*	positive

Of course, right before I post this I see that Ickelpete reviewed this set earlier in the week. Sorry for being redundant but it is already written so here ya go: Monster Dino Reviewed by Dunamis Set 4958 792 Pieces $89.95 from LEGO Online Store Build time 3.5 hours Here we go with another offering from the Creator line. I?m kind of fond of these sets as they are pretty imaginative and usually have instructions for multiple models. I like the reusability of all the pieces and the varied things you can build. The Box: The box that LEGO shipped this thing in was absolutely huge! When I first got this in the mail, I thought I had won the lottery and they had shipped the UCS Falcon early. Once I opened the shipping box, I was surprised to see an unusually large Creator set box. The box itself is pretty standard Creator type box but this one shows off the Power Functions prominently on the right side of the box. The back of the box shows some of the motorized features as well. Opening the box is a matter of breaking two seals. We?re back to the reusable cereal box type tab system for those of you who stay up a night wondering about LEGO?s next box design. Inside the box we have a bunch of sealed bags. Immediately the power brick, remote and motors stand out as they are each in individual bags. Also, there are three manuals. The Manuals: The three manuals are 76, 76 and 56 pages in length. They are laid out well and are pretty standard with all the usual trimmings: - Piece call outs for each step - Parts inventory at the end of the primary model build - Page numbers Color separation in these manuals were fine for me. Interestingly, the instructions for the primary build took a full manual plus about a quarter of another manual. Random manual photos: Parts list I?ll explain a bit more below, but it would have been nice to have some written documentation on all the functions of the motors, remote and receiver. Such as motor load guidelines and specific explanations of all the remote control functions. It is severely lacking in this area. The Pieces: Obviously, the pieces we?re most interested in are these new motors and wireless remote control. Note that before you fire this bad boy up, you had better BYOB. Since this is prominently a European community, I had better clarify my acronyms. Over here across the pond, BYOB usually means ?Bring Your Own Beer?. In this case, it still means bring your own beer (I?m on my second Heineken right now) but in addition to numerous bottles of beer you will need a total of NINE batteries to get through this set. I kid you not: Anyway, there are two motors (a small and a large) each with its own very unique name according to the manual; the smaller one is called ?motor? and the larger one is called ?XL motor?. Very creative indeed! The battery box takes SIX AA batteries and there are two compartments to hold them. Here is the first: That seems pretty normal. However, the back side of it holds the other three batteries and it seems to be very poorly designed: Note in the photo above where the bottom battery is placed. Compare it to the previous photo and you will see the difference. I played around with trying to get that bottom battery out and you better pack a lunch (or BYOB) because it is no small task! Why couldn?t they make this compartment just like the other side? There is a single power cord connector and a three position switch. The middle position turns the power OFF and the other two positions seem to provide the same functionality in either position as far as I can tell. Perhaps a little blurb in the manual would have been nice to clear things up a bit. The remote takes three AAA batteries. It is fairly small and lightweight even with the batteries installed. It has two thumb controls which could be levers if you insert Technic bars or even pins. The two controls are color coded and match the plugs on the receiver to control two separate motors. In addition, there is a four position switch which I assume changes the channel. Finally, there are two tiny levers that seem to have no function. I?m not sure if they are a trim control or variable speed control. I messed with them and didn?t notice any difference in the motor speed. Again, some documentation from the incredibly verbose LEGO manual would have helped. As far as the rest of the parts, it?s really a mixed bag. There are a lot of varied parts in this set to the point that there is almost one of everything. Lots of Technic gears, pins, studded beams, studless beams, axles, wheels, etc. Also, lots of little 1x1 slopes in various colors, teeth, horns, etc. You can?t really say it is a parts pack because there is not enough of one thing to make it a parts pack. A couple of notes: It seems the quality control issue on the axles has been fixed. I initially reported this back when I reviewed the 8285 about a year ago. All the axles worked fine for me. The color quality control issue is still alive. Check out the different shade of red in these two parts: Also included is the sound brick. This looks just like the other sound or light-up bricks we have been seeing lately. It does have a load dinosaur ?roar!? sound embedded in it though so hide the younglings if they are a bit on the skittish side. Finally, I?ve never seen one of these before (although someone will no doubt rattle off a dozen sets where you can find this part in about 5 seconds): No, I am not referring to the studded beam, I put that in the photo for scale. The Build: The build was fun and was fairly straightforward. As I mentioned, there is a lot of Technic parts, so if you are not a fan of the Technic line you should run, not walk away from this one. There were no gotchas to speak of, but you need to pay careful attention to the placement of the wires that go from the motors to the receiver. They kind of sneak them around a bit so watch closely. Otherwise, it was fine. Here is what is left over: So far, I have only built the primary model. As seen on the box, there are instructions for two more models. Both of the other models seem less complex than the primary model and are likely quicker builds. The Dino took me about 3.5 hours which included some time to screw around with the motors. I?m an old school Technic fan from way back in the 80?s so I had some familiarity with the old Technic motors. Obviously, 25+ years has improved some things and these seem much more powerful. The Design: If you have built the 4507 Prehistoric Creatures then some of the design will feel familiar, especially the head and tail. It is almost like they took the dinosaur from that set and figured out how to motorize it. This is not necessarily a bad thing, just a comment. The set does a good job of showing off the features of the new motors and remote. It is nice to see how one motor can perform multiple functions. In this case, the small motor makes both arms move and opens and closes the mouth of the dinosaur. When the mouth is completely open, it pushes the activation switch on the sound brick which emits the ?roar!? sound. Pretty cool. The ?XL Motor? handles the walking feature of the dinosaur. There is both forward and reverse. Forward works really well while the reverse just makes the dinosaur look like he is doing a Michael Jackson moon walk. (Wow, I never thought I would use Michael Jackson?s name in a LEGO Dinosaur set review!) It is almost like the dinosaur can?t get traction going in reverse. However, as noted previously forward works really well. This guy actually gets going at a pretty good clip. As you might expect, he kind of waddles like a duck since there is no articulation in the knees. It is a bit awkward but it works. The ?XL Motor? seems to kick out plenty of power. Overall, the design seems to be a mixed bag. The way the tail is attached seems to be an afterthought. The arms look to be too small. However, the walking mechanism and legs/feet are pretty cool as well as the head and mouth. I guess it is a reasonable effort to get people introduced to the parts and we?ll see designs improve as time goes on. Here are a few views of our new friend: But What About The AT-AT??? Of course, the real reason you are reading this is that you hope I will have some epiphany on how all this relates to the new walking AT-AT. Judging from the box on the AT-AT, it looks like we get one motor. I don?t see the remote which is a disappointment as I hope it is not controlled by a switch on the body and you either turn the AT-AT on or off. If that is the case, the first thing I am doing is scavenging the receiver and remote from this set to add to the AT-AT. Granted, it could be that it comes with a remote but is just not seen on the box. Also, the AT-AT box looks like one of the images shows that the head turns. I sure hope this is controlled separately as it would be really lame to not be able to control this independently from the walking feature. I?m kind of skeptical on the walking feature of the AT-AT. I suspect it will be rather cumbersome but hopefully I will be pleasantly surprised. Needless to say, this is all speculation but those are my initial thoughts based on this set. Overall Thoughts: It?s an OK set. Kind of pricy but I suspect a large part of that is due to the motors and remote. I haven?t built the other two models (they seem less interesting to me) but at least it has some variability. Also, you get a ton of different parts which can either be a good thing or bad thing depending on what you are looking for. The dinosaur is average. The color selection is marginal (black and lime green?) and the tail section is just lame. I appreciate it more for the mechanical functions and how the motorized parts work. It does do a good job of waking up my dog who seems pretty irritated by it. It is a nice set to show off to the neighbors or the endless caravan of my wife?s friends that seem to materialize out of nowhere. People are quickly impressed by it and then promptly move along once you start trying to explain how it all works. I?m a bit disappointed that the manual did not explain more about the remote and motor functions. I suspect that there is more than meets the eye and I?ll just have to play around with it to find out. It would be nice if LEGO had a website that showed all the cool functions of the motors and remotes so we fully understand the capabilities. Final Rating: 72% Build 9/10 (Pretty quick and fun. The mechanical part is cool) Functionality 6/10 (It is a Creator set so you have multiple builds. As far as it being a dinosaur, it?s just OK. Motorized parts are cool though.) Design 6/10 (Partly cloudy. Some things are cool, others are lame.) Parts 8/10 (New motors and remote are cool. Lots of varied parts included but nothing to write home about.) Price 7/10 (It is kind of expensive) Edited by WhiteFang, 23 May 2009 - 06:23 PM. Indexed	negative

It worked by the head simply swinging from side to side due to balence shifts. I suspect the AT-AT will be same. I also think that there will be no remote for it either. Thanks, that makes sense and you are probably right. I do have the Dark Side Development Kit, but I have not built that AT-AT.

Awesome reveiw, thanks! I gotta get this one!!! *y* *wub*	positive
I kind of like the design of this, but more importantly I really want to get my hands on the power functions motors and IR control system. I'd prefer the 8275 Technic Bulldozer, but there's no way I can stretch to the ?100 price tag, so I was thinking I would have to see if I could get a 4958 Monster Dino cheap in the January sales. Then two things happened today. Firstly I saw the Dino in Tescos reduced from ?70 to ?55. Then my wife said she'd buy it for me for Christmas. Wow! That's never happened to me before. I love my wife! *wub* Can't wait till Christmas now!	positive
Ickelpete, on Nov 4 2007, 06:41 PM, said: If you really want the power functions the Bulldozer is better value as you get two large motors, two small motors and two receivers compared to the one in the Dino set alos watch Toysrus and argos both have had the Bulldozer for ?70-75 in there pre christmas sales usually for a week only I am hopeing they will be on sale soon as I want a Second Bulldozer to get some more motors. Thanks for the tip, but even ?70-75 is too much right now. ?55 was just about affordable, but now my wife's buying for me it's going to cost me zero zilch zip nada nothing which is even sweeter!

I ended up buying a MISB set recently from a Lego collector who is clearing up his collection. Excellent set to get the IR remote and IR receiver and other motors without paying insane amounts for the bulldozer now. There is a quite a number of parts in Power miner lime green and 1x1 white teeth plate for the mouth and claws. The dino alone has 20 teeth in its mouth The glow in the dark "antennas" on the backbone of the dino is a nice touch as you can let him walk in the dark somewhat. I do agree with the reviewer, the box IS INSANELY HUGE!!! I don't think Lego wanted to show a 1:1 scale dino, they just wanted to promote the power function stuff as large as possible. Also, the remote is smaller than shown in the picture as the hand holding it I think is smaller.	positive
Pretty good first review! This looks pretty great, I probably won't be getting it due to budget constraints. (Bionicle) but still, very nice set. To me it kinda looks like the missing link between when the at-st evolved into the at-at. Also, I know the rebels stormtroopers get a lot of hate, but I really like them. Thanks for the review!	positive
Awesome! I am really looking forward to buy this, but is it really $50.00 US? I was hoping more around $30.00. Also, I was wondering how the hip section for the legs work, does it have a stiff turning axis to it?	positive

I built this set and I think the two rubber pieces holding the both sides of the face is a bit stretched out therefore making the set somewhat tight for entire top hatch to open and close. Does anyone have the same situation? Is this right? -------------- Never mind I got it! I built the back a stud too long! Edited by namioik, 29 December 2014 - 03:04 AM.	neutral

Great reveiw, shame on Lego for forgetting that they already made a AT-DP pilot helmet (Ezra's from the Phantom set) that didn't resort to needing a printed head.	negative
It's a different helmet. Ezra's is an Imperial Cadet Helmet (the same one he wears in "Breaking Ranks).	neutral
Thanks for the review and pics. This is a really nice looking walker. One question - how snug are the AT-DP drivers sitting in their seats? The cockpit looks good. Actually I'm not crazy about the AT-DP helmets on the show but I dig the minifigs! Good stuff. Awesome facial hair for Kallus!	neutral

Fantastic review, could easily be the year's best, and it's only January 1st! You've got a duplicated picture in the bit where the candy is being moved from the outside and through the barber shop.. ...and I was expecting a final B&W picture or two where the detective makes his report to the woman in red, and gets his reward (candy, of course) or she in turn reports back to her real boyfriend, the candy smuggler.

Great review Oky! I really love your introduction text. You put a lot of effort in this review, with lots of nice touches. Well done For me the set gets 4 out of 5. It's a great set, but there's something preventing me of giving it 5 stars.	positive
Great review Oky! I managed to pick this set up a few days ago and I must say, it might be my favorite modular yet for the feel alone. The pool hall, barbershop, and the detective's office itself are all wonderfully designed!	positive
TheLazyChicken, on 01 January 2015 - 06:14 PM, said: Great review! The intro was great, but I'm still not convinced on this one. The height seems too small for comparison with the rest of the modulars. The play features are ok but I wish it would have been taller. Totally agree with you, the height does seem rather small. Also 2x buildings on a 32x32 base-plate with a lots of spare studs behind the buildings are these buildings 12 studs in width?. It still looks great style wise, however this might be a set i buy and look at it after i have built it & regret the amount of $$$ i have spent on it. $239 for us Aussie's .

Thank you for the review, it was very interesting and changed my opinion of the set, I'm now considering a future purchase ^^. Just one question: The mirror is on cardboard? I was hoping for it to be a window piece with a mirror on one side.. I hope it's not the same cardboard we had on some of the early Harry Potter sets or the element won't last long	neutral
Thank you for the great review of this set. I'm also curious for the backside of the mirror.	neutral

Lego's affiliation with six wheelers go back a long way. I think the first one was released in 1981, more than 25 years ago. This year, Lego added another one to the family, Mars Mission's "Rhino 1", as its title sounds... It's been a while since i've bought and opened a large box, so maybe this isn't a surprise to most of you, but the box does not open at the front, as with many larger sw boxes, but at the side. The two printed seals(or whatever people call them) have gone as well, being replaced by one larger print in the middle of side... the box also isn't as thick as a large sw box, like the sandcrawler... The general size is, however, still quite large. PICT0001.JPG 281.91K 102 downloads the back side shows the Mars Mission theme sets... eccept the Rhino! I guess it shows this set will be released as a TRU exclusive or something, only to show up in Legoland shops and maybe Lego shops... It's a shame really, because this is by far the best set of the theme. PICT0002.JPG 285.42K 89 downloads When you open the front cover, you see a larger picture picture of the Rhino. Obviously, it seems to be some sort of multifunctional truck. i think the basic function is to drive around and explore. For that it has a drilling device and six giant wheels. PICT0003.JPG 273.7K 82 downloads The set comes with two instruction books. i'm afraid to say they did not resolve the gray/black colors issue. Colorwise, the real thing does not look like the instruction book because of it... PICT0004.JPG 302.63K 75 downloads The Rhino looks really big because of the six giant wheels. I guess it's more or less the same size as M-tron's Magnetiser with the big difference between the two being that the wheels have been turned around, creating a unique wheel design for a Lego model PICT0285.JPG 290.59K 83 downloads PICT0277.JPG 286.26K 80 downloads the wheels look very cool, even though the first couple of wheels stand a bit closer to each other. Don't know why that is. hm... |-/ and they could have used a bit more body, but the design is pretty good. i know, "Armagheddon" isn't far away... |-/ PICT0292.JPG 216.75K 70 downloads The suspension of the wheels is a bit flimsy. sure, it allows the truck to move around in a more realistic way than the old sets, but it's not as flexible as some older sets, like sw's CTT. Nor do the wheels have much body. the black bars you see on top of the wheels are more "window dressing" then functional... PICT0293.JPG 244.78K 88 downloads The over all shape of the Rhino is kinda "bulky", it looks more like a beatle than a rhino, if you're asking me. It has three major sections, but i wouldn't call it a modular building though... The cockpit is the first section. It's spacious and detailed. PICT0290.JPG 262.77K 0 downloads PICT0291.JPG 299.75K 87 downloads The cockpit hangs down from a weird angle. it's attached to a large vertical technic brick that is part of the Rhino's main structure, so it's not a seperate spaceship, which is a shame... oh well... you can't have it all, i guess... PICT0301.JPG 291.13K 78 downloads ah yes... stickers all over the place, but they're cool. the mid section of the Rhino dominates the basic shape of the model. It's as if those two large white parts form a strong and thick shield, protecting whatever is inside from whatever is outsde. PICT0007.JPG 213.22K 67 downloads unfortunately, there is nothing inside. it's extra space needed to house the spaceship. That's really a shame; a command center of some kind could have given the rhino a bit more "panache". PICT0286.JPG 251.35K 87 downloads However, what's really great, is the way in which they fit together: one side has an orange 1x2 plate that fits in between two white 1x3 plates of the other side, creating yet another unique shape for a Lego model. But again, it's a shame they didn't do more with this section... X-O PICT0283.JPG 287.75K 82 downloads The third and last section is a platform for a space ship. PICT0299.JPG 289.5K 77 downloads PICT0287.JPG 199.78K 75 downloads The platform itself isn't really special. no details, no stickers,... it's just a skeleton to carry the spaceship, nothing more nothing less. No, your space ship doesn't fall off, even if you rotate the platform into a launch position, pushing the weight of the ship backwards. In fact, the position of the ship onto the platform is so solid, it's kinda difficult to imagine how this ship flies off. |-/ The ship on the other hand, is pretty cool. It's all sorts of things at the same time it seems. It transports two aliens, but also a small car that reminds me of the small sets of Spacepolice 2, blacktron 2,... PICT0295.JPG 307.4K 85 downloads PICT0298.JPG 268.13K 75 downloads PICT0294.JPG 276.84K 76 downloads the shuttle reminds me of a Star trek shuttle and i think it needs some modding, but i do think it looks pretty nice. sure, the cockpit is a bit too low, a pilot needs to lay down instead of sitting down and the dropping mechnism, if there is one at all isn't all that brilliant either... The main structure is a bit too technical for me. I prefer actual parts with studs, not these Lego technic bars and pins. PICT0006.JPG 224.43K 74 downloads the crew: PICT0276.JPG 239.43K 70 downloads ah yes, there's also this green plastic residu. think they are supposed to be the aliens... and there's also this weird alien craft, but i didn't bother to build that... *sad* GOOD: *wub* Great, innovative design, lots of potential, i even like the colors *sweet* Lots of playability it's a big, attractive model; i don't see any weak spots in the design that could compromise stability or structural integrity. NOT SO GOOD: |-/ too many technic parts, some sections on the model, like the gun and the drilling device are a bit to flimsy I'd say 7.5-8.5/10 Price: 750 Danish Crowns, about 105euro	positive

Great review, wonderfully detailed. Don't care for the ship at all. It's that 'technic under a hollow shell' thing like the CTT. If it wasn't for the figures, I would have hated it, and nothing about these figures excites me. I'll end up finding the least number of sets possible to provide at least one of each figure for the general population collection and skip the rest (unless they do as I expect and flop here, thus leading to huge discounts). I like this set ... at half off. ;-)	positive

Vorkosigan, on 09 January 2015 - 12:29 AM, said: Isn't getting parts in new colors a good thing? It is a shame there is only this one set, I think TLG could make a whole subtheme out of Frozen. I do agree that they overuse lavender and magenta, I don't see why every girl set has to have these sort of colors instead of what would be accurate to the source material . Sure, new colors are good. But cramming a bunch of oddball ones into a single set where they don't even make sense just seems financially unwise for Lego. I'd rather have seen a larger set than light aqua spiral staircase parts. Or lavender tiny fences. Lego made the stairs in dark purple last year for Rapunzel's Tower, and those probably would have been ok here. Or make them in a more useful color like WHITE.	neutral
Thanks for the review! I have the same opinion about the design, looks like Belville. I bought it on Legostore Orlando December 30th. It was impressive. My wife saw them putting on shelf, 8 or 10 boxes. She ran and grabbed the last one! The girls faces around it was indescribable, mix of ecstasy and afraid to loose it. It happened in less than 2 minutes. My 7 yo girl didn't want it. She likes the dresses but hates the movie. Prefers Lego Movie. But my 2 yo girl who never saw the movie grabbed it for good, and we bought it. Lego will sell it like water, but I do not understand why a set so small. It is the WORST SET DESIGN since the introduction of Lego Friends. My 7 yo has more than 50 Lego friends minifigures, all the Lego fiends stores and concluded that the castle had a terrible design. She is 7!! Let's be honest, Lego should have released this sets months before this Christmas and is loosing a perfect opportunity to sell a decent set, with much more pieces. I am wondering if they are going to make another set with the same characters. At the end,. It is just for the minifigures.	negative
When I first saw the pictures, I didn't realize that this set had so much color barf going on in it. Also, there is a bunch of stuff that does not fit in with the movie, and it is pricey. The minifigures are nice, but no Kristoff or Sven. I thought about getting this, but this review is pushing me towards no.	negative
I wish Elsa had more of a white hairpiece rather than blonde. But it could be worse. Not a bad set overall, although Olaf doesn't look right without the twigs on his head. Anna is a really nice and accurate fig.	positive
I think the trans-glitter blue panels can be icy or snowy just fine. I'm sure that's WHY they used them for this set. Now, if you're looking for realism (like the photos in your sig seem to be), it might be tougher. But I've been thinking about using those big glittery panels to make a waterfall-type scene.	positive
Very nice review indeed and I also can't wait for the release of this set. It will be a superb wonderful addition to the LEGO Disney Princess theme.	positive

Most of what I remember about the old Batman TV show actually comes from the movie as I own that. (Mum bought it for me.) I tend to put in on if I have friends over and I am drunk enough. I like the darker side of Batman only, and thus anything that is against the idea that Batman is as big a loon as the guys that he hauls in I don't like.

Great review! Funny as allways! The comic was just a hell lot of fun. It really had me laughing. I would love to have this set but the price is just to high here, far worse than I had expected.

7665 Review Part 2 The second half of the build goes quicker than the first. Once you start to add the engines, the ship really begins to take shape. The main body of the ship has a few surprises hidden away under a removable cover. Inside you get some retracting guns, a storage box, a little shuttle and space for a droid and figure. Here is everything you can fit inside. The guns are concealed behind the side vents. Pushing them forward causes the vents to open. Closed: And open: The final feature is the passenger area/escape pod. Inside is plenty of space for two figures. The pod cleverly attaches by pushing the front section of the ship forward, sliding the pod in, then returning the front. Everything locks together and is held securely in place by an elastic band. :-) Here's a couple of pictures of the final model. It's not the most beautiful creation ever, but it is an excellent representation of the ship from the film. The angular shape actually suits a LEGO build well. There's one more useful feature. The whole ship can be safely and comfortably picked up by two ball ended Technic pins towards the back end. It balances well at this point and does allow you to swoosh the ship around much more easily. This was the most enjoyable Star Wars build I've had in a long time. Everything progresses nicely with almost no repetitive bits. The ship looks good and is also HUGE! *sweet* Compare it to the 6211 ISD and you'll see it's only fractionally smaller. When I first saw pictures of this on the internet I thought it looked OK. Once you see it for real it is much more impressive. For ?69.99 in the UK I'm not complaining. It's the best value Star Wars set of the year so far. To conclude: Pieces: 9/10 Minifigures: 7/10 (would be a 9 apart from the stupid Qui-Gon/Obi-Wan head error) Playability: 8/10 Originality: 9/10 Set Design: 8/10 Overall: 8.2/10 The box says this is a Limited Edition set (whatever that means). So if you're planning to get it I'd suggest you grab it at the first opportunity. I'm glad I did! X-D Edited by Kernow, 22 July 2007 - 10:56 PM.	positive

Ok here is the set alot of us star wars fans have been waiting for! The 7666 Hoth Rebel Base! *wub* First the box Now the great minifigs! That stunning K-3po fig! Now the snowspeeder! AAAAGGGHHHHH these parts are all stickers! Now for the turret! the 2 cones on the side press in to fire out 2 blue lights saber blades :-D Now for the small crane thingy. Yes the part under the engine on the snowspeeder is another sticker 8-| Echo Base!! (well the front door anyway :-D ) The main control room? :-D Again these are stickers on a tinted clear panel and on the slope |-/ I have no idea what this is meant to be! :-D Finally 2 shots of the full set! *wub* Well over all i really like this set and think it is great value for money. The minifigs alone would set you back more than the cost of this set. The build time was a good 2 hours or so and was good fun! The snowspeeder is not as good as the second snowspeeder and no where near as good as the first in my opinion, but i did love that first one. The k-3po fig is perfect and it is good to be getting more droids that aren't r2-d2 and c-3po. It is a shame about the stickers but that is the price of keeping the cost down i suppose (the only printed part in the whole set is the snowspeeder/x-wing windscreen).

Excellent set. The snowtroopers are just amazing (most Lego imperial troops are really good). However, it's sad that except from Luke, all the rebels have the same face which is what is more the most unexpressive that you can find. For the rest, the quality looks excellent. The snowspeeder is far better than the first they realized (but only one thing: it looks a bit too white to me. I think I remember they were grey and orange rather than white in the film) and the Echo Base door is really cool. Really nice set. Edited by Lord Beckett, 02 August 2007 - 04:14 PM.	positive

Great review. I see now why the B model is so popular. I wonder though, on the car, if instead of the panels for the rear spolier (or wing) if they could have used studded panels and maybe layer them to give the appearance of, ie: a three element rear wing. I won't mention the front lights. If I had the money I would buy it for the B model. H	positive
Great review Jim and stunning pictures	positive
Great review with fantastic pictures. As for the model, I'm glad that they chose to make it less pretty - real Le Mans prototypes are rarely a sight to behold. It is function and aerodynamics over form. I would, however, have preferred more realism for the sake of learning: - The front shouldn't open like that - instead it should be easy to remove the whole front cover, leaving the suspension easy to work on. - The aero seems to be realistic, except for the rear end where there's no indication of a venturi channel. This should have been easy to include. - There is no fuel tank, nor fixed fuel connector right behind the cabin. - There are no air jacks! Seriously!? This is one of the most unique features of a race car like this... and LEGO forgot about them. Instead they automated two functions which are manual on a real race car. - The top cars at Le Mans are hybrids with ingenious systems. I would have loved to see the front wheels connected to some kind of spinning apparatus indicating a kinetic energy recovery system. If I get this set... I'm going to make some modifications.	positive
I'm still not a huge fan of the model, but this is one awesome review. The effort and quality can be clearly seen and I hope you continue making reviews like this	positive
Great review Jim.. I have been sitting on the fence about if I will get this set for a while but I saw one built for the first time at a local brick show on the weekend. It definitely looks better in real life than any pics. I have decided to buy one	positive
Thank you vey much for this review. I do have some questions; 1. What are the white clutches geared into? 2. Is the engine geared to one or both drive motors? 3. How well does it go on carpet? 4. Can it doze without breaking the blade?	positive

Not sure if is fairly strong I have only chased the cat at the moment :'-( Thank you! *wub* (I expected the engine was run from only one drive motor; that would have involved some complicated mechanics to do otherwise!)	positive
Thanks for the great review of this set. I've been looking forward to it as well and I am excited about the wireless controls like the Dino. I too am curious if this set has been released here in the US. I was told that it was a Sept 1 release. I agree about the battery life. My Dino set lasted about 4 hours too.	positive
Thanks for the review! This looks like a great set, and with four motors, two receivers and a remote control I wouldn't say it is overpriced. It is still a lot of money though..... If my scholarship permits it I will seriously consider buying this set.	positive
Nice review, Ickelpete. Thank you.	positive
Ickel, thanks for that awesome review. It makes me want to buy this set. I think it'd go just swell with the Mobile Crane. The fact that it has all the motors and such is awesome, I can foresee using those for a lot of other functions for MOCs. And, well I'm a fan of treads. You can never have enough treads :-D Hm, would you be able to tell us, perhaps after a test or two what kind of weight this beast can push around? Thank you!	positive

Thanks for all the feedback you guys! Robert8, on 12 April 2015 - 11:25 PM, said: I can't help but think the minifigures are the weak part of the set. Snake and Apu are great but the rest.... I don't know. They kinda redundant now. They could at least give us new torso printing, like Homer wearing his jacket or Bart wearing his blue t-shirt or Marge wearing her coat. Or, as I said in the discussion thread, I'd have included Jasper in CMF series 2 and a Frozen version here. Overall, the set looks kinda smaller than what I thought. I agree, but so many people were complaining about how The Simpsons House should have included the most common versions (mostly because the eyes or whatever), so I think LEGO played it safe and just included the normal versions. It makes sense, since Series 1 is gone forever, and the common versions were in there, and this set is bound to be in stock for a very long time like the Death Star. I never really agreed when people were complaining about the alternate eye prints personally, but I guess this is a good business choice based on previous feedback.

Hello everyone. Excellent review! English is not my native language, but I want to express my opinion. Simpsons house was the first of its kind, and I can say without exaggeration that this is the most impressive set that I'm going (my collection http://brickset.com/sets/ownedby-celeb ). I look at the video from the Kwik-e-Mart, and is difficult to say how good it is compared with the house. The main disadvantages that I said to myself, is this: build the walls of the large panels, next is access to the roof (gray parts in front of the back door (I think they represent the stairs)) is not on the level with doors on the roof and when you open them, you can see the white block is openly trash, my points of view. Boxes on the left of go to the store and powersauce box, i want see make real and not just a cube, f.e. such as in the unreleased Star Wars set. About minifigures, I fully agree with Robert8. Two more of the same Homer, Marge and Bart?! Personally, I put my set as a scene and all the replays minifigure are inside the house that was not identical characters next And also absolutely terrible Bart`s accessory This set is made parking for bikes and it looks very cool. But damn, it is hoped to see the Bart or Lisa's bike, instead of useless balloons with paint. The walls are made with convex inside panels, why so? can anyone know? have not seen any pictures with such walls in TV show. Why did not they turn? I personally really like how realized roof, but my brother says that it is terrible :) garden could do more in the series there were almost jungle I do not know how to be considered here, maybe anyone can express any opinion or idea? I look at the Simpsons house, and then look at the photo of this e-Mart. I can not understand, in the house we have a garage, two floors, cool floor, a lot of furniture, all the rooms and walls, collected from cubes, many additional accessories. And where is all this detail here? It looks much smaller (maybe even poorer). If they still will release next year comic book store, it will be even less? Of course it is difficult to estimate without seeing it live, we have it will be sold only in May. At first sight it does not look so impressive as the house. Can certainly the case in the limit on the amount of detail, but why it was impossible to add $ 50 to the cost and make Jasper, the more detailed the roof, the walls of the smaller elements, that it was not convex. Sad. Thanks all for attention. Edited by celeb, 13 April 2015 - 05:10 AM.	positive
looks great. how does it compare to the house	positive
Here's a size comp to the house: Click for a bigger image.	positive
That's actually not bad sizing, IMO. Sure, it looks like you get a lot more with the house, but the Kwik-E-Mart has a lot more of those little references that make it Simpsons. I agree with some of the complaining; a real Jasper behind a trans-blue panel would have been cool. You could always bulk up the roof with more foliage... I think it has a great foundation as a set, but could do with a few mods to make it better. Thanks for the pictures; I greatly appreciate being able to see reviews like this before dropping $200 on a LEGO set.	negative
Great Review Just2Good, honestly I love this set lots of great details and references.	positive

It's the level of detail that floors me, a licensed set with the mindset of those great Creator sets. I think it displays much better than the Simpsons house which, from the outside, is a bit drab	negative

I recently acquired 90% of this set, so I thought I would do a review of it. Please note that half of the Mini-figs are wrong, and there are some part substitutions. This is the only set that comes with this plate. There is a depression under the grey plates to the back. The pool depression can be easily covered by three quarter circle plates... which just happen to be included in this set. (Good set design Lego!) The stairs are old Fabuland ones, and have been used in a few other sets. This is the only one that has them in "ParaPink" however. What is the difference between "ParaPink" and "Pink"? Dunno... The big windows are in only two other sets, both of them DACTA ones! The smaller ones were in one other Paradisa set. The interior, while simple, works very well. I love the coffee machine. A cute car came with the set as well. The bird house is a nice idea as well. Once the current visitors leave I will probably be breaking this set. I wish Lego would go back to these sets as they always had some great parts in them.	negative
Great review of a classic set. *y*	positive
Tks Sinner for that cool review ;-) This set is not one of my favs (never was really a big fan of those raised baseplates) but had fantastic parts and MFs !! It has great playability with really cool "80's Miami" feel *wub* That pink was actually pretty cool and went well with that lime green (I think its lime but I'm not 100% positive). Once again this pisses me off so much that I was in my dark ages when this theme was out !! I loved it, especially all the beach/water themes *wub* I really wish TLC decided to bring that water Paradisia back !! Who knows !! After all they need to make some girlie sets !! Girls are a part of their market totally neglected !! How many women we have on the boards ?? Really a tiny few unfortunatly !! SO TLC, please bring Paradisia back in may 08 :-P , please !! *yoda*	positive
I got that set recently as well. Bought a bulk lot and there was all but 1 minifig in there. Gave it to my girlfriend for her town. Need to find her a Ristorante now.	positive

I really liked this train set and it adds so much to a train layout, especially when you buy multiples. TLC is throwing away a potential gold mine by discontinuing this line. :'-( It is also nice to see those beautiful consistent slopes in that picture. It really is sad that TLC is letting quality slip. They don't seem to be responding to the issue they way they did the bley/frown fiasco. perhaps we AFOL need to make more of a stink!

That?s really a great and overall nice playset with a very cool Mrs. Puff and a fine new Spongebob! *sweet* The boating school?s indeed very nice with a beautiful color scheme, and so is the lighthouse.... I?m really tempted to buy a second set just to "complete" these buildings.... although it?s a little too expensive for doing so, and it wouldn?t even fit with the style of the other SB sets. X-D Wet highway to the poor puffer fish? privat hell on! :-D	positive
You've done it again. *yoda* ! Great reveiw. I really like this set, but in my opinon, $50 is steep considering I won't actually 'play' with it. I mean, half of it is a track for peat sake! Ill eventually get it for the Mrs. Puff figure, though. *y*	positive
Man, that Sponge-bob head cracks me up! Hilarity.This is a cool set, although I much prefer the Chum Bucket set. I don't see what's wrong with the course, then again I can see why AFOLs wouldn't like it. It's just playability really. I like the breakable wall though. The building is cool, a few modifications (i.e. making it more realistic, real chairs for a start) and it would make a cool little wharf for your Lego town. And to SW4J, Mrs Puff's legs are connected at the feet, if you look closely. So, thanks for the great review, *yoda*!	positive
Thank you *yoda* for strike 2! It?s SB again. |-/ Sticker Alarm! :-X But this set is better than Chum Bucket. There are far more interesting parts if you don?t like SB. Especially the light house and the little hut with the wooden pontoon. *y* And yet again another set with smooth slopes and rough ones... Too bad, too bad. >:-( >:-( >:-( If I just knew the person who is responsible for that... >:-)	positive
Maybe mrs Puff has a nice toy inside X-D I like this review. The lighthouse part and the school are nice enough for other towns. and the figs are nice, even mrs puffs 2 pieces you can't use for other things. :-) Pity that it's 50 dollars/+/- 60 euro. for half price I would think about it.	positive

Lego 31036 Creator Toy and Grocery Shop Thanks to EuroBricks for making this review possible! For years, Lego has offered a house of some sort in the Creator line each year - with the standard Creator 3-in-1 instructions, that's given us a very wide variety of housing. In 2014, they added a business option with their 31026 Bike Shop and Cafe set. This continues into this year's Toy and Grocery Shop set. These shops are smaller than the very detailed modular buildings, but that should help them fit in better with the other City sets, and this also lets them get into more kids' cities with their lower pricetag. Name: Toy and Grocery Shop Set Number: 31036 Pieces: 466 Price: $39.99 Minifigs: 2 Theme: Creator Year of Release: 2015 Links: Bricklink Peeron Brickset The Box The front of the box shows the "A" version model out of the three, plus insets of the B and C versions. I like the sorta-European looking backdrop; it goes well with the styling of the buildings. Interestingly, the main model is shown opened up for play, while the two insets show those versions folded. The Box Top On the top of the box, Lego helpfully shows that with 3 of these sets, you can make a whole street. The Box Back On the back, you get to again see all three versions together, but this time, folded. It's a little creepy though with those clones running around :) The Manuals Yep, three actual, printed manuals. There's nothing indicating them as being A, B, and C models, but it's pretty obvious looking at the designs which is the "main" model and which are the alternates. The Contents Bags of parts and two plates. Nothing terribly exciting to see here.... The Minifigs Nothing new here, but two nice figs none-the-less. Well, Bricklink does say that both figs are unique to this set, but there's not any new parts to them. The closest thing to rare is the female head - it's only in this set, 2013's Dragon Mountain Castle set, a UK store grand opening set, and one of the 2014 Holiday freebie sets. The faces aren't that unique, but I guess this exact combo of two faces on the head is. I love the kid torso with the spaceman on it. The Minifig Backs No back printing on anything here except for an alternate female face. Sorry. I do like that her two faces are so different though. That's much better than when a head has a "scared" and a "more scared" face. The "C" Build Enough with the basics; let's build. I'm going to review them in the same order I built them, backwards. Since you can tell immediately looking at the 3 designs that they're going to use different numbers of pieces and so forth, I figured I'd build the smallest first lest it seem like a letdown. All three have some basic similarities - the two plates are hinged to give a building that opens for play. They also do have interiors, which you can see starting to form here. The "C" Build, Front It's a pretty quick build, so it's done already. Here's the front of the building with it opened up. Like this, it appears to be two separate stores, a newsstand and some sort of shop you can enter. All the printed tiles help give the newsstand a detailed appearance, but I'm not sure why they've got a $100 bill lying on the ledge... The "C" Build, Rear From the back side, the interiors are pretty plain. The shop half has a plant in a jar and a weird chair, and the newsstand just has a register. The "C" Build, Sides Here's the two sides of the folded building. On the hinge side, there's a bunch of windows in a disjointed wall with random colors. On the other, why did they put in a huge window when the set does include a trans-clear door that could have gone there? And you get a small patch of plants, like so many sets seem to have these days. The "C" Build, Extras That's a lot of leftovers there. And not just little stuff - multiple doors, stairs, etc. And unused sand green is always a little sad.... The "B" Build, 1 A pretty similar start, with the hinge and little garden and some tiles along the ground. The "B" Build, 2 Now we see a big windowed wall, some details like lights, and how it has the usual alternate model "weird part usage" - like a 1x4 brick with side studs being used over the doorway, even though those side studs will not get used. The "B" Build, Front The finished building gives us a nice little post office, with a letter-carrying bird on the roof. Hope that's not their normal method of delivery! Something about the colors just doesn't work for me though. The combo of white / light grey / dark grey / black / sand green plus tan is just too much. The tan window and door frames I don't like. The "B" Build, Inside On the inside, things are weird. The counter on the left is ok, but the light above the door (with a yellow clip? ugly!) is too big, and everything else over there by the door doesn't make much sense either. The "B" Build, Sides I like the front side here, except the colors are still too much. The bench, greenery, mailbox on the corner, and streetlight are all nice. The boy is a little creepy though - binoculars in hand PLUS a telescope on the roof of the post office? Why? The hinge side shows more of the weird colors you get in the wall, but that's going to be hidden when the set is open. Plus we even see that on big modulars at times, so it's not SO terrible. The "B" Build, Leftovers Again, a lot of leftover parts. It's obvious this was another alternate, but it'd be nice to see more of them used to make a bigger building. But let's move on to the model that DOES use them all... The "A" Build, 1 The first half starts like this. Maybe it's just my bias, but it already feels like a more detailed build. Bottles on the wall, the yellow and red awning over the window, etc. The "A" Build, 2 The other half starts off with detailed work too. I think that's a red vending machine. The stairs are also VERY solidly built. I also appreciate the effort to get that diagonal base where a door will be - it's such a nice touch to have sections of a building that aren't right angles. The "A" Build, 3 Not too much has been added, but I wanted to showcase the tiny toys before they get hidden by a wall. That robot and train are just fantastic little micro builds. The "A" Build, 4 Things are coming together quickly. The walls, windows, and doors get the first floor nearly done. I'm still not big on the sand green and tan combo, but I do really like the red and yellow awnings. The "A" Build, 5 It appears the shop owner lives upstairs, since we've got a bedroom forming here. The bed is a little plain, but the table and lamp on the other half are great. And my big fingers did not like putting all those railings on the balcony, with the telescope posts and tile tops. Knocked quite a few off before I got them all done. The "A" Build, Front And it's done. All the details make this set really feel like a mini-modular. The roofline has great greebling, and the shop contents, and on and on. It's not perfect though. The tiny car above the toy store door isn't nearly as good as the toys inside. And the kid's yellow scooter? The wheels aren't even on the ground, much less able to roll. The scooter looks decent though, so that counts for something. Well, at least as long as you are at this angle, since the boy's only got 1 foot on the 1 stud wide scooter. The "A" Build, Inside Most of the interior has been seen already. The roof though does a nice job of being interesting for a roof. A skylight, the edge rails, etc. And you can see there's not much "wrong color" in the walls. The "A" Model, Sides An interesting building when folded up. Very tall and skinny. You can tell it's not really meant to be displayed this way - it's meant to be open. The good - lots! I like the awning, the diagonal door, the flowerbox under the upper window, the folding gate on the balcony that lets it be used in open or closed mode, and the green / white / blue colors. The bad - well, the stairs end short of the upper door, I still don't really like the tan doorframes (I think black would have been better), and why don't the upper floors match up in size? The "A" Model, Leftovers Ah, that's more like it. Just a few small pieces left as spares. The Errors You might have to click through to the full-size versions, but I did catch a few weird errors in the manuals. First, in the photo of the newsstand, the map in the front corner is on there sideways. The map does have a clear north arrow printed on it. On the second image, the boy's feet are hanging off the edge. Just unusual to see an alignment error in the manual like that. The Comparison Here are this set and the modular Detective Office side by side. There's a huge difference - as you'd expect. But is the difference MORE than you'd expect? This set is 466 parts, $40. The DO is 2262 pieces and $160. 5 times the parts, 4 times the price. Looking at them side by side, I'd expect a bigger difference in both. The Conclusion So, what's my conclusion on this model? I love the main model, but the alternates are meh. It's a nice set for someone looking for a town building other than police and fire stations, but who isn't ready to move to the modular line. Compared to the modulars though, it seems overpriced. Part of that is because the huge modulars are actually a great deal compared to other Lego sets. I'm also a little surprised that it's so small, when you compare it to the City sets like a police station. Those are generally designed with much more open space, letting them be more of a playset. This one is small and cramped, so it'd be tougher to play in. It's not really a City set though. The Ratings Value: 7/10 - It's under the 10 cents a part mark, but that's largely due to having a TON of tiny parts. All those flowers and decorative 1x1 round studs add up quickly! Design: 7/10 - Good and bad on the colors, and there's a big difference between the quality of the main vs alternate models. Having so many leftover pieces is one thing when the Creator set makes 3 very different models (ie a boat, plane, and truck). When it's 3 buildings, it seems wasteful to have so many parts leftover. Minifigs: 6/10 - I'm not sure they both fit the set. I suppose the boy is going to the toy store and the woman is going to the grocery? But there's no storekeeper in either. The woman doesn't look like a storekeeper to me, so that's why I assume she's another shopper. I love the boy, but the woman is just so-so - except that I do appreciate the head having two very different expressions. But again, that doesn't fit the set. I can't see her scared face being used. Playability: 6/10 - The shops are detailed with registers and so forth, but it's all so tiny it'd be hard to play with the figs in it. Parts: 9/10 - Tons of windows and doors, plus nice sand green bricks. But some things (the large blue curves used on the roof for example) are weirdly specialized and would be hard to use in another building design. Overall: 7/10 - I'd recommend doing what I did - build the alternates first, then the main since that's how you'll want to leave it. I'd really like to see the price a little lower compared to other sets (again, the part count is inflated due to SO MANY tiny parts) and the finished building is tiny, but it's loaded with neat details.	positive
A terrific, very comprehensive review - but I'm not at all impressed with this set. It feels like a mishmash of bricks with no clear design aesthetic and as such blatantly underdeveloped (i.e. designed to hit a price/brick count point rather than provide a solid set in the Creator Town tradition). Compared to other Creator sets at this price point (31025 - Mountain Hut, for example) it feels utterly uninspired and ugly. Edited by Johnny6666, 04 May 2015 - 10:02 AM.	negative

Cheers for putting in the time to create a wonderful review. I am not a huge fan of this set; I like the colour combinations, but it all seems a bit all-too-simple. It can (and will) be nicely modularised, though!	negative
Reviews for this set really should picture them next to the Bike Shop & Cafe, which it's intended to be compatible with right down to the size of the baseplates and grey tiles around the edge. It doesn't look that great on its own, but if you add the two sets together you get something that begins to look like a street scene.	positive
Thank you Andy for your speed review! *y* So there?s nothing left to open while advent? ;-) I like all the tiny sets, it needn?t be another police- and fireman |-/ , but well, what would an advent calendar be without them? :-D One thing about the train traffic lights: TLC used to give us similar lights, but you could show either of the lights with the other one being covered: That one was waaay better! :'-( Just a little piece more would have done the thing... ...and I won?t mention the radar-crap-dish :-X Let me quote Franz Beckenbauer: "Is' denn scho' Weihnacht?" (legendary quote from an promotional job he did years ago - "is it X-mas already?")	neutral

I have 2 of these guys. :-D It's awesome, only cost me 13 bucks NZ, for a comparison, the Castle Crossbow Attack set costs $10 NZ. For the win! Did I read this wrong? You paid about the same price as the Republic Cruiser??! The Republic Cruiser costs $200 NZ, and the Cyclone Defencer costs $13. I must have read that wrong... *wacko*	positive

Hovercraft Alternate model. Uses around 4/5th of the parts. It is cool but a bit fragile.	positive
Thank you Sinner for bringing the pictures of the hovercraft. I think it is a really cool model, but The steering wheel doen't work too well. It doesn't turn easilly all the way around and when the craft turns, it doesn't stay stable on the three wheels because the front wheel turns quite alot into the opposite side. Now to the third model! This is quite a basic helicopter with the functionality of having the rotors turning. It doesn't use that many of the bricks and doesn't even have a landing gear. I have a question to all of you. As you can see, I prefer to show one or two large pictures and have the rest as clickable thumbnails. Most people use only the relatively big (typically 640x480) pictures so that you don't have to follow links. What do you prefer? It is no problem for me to do it the other way, but I would like to know if you have any preferences.	neutral

It?s for sure an at least interesting set. The idea of attaching that small mecha to the bugs body is very good, so it works like a counterpart to the Aero Booster. Pretty nice.

It is no secret that Marvel is one of the most successful companies right now. From the Avengers to the X-Men and down to even the most obscure characters like Ant-Man, every one of their movies has been a big hit until now. The latest Marvel movie, Fant4stic, was released last month and while I have not seen it yet, I'm sure it's just as great as their other movies. I mean, it has the word "Fantastic" in the title after all! And being the smart business that they are, The Lego Company decided to get in on the hype early and capitalize on this movie's undoubtful success two years in advance by making a set featuring Fant4stic's main villain, Dr. Doom. Now that's what I call forward thinking! But did they do a good job with it or were they being overhasty? Let's find out! Set Number: 76005 Name: Spider-Man: Daily Bugle Showdown Theme: Marvel Super Heroes Subtheme: Ultimate Spider-Man Year of Release: 2013 Pieces: 476 Minifigs: 5 Price: $49.99 USD S@H description: Quote Swing into the Daily Bugle and stop Dr. Doom™! Dr. Doom™ and his henchman Beetle™ are attacking the Daily Bugle in their speedy jet to steal Spider-Man's™ secret identity. It's up to Spider-Man™ and Nova™ to swing in and stop them! Trigger the Daily Bugle's explosion functions to cause destruction as the jet fires missiles! Stop Dr. Doom™ from hitching the jet's anchor hook to the safe with Spider-Man's secret inside! Knock Beetle™ off the building with the swinging web attack and drop Dr. Doom™ inside with the rooftop trapdoor! Then fly Nova™ in through the broken window with the dumpster catapult function and send those villains back to where they came from. Includes Spider-Man™, Nova™, Dr. Doom™, Beetle™ and J. Jonah Jameson™ with accessories and weapons. The first thing that comes to mind after reading this description is: Wow, that's a lot of TMs! Anyway, here are some resource links for this set: Brickset Bricklink Rebrickable The Box Since this set is based on the Ultimate Spider-Man cartoon, the box has the usual USM design with the red Marvel Super Heroes background, an illustration of Spidey in the upper right corner, and the USM logo in the lower right. As usual, there is a minifig line up in the lower left, and since this was before the terrible redesign, you can see the full body of the minifigs. I really miss this type of line up. There is quite a lot going on here: Doctor Doom attacking the Daily Bugle in his jet while simultaneously reaching for J. Jonah Jameson below with his jet's claw, Spider-Man (reluctantly) swings in to save him, while Nova fights off the Beetle. It's a pretty cool scene, even though it's not very accurate to the show. In "Beetle Mania", the episode that this set is based on, the Beetle was indeed out to kill JJJ, but it was in order to stop him from exposing his identity, not Spider-Man's (although Spidey was next on JJJ's list). And while he is a recurring villain on the show, Doctor doom had nothing to do with this plot and didn't even appear in the episode aside from a brief cameo. It's awesome that they included him anyway, though, so I'm not gonna complain. Note that the tower is so tall that it wraps around the top of the box. There, you can also see a scale reference with the Spider-Man minifig. On the back of the box, you can see the interior of the Bugle and all of its play features which there are quite a few of since this is a playset. It's all illustrated pretty well, although Lego's choice of sound effects is still a mystery to me. I don't get why they don't go for Spider-Man's signature "Fwip!" instead of "Fazzing!" and I didn't know that a breaking window made the sound "Btoom!" but I digress. Contents Inside the box you will find three instruction booklets (one smaller than the others), a comic book, a fairly large sticker sheet, five numbered bags, and two loose pieces: A white string piece and a gray 16x8 plate. There aren't really any notable pieces and nobody cares about the comic bock (no offense to the artist), so lets get right to the instructions. They are pretty straight forward and easy to follow. Some of the pages have a ghostly image of Spidey, Nova, and Dr. Doom in the top right corner which is fitting since these are all minifigs that appear in this set (which is strangely not something that can be said for many other Super Heroes instructions with this type of artwork). Minifigures As with most Super Heroes sets, most people will get this set mainly for the minifigs, so without further ado, let's talk about them. Spider-Man is the same old bootless one you get in almost every USM set. Not much to say about him. Some might complain that we don't get Spidey's alter ego Peter Parker in this set, but in the USM cartoon, MJ is actually the one who works at the Daily Bugle, not Peter. Curse the creators of this cartoon for ruining our chances of getting a new Peter Parker minifig by trying to mix things up. Next we get J. Jonah Jameson. He appeared in a Spider-Man 2 set before, but this is a complete redesign. He now has a blue suit with a red tie, a unique face print, and that combed-back hair in dark gray. This new hairpiece doesn't suit him at all and the old flat top hair was perfect for him in my opinion, so I don't know why they changed it. The good thing about this change, however, is the fact that this piece is exclusive to this set in that color. Nova on the other hand is spot-on. He comes with a new helmet mold and some nice torso printing. However, he, too, is missing his boots. TLC should have started making dual-colored legs a long time ago. Here are some reference images to compare them to. Okay, so JJJ's hair may not be completely black in the show, but I still think they should have given his minifig a black hairpiece. His suit is also not quite the right color. He rarely appears in person in the show (including the episode this set is based on) and is usually seen on screens around New York, so this is the best picture of him I could find. I guess I should be happy they included a minifig of him at all. In the episode, it was actually Mary Jane who was at the Bugle during Beetle's attack, so it would have made more sense to include her, but we got her in the Spider-copter set one year later, so that's ok. All three of them have back printing. In JJJ's case I'm using that term loosely since it is only comprised of two lines, but it's nice that they went through the trouble of adding them. Both JJJ and Nova come with angry alternate faces. It almost looks like they're trying to out-angry each other. Who do you think looks angrier? Let me know in the comments section below. Now let's talk about the bad guys. Even though he would be better off in a Fantastic Four set, it's great to finally get Victor Van Doom, one of the greatest Marvel villains ever and in comics in general. He comes with a dark green hood which was new and exclusive in that color at the time, and he is the only minifig in this set that has leg printing. Beetle is a regular minifig with wings. The metallic printing on his face and torso is pretty nice, but I wish it would have continued onto his legs as well. The Beetle looks quite accurate to his on-screen counterpart. The only thing that could have improved him is a new helmet mold with pointy eyebrows/antennae. Doctor Doom, however, looks nothing like he does in the movie. I just don't understand how Lego could have messed him up so badly. Maybe they were working off of early concept art or something. Here is a back view of Doom and Beetle. Beetle would be a pretty boring minifig if it wasn't for his wings which are awesome with their holographic texture. They are so mesmerizing, I could look at those things all day. This piece also appeared in trans. light green in the Galaxy Squad sets which came out at the same time. Here they are without their gear. As you can see, they both have back printing as well. And no, Doctor Doom does not come with an alternate facial expression, which is fine since you can't see much of his expressions due to his mask anyway. Here's a look at Dr. Doom and Nova without their headgear. Some say that Doom's face looks too cartoony, but I think it looks fine. Nova is wearing stylish goggles as a way of explaining his white eyes. It's a far better explanation than the Bat-sweatband. They did the same thing with the masked Wolverine later. Here are all the figs with their accessories. JJJ comes with a camera so that he can take "more pictures of Spider-Man!" Beetle comes with one of those overused ADU guns which is a very poor representation of his wrist-mounted blasters. I hate to say it, but even those bulky new stud shooters would have been a better representation of his weapons. Spidey comes with his usual string of webbing and Nova comes with some Iron Man style translucent studs. The weird thing is that they are red while his powers have a blue glow in the show. Doctor Doom sadly doesn't get any accessories, but who needs weapons when you have a jet with a claw and flick-fire missiles. The Build The first bag contains Spider-Man, a brick separator, and the parts to build the ground floor of the DBC building. After a quick and straight-forward build, you get this. The dumpster and street lamp are separate from the building and since the lamp post is not built onto any baseplate and is quite top-heavy, it gets knocked over pretty easily. Maybe it's meant to be that way, but I would have preferred it if you could stick it onto the baseplate of the building on which there is unfortunately not enough space to do so. As you would expect, the second bag has the parts for the first floor of the building. This is also the bag that contains Beetle. After another fairly simple build, you'll find yourself with a two story building with a spiderweb one side and a fire escape on the other. However, you have to apply three stickers during this section of the build which is never fun. Can you guess what's in bag number 3? Yup, the second floor of the building. You don't need superpowers to predict that one. Also, this bag contains Nova and Jameson. The build of this section is a bit repetitive since the second floor is mostly the same as the first and it takes slightly longer to build since you have to build the rooftop as well. Also, in addition to the two window stickers you have to apply ten 2x2 tile stickers! Trying to do this without having any of them being crooked is a real pain in the megablocks. The next bag contains Doctor Doom and the cockpit of his jet. Doom's cape is in the usual square white box and the string for the claw is folded up in a piece of tape. Here's what you get at the end of this section. Looks more like an escape pod than a jet at this point. The final bag is the smallest as it only includes the few parts needed to finish the Doom jet. Once you build the wings and tail, you stick them onto the cockpit via Technic pins and you're done. Spare Parts These are the parts that are left over after the build. There is the brick separator of course, an extra antenna, and the usual little bits and bops. What's really awesome, though, is that they give you an extra pair of Beetle's wings! Considering what a neat piece this is and that this is the only set in which it comes in trans-black make this a very welcome spare that you can use in your customs. The Finished Set Here is the complete set. The DBC building looks quite tall, especially when you count the antenna. Comparing it to a screenshot from the episode, the general look of the building is there, although there are some inaccuracies. Aside from the fact that it is obviously way down-scaled, the screens that show JJJ ranting about Spider-Man should have been hexagonal, not square, and should have wrapped around the building. However, considering how many stickers you would have had to apply if they would have made it accurate, I'm actually glad they kept the screen mercifully small. Much like Doctor Doom himself, the Doom jet didn't actually appear in the Beetle Mania episode. However, it did appear in a later episode titled "Not A Toy" in which Spider-Man plays around with Captain America's shield, accidentally drops it in Doctor Doom's Latvarian embassy and has to try to retrieve it. And yes, that episode was as godawful as it sounds. Here's a screenshot of the jet from that episode. Like with the DBC, they managed to capture the general shape of the vehicle, although it doesn't look quite as good as in the show. The color scheme is too dark and it looks kind of blockier. Let's take a closer look at the jet. There is no real way to reel the claw in unfortunately. However, there is a stud on the back of the jet that you can stick it onto. Needless to say, this is not the ideal way of storing it. I would have much preferred it if they would have attached it onto winch instead. The engines on the wings can be turned, even though they don't turn in the show, and there is a flick-fire missile on each side. Even if it's not much to look at, at least it's a very swooshable vehicle. On top of each wing there is a tile with the emblem of Latvaria. There was no such emplems on the jet in the cartoon, but they are useful pieces that make it clear whose jet it is, so I'm glad they included them. There is nothing inside the cockpit except for a seat and unless you want to ruin Dr. Doom's nice dark green cape, I wouldn't put him inside of it. They could have at least printed a control panel onto that empty 2x2 tile. Play Features Since this is a playset, let's look at all the play features it has to offer. Like all playsets, the building is open in the back so you can play inside. On the ground floor, there is a potted plant and... nothing else. Seriously? Is this all they could come up with for this floor? They could have included a security desk, a lounge, a second plant, or anything else! As it is, it's just a boring empty lobby. The first floor is a bit more interesting. There is a safe, a swiveling chair, and a pin board with various pictures of Spider-Man. There is one tile that reads: "The true identity of Spider-Man" which is supposedly what the villains are after. I wonder how Jameson got this information in the first place. Speaking of Jameson, the second floor is devoted to his office where he can sit and yell at his non-present employees, demanding "more pictures of Spider-Man!" It also has a swiveling chair as well as a desk with a lamp and a computer. There is a Technic beam connecting his desk with the ceiling of the first floor which you can remove in order to take off the upper half of the building, but it's difficult to do, so I don't recommend it. As you may have noticed in the picture above, there are a few red pegs sticking out of the building. These are for triggering the play features. Most of them are on the roof. There is one on what looks like an air conditioning unit. If you place Spider-Man holding is web-string on the jumper plate in front of it and push the peg, Spidey goes bungee-jumping off the building. Wee! There is also one that sticks out of the side of the building which when pulled triggers a trap door. The third red peg on the roof can be used to pop off the DBC sign. Why is it called the DBC, you ask? It stands for Daily Bugle Communications since in this version of Spider-Man, the Daily Bugle is not only a newspaper, but a news TV station as well, one that promotes its own highly biased views. So basically the Fox News of the Marvel universe. I guess if you're an old school Spider-Man fan, you could just leave off the "C" and have it just stand for Daily Bugle. The sign above the main entrance wont be so easily modified however. There is also a peg between the first and second floor which when pushed pops out one of the windows on the first floor. The safe is only attached to a couple of jumper plates and has some jumper plates on top of it as well, so you can easily attach the Doom jet's claw to it and rip it out of the building as seen on the back of the box. There are also some SNOT bricks on the corners of the building that you can attach spiderwebs or Spidey himself onto for some wall-crawling and webslinging action. This is not so much a play feature as it is just a feature, but as I mentioned earlier, there is a fire escape on the left side of the building. This was a neat idea as it helps it feel like a building in New York City, but it is executed very poorly. There is no hole big enough for the minifigs to climb down through, so they would have to climb down the ladders from the outside which makes no sense. No wonder Spider-Man always needs to rescue people from burning buildings. There is one more play feature in the form of the dumpster. You can open the lid, put a minifig inside, and make them jump by hitting a tab in the back. Remember, this is before the introduction of super jumpers, but nevertheless it's a pretty strange place to launch minifigs out of. I guess even Super Heroes like to do some dumpster diving. You don't think this was funny? No? Well, me neither, but that's the type of humor that this show loves to use. Sigh. Anyway, let's get on to the ratings. Ratings Design: 2/5 - The set looks ok. Despite many inaccuracies, the DBC building and the jet somewhat resemble their on-screen counterparts and don't look too bad, but they definitely could be better. Build: 1/5 - A mostly unchallenging and repetitive build with an attrocious amount of stickers. Minifigs: 4/5 - Definitely the strongest point of the set. Some of the figs could be better, but four out of five of them are exclusive to this set. Doctor Doom is easily the best and probably the most desirable one - unless the Fant4stic movie portraits him so badly that nobody will be interested in him, but that's impossible. Playability: 4/5 - As you would expect from a playset, the playability is quite high, although I still feel like there could have been more. Parts: 3/5 - Not many rare parts. If you're looking for parts for building your own skyscraper with tan walls and lots of doors and windows though, this set is for you. Price: 3/5 - At 476 parts for $50, this set is a bit pricey, but it is somewhat justified by all the large window and wall pieces. Overall: 3/5 - This set is mediocre at best. Playsets are always a good choice for Spider-Man sets since they give Spidey something to swing from, but unfortunately they are rarely pulled off well. The jet is blocky, the building is bare-bones, and the price feels too high. The only reason to get this set are the four exclusive minifigs. This set was discontinued early this year, but if you still see it on clearance somewhere, go ahead and get one for the minifigs and parts, or buy multiples and use the parts to build a better DBC building. I hope you enjoyed this review. It is part of the Reviewers Academy's 7th Anniversary. We're not doing a big celebration this year due to other commitments, but look out for more reviews with the 7th Anniversary banner soon. Now, if you'll excuse me, I am off to see Fant4stic. I hope it's as fantastic as it promises to be! (2 hours later) I was wrong! I was horribly, horribly wrong!	positive
Yeah. I'm really hoping the concept art/Doom minifig joke is just that! I picked this set up on whim, mostly because a needed a building to add to a MOC, as a parts pack it's not a bad set at all.	positive

I'm glad you were joking about Doom. I'm not that big of a fanboy, but I had the need to correct you for some reason. With that said, I bought this set for the minifigures a few years ago.

Hello everyone! By now many excited LEGO Star Wars fans have started receiving their UCS Falcon. Some of us here enjoy writing reviews and sharing our thoughts. I mentioned to Yoda that I was planning on doing a review of this set but it would likely take me a few weeks (of 1-2 hours per night) to finish building the set. Yoda suggested that I do the review as I go so everyone could see the progress of the set. What a great idea! So, here is the first entry. Feel free to comment along the way. I will try to post photos and updates every night on the build then wrap up the review when I complete the set. If you have any specific questions or photo requests, please be sure to ask. UCS Millennium Falcon Reviewed by Dunamis Set 10179 5195 Pieces $499.95 from LEGO Shop at home The Box: Obviously, this is a box like no other. First of all, it comes in its own shipping carton. Inside of that, there is a standard LEGO carton. Finally, inside the LEGO carton, we have the actual Millennium Falcon box and a nice little letter thanking you for buying the biggest LEGO set ever. Shipping box (Naboo set provided for scale) LEGO Carton and letter LEGO Carton The Millennium Falcon box is really quite nice. There are lots of photos and it does a good job of ?selling? the set. There are 8 individual pieces of tape that keep the lid on the box. The limited first edition comes with a seal on the lower left corner. Millennium Falcon Box (Naboo set provided for scale) Lifting the lid straight up reveals one compartment of several bags on the right. On the left, we find a thin, square box (like a pizza box) that contains the official certificate of authenticity, two sticker sheets and one enormous manual! Under the pizza box, we find two more compartments each filled with several typical LEGO bags. The box weighs 24 pounds! Stickers Pizza Box Pieces in compartments Not quite sure what the little 30th anniversary sticker is for yet. The Certificate of Authenticity is on heavy paper and is suitable for framing. More to come tomorrow. It's late here.	positive

Tks for that comparison pic Dunamis ;-) OK the box is big !! I pictured it a tad smaller though !! I know what I don't like, its the fact that it has the regular Lego Star Wars logo on top with Vader. UCS sets should have a different iconography like they did in the past. Sure its a trivial detail but it adds to the fact of owning something special !! After all its the most expensive set ever as of now ;-) Happy building !!

So this leads me to believe that dimension-wise the UCS MF is more compact. Also, notice how in the content, the parts fit in just nice without additional spare space for anything else. Strange isn't it that when TLC is responsible for the shipping, we see optimum usage of box spaces. X-D imagine if all boxes were this efficient. $4.99 sets would be no bigger than a match box!

Great review so far! I am looking forward to additional posts! As for the number of pins - from the Peeron inventory for the set, there are over 400 technic pins of various lengths! (insert the "my fingers hurt from building" emoticon) Keep the pictures coming!	positive
Thanks for the review, and tons of pics! I've been wanting to pick this one up since I saw it. I thought the 4956 Creator House was nice, but this Model Town House is in a completely different league! I also like the alternate models that you can see in the catalogues.	positive
Sinner, thanks for this outstanding review! I am glad that I had read this review in advance, before making my purchase on this set earlier with my girlfriend. We built this set for a total of 3 hours, to complete this beauty, in about 2 hours ago. There are stars circling around my head at this very moment, when I post this reply. I must admit from the bottom of my heart, that this is an wonderful piece of house, that simply shows the beauty of it, with the European kind of houses, where there is a garage. Furthermore, there is a lovely blue car. I am seeing stars right now, in the middle of the night, and I must drop a thanks to you personally as well. Although it is empty from its interior unlike the 4996 Beach House, but this set has the majestic look which simply place a "Wow" factor in front of it upon completion. At the moment, we had plans for getting the second set next month, to build the other design as well. Hopefully, I will be able to share with you guys, all of my different Creators sets, with its alternate designs as well in the near future.	positive

Thanks for comments. I know about text, I'm trying to write more, but haven't succes in this yet. I thought about joining Reviewers Academy, but I'm not sure because I have only maimum 4(may be 5) hours each time when I can make review or something that needs some hours.	neutral
i actually bought this set last Monday as it was reduced to 14.99.....it actually not a bad little set considering the size and part count, has a decent array of functions. its a nice little set....the B model looks just as good so i might buy a second set, as you get the bucket left over and i need that bucket for another set.

i just got this today. It is amazing like my other two castle sets: the joust and the crossbow. I am currently starting to save for 2008 but for Christmas i think i want the Skeleton Carridge and the Naboo N-1 Fighter.	positive
Thanks for the excellent review! Unfortunately it only highlights how minimal the upgrades are (though they are nice). Definitively a pass for me. Let's hope LEGO does continue to make the more realistic winter village sets (versus Santa). I'm not opposed to a rehash, the post office could use some improvements for example, but this one is just a wee bit minimal.	negative
I bought it and I'm very happy with it.	positive
Cheers for putting up the review. Some nice improvements, but not enough for me to pick it up. The original set is good enough for me. Pity the poll has no option "Yes, but only in addition to new sets, not in stead of new sets". Edited by Withacee, 01 December 2015 - 09:38 AM.	neutral
Thanks for a nice review. I am building it as we speak, and I like it so far. Since I didn't have the old one, I can't complain.	positive
Thanks for the review. They definitely improved upon the original, but since I already own the original, I can't justify this set also, unfortunately. It seems to be the trend. But I'm sure there are a lot of first timers out there too that will snatch this up since it is a really lovely building. And the updates make it better for sure.	neutral
Thanks Oky for this fine review. I agreed with your sentiments on the unnecessary rants. I also owned the 2009 version and even though there are minor improvements. There must be a logical reason for its release again but is not entirely the same. I felt is an excellent opportunity for others to acquire this design especially after six years ago. As for myself, I will probably buy this if my spare funds allow me to own this set.	neutral
Thanks for the kind comments everyone! I like hearing your opinions on this set. Withacee, on 01 December 2015 - 09:37 AM, said: Pity the poll has no option "Yes, but only in addition to new sets, not in stead of new sets". I don't think that would be a realistic option as that would mean that they would have to spend twice the resources on this theme which I don't think they are ready to do, but if more people would like this option, I can add it to the poll. Joebot, on 01 December 2015 - 08:33 PM, said: After mocking people for holding a particular opinion, you then turn around and ask people to express their opinion?? No thanks. I guess I'll keep my opinions to myself. I certainly don't want to be labeled a "hater." I'm not mocking anyone. I just think that some people need to calm down a bit and that TLG is getting more hate than they deserve for this set, but that's just my opinion and you're welcome to disagree with it. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, including you and me. And yes, I would love to hear your thoughts on this matter because I would like to have a friendly discussion on this subject.	neutral
REVIEW - 42044 - DISPLAY TEAM JET INTRODUCTION The smallest of the 2016 sets, is the Display Team Jet. It doesn't seem to have lots of functionality, but maybe the landing gear is retractable. This set kind of reminds me to the 9394 - Jet Plane, although it's obviously a lot smaller. As you can read in my review of the 42052 - Heavy Lift Helicopter basically anything flying is +1 for me, so let's find out if this set also fits the bill. Note: All images can be clicked for hi-res versions. SET INFORMATION Number: 42044 Title: Display Team Jet Theme: Technic Released: 2016 Part Count: 113 Box Weight: 193 gr Box Dimensions: 15,4 cm x 13,8 cm x 5,9 cm Set Price (MSRP): € 9,99 Price per Part: € 0,088 Links: Brickset, Bricklink THE BOX Being a small set, it obviously comes in a small box. The Display Team Jet is an Aerobatics Jet, used in air shows. On the box it's flying rather high, but at least it's at a safe distance from the crowd. Front side shows the main model, together with a small section indicating you can use Digital Building instructions to build this model. BACK SIDE The back side shows the B-model, a Stunt Plane. And again a reference to the apps for Digital Building instructions. More on the Stunt Plane later. CONTENT OF THE BOX The box contains: 2 Instructions Booklets (A- and B-model) 1 Sticker Sheet 3 Technic Liftarms 2 Bags INSTRUCTION BOOKLETS Both the instructions for the A- and B-model are included in the box. STICKER SHEET A lot of stickers for such a small set. Apparently no panel is left untouched. LIFTARMS Three liftarms unsealed, nothing out of the ordinary for a small set. BAGS Two bags containing the rest of the parts. HIGHLIGHTED PARTS This section describes the new and/or otherwise interesting parts. YELLOW 5L AXLES The 5L Axle in Yellow has never been released before, so it's one of the new parts for this year. BLACK 7L FLEX AXLES For the layman this seems a common part, but the 7L Soft Axle actually has never been released in black before. Combined with the re-release of the 19L Soft Axle in black, this will open up lots of possibilities. For those of you thinking you've read this text before; you are right, the new Drag Racer contains these new 7L Flex Axles too. WHITE PANELS This small set comes with a whopping 10 panels. Great for the ones who like panels. Not so great if you think TLG is using too much panels lately. RUDDER This part, the Small Bionicle Wing, is the same as the one used in last year's 42033 - Record Breaker. PART LIST This set contains 113 parts, all listed below. THE BUILD This is the collection of parts, used to build the Jet. It sure looks like we are getting a landing gear. The build is fun, but pretty straightforward. There aren't any special or cool techniques used in this set. It almost took me more time to apply all the stickers than to build the actual model. FINISHED MODEL The finished Jet does look cool though. The white and yellow color scheme, combined with the stickers, work really well. I have seen people refer to the plane as being orange, but it's definitely yellow. Technic (or LEGO in general) tends to have some color variation when it comes to yellow. I do concur this is the warmer variant of yellow, but it's not orange. The back of the plane looks nice too, although I am not a big fan of the rudder part. It looks too detailed, compared to the other panels. It's not a big deal though, and maybe it's just me. PARTS LEFT Only three common parts left. FEATURES AND FUNCTIONS This set has a single feature and that is a retractable landing gear. It's operated by the black 12T Double Bevel Gear near the cockpit. In the following picture you can see the landing gear retracted. This image shows the landing gear when the plane is ready for landing. Hopefully the pilot will roll the plane before landing, but you probably know what I mean VIDEO Here's s short video demonstrating the Display Team Jet. B-MODEL This set also includes the building instructions for the B-model, a Stunt Plane. The building experience for the Stunt Plane is more or less the same as for the Jet. Well, what do you expect when both models are planes with a limited number of parts. For an alternative model the Stunt Plane looks fine. There's not a lot of functionality in this plane, but it's worth mentioning that the tail wheel allows the plane to roll on a flat surface. The plane also has working propellors. Both functions are demonstrated in the video. Unfortunately, the landing gear of the Stunt Plane is not retractable. PARTS LEFT A couple of extra leftover parts, but it's nice to see that most of the parts have been used in the B-model as well. Actually, there's probably an extra yellow Technic Smooth 1/2 Bush left. I just found it on my desk, but it could belong to one of the other sets. VIDEO Here's a video demonstrating the Stunt Plane. SUMMARY Two nice planes for 13 bucks, that's basically what you get. Both models look good and the set has some interesting new parts. Especially the 7L Flex Axle will be very popular. It comes with a decent collection of white panel, although they are very common nowadays. Both models have limited functionality, but each of them has at least one function to give the model some playability for kids, other than the swooshability that is. Okay, it might lack some proper functions, but I still think kids will love this set. I can see kids running around with one of the planes in their hands. All in all I think this set delivers what you'd expect. SCORE Let's see how this set flies! Remember that the grades are based on it being a small set. Obviously a set like this, cannot be compared with a Mercedes flagship. 8 DESIGN For a small set, the model looks very authentic. 7 BUILDING EXPERIENCE No surprises. 7 FEATURES Just the retractable landing gear. 8 PLAYABILITY It has swooshability, so I see kids running around with this model. 7 PARTS Lots of panels, if you are into that. 8 VALUE FOR MONEY Can't go wrong with these small sets. 7,5 FUN FOR KIDS More image can be found on my Flickr page. Thank you for reading. I hope you enjoyed it.	positive
While I can see kids enjoying this, I'm not sure I would buy. The flex axles are nice, and it is a decent number of white panels but I think I would get better return out of a larger parts set. Fantastic review though, and your pictures show off this tiny model better than the box art does.	negative
It says 5l in the parts list.	neutral
For 10 Euros very usefull parts. I like it as well as other 2016 sets. I like the gear retracting mechanism a lot. Very good set for good price. Thanx for good review. :) Max	positive
Good review, as always Jim When I first saw this set I thought that it would make a great parts pack for me, as that I have about 20 white pieces in my Technic collection (all from 42043) and this set has some really useful ones, all for a cheap price. Those 7L flex axles will be extremely useful in my current build I'm doing	positive

Fixed the video and fixed the stars in the voting. Thanks for paying attention guys	neutral
I just built the A model, and I rather like it. It is much bigger than it looks from the box - about 30 studs long. There is only one function - the landing gear - but it works very nicely. Apart from that, it's a very solid build, and achieves an elegant shape with an absolute minimum of parts. I don't usually get excited about small sets, but this one appeals to me. I like the feeling that every single piece has a purpose.	positive
Thats a cool little mod, two small nigles though, 1, your navigation lights are flipped on the main wings, 2, the panels on the tail i *think* were supposed to be the intakes for the jet engine, by using them to close up the tail you've turned it into a glider Cant wait untill i find one of these on shelves!	positive
REVIEW - 42046 - GETAWAY RACER INTRODUCTION Starting with the 42010 - Off-road Racer and 42011 - Race Car in 2013, TLG released two sets in the first half of each year, using a pullback motor. The pullback motor allows the model to be pulled back, followed by forward motion. Usually there's no apparent relation between the two set, other than the ability to combine them into an alternate build. This year there seems to some sort of Cops and Robbers scene going on. A Getaway Racer and a Police Interceptor. That can't be a coincidence. Makes you wonder who will be victorious, the good guys or the bad guys. Let's find out! Note: All images can be clicked for hi-res versions. SET INFORMATION Number: 42046 Title: Getaway Racer Theme: Technic Released: 2016 Part Count: 170 Box Weight: 302 gr Box Dimensions: 26,0 cm x 13,8 cm x 5,9 cm Set Price (MSRP): € 19,99 Price per Part: € 0,118 Links: Brickset, Bricklink THE BOX The box has the same dimensions as previous year's pullback motor sets. In the lower right corner there's a visual explanation of the pullback mechanism. The dark model with it's decals sure looks like a cool hot rod. CONTENT OF THE BOX The box contains: 1 Instructions Booklet 1 Sticker Sheet 2 Technic Liftarms 1 Pullback Motor 3 Bags INSTRUCTION BOOKLET Just a single booklet. Unfortunately no booklet for the alternate model. STICKER SHEET The sticker sheet contains a lot of cool stickers with flames and skulls etc. PULLBACK MOTOR AND LIFTARMS The pullback motor and two liftarms are found unbagged. BAGS A total of three bags containing the majority of the parts. HIGHLIGHTED PARTS This section describes the new and/or otherwise interesting parts. Actually, this set is the only set of 1H 2016 which doesn't use any new parts, not even parts in a new color. TIRES The Getaway Racer uses four low profile tires (Tire 37 x 22 ZR). RIMS The rims are Wheel 30.4mm D. x 20mm in Pearl Gold, found in 12 other sets. PANELS This set contains three #3 Panelsand three #4 Panels in black. PART LIST This set contains 171 parts, all listed below. THE BUILD This being a small model, I won't show any building steps. Let's skip right to the finished model. Below you can see the end result. In my opinion the model looks great. It's got that hot rod vibe going on and the stickers add darkness to the vibe. Slight problem with this set is that it really needs the stickers to finish the look. Otherwise it's quite dull, with black and dark grey liftarms and panels. The rear view shows the pullback motor connected directly to the rear axle. In this image you can also clearly see the exhaust pipes on the side, which are very well executed. The 3x3 Technic Discs with stickers, used in the rim, result in only seeing a part of the rim. This works very well with the golden rims. The bottom view shows the chassis of the car. Nothing really noteworthy, as you would expect from a pullback set. VIDEO The following video gives you an overview of the finished model. PARTS LEFT These six parts are left after building the model. Seems about right. FEATURES AND FUNCTIONS This being a pullback motor set, it only has a single feature. The video below demonstrates the acceleration of the vehicle. My girlfriend was kind enough to catch the model before it fell to the ground. Or did it hit something before it fell to the ground?! VIDEO This video shows the pullback functionality. B-MODEL The alternate model is a combined build with the Police Interceptor, which you can see on the back of the box. Unfortunately the instructions for the combined B-model are not included, so I didn't get a chance to build it. This would make for a fun challenge, building the B-model without the instructions. SUMMARY Pullback sets are not the most technically advanced models, so you can't expect any other functionality than hitting the walls in your house. However, I think they are very appealing to kids. The fact that this year's pullback sets form a duo adds to the fun. In my opinion TLG hit the nail on the head with the Getaway Racer and Police Interceptor. The Getaway Racer looks very badass, which is something you don't see every day in a Technic set. SCORE How do I grade the bad guy in this year's duo. 8 DESIGN It looks so cool, but it does need the stickers. 7 BUILDING EXPERIENCE Nothing out of the ordinary. 7 FEATURES Limited to the pullback-and-drive functionality. 7 PLAYABILITY Combined with the Police Interceptor, kids will love it. It does need it's Nemesys though. 7 PARTS Collection of common parts. Gold rims could be interesting. 8 VALUE FOR MONEY Pullback sets always deliver a certain value. 7,3 HIT IT! More image can be found on my Flickr page. Thank you for reading. I hope you enjoyed it.	positive
Jim great reviews but can I suggest you one thing? Take some pics before you apply the stickers....and some with the stickers on! It helps to have a comparison!	neutral
Jim, on 01 December 2015 - 09:34 AM, said: You are right. I came to the same conclusion when writing the review. I tell you it doesn't look that good without stickers, but I don't have a picture to prove it. To be honest; I compared it to the model posted in the 2016 topic a few days ago. I applied the stickers before building the model, so I wasn't able to make a proper comparison. I will keep it in mind for future reviews. Thanks for the suggestion. You're welcome! I'm not a huge fan of stickers, for 2 reasons: I do re-use all the parts normally...and also I believe a model should look great even without stickers, then obviously they can be a plus, but only afterwords! Anyway I'm enjoying the reviews as usual, and those pics Thanks for making them Jim!!	neutral

Great review with high quality pictures, well done!! I'm glad you took the time to do it properly. Cool that you have built both models. I agree with the mudguards. They sure look good on this model.	positive
Thanks for the thorough comments! I agree that the set has some limitations, both in construction and realism, but I think they're acceptable given the pricepoint and size. The antenna is definitely ludicrous - I really do suspect they had a surplus of the swords to use up! And yes, the way the steering knob is mounted is loose. I also noticed that the u-joints to the claw are not in the right spot like you mentioned, but didn't include it since it still works fine. That axle coming forward to the claw has a very long unsupported section that does bend a bit when you raise and lower the claw. It works, but is a bit of a cheat that I'm kinda surprised they let through. I just checked and the bucket from 8043 is a couple studs too wide for this set. I'm betting that was seriously considered, but it'd have meant scaling the whole thing up and that would have put it into a higher price point. Or they could have pulled the mold for the 8x14 bucket back out and remade it for this set... I really like the model you built! And that's interesting about the cabs being basically flush with the top but sticking out the side. In image searching as part of my research, I found both that style and ones like this, with the cab sticking up more (like the photo of the Caterpillar one in my review). I wonder if that's a US/European difference, or different types of mining, or what, because both styles definitely exist in the real world.	neutral

Lego 42045 Technic Hydroplane Racer Thanks to Lego and EuroBricks for making this review possible! This was supposed to be a preview-review, before the Dec 1 release date for the set, but it got stuck in customs or something and didn't arrive in time. Well, I'd rather do a good, late review than a rushed review, so here it is. Name: Hydroplane Racer Set Number: 42045 Pieces: 180 Price: $19.99 Minifigs: 0 Theme: Technic Year of Release: 2016 Links: Bricklink Brickset The Box Standard Technic box. Action photo, 2-in-1 logo, inset of functions. And the new "try our app" logo in the corner. The Box Back More standard stuff with the B-model and a larger app ad. The Contents 3 bags, two manuals (yes, despite all the ads for their instructions app, they included printed manuals for both the main and B models!), a BIG sticker sheet, and two loose black beams. The Interesting Parts There's a lot of panels in this set. Some are new colors (the blue curved panel) and the L-shaped blue panels are a new mold. I see them being used as mudguards on future sets (or maybe even this year; I haven't looked at the other 2016 Technic sets in detail yet). The hose, soft axle 7 long in black is new as well. The normal 7 axle in yellow is a new color too, and I have no idea why it's in this set. Both models use it in invisible places, so there's no reason other than making it easier to grab the right length axle to have it. I assume other sets this year are using it, but I'm not sure. The Manual And the dumbing-down continues. Now they have to show people to compare axle lengths to the 1:1 prints on the page that have always been there. But how does the 1:1 work on the app? Might have to look into that... (for the record... I pulled out my phone and tried to find the app in the Google store. Couldn't find it. So then I went to the Lego website shown on the page and it had a link to it. Turns out it wasn't showing up because it's tablet only, so Google wasn't showing it to me on my phone. I'll try again later with a tablet...) Starting the Build Two Technic standards. A bunch of pieces linked together to make a specific pattern of holes, and an engine block. Some Weirdness This felt very weird to me - making the crankshaft for the engine, they have you build it right to left. I don't know if it's because I'm a lefty or what, but it felt awkward. I need to look in some old manuals and see if it's always been this way... (nope! I randomly looked at 2013's set 42000 Racer, and it builds it left to right.) Assembling the Core Here's the core of the racer, upside down. The engine block, some gears at each end, and a couple boat studs for smooth gliding. And yes, they cheated and those are only attached on two studs instead of all 4. I'm always amazed at how Lego geometry keeps finding interesting ways that it works. Like here, with those boat studs. They fit perfectly into the bottom of the brick and against the beam. The Front End Up front we get a standard blue seat with a couple "hidden" wheels behind it. A boat doesn't typically have wheels, but these will drive the mechanisms of this model, so we'll let it slide. An odd part choice here though - in the very front there are two tan "axle pin without friction" parts holding that 3 long liftarm on. Why? There's no need in either model for the non-friction pin, and there's lots of the normal blue axle pins in the set. So why include these two different pins? And All Done! It looks like a huge jump here, but it's really not. The front and rear connect to each other, and then a bunch of big panels are added that make the model look WAY bigger. The stickers on this set really make it work. Without them it's pretty bland and boring, so I recommend using them. From the Rear At the back we have a fan to propel the boat. That's not so accurate. All the images I can find of real-life boats use props in the water. But since this is a non-floating model, we have to make some tweaks I guess. There also should be fins going down into the water for stability and hydroplaning, but again, had to drop that. Here's an example of a real boat: You can see they nailed the overall look quite well. The Underside For those that want to see the mechanicals, here's the underside of the model. Minifig Scale Technic? Nope, not quite. A fig will fit the seat, but sticks out of the cockpit and can't fit a helmet at all. So close... Starting the B Model Again with the engine block, but this time an opposing 4 instead of inline. An Odd Part It's rare for Lego to include parts specific to the B-model, so I was curious when I found this 2-axle with pin, a fairly new part. In the main model, it's used in a place that a normal 3 pin would have been fine, and it's the only one of these in the whole set, so it obviously must be needed in the B-model. Sure enough, there's an assembly here that needs it: The Front of the Boat More upside-down building. And that silver piston is basically only there as a spacer. It has no real function. (Yet.... it turns out later an axle goes into it, so it's a support for one end of the axle.) Adding the Wheels We keep building around the engine. This model uses the same wheel setup as the main model. Taking Shape The B-model instructions tell you to put the stickers on in case you haven't - they actually did a good job making the sticker work on either model. But the silver piston used as a cross-brace is a bit weird. It can spin, so that axle hole on the side ends up facing whatever way it wants. The Back End The flex axles are used here under the panels just for appearance and to support the exhausts at the right angle. Same fan propulsion as the main model, and just as wrong here :) Worse, the gearing is switched. In the main model, the pistons and fan spin pretty quickly as you push the boat across the floor. In this one, they turn very slowly. More Instruction Weirdness I'm always curious at how Lego decides to do instructions. Here's how the panels on one side of the boat are assembled. For the mirror image on the other side, they tell you to put all 3 pins into the short panel as step 1 (2 black and a blue), add the white piece as step 2, and then add teh second panel and stickers as step 3. Why two different ways? All Done Here's a similar angle as most of the official images. Looks ok. I noticed though how obvious the wheels are. The back of the box image is a lower angle that hides them more. And I like the mudguard panels as seats. Pretty clever. From the Side I'm not fond of the profile. It doesn't sit level like I think it should. The wheels are a stud too low sticking out of the bottom. The Underside Like most B-models, there are compromises. There's pins and axles sticking out, but that's what you do when faced with a limited piece selection. Minifig Scale Yet? Nope, not quite. A bit too big this time. I think the driver is supposed to sit in the seat with knees over the front of the guard (where the grey pin is). So the minifig is way too small. Spare Pieces Very few leftovers in this B-model. The Conclusion So, what's my conclusion on this model? The B-model is fairly meh, and too similar to the main model. However, I LOVE the hydroplane racer itself. It looks great and is very swooshable. For the price, it's surprisingly large thanks to the big panels on the sides, Yes, this is one set that really needs the stickers to look good, but they look great and are well worth putting on. The Ratings Value: 9/10 - Close to 10 cents a piece, and a fairly large model for the price. Design: 9/10 - Looks great other than the tiny fan on the back. Minifigs: n/a - I was tempted to give a score since a minifig almost fits, but that'd be cheating. Playability: 8/10 - Not much functionality other than the engine and fan spinning, but very swooshable and sturdy enough to be played with. Parts: 9/10 - A bunch of panels (including some new ones), just about every kind of Technic pin, and quite a few thin liftarms . Overall: 9/10 - The set is a solid winner, as long as your satisfied with the main model.	positive
Thanks for a great review! Too bad there is only one blue curved panel in this set. My opinion on the frictionless axlepins is that the flex axle might be easier to stick in them than in regular/blue axlepins... Didn't actually try it though :-) Edited by MajklSpajkl, 05 December 2015 - 11:46 PM.	negative
Thank you for the review. I have this one in my pile to build. I wish there was more of the curved blue panels though.	negative
Very timely review Jim. My wife has just surprised me by giving me this set a few days ago and I have just built the A model two days ago and B model yesterday. I agree with all that you wrote above. I don't have Tumbler tires but I have 9398 tires. Driving is smooth but steering + suspension will be bad as you said due to negative caster and tires hitting the chassis. Anyway, tonight I will destroy the B model and rebuilt this http://www.busterhau...8-c-model.html.	positive
Great review. I bought this model several weeks ago and the box has sat on my shelf, so I think after this I will be digging it out for Christmas and I expect my son will have a lot of fun with it when it's built. PS. these Tumbler tyres look amazing on this model, and indeed amazing in their own right!	positive
Until I saw photos of this set I wasn't convinced I wanted it. Now after seeing all the combinations (A+B and tumbler tires!) I am definitely buying two copies. I need orange parts and black treads anyway. The only problem I have with this is that it's going to encourage me to buy many copies of the drag racer just to get enough wheels to play with.	positive

Nequmodiva, on 14 December 2015 - 09:48 PM, said: You switched the sides for the panel with the unsymmetrical sticker. Otherwise you would see that the cut off part is where there's a beam in front of the panel. That's probably done because the beam could possibly damage the sticker, either while building or while placed against it for a long time. Or it's simply omitted because it wouldn't be (completely) visible This is probably the only reason (for TLG choosing to provide an asymmetrical sticker), but looking at the sticker sheet, I also believe they simply didn't have the space on the sheet for a symmetrical solution. A symmetrically stickered panel could have more (re)uses for the MOC'ers. On Lego's own B-model, they handily camouflage it with the exhausts	neutral
Thank you Jim, nice Review It´s a great set: A lot unique parts and not just pins, axles and beams. I bough it to bring me back to Lego from my DA (10 years)... PS. Soon I will post an alternative model	positive
You wrote a very accurate review of this set, Jim. It's a pretty good model (with some obvious problems) but it's an even better parts pack. Your pictures with the Tumbler tires are great.

REVIEW - 42001 - MINI OFF-ROADER INTRODUCTION Technic Mini models are sometimes regarded as models not worth buying. I don't agree with this opinion. Whether it's a special part or innovative building technique, almost every Mini model has something that makes the set worthwhile. This time I will be reviewing the 42001 Mini Off-Roader. This model is not a smaller version of an existing model, so there's no real comparison with a bigger brother, or sister if you will. Nor does the model resemble a real life brand or vehicle, so it is what it is, a Mini Off-Roader. Note: All images can be clicked for hi-res versions. SET INFORMATION Number: 42001 Title: Mini Off-Roader Theme: Technic Released: 2013 Part Count: 100 Box Weight: 165 gr Box Dimensions: 15,5 x 14,0 x 4,2 cm Set Price (MSRP): 9.99 EUR DE / 7.99 GBP / 12.99 USD Price per Part: DE 0.100 EUR / UK 0.080 GBP / USA 0.130 USD Links: Brickset, Bricklink THE BOX The box measures 15,5 x 14,0 x 4,2 cm which is obviously not very big. The weight of the box is approximately 165 grams. FRONTSIDE The front of the box shows a though four wheel drive off-roader challenging a fierce rocky mountain trail...now does it?! What the box actually shows is Mini Off-Roader challenging a small foam rock formation, much like rocks used in Star Trek The Original Series, yet smaller The box also states that this model is for the age of 7 till 14. More importantly, the 2-models in-1 logo is clearly visible, which means this set can be used to build two different models. BACKSIDE The backside shows a picture of the alternate model and a smaller version of the original model. The conversion arrow and the 2-in-1 are printed to clarify that the main model can be converted into a secondary model. SIDES One of the sides shows the 2-in-1 logo and a picture of the main model. Another side shows a picture of one of the wheels in actual size and again, a picture of the main model. CONTENTS OF THE BOX The box contains: 2 Booklets 2 Bags 4 Tires BOOKLETS This set contains two booklets which is not very common for a set this size. Both models share the same chassis, which is why the build has been divided over two booklets, one for the chassis (8 pages with 10 steps) and one for the bodywork (34 pages with 23 steps for the main model and 20 steps for the alternate model). BAGS The box contains only 2 bags which is to be expected from a set consisting of 100 parts. One of the bags is filled with liftarms, panels, rims and two elastic bands. The other bags contains all the other parts, like pins, axles, connectors, etc. Opening the bags results in the following collection of parts, with the exception of the tires. No abundant number parts that will add real value to your collection. Nevertheless, there are some interesting orange parts and elastic bands. TIRES The tires are provided seperately (i.e. not contained in the bags). From the picture you can see that these tires have a front and a back side, so you should pay attention when fitting them to the rims, which have two different sides as well. HIGHLIGHTED PARTS This section describes the unique and/or highlighted parts. VERY SMALL SMOOTH TECHNIC PANEL (#21 AND #22) These two small Technic were new at the time of release and this set was only one of two sets containing them in orange. The other set is the 42007 - Moto Cross Bike. At the moment of writing there's a third set containing these parts, the Black Champion Racer. Side A Side B SMALL RUBBER BAND I was under the impression that these White Rubber Bands weren't that common, but it seems that these bands are as common as dirt. But hey, you can't have enough rubber bands! THIN LIFTARM 1x5 WITH AXLE HOLES Like the panels, these Liftarms were also new at the time of release. Looking at the the frequent usage in other sets, this part has proven to be a most useful mammal. THIN LIFTARM 1x3 Not a very rare piece per se, but if you are not into Bionicle, this liftarm part can be hard to find. Your other option would be to buy the 9390 - Mini Tow Truck, or the 8305 - Dual Bikes from a while ago (2000). LONG PIN WITH CENTER PIN HOLE This relatively new kid on the block is currently used in many Technic and non-Technic sets and has well proven it's worth. AXLE PIN CONNECTOR HUB WITH 2 AXLES Like the previous part this newish part is also quite helpful in certain situations. PART LIST Here's the complete list for all 100 parts. BUILDING EXPERIENCE The build starts with the chassis of the Off-Roader. After connecting some liftarms two elastic bands, one on each side, are attached to the towball pins. This is all there is to the suspension, plain and simple. The two elastic bands contract the L-shaped liftarms, which results in the long ends swiveling downwards. The video below demonstrates the suspension. The simplicity doesn't do it justice, because it works like a charm. The suspension is very smooth with the right amount of stretch and resistance. This great working suspension adds a lot of value to this set. To quote John Hurt in the movie Contact: "Why build one when you can have two at twice the price?". I have purchased two sets so we can simultaneously see both models and make a proper comparison. Below you can see two identical chassis which will be used for both versions of the build. At this stage we have arrived at the end of the first booklet, which only took about ten minutes. Not surprising, since the first booklet only has 10 building steps. Progressing to the second booklet, you need to choose between building the main and alternative model. That's a choice I don't need to make for this review, so let's start with the main model. MAIN MODEL When building the bodywork there's a rather peculiar building technique, which you wouldn't expect in an official LEGO set. The Axle and Pin Connector Hub with 2 Axles only protrudes halfway into the Double Bent Liftarm. The Thin 1x4 Liftarm which is added in one of the following steps makes sure the hubs stay perfectly in place, but I was still surprised to see this technique. The finished bodywork for the main model looks like....uhh...well.....I don't know exactly. It doesn't bear any resemblance to a real life model, which makes it hard to judge. One thing's for sure; it's not the best looking Technic Mini Model. The bodywork can be attached to the chassis by using a 7L axle and two bushes, one on each side of the chassis. ALTERNATE MODEL Unfortunately the alternate model doesn't look much better than the main model. It's even a stud less wide, while you would like to see slightly more body, matching the size of the tires and chassis. Attached to the chassis the body is even more out of proportion. It's not really ugly and the color scheme is great (obviously this goes for the main model as well), but the body simply doesn't match the chassis. I can only imagine that this model is supposed to have a chibi look, much like the Microfighter Star Wars models. COMPARISON The following section shows a selection of images from different angles to compare the main and secondary model. The main model has a bit more volume, while the alternate model has a more sporty look. FRONT VIEW The main model has headlights which are attached at a higher point, while the alternate model has headlights which are placed more closely next to each other. REAR VIEW A slightly different setup in both models, where the main model again has higher placed rear lights. SIDE VIEW The side view shows that the panels are used differently in both models. The main models uses them as doors, while the alternate model uses them as engine cover (bonnet). TOP VIEW The top view reveals that the main model might have room for a minifig PARTS LEFT The left image shows the parts which are left after building the main model, while the second image shows the parts left after building the alternate model. As you can see, the main model uses slightly more parts than the alternate model. FEATURES Besides the awesome suspension, which we already have discussed, there aren't a lot of features in this set. There's actually a single feature, which is only present in the main model....opening doors! Wow, impressive! Well, maybe we can't expect too much functionality in such a small model. SUMMARY The Off-Roader is a fun model which is fairly easy to build. The suspension is simple, yet very effective. The model could do better in the design department, but the suspension offers great playability and that is what this set is all about. The orange parts are not very common so they are an added bonus. All things considered this set is definitely worth the few bucks you need to spend on it. PROS Great suspension Fun to play with Some (semi) rare orange parts Great color scheme CONS No resemblence to an actual off-roader Not the best looking model SCORE Below are my scores based on different categories. 6 DESIGN Not the best looking Technic model. 7 BUILDING EXPERIENCE The suspension makes it fun to build. 7 FEATURES The suspension makes up for the lack of functionality. 8 PLAYABILITY The model has Car-Swooshability. 7 PARTS Some interesting orange parts. 8 VALUE FOR MONEY Great present for the younger builders. 7,1 ELASTIC Hope you enjoyed it! Thanks for reading and please rate this set at the top of this topic!	positive
Once again, excellent review Jim! Than you for not skipping this small but pretty great set. I also got two of this and I have to say, I really admire the nifty suspension. Building a third bodywork for the same suspension system is still on my backlog.	positive

Here is the review...for Broadside's Brig 6259! A set from 1991, with a handsome count of 64 pieces, 3 figures, and a sale price of $8.75! The building(and parrot): We'll start off with the front. It looks like a good solid building to hold those scurvy dogs! We yonder over to the left side: And see a nice open back: And yonder to the plain right side: Back to the left, we find the corner, with a nice area to rest your tired soldiers! We see the platform in the corner, a lovely place for soldiers to stand on! It's a bit...skimpy, so watch your step! The middle is blocked by some stones, assuring security! But still open enough to stand in! The jail is cramped, and fits only TWO people, but we only need one prisoner in this set :-) ! Moving up is the watch tower, a place for your soldier stand and stand watch or for silly parots to sit on! Here's the front middle part, again those stones blocking the way! Figures and Accesories: We have a delightful number of a soldier, a sailor, and a scurvy pirate! A lovely parot! And a generous assortment of weapons! That concludes our review. Overall: It's a fantastic little set, and great for army and supplies and bricks gathering! I can't find any faults with this set, it's just the neatest little thing you've seen in a port *wub* Highly recomended *y* . And to end our review: A comic!	positive
A fine little set with 64 pieces and 3 figures for under $10. May have seemed a bit steep in 1991, but I wouldn't know, I'd passed into my dark ages already, so alas, I haven't a copy of this set. Looking at the parts list, I could build one out of my current inventory though. Issued today for $10, I'd buy no less than 14 of them, even though it does lack the obligatory rowboat for the pirate to make his escape in. Very nice review and comic, thanks for doing them! *y* Edited by imperialshadows, 20 October 2007 - 06:10 AM.	positive

During the annual Thanksgiving Road Trip to the relatives, I stopped by the TRU in Portland, OR. Lo and behold, the new Mars Mission sets! Obviously, I bought them. ;-) The box: Not much to say. Standard box art for MM sets, nothing new. The parts: Some good parts here. Even if you don't like the set (Which I highly doubt after I've had my say :-P ), it's a decent parts pack. I noticed that some old parts have been renewed. I know the wheel has been used in the '07 sets, but the cockpit and hitch I haven't seen in a while. The VLDSS (Very large DSS). Grr. New part. At least, I think it is. Someone slap me if it isn't. *wacko* The figs. I know I've seen that head before, but I have no idea where. Does anyone know? I was hoping that the aliens would have new arms, at least. I was sadly mistaken... On the upside, I finally discovered that they glow in the dark. :-$ The alien has a jetpack. If that's not the silliest thing I've ever seen, I don't know what is. The build. Simple build. A block. So easy a caveman cou- oh, never mind. Geico's used that one enough. Then, we have this jobber right here. Not sure what it is, but it looks like some crystal scanning device. It's starting to look pretty nice. It almost looks practical. The cockpit is suffering from a bad dose of over-stickering. On the upside, we have a new piece there to hold the cockpit on. Part 1 complete. It has a nice little radio antenna, which is ruined by the use of a random missile that looks like it's going to shoot the antenna before it shoots the alien. Still, I never say no to a good missile I can use for something else. The trailer: Fairly simple, but it works. It features stabilizing arms, a handheld saw, and an extremely random mini-bot who's purpose escapes me. The Whole Meal Deal- Erm, general pics. Overall, I thought this was a good set. In fact, it reminds me of this:	positive
Cool review, thanks!! :-D I personally think the minirobot is awesome, and (dare I say) cute! This was described on Amazon to be a mobile lab, I'm not seeing that. I do however see a crystal hauling vehicle. *sweet* Pretty cool, not as bad as previous sets. ~Peace	positive

Thanks for that very good review, Mr. Mandalorian! *y* I think that this is a plain beautiful set, oh how I wish that TLC would?ve taken that direction from the beginning.... :'-) The design is much more practicable, with fewer non-system parts and technic beams with(!) studs.... this makes everything much more easier to MOD and a lot more useful, at least IMO. *y* So it?s for sure not very hard to make the (wonderful enclosed) cockpit one brick higher, and even that little Alien Ship looks decent and nice.... X-O And the fighter looks sleek and elegant too, in both modes! That?s just very cool, compliments, TLC. Now all we need?re aliens with moving arms and here we go, Classic Space on forever! X-D	positive
Thanks for a very thorough review. I might think about getting this. I really like the mini alien fighter, and the transformation idea is always a welcome one. Both modes look pretty good, despite the some of the odd coloured bricks (which I'd MOD out). You know what it reminds me of? Some of the futuristic designs in the Gerry Anderson series.	positive

The one thing you'd have to make sure of, though, is that it was fairly light and the wheel base had a fairly large surface area (actually, that's two things), so as to make sure it didn't dig into the soil. If that happened, transformation would be harder as the wheels would dig into the ground and drag through the soil. Then it'd nose dive.	neutral
Great review Mr Mandalorian! *y* I'm not a fan of MM and don't like this set much, but it has some neat features. But the only way I can see it transforming is by racing off a cliff and swinging its wings out *wacko* To the Brickmobile! >:-)	negative

You mean the ungainly way in which the wheels have to turn in order to change from tank mode? I think you are right as well. On the other hand. If it has anti-grav, then it doesn't really make sense to have wheels as well. I mean. If the power goes, then the wheels can't turn anyways!	negative

Although they used something similar to the light and sound globe peice, which is kind of neat. I dont think I'll be buying this but your review almost talked me into it.	neutral
Sinner, on Nov 28 2007, 12:53 AM, said: How well do the tracks work? The last tank was too light and it didn't roll well at all. :-/ It's similar in weight but I didn't have to press down so hard to get the treads to move, barely at all, really. I think the Mobile Defense Tank, although a better overall design, suffered from the odd angle of the treads and that was mostly why the treads didn't turn well. Plus, what was with those weird exhaust pipes?? Anyway, they are both cool tanks although I like the Mobile Defense Tank better... :-)	neutral
Fantastic! Great review, thanks a bunch for all the pics, they've shown me how (in my opinion) bad this set is. :-P I just expected it to be more bricky rather than technicy. Oh well, I wasn't planning on buying it anyway. X-D I noticed you spelt mini-figs mini-fgis in the first paragraph, in case you wanted to know. X-D So again, thanks, and I'm looking forward to seeing the rest of them, and the comics! ~Peace	negative
Thanks for this great review Hinckley! :'-) I know you're loving this attention! X-D :-P I actually like this set, and like it a lot more now that I've seen this review. I'll most likely get, mostly for the figs and parts. I reckon it would look a lot better alongside the rest of the 2008 EF mechs. Anyway, thanks for the review! To the Brickmobile! >:-)	positive
Thanks for that good review, Hinckley. *y* A really interesting set and a turning point for LEGO. Minirobots instead of shooting crap, pretty cool. I hope the kids?ll like it too. For the design, I love that asymmetrical look of the front part and the sleek guns of the flyer. It?s smart that the gatling gun moves along with the tank, too. The set idea with two vehicles in one?s not new, but very play- able and the treads/big wheel design?s cool. I don?t like the use of studless technic beams, but well, they do their job I guess. And Keiken?s cockpit should be easy to improve....	positive

I like the new skellies because of their posability (I'm a big supporter & user of stop-motion) and I think there's nothing wrong with stickers. I mean seriously, why does everybody hate stickers so much??? :-| Sure, they are a pain in the megablocks to put on and, sure, they come off after a while and are never usable again, but hey, you don't have to put them on, even better, you can save them (like I do) and use them for your mocs! Could somebody tell me, please? I'm just curious. However, as I said, nice set! I might even get one. Gotta love that marion with the carot torch X-D and that arc is neat too! By the way, are all parts on it golden? Some more pics on it would be nice as soon as your camera is recharged! ;-) Thanks. Peace Out! As far as I know, those insignias on the arc are in the movie, too. But I don?t remember if they actually were on the arc or somewhere else. There are a lot of Star Wars references in all the Indiana Jones movies. Looking at your name, you might find it funny to know that the Asian club of Lao Che in Temple of Doom is called "Club Obi-Wan" The plane in the first Indy has the callsign CPO, which I just found out the other day :)	neutral
My 2nd review (what a veteran) ... again, found this set via a shop assistant, in my local TRU (Portsmouth, UK) this evening. Comes in at ?44.99, which, is pretty steep, but, you get quite a bit for your money. Front of the Box : Back of the Box : Back of the Box Closeup : Contents : It was a nice surprise to get numbered bags ... not had a large set with numbered bags for quite a while, at least in none of the sets I've bought recently! Didn't take a close up of the stickers, but I was quite disappointed that the curved pieces had stickers ... if they could print the ATT curved pieces, why not these? Minifigs : Oh ... and there's a nice backprint on the Pilot figure : Now, the build was pretty good ... you build the plane first (after the minifigures). Quite an interesting build in a way, becayse for a while you think the back is the front ... and then you realise, heh! Now ... I've not seen the film in a while, but I don't recall a guy flying a plane with a fishing rod ... don't flame me if this is what happens, see earlier point regards not seeing the film in ages!! :-P After that, you build the temple in stages, starting with the entrance first, and then the holey floor section with the spears. These spears are just loosely placed into technic holed bricks. Quite easy to make em flick out but they can go anywhere! hehe Entrance : Holey Floor & Spears : These two parts are hinged and on an angle to each other and the gap makes for a handy bottomless pit, complete with pole for Indy to swing over with his whip. After that, you create the door and the ratchet mechanism to keep it raised. After that, you add the runners for the ball and the swinging knives trap. Swords Trap - Before : After : Finally, you build the statue that holds the efigy. Nice bit of construction here, especially the way that everything falls over once the efigy is removed. Do be careful when putting the curved bits on though ... it appears one of the edges on mine has slightly bent when putting it on ... nowt noticable though. Temple : Preparing to steal : Run!! You can see that the temple has toppled and debris has fallen all around ... And then, as he goes through the door, the door falls (he gets his hat) and then the rock ball starts a rolling! Ruuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuun!! The stickers were a pain though ... there's no room for a border around the sticker here! Beware!! After all that is done, you join all the pieces together and it makes more a really good playset. Plenty of opportunity for recreating scenes here! Idol Closeup : Total Set : Spares : Yet more spare stickers??! (sorry, i've already put the spares in my box of bits!) Overall, 8 out of 10 ... lots of play value and a pretty nice build. Too many stickers though ... and defo poor arms for the skeletons! Edited by imperialshadows, 01 June 2008 - 12:18 PM.	positive

As Brikbitz said on his site in the 7732 postal plane review... Quote You can see the traditional airplane window piece, but the bad news is they've changed the window pane. It's the new flat piece used in 4996 Beach House, it just doesn't work as well. Without the original bevelled edge it doesn't seal the window and there is small noticable gap around the edge. Not a major problem but it might get a bit draughty inside and certainly no high altitude flying. I was wondering if it is the old or new type.

Okie guys and gals, here s time for some droid exploration with my review of set 7670. As a general statement I have to say its really a neat set that is not that expensive for what it holds. 1) Box art Like always I will start with pics of the box art. BTW, notice anything guys ? No bloody crappy DSS. Yes, finally a set without stickers and that feels great :-D 2) The Mfs Nothing really spectacular there. The only novelty lies within the inclusion of the new Commander (yellow torso) BD. Apart from that, there are 2 BDs and unfortunately yet another SBD (I like those but I have a huge amount of them, and I would rather had something different). You have 3 short blasters and a couple of extra parts. 3) The Spider Droid I think it?s a pretty cool little buggar. It?s a rather simple yet classic construction I think. It has sweet parts such as the BD body in dark bley. It really has a spider feel unlike the previous Ep3 one. 4) The Hailfire Droid This baby represents the ?pi?ce de resistance? of this set. I truly love it !! Sure it?s a bit under scale but I don?t really mind that. Its conception is superb even if I totally dislike assembling those technic treads (especially 80 of those small things). The ellipse of the treads is well balanced and that trans disc is a brilliant idea. The great thing is those new flick fire missiles: they don?t fall unlike the other ones and they do look good on this baby. Also you can put the wheels together and the missiles to gain some shelf space (easy storage ON :-D ) In conclusion those druids re really sweet and are perfect target practice for the upcoming RGS hehe !! I hope you enjoyed that review and do not hesitate to comment and ask pic requests if any ;-) *yoda*	positive

The new 7670 commander has a torso made of all yellow plastic, whereas the 2000 battle droid commander had a tan torso with yellow printings, and a tan head with yellow printings. So, while we have had a BD commander before, the 7670 commander is "new."	neutral
Nice review, thanks. It still seems overpriced to me though. Also, the box shows the droid torsos that are used for "feet" on the Spider Droid as being light bley, yet they are clearly dark bley. *wacko* TK	negative

Ah I finally got the 2 City sets I really wanted !! I am so happy that Lego went postal on us :-P . Since they are rather small I shall do a mix review of these 2 sweet sweet sets. 1) Mail Van (7731) Like always I?ll start with shots of the box art and bloody DSS. Now here are the extras of that set: I really love the new torso of the postal worker. My huge grip lies on the mail box: that mail logo is a freaking sticker !! For that part I was so expecting a printed part. That is really really bad !! Apart from that the design is pretty cool. The van is quite simple but I think its pretty cute. I love the fact that the rear is a window. 2) Air Mail (7732) Like always I?ll start with shots of the box art and bloody DSS. The extras are OK: another great postal worker. You also have yet another red trolley with a package that is a bloody sticker yet again !! G TLC should have more printed parts !! That plane for me is a classic thing of beauty !! Really is consistent with the fantastic planes of the 80?s. That?s the kind of lanes TLC should produce instead of those huge Playmo planes. Actually I am happy that TLC released that one ? for once its not a bloody airline exclusive promo set !! Here are general pics. I love the engines of the plane: simple yet superb. Also the top hatch opens to insert mail and packages. The front control panel is a printed part !! I love the classic double train windows and here is a poc of the undeneath of the set. In conclusion I truly love these small sets: they are the perfect size (4 wide car yeay !!) and the colour pattern is amazing as well. I hope you enjoyed that review and do not hesitate to comment and ask pic requests if any ;-) *yoda*	positive
I haven't spotted these in the US yet. I'm looking forward to finding them. Overall, the 2008 line-up is a excellent and it's going to be difficult for me to decide which themes/sets to pursue. There's a lot to choose from.	positive
Very nice, cheers Yoda! I'll definitely be getting the post van, not sure about the plane though. Both are awesome, but I think I have enough planes... Can you tell me though, the wheels on the van, are they rubber or plastic? They look a bit tacky...	positive
Aww man, is TLC really getting too cheap for printed parts? Shame on you TLC!! Despite those stickers these are two really neat sets. Especially the airplane. Classic *wub* Reminds me of that little plane my dad bought in an airplane. Not sure what's the set nr..

And what about getting them out? You have to flip the plane upside down? :-| Weak. They should have had a hinged rear end or a hatch on the side. Yes, this is the LEGO charming! No stairs in buildings, cars with just one minifig, all those things that make LEGO what it is... Thanks Yoda for your review! Those posts sets will be mine, but I will wait to find them in my supermarket, even if I have to wait 2 or 3 months, I know that I will save some money, so I will buy more LEGO :-D There are simple designed sets, but we don't need more: two nice litle sets that are not oversized and too expensive.	positive
TheBrickster, on Jan 5 2008, 10:12 AM, said: I wasn't real fond of the postal truck at first. It's so different than those in the US. good point B... this design is just too foreign to my eyes for me to enjoy... i don't like either of these sets, very disapointing - the postal theme has so much potential. i don't really like the torsos either - too plain/cheap as kanal suggested. and i will agree that the wheels on the van look cheap. i was sooooo impressed with city 2007, this is a real let down. though, i am happy to see a small set with a postal box. so, even though, all that aside, i'll probably buy 6 of the van - just for the yellow mudgards, postal box and stickers to populate my city. and i think this set will provide some excellent piece to MOC a yellow civillian convertable with *sweet* - BM	neutral
I'm glad to see the mail van has the doors that used to be on the older cargo containers. I had given up on those older ones, but now that they're still out there, I may invest in the older cargo system instead of the new 6-wide ones. Both sets are good enough, I'll get both. I'm hoping for a postal building too, even though I have the smaller of the old post offices. A nice big modern one would be great. I'm not too hung up about the design of the plane; I've got the neat old cargo plane with the tail that swings open (one of the best plane sets) for big packages. The truck is goofy looking, but if I get sick of looking at it I can rebuild it into a classic looking one. Great review by the way, the pictures are some of the better one I've seen in a review recently.	neutral
Thanks *yoda* for the great reviews. I love the airplane, it's really cute. The van needed to grow on me though but you did the trick. I don't like the wheels of the van. They will need replacing. And wouldn't everything have been better if they were completely red? Dr. Brick	neutral

Well today i finally got my hands on set 7038, now since the moment i first saw pics of this set i knew it was for me. So lets start with the new troll helmet and torso, these are both great. This troll really stands out as a leader when next to the usual trolls in the dwarf mining set: Ok so here's a few shots of the front of the set: Now one thing i really like about this set is the way that lego have placed the back wheels higher than the front. This allows the set to really appear to being pulled: Here we have a shot at the missiles on the wagon, these are better than some around i have to say. If you look just behind the bottom missile you will see a simple firing device, simply push it down and then let it go to see those missiles fire: The troll flag is moved behind the missiles for firing: One thing that does bother me about this set is the lack of anything on the rear, ok it's easy to fix with a little moc'ing so it's not the end of the world but i would of liked something placed there: Now lets move on to the Crownie's wagon, this is simple yet good for holding weapons: As for the Crown knights themselves, well there the ones from the impulse sets which is great IMO: Here's a few quick shots of the 2 larger trolls we have so far, i prefer the sand green one. What about you? Well that's the end for now, requests for pics and comments are welcome. Overall i rate this set as a must for anyone who's a fantasy castle fan, i know i'll be getting more of this set...... As for the new wagon well it's joined up with the other trolls: I do hope the impules crownies i bought today can handle them, oh and yes i did change the knights heads X-D : Fantasy war on!! *vader*	positive
seems like a good set should i get it? BTW how did you get you hands on this?	neutral
Looks like an ace set :-$ I may get this just for the sand green troll, even if I'm not a great castle fan, I do want one of them things! *wub* I also love the goblin's new metal flaked helmet, and the same style with the wheels. They look very nice. The chicken leg fishing pole is always fun too :-$	positive

Thank you for the review, vader! That set looks worth buying! 8-? i think you gave me a good reason to buy it... ;-)	positive
A Troll driven by a turkey leg, what a wonderful little detail!!! :-D :-D Thanks for the review Vader. Very clever, using a flag to hide that crazy firing device. I find it rather odd they used blue pins for this. Black or gray would've been alot more discrete. About the big trolls, I think using different colours is good. I don't think a troll force would be very organized, so different colours would make the effect complete *y* . As for your troops, looks quite fearsome! Definitely compared to my pathetic number of soldiers.. :-$ A nice set, but I would rather get the Attack on Tower though.. no matter about the price difference.	negative

Lego City Truck & Forklift Set # 7733 Pieces: 343 Price: $24.99 (USD) Store of Purchase: Toys R'Us Release Date: January 2008 After discussion of the mysterious yellow cargo contained in this new City transport set and a visit to my local TRU, I purchased this set. I was immediately pleased with the price/piece which I think is pretty reasonable (343 pieces for $25). Starting with the box, great City artwork boasting "Special Edition": Tha backside of the box (no alternate models comes as no surprise): The dreaded decals (I was looking for the skull and bones for radioactive, but no such luck): My favorite part of the set, a very clever forklift: Side view: And the backside: What I like about the forklift is the bars across the top giving the vehicle a "real-life" design. The double wheels in the front with two pieces that can hold the wheels also adds to a clever design: I like the figs (although not much new - perhaps I'll make the driver into a werewolf later): The set includes three cargo pallets, the first some sort of fuel with gauge: The 2nd, two Indy containers, and a square 2x4 brick (I have not put the decals on yet): And the mysterious yellow cargo. Your guess is as good as mine :-$ . On to the truck, the front section: The front grill: Another angle: The back: I like the opening mechanism that is very simple, but works well. Also is the large plate tile piece inside. I like this because the entire interior has no studs: And the trailer section of the truck: Orange and yellow tail lights: And the rear trailer open: The complete set: Summary: This is a neat set that reminds me a bit of classic Lego City (but larger). It is very playable and has a lot of accessories adding to the value. The build was very simple, and enjoyable (took me about an hour). It is a great addition to a number of City sets including the Cargo Ship, Container Stacker, the World City Cargo Train, and the new Cargo Plane. As I mentioned previously, I have not yet put on the decals that I'm sure will really add to the overall look of the set. The forklift is awesome and I like the cargo containers. The truck could have benefited from a few additional details (chrome smokers, and an undercarriage box that really opens). Considering everything, I would buy this set again. Hope you enjoy and perhaps this mysterious cargo will make its way into a Brickster Mystery. *y*	positive

Why do you think they'de pick this one? Good question. Maybe it's merely a gimick to help push the city sets with all the other competing themes. The cement mixer is a special edition as well.	neutral
this set looks pretty good to me, It is six wide isn't it? That is nice for a truck like this	positive
Nice review, your camera is much better now. I look forward to more of your reviews :-) I just went to Toyworld today and got a wizard and 4 knights :-) And on top of that, they were having a 20% off sale *sweet* I might go back and get some more tommorrow. The wizard is pretty good, and comes with some good parts (owl, beard, legs, hat, round table, crystal ball..). It would be nicer if he had a torso with printing on it, but I can understand why they didn't.	positive
Yay! more Redman! Probably going to get one of these and turn it into a carnival attraction.	positive
Not bad. I could see picking up a couple of these guys along with a few of the new knights. I actually prefer the wizard as these impulse items are simply too expensive for army building (IMO). Later.	neutral

Wow, that's a great review of a great set Dr S! *y* As you yourself have already noted, this has the potential to be a fantastic military MOC! With a bit of modification you can get the engines to be rounder, or perhaps do away with them completely and replace them with jet engines. *sweet* Though I can't think of a system to retract the undercarriage at the top of my head it seems like there's indeeed more than enough potential to do so. It reminds me rather of an Ilyushin Il-76, one of my favourite cargo planes. :'-)	positive

Nice review, Dr. S! I have been thinking long and hard about the scale of the planes in my town. I would like to keep my passenger planes in their classic 4-wide fuselage style, but I really don't mind the new plane hull pieces if they are used as an enormous transport plane like the Ilyushin-76. Unfortunately I can't afford this lovely new green one at the moment (which would be perfect to go with my green army) as I took too much of a hit buying the new 2008 Star Wars sets! But I have modified my white one to take huge cargo loads, in fact my APC is designed specifically to fit inside. Unfortunately I'm a bit busy to take pics at the moment, but hope to put some up soon.	neutral

I got mine today! X-D I too got an Anakin Clone Wars head, although I'm not really complaining since I already have an Indy head from the Motorcycle Chase set. It is really odd that they would pack in such a different looking head though. Also, for those that think the head has no use, try placing it under one of the braided new brown dwarf beards. It looks pretty nice, I think! *y* On the set, it's wonderful! The hieroglyphic stickers are wonderful, Marion (especially her head and hair) is wonderful, and the Anubis statues are nice too. There's also lots of nice tan parts, such as 20 round 2x2s, and 8 1x8 bricks.

Thanks everyone, heres part 2: The second instruction booklet includes instructions for both alternate models, which is good, I hate having too many manuals: Here she is, the plane: Its very nice and well proportioned, but where did iamded get that laser? Overview, the landing gear is very sturdy and nice, and the wings are surprisingly good: Top view, iamded's head fell into the propellers, I was trying to save him, honest! A view of how the motor on this one works, by pushing the orange button you can make the prop spin. It is well integrated like the chopper, though the prop only spins for about 2 1/2 seconds. Still, its a nice feature: The tail is also well made, simple, but lovable. Oh, and check out that tank! The prop spinning, Agh! Is that MY hand? Final view, there seems to be some sort of explosion here 8-| Well I think I got iamded more than me atleast. The second model is also great, though not as good as the chopper. The lack of space to fit something into the cockpit brings it down a bit, but it is a very nice model overall. I recommend it, though unlike the chopper it will be hard to mod into minifig scale. So far so good with 4995, here are the leftover pieces from the model: Enjoy! Batbrick Away! >:-)	positive

I bought one of these new from Bricklink a few months ago as part of my Pirate splurge I went on.

So here it is finally, my first ever review of a lego set..oh wait, it's actually 2 sets. So i don't really know how to do it right, but i'll try the best. (Sorry if some pictures are a litte bit dark, but i'm not really into photography and i got bad light here) Let's Start with the Dwarf's Mine Defender: Theme: Castle 2008 Set Name: Dwarf's Mine Defender Number: 7040 Pieces: 86 Price: ?9,99 (EUR) First, as always, the box: The back, a few instructions on how the defender works, for those how don't know ;-) : And the instructions: We continue with the minifigs, sorry i forgot to make a closeup of the dwarf: And finally the mine defender itself, i personally think it isn't as bad as maybe some people think. The chain for the catapult is great i think: I kinda love those controls, the mechanism with the rubbe rband actually works pretty well, but only on a not-glossy underground. That's pretty much all of it, it's small but i like it a lot. So let's go on to the tower raid now, which would be my absolute favorite of those new sets. -------------------------------------- Theme: Castle 2008 Set Name: Tower Raid Number: 7037 Pieces: 364 Price: ?29,99 (EUR) Again, first the box & Instructions: We got 2 sets of instructios here, one for the tower and one for the siege tower: The Minifigs, we got one archer and one soldier here, both with the torsos of the 2007 sets: Now thw orc side, starting with the great leader, with the new armor and the golden helmet (i love those pieces!): Closeup of the armor & helmet: Then we got another orc-knight: And the prisoner, with handcuffs! The Crownie Tower looks great overall, though there is something i don't really like about it, but later on that. Now the back, and that is what really bothers me, there areno walls on the first floor except the one with the wall-piece and the door, and theprison also is open at the back. The orc easily could jump out there: Not sure what these are all about, they really don't add much to the set: Enough rant now, let's go on with a pretty sweet detail, the golden crystal on the little table: The wall piece on the first floor you can ram in: And finally the very best thing of this set, the amazing orc siege tower! From the front: The great working ram, you can pull it back very far and it got pretty much power: Here we got another sweet detail, the siege "platform" that moves out by pulling a cord in the back of the tower: Finally a picture of a bit siege action: If you ram in the lower wallpiece, the brown shelfs of the prison-floor collapse and the prisoned orc is finally free! Summary: Likes: As i mentioned before, i really think that's the best ever produced siege tower, it's got so mich details and works extremely well, also the overall look of it is magnificant. The destroy-mechanism of the tower is pretty cool too, the brown door is a fine detail too. Nothing much to say about the mine defender, i like this little set, and there's nothing really to bother about it. Dislikes: The Back of the tower. That's really the only thing that's a bit bad imo, they could have put there 2 more walls on the first floor and something to lock the prison easily. Final Thought: The Tower Raid for me personally is the best of the 2008 sets so far, it's got great playability and looks simply good. My opinion: Buy it!	positive
Tks for these cool reviews metalandi !! I love these orc sets !! I am so going to get these ;-) I'm happy to see that scared face again (I love it really !!) and the use of that handculfs !! That new armour looks really cool That tower is really nice and I wont mod it that much which os cool and the battle ram is freaking sweet !! Tks again for sharing ;-) *yoda*	positive
Great review, pictures and all! Thanks for showing all the mechanisms of the tower, I didn't notice them from either the pics we had or the instructions--it didn't hit me that when you knock down the wall the second floor breaks. That is a genius idea. This looks like a superb set, unfortunately my priority right now is the Troll Warship. Still, if that really is U.S. $80, I might skip it and go for this instead, which is only $20 US. One note, though. I think there might not be a back cage on the second floor of the tower so that the mechanism can work. Did you try to see if the second floor ground still falls if you add it a fourth cage wall? Also, you could just pretend that the tower is built against a mountainside. It would fit perfectly and add more defense to the Knights. Great review! :-) VK	positive
Tks for those so much!! :'-) *y* Nice reviews! I love that tower raid, and the defender, and will buy them both. Quote really don't add much to the set: Oh, but they do. More pieces= higher price. ;-)	neutral
The Tower Raid has the best price per piece ratio in the whole 2008 line. Thanks for the review ^_^	positive
Thanks metalandi! These are 2 great sets, I'm definately looking forward to seeing these in New Zealand stores! The collapsing floor/prisoner freeing mechanism on the tower is wonderful, a great touch. Some slight modifications, like, some walls, will make this perfect. And the Dwarf's Mine Defender is a sweet little set, with some neat minifigs. Thanks for the reviews! *y* ~Peace	positive
Thanks for these great reviews! *sweet* The dwarfs mine defender looks interesting, the figs though are *wub* The only thing missing is a weapon for the dwarf and some shields The battering ram and tower are awesome! 8-? The Troll King with new torso, helmet, and body armor is simply amazing I like how the troll is handcuffed :-D The tower shows nice detail except for the poor "brig" . I love that gold crystal! The battering ram is a thing of beauty! $30 for the Tower and Ram and $10 for the Defender are very well priced! I still want the Battle Wheel more though! Damn Exclusives! :'-( >:-( P	positive
Well, I don't think Orcs are that sturdy, seeing that they'd have to jump from the second level of the tower, I don't see survival as his chief objective! :-P Awesome review! I'm loving these sets more and more! The Tower Raid is DEFINITELY the best and the cheapest set there! >:-) Oh, and Pirhana, it's not really a 'king', it's more like an officer. Remember, the Wizard rules these goblins! Edited by trooperdavinfelth, 22 February 2008 - 02:49 PM.	positive

For some silly (and quite delusional) reason I thought that I had a chance to review this first... :-D But yours is at your house, and mine is (hopefully) winging it's way to me... :'-) Thanks for the review!

What a beautiful set, TLC give the designer a pay rise immedietly. I was lucky to order one of these while they were on sale to us aussies ;-) but dont worry lego the $100 you saved me will be spent on more sets like this. Carn't wait to watch my kids rescue residents in distress from those upper level windows with the fire fighters.	positive
Great review, great set. I can't mine until after Easter. *weeps*.	positive
Truly an awesome review. Thanks Dunamis. I ordered my two copies (one to build, one to store in the "vault") last week. Can't wait to get this one! The attention to detail here is what makes the set great. There's nothing to criticize about this set. It's really the closest thing to perfection that I have seen from TLC. The difference between this set and CC is the interior detail, and because of that, GG now become (in my opinion) the best set EVER released by TLC. Do the CC/GG/MS sets fit well with the 50th anniv. town plan? My impression is that out of the box, at least, they don't. Which is too bad. However, I don't think it would be hard to mod the Town Plan so it looks like it belongs in the same town as CC/GG/MS. These sets, to me, are what I have always wanted from TLC as an adult. I hope they keep up the line, and add more elements to this excellent lineup.	positive
wow,, thanks for the nice review! I have the other 2 sets and waiting for this to come to our shores. Stupendous Design and Details! I really like the "hammer-rails" on the roof. CANt wait!!! *wub*	positive
A very informative review, indeed. Thank you so much for doing so. Now I know that the price is worth every penny leaving my pocket. ;-) What do you guys think is TLC putting up as the next modular set? Is it asking too much of TLC to produce 1 modular set each quarter (4 times a year)?	positive
A million thanks for this review. This is greater than I thought. I especially like that clock. I'm going to get this set as soon as possible.	positive
Thank you for the amazing review Dunamis! This set looks amazing *wub* I won't be able to afford it though :'-( Congrats! This is on the frontpage *y* *sweet*	positive
Wow, another old technic set review by you. Nice set, and thanks for that review.	positive
Thanks for another fun review! This set is high on my list of things to buy, I love cranes, built many and bought many including the classic 8460 from 1995 and the more recent 8421. That threaded axle never stopped intriguing me... It was use in so few sets (I believe 8851 contained one as well?) and I still don't know why it's better than any other axle. Congratulations with a near mint copy of this set! :-)	positive
As I bought it, I didn't even know I would also get a box. It just said: all parts with building instructions. After opening the parcel I was like: "woah... woooaaahhh" and so on. ;-) I love LEGO-boxes because as a child I stood in the toy stores starring at the boxes, only seeing the front and the back, nothing more. This brings back some memories... :'-)	positive
Ah a good old retro review. Those old school days had some pretty impressive sets, with alot more complexity than modern sets. If you have it may I recommend 8880?	positive

thanx for the review. i have one question. do these aliens have moving arms? as far as the set goes i think lego did a bad job on the alien ship. i dont think any of the alien ships look good in Mars Mission the human fanction got a lot better this year and i would have bought this buggy if it came by its self..	negative
Cool review. makes me want to get the set. *y*	positive
Thank you for your nice review, vbbn! *y* But it only confirms: This theme is NOT my cup of tea.

Well, as bad a concept aliensvshumans is for a theme... I really do like this set. The human rover has nice parts for reuse, especially those oldschool space wheels. And despite those wobbly wings, I really like the alien ship. goes from a flying saucer-ish shape to a spread winged almost raven shape, very ominous and cool looking. Now that 'alien commander' is terrible... if I don't buy bionicle minifigs already, why would I be interested in that thing? Kinda wish they'd take the Drones from the retiring ExoForce theme and do them in green, they'd make nice alien robot things...	positive

BerndDasBrot, on Mar 21 2008, 07:07 AM, said: Hi! This is my forth (old-school) technic set review! Since blakbird pointed out that all my technic reviews are red, I chose a yellow dune blaster for today! This is my second 8829 and I also noticed that the engine turns very hard. The alternate model is really (sorry to all those of you who like it) crappy. I mean- a nice idea, but not with this wheels! :-| Anyway: a really beautiful Technic-set! *reminiscing* (this word exists, does it?) thanks for viewing the pictures, I hope you enjoyed it! Please comment if you want to! A great set review, as always. Nice try making a review of a set that was not red. It almost worked! Maybe next time. *sweet* One thing I noticed is that a bunch of your pictures are missing the beam that goes over the left hand wheel as a fender. Like this picture: What kind of camera do you use? The pictures have very good depth of field, meaning that both the foreground and the background are in good focus. This is usually hard to do without a very small aperture. Yes, "reminiscing" is a word. It means to fondly remember the past. I also noticed that the engine was sticky. Set 8408 has the same problem. It took me forever to figure out what the problem was. If you take the engine out of the model, it turns nice and smooth. Then when you put it back in, it works terrible. It turns out the key is that, in the back, there is an 8 tooth spur gear and a 24 tooth crown gear used as a spur. If you look at Technica, you will see that there are two different crown gears. One of them works well mated with an 8 tooth on parallel axles, and the other one doesn't. The difference is only supposed to be longer teeth, so it really should not matter, but it does. If your set works bad, try switching the crown gear to one of the other variety. Worked for me. Eric	positive
Toa_Of_Justice, on Mar 21 2008, 08:10 AM, said: That looks like a very nice set! :-) In your opinion, how does it compare to the current Dune Buggy? -Toa Of Justice IMHO, 8829 is much better than 8296. First, 8829 is a lot bigger. I really like the huge rear balloon tires. They both have rack and pinion steering, and they both have trailing arm rear suspension with a V-2 engine. I think the body on 8829 is a little more well done. For 8296, I think the alternate tractor model is much better. For more comparisons, see Technicopedia. Eric	positive

WOW! This buggy was my very first LEGO set. I like this review - it remembered my childhood. I also liked its body with those 8 studs long bricks on sides. I can also remember trying to build engine in such way that it works smooth without success. Anyway I think its "studless version" - set 8048 is much better.	positive

I would like to comment on the review, but the pictures are too big - it simply takes too long to load. Regarding that new resize function. I can see it does "nearest neighbor" rescaling.

Thanks for resizing the pics. It is strange that you didn't know about that Z-piece before. It was well used in old space sets.

Hi! This is my forth pre-old-school review. As promised: a yellow-set ! My 8862 arrived today, survived the washing machine coaster and actually was real fun to build! #1: information: This set contains 664 parts (only! I thought I’d be far more!) and was released in 1989 in the TECHNIC theme. Be sure to visit Technopediaif you want to know more! #2: building instructions: Wow these instructions are used! I'm not used to this after all this sets with unread instruction booklets... The pneumatics page: The last step for the alternate model: #3: the parts: Wow! Look at all those technic beams, gears, pins...! (A few parts are missing in this photo!) #3: building: The left worm gear is for the outriggers, the right one for turning the “rear boom” The three 12L Axles: left one: outriggers, middle one: steering, right one: erm… rear-boom-rotation. The two worm gears in the front part: left one: lifting the bucket, right one: dumping the bucket. The turning-mechanism for the “rear-boom” is finished. Once again a toothed 10L axle. The Boat Weight 2x6x2 is hidden underneath the radiator grill. Okay… many hoses and a nice, comfy seat have been added. Now you can recognize the Backhoes real shape. Only with a little violence it’s possible to lift the bonnet (?) through the Pneumatic Pump. Yeah, outriggers. Same technique that the 8854 uses. The finished “boom / jib / scoop thing” (=BJST) :-| X-D The finished loader bucket. And to end the building process: the same picture from the introduction. (OFF-TOPIC: “It is all part of the miracle of nature! - The circle of life!” #4: functionality: This time, I tried something new! I hope you can spot something - if not: Technopedia! Okay, here we go. #5: random shots: I’ve got way too many pictures this time, so I refer to my brickshelf folder. Until it’s moderated you can follow the multilingual links! eins deux three quattro fem zes sédem osiem #6: final thoughts: Definitely worth buying! As a child I thought it looks hideous - but today I’ve found out it’s totally fun to build and freaking functional. Three things I want to mention though: The BJST can only be slewed (a new word!) if the outriggers are deployed. It is also possible that the BJST will reach the ground (danger of grinding or sticking) even if the outriggers are deployed. The two mechanisms for the loader bucket can actually interlock, and the 14 tooth gears might break / disentangle from the axle. thanks for viewing the pictures, I hope you enjoyed it! Please comment if you want to!	neutral
Thanks for your feedback! I like both, but I would say 8455 is far more than just a studless version! with 10 pneumatic cylinders and 2 pneumatic pumps it's a wonderful set for every pneumatic freak. Unfortunately I don't own the 8455 - YET. ;-) Sinner said: I hope you have more planned; any chance of a supercar one? I foreshadowed a black review a few days ago... guess which one... X-O X-D	positive
BerndDasBrot, on Mar 24 2008, 05:39 PM, said: could you explain your thoughts please? You know: my english skills ;-) I was thinking you could somehow attach a 16-tooth dark gray gear (the one that spins freely around axles) to the nut, which would make the axle move in and out when the gear turned and convert the gear's rotary motion to linear motion in a fairly compact package. Although there are other ways of doing the same thing that don't use such rare parts, and the 2008 Technic sets will come with pre-built linear actuators anyway.	neutral
BerndDasBrot, on Mar 25 2008, 03:46 AM, said: 15 seconds. Wow, that's a long exposure. I would think you would get way too much light and overexpose the image. The aperture must have been tiny. Quote I will review it too and post it in this topic! Cool. I am also planning to write about the combine on Technicopedia. Combine Quote actually I took it from your site! X-D I thought that word sounded familiar! Quote unfortunately I don't own 8480 but I think 8824 is also a very good (though small) white set! 8462 rocks as a blue set. I just got it a few weeks ago. Let's see... 8462 also is one of the last TECHNIC sets I would call Old-school. 8479... okay too, but 8458 is IMHO not. 8868 and the totally mysteriously black set will follow...! You don't own 8480? That is unacceptable. It is imperative that you put a mortgage on your house immediately to get it! *sweet* Yes, 8824 is a good white set. I also see from your room photos that you have the 8839 Supply Ship which has lots of white. This is a really nice set. 8462 is hard to call old school, but at least it uses regular beams. The air tanks are the best part of the set. I wish LEGO had used them more often, especially on the highly pneumatic sets. The tank makes all the difference on 8459. You are right, 8458 is certainly not old school, but it is a great set with wonderful suspension. It is of the same era as the Super Street Sensation with all of the panels for body contouring. 8868 is Technic at its best. There is nothing else like it, especially with the compressor. Quote Did you had something like this in mind if the toothed 10L axle rotates the axle nuts want to rotate too but they can't because of that 2x4 Technic Plate. So they'll decide to move along the axle. The 1x6 Bricks on each end make sure that the axle won't move in or out. Thanks for your feedback! While the assembly you have drawn would work as a linear actuator, I would not recommend it. The torsional stiffness and strength of an axle are proportional to the polar moment of inertia, a section property. Most of the stiffness comes from the outside of the cross shaped axle. But in the threaded axle, you lose all the stiffness of the outer area because it is not continuous. This means you only get stiffness and strength from the small core. I think the threaded axle would bend and break very easily if subjected to much torque. Eric	neutral
A great review. I only have new sets, so looking at old ones like this is great. I would suggest multiple pictures blended together afterwards, instead of the long exposure pictures.

Some time ago I sort of complained about the fact that there was not much Technic represented in the Eurobricks community (this was the topic, if someone is interested). I am glad to see someone took that complaint serious and started reviewing technic sets on large scale to show us how fascinating the theme really is! This review is once again an excellent one, I really enjoyed reading it. I must buy this set sometime soon because I always liked the three-way pneumatic system it came with and the overall look of the machine. For many years it seemed out of reach, much to expensive and hard to come by as a kid. Now as an adult there are many ways to acquire this wonderful set. Keep on reviewing! *y*	positive

They are both really similar so it really depends on which colors you use more in MOC-ing, or which characters you like more. My personal choice is 8159 as it has cooler minifigs, except for Racer X's recycled head :-|, and the colors are more useful to me.

Speaking of pocket knives, I just got Speed Racer and Snake Oiler at K-Mart and might mod the helmet so it actually looks like the cartoon. The problem is - I don't want to shell out two bucks for a clear visor! >:-( By the way, I know trans-clear visors are non-production, but where did they come from? a pick-a-brick? if so, what store? Well at least if I do go through getting the elusive clear visor, it's not as bad as the insane $25+ red vader helmet! This set is great. I would have gotten this along with the one I purchased, but I didn't have enough dough with me to get both.	positive
Very good review! These sets are a lot better than I expected, and for $20, I might have to pick up both! My family and I are going to Orlando this summer, hopefully I'll pick these and some other sets up at the Lego Store in Downtown Disney. :-D	positive
A fine review of a fine set, thanks Lasse D! *y*	positive
Thank you for your detailed review, Lasse D! *y* The only problem about this set is, that most of the people here will regard this as a pure parts pack. X-D Oooh - I just found out about the red "teeth" - cool. I want that! *wub*	positive
Excellent review! *y* Getting a better chance to look at this set actually makes me interested in it. I was in my dark ages throughout the Islander days, though I have built up a small force of them (10?) from eBay buys, but no actual sets. If this is really as reasonable as you say there, I may just have to pick one up soon. Oddly, I do own the baseplates to this set, having also picked them up in a lot on eBay, so I might be able to recreate it manually, but I think I'd rather pick one up whole. It looks like a great mix of parts and makes a decent looking display piece. Thanks again for the fine review! *y*	positive
A great and informative review with very fine pictures, thanks SlyOwl! *sweet* A wonderful set this is indeed, full of nice details and pretty playable, and a cool subtheme that offers a lot of fantasy and charming characters in a marvelous layout. I really love that little boat with the outrigger, and the neat buildings and sweet landscaping works together very well. TLC got sued for using some names of native sounding origin? Now that sounds really strange to me.... such names´re widely spread within novels, movies and such stuff, I didn´t know that there´s some kind of copyright on them.... 8-|	positive
Good review, mr. SlyOwl! And good pics too! I know it probably deserves better but I only give him a 3. I'll be surely the only saying that I don't like this set but I remember I had it for christmas when I was a child and it disappointed me very much because I expected it much larger after seeing it in the LEGO catalogs. Well it's just a little trauma I had :-P LOL Anyway I must admit it's an interesant set, specially because of the large number of mini-figures and accesories it brings with and the two little "ships" Edited by BlueBard, 31 March 2008 - 01:13 AM.	positive
Excellent review of an outstanding set! I love the main image. I want this set so bad!	positive
It's a great set and one I have yet to add to my collection despite my large number of Islander extras. Enchanted Island, aside from having so alluring a name was good value for money in that you only needed this one set and you had a good representation of the islanders both in the size of the set and the number of minifigs. The flipping rope bridge and the river give it a great rainforest retreat sort of feeling and one is inclined to think of this set as more inland than directly coastal for me. Whilst the Islanders were never seen in the same light or popularity as Pirates and Imperials they were an obvious and colourful addition that to me added a whole new depth to the Pirate system and one was now able to play a 3 or 4 way war adding a greater political element to the sets. Enchanted Island is probably the 3rd most appealing of the large land bases for me after Port Royal and Eldorado Fortress. Good review and glad to see the set recognised!	positive
SlyOwl, you're a legend! Thank you for taking the time to do such a comprehensive review. You've captured Enchanted Island in impeccable detail and anyone who doesn't own this set should know it inside-out by now. I shall write my thoughts on the set itself, directly.	positive
For some reason I never considered buying this set. But your review changed that. I'll try to get it on eBay. Thanks for your efforts to make this wonderful review for us. It's now added to our index.	positive
Thanks for the review! I am getting very interested in the classic pirates sets, and I wat some now. This seems like it would be a great starter.	positive
I was just going into my dark ages when LEGO began the Islander themes, so I've never really cared for them. BUT this review actually made me want this set real bad. I guess this is what reviews are for then - good job on the review	positive
What an amazing (old) set! I loved Pirates in my childhood, but that was before the Islander and Spanish stuff... mine were the BSB and soldier fortress with the big baseplate. As I'm now returning to Pirates, I've tracked down most of the 2009 sets and of course bought the new 2015 sets... but knowing I missed this "middle" period of Islanders vs Pirates makes me a bit sad... those Islanders are soooo "Monkey Island" (those of my age likely feel the same) to my eyes! Oh for a "Lemonhead" minfig... ;) I'm curious now how much this set sells for, given it was apparently one of very few Lego actually re-released! I recently bought a MISB BSB that was an early 2000's re-release, and it was very pricey... but then, I suspect the BSB has a LOT more of a nostalgic following these days than this set! Can anyone give me a rough idea what this set goes for in as-new condition these days? Regardless, a fantastic review with some great photos of the whole set and minifigs... even though this is an old thread, I am glad someone else bumped it recently so I can add my thoughts too. :) One thing I've noticed comparing the newest Pirates sets to the 80's ones I had as a kid (and these from the 90's) is the move away from baseplates and big "panel" pieces. I actually like that in a lot of ways; whilst I miss baseplates being included as they are a great starting point for creating new things (and make the sets easier to "play" with), visually, I think Lego-designed model sets look better without them.	positive
How comes the monkey stays yellow but not the people... :'-(	negative
I will most likely get all the speed racer sets as it was one of my favorite movies(the animated one) i just loved the decked up and tricked out cars >:-) great review and red tux = X-D	positive
Sorry to bump such an old thread, but I´ve just discovered this set is on sale at Amazon.de - for a mere 25 Euros. I am tempted. Not because I like the set or the models, but because of the parts. As most of you might know, I´m especially into Exo-Force. So would you recommend to get this set just for the parts? Are they a good choice to combine with EF-sets? Would anyone of you be interested in obtaining the fleshie-parts of the minifigs from me, as I totally don´t need those?	neutral
An opportunity has come up to buy this set for 100 AUD. Just wondering whether people think it's worth buying? I've heard very little about the speed racer Legos	neutral
Ah, thanks sommuch again for that great review! *y* *sweet* Man, I am so happy they made this set. The new one seems too boring. ;-)	positive
Front, on Apr 6 2008, 05:19 PM, said: btw. boxes are expensive, so at a given price point, it's a choise between more bricks or nicer boxes. I have no doubt what most people would chose. Yeah, it's certainly understandable why they did it, but bad for box hoarders like me. :-P	positive
Great review! While I admit I wasn't into Technic at the time this came out (I was a mere child, give me a break! :-D), I can see now why it was featured so much. From the booklets to display stands at toy stores and at my local LEGO center (when it was still around), this thing was everywhere! With your review, I can now truly appreciate all the details of the set. I got to admit, I can see the appeal now! That comparison shot you took is amazing. I love not only just how it included the little details such as the stabilizers, but also looks incredibly fun to play around with. Great set and an even greater review!	positive
thanks guys! @ sinner: i hope you refered to 8285 so my answer will match: 8285 is interesting: main model: american styled truck, alternate model: european styled truck. I don't think TLG produced many european styled truck. EDIT: I just found a wonderful MOC-alternate on brickshelf: 8436 by industrialdesigner. If I got him right, he designed a few offical technic sets for TLG. @ all: promises, promises, promises... hm. and again it's eBay that's blocking me. I want to foreshadow my next review (although it'll take some time to make it): I know, you know. But please act inconspicuous until you'll can act very astonished...!

Can't wait to get this one (ANTS!!!) I don't have a tent either, so that'll be a great pickup. I'm surprised, though, that it includes the gold Exo-Force sword. I didn't expect this to come in any other sets besides the tower. <Faramir-<	positive

I was already thinking of buying this set, and you've totally convinced me. Thanks for the review, Alex Btw, I think they are ants, having that shape; moreover, we already have spider molds, and they have already been used in Theatre themes (see Spiderman ). LuxorV	positive
OK! I think, it''s a no-brainer that this is a must-have for pretty much anyone who likes LEGO! It's cheap and a great minifigs & parts pack! I'll be getting at least 1 of these! Here is what I like about it: 1. Great minifigs with nice torsos, sweet faces, and awesome hair! (Gotta ask 'em where they get it done! ) 2. Golden katana! 3. Chicken leg! YUM! 4. Nice campfire! And this is what I don't like about it: 1. Dark bley knife! Seriously, they could have at least made it silver like the sword, if not chrome! 2. Rehashed tent. 3. Spiders with 6 legs!!! I actually don't really care about the tent and the multi-legged creatures. Those go straight into the sorting boxes. Perhaps I might use the tent someday for a steampunk MOC of some kind, or a stop-motion film, or maybe some kind of contest... Anyway, what's up with that thing that holds the katana, the sword, and the saber? It's in the airplane set too! Is it perhaps one of the treasures of the new movie or is it something Indy takes with him everywhere in this film? 44However, nice pics, nice review! Thanks, dude! Edited by Oky Wan Kenobi, 16 April 2008 - 09:38 AM.	positive
I simply that tent! I guess I´ll have to buy three of these just to make a proper expedition MOC somewhen.... A great little set indeed, with marvelous new MF torsos and that new black feminine hairpiece´s also great and very useable for creating some characters related to the sixties and seventies. And finally a pan that´s not black and a knife in grey. That´s very handy indeed, the chrome one always looked a bit too shiny to me.... Thanks for that sweet review, alex!	positive
Thanks for that great review! This is a very interesting set filled with nice parts for customisation. Somemore, the price is not that steep. I will need to get ready for the second wave!	positive
Great set, i'll definitely get it. Is there any sign of flesh on the soldiers, like at the collars?	positive
Nice review, I like what I'm seeing in this set. I liked the little comic, Marion should be arrested though	positive

A very fine review of a really great set, thanks alex! This set has everything, a croc, very nice MFs, a neat tree trap, a cool zodiac and a marvelous and very detailed amphibious car in a beautiful color scheme. The only thing I´m not colpletely sure is the design of that jerrycan (thanks for the right word and the interesting link, Kingboy ). Although the use of the revolver´s pretty clever indeed and fits well too, it´s still clearly, well, a revolver.... very unusual and interesting for an official TLC design.	positive
Just like 7626 this is a must buy in my opinion. I just the amphibious vehicle,very nice for army building.	positive
Oh, man, thanks for the review! IMO, this looks like the best set in the new Indy line! Do you have any better pics of the Colonel?	positive

Here's a review of the second largest set in the Dragon Masters subtheme for castle month, Dark Dragon's Den! Figs: The set comes with 3 Dragon knights, two of which have the dragon wings on their helmets(Sad thing is, one of my knights was missing the left wing on the helmet). There are also the definitive dragon, Wiz the wizard (or Majisto if you prefer)two horses, and a hawk( try to find him in each picture!) The set: there's a large spot under the mountain for the dragon to guard the treasure chest. The chest has 2 red and green 1x1 circles in it. Another gate in the back, along with a door for knights. The right side of the mountain has a ladder and a removable rock face. The left side has some stairs leading up to the top. I love this tree design. simple yet effective. A shot of the top- Hey, what are you doing?!? NO!! Throw him in the dungeon! Overall: This set when first released in 1993 was priced at $43USD, although that might just be because of the Juniorised pieces (6 BURPs!). It's a fun set that provides excellent playability. If you can find it at a $20-$30 price point, pick it up. Overall grade: 8/10 Edited by KimT, 10 August 2008 - 01:33 PM.	positive
Agent Rick: You're definately the Dragon Master around these parts. What a great little set. I really like the classic dragon which reminds me of a similar style used for the Lego crocodiles. And the dungeon is pretty slick too. I like the use of the large gates plus the doors. Plus the set contains the blue wizard. Awesome! Great review.	positive
A very neat set with charming MFs and a great classic dragon, a good use of BURPs and a really nice tree indeed. Thanks for the review, AgentRick57!	positive
The 8291 Dirt Bike comes from a long line of Technic bikes, and I think it's the best ever. It looks great, and it's fun to ride around in the house. I hoped to find a figure the right size for it, but none of mine would fit. Unlike a lot of Technic models, it looks good from all angles. Considering the size of the model it has a complicated way of connecting the engine to the wheel. The rear shocks are just the right stiffness... ...and they have a good amount of travel. I thought these shocks were new. I need to get out more... Functions: Shocks: Two front, one stiffer one in the rear. Drivetrain: 2 piston engine linked to the rear wheel via gears and a chainlink. Steering: Yes it does... Stand: Retractable. For the price, size and subject, what else could be added? 10/10 Parts: Considering that it has three shocks and a 40 chainlinks it's a great set for parts. Some hard to use large parts are included, but they are not overused. The usage of the green does limit part usage somewhat though, and I'll be struggling to find a use for those wheels for anything other than a motorbike. 8/10 Price: At $39.99 AUD for 248 parts it isn't the best value set. The US price is $25.00 which is somewhat better. It does have some more complicated parts however. 7/10 Looks: Lego seems to be moving away from the see-though look for Technic sets and this is a good example of it. I'm not a big fan of fairings but I think they work great in this set as a fuel tank. 8/10 Fudge: This set was great for me as I have never had a Technic bike. However for those that want this for just parts or have other bikes it could be a hard sell. The alternate model (a chopper) is a complete rebuild (which I didn't make), and it's great that Lego have been including these most of the time lately. 7/10 Overall: Recommended. 8/10	positive
Thanks for the Great review Sinner I like the Technic bikes I wonder how it would look if you replaced the gear on the back wheel with a smaller one?	neutral
Best review of a Lime Green Technic Dirt Bike ever! Really, it is. I just don't understand the allure of the bike very much. Where does the Fabuland fig go? Anyway, very insightful review. Thanks for taking the time and effort to review it for us. I'm not really interested in the set, but wanted to support my buddy since I know how much work you put into these. Now I shall go read the cherry picker one. I look forward to it because there's a walrus in it. Lasse D, on Apr 22 2008, 04:55 PM, said: It must be cold in that room. Nice shirt, but the vertical hold is broken...	neutral
How did I manage to miss this review? I must have overlooked it somehow... Thanks for making this one Sinner, it's always nice to see reviews of Technic sets. I'm not so sure whether I like this set, I am not that much into motorbikes, but Lego did a good job on this one. It looks a lot like an upgraded version of one of the first bikes Lego made, namely the 8838 Shock Cycle. I also believe the back gearwheel is somewhat oversized, it looks better with the smaller one you attached. It is good to see that Lego is back to making the Technic sets the way they were (except for the green, that is )	neutral
I wasn't very interested in this set at first. It seemed to be just a nice looking truck with a small motor... but when I found out it had a transmission I changed my mind! Here is the transmission. It allows the single motor to be used for two functions. This system has been around for a while, and Lego seem to be using it more and more. The Transmission Driving Ring alone (the red circle) goes for $5-15 USD on BrickLink, and you also need the Catch and Clutch Gear so I have been buying sets that have them instead. I now have enough parts to make a Supercar gearbox. (I bet a new supercar comes out next year now...) This is the gear that rotates the arm. Note the colour of the 24 tooth gear; it seems to be a new gear trend. A lot of work has been put into this truck looking real. Personally I think they went too far as the truck seems to have been designed for a tilting cab, but it's disabled to prevent breaking the front. Bottom of the transmission. The bottom shaft lifts the arm. Note that there are more dark grey gears. The motor fits in very well also. The bottom of the arm. I was surprised by the usage of a 12 Tooth Bevel to link with the 36 Tooth Double Bevel as I had never seen that done before. As you can see there is no room for any drive train. Standard steering for a recent technic truck. There is a hand-of-god at the cab top that links via two Knob Wheels. It looks good from the back. You can also see the white Clutch that connects the transmission to the motor to avoid burnouts. It goes decently high, and can go a bit higher if you use the crane arm. Compared to last years fire truck. (If I didn't buy the fire truck for half price I would have been annoyed that Lego brought out what is almost a motorised version of the same set.) Functions: Cherry Picker Arm: Motorised rotate and lift that links to a motor via a transmission and anti-burnout clutch. Steering: Rack and pinion controlled via a hand-of-god linked by Knob Wheels Doors: Open and close. Good functionality that works well, but I wish they made the cab lift and I'm a bit sick of the lame fairing door trick. 7/10 Parts: Motor, battery box, transmission, clutch, practical wheels, only two fairings, compact turntable... this is a great parts set. 10/10 Price: At $99.99 AUD for 726 parts it's OK value when you consider what you are getting. The US price is $60.00 which is better, but still not great. I bought mine for $80 AUD which was good however, and I suspect that the price is designed for easy sale...8/10 Looks: I'd buy this for the looks alone! 9/10 Fudge: The functions work well and I llked it more than I thought I would. Oddly mine seemed to be missing a Axle Pin with Friction, but since it includes extra parts for the alternate model I didn't mind using one of my spares. On the subject of the alternate model, it is a dump truck which is made out to be a total re-build, but it isn't. It could have easily been done like Super Street Sensation was, but Lego have probably determined that instructions like that confuse people. 8/10 Overall: Recommended. 8/10	positive

Looks like an interesting set. I didn't realize the motor controlled two functions through a transmission switch. That's always good to see. I'll probably pass it up though until the price falls a bit. The overall design is a bit too studless for my liking (I think the 8275 bulldozer has a much better balance of studded and studless pieces), and the wheels somehow look too small to me. I also have something of a backlog at the moment; I still need to pick up that bulldozer along with the 8421 mobile crane (on ebay).	neutral

Set: 7627 - Indiana Jones - Temple of the Crystal Skull Pieces: 929 Price: $AUD149.99 Out of all the Indy 4 sets, this one seems to cop the most flak - which may account for the fact that the other 3 were reviewed weeks ago and this one has sat, unloved and alone, waiting for someone to turn their eye upon it (or, y'know, buy it). Luckily I'm a sucker for spooky old temples, filled with devilish traps and hidden treasures, hissing fountains and overgrown foliage, creepy skeletons and crumbling stonework, so here it is: Indiana Jones 7627, Temple of the Crystal Skull. Part 1: The Figs First off, the figs - 6 humans and 4 skellies (or should that be skullies? ) Indy, Mutt, Irina, and that sneery Russian guy that's in the 2 smaller sets. Nothing new here. Aha! What have we here - two natives. I wonder if hair is a sign of power in this culture, since one guy is completely bald and the other one has the most extraordinarily luxurious black mullet. Somehow I doubt the movie will answer this question. Back view - as you can see, the scalp tattoos are also popular in this tribe. Fashion conscious! (Note in the background the paws of the fearsome black jungle panther, ie my cat, curious as to see what the tribe was up to.) Also, don't ask me why these guys are carrying axes rather than, say, spears. And what everyone's been waiting for, the skullies - three of 'em and a conquistador skellie - very cute. Note the backs of the crystal head have a plume-sized hole - or maybe that's just where they injected the blue brain-plastic. Spooky! I love these skulls, I wasn't sold from the initial pics but they have a very creepy smile and the head shape is just... weird. With the large eyes, it's kind of Homer Simpson-esque. And here we have the token vehicle in the set - a weird little tank thing with treads. Kind of looks like a cross between the amphibious boat and a mini-tank. I'm sure there's a military expert around here who can tell us exactly what it is supposed to be. The treads are nice, but the rest of it is a bit thrown together. You can tell they wanted to keep the dark green colour scheme but the budget only allowed them 5 parts to do so . All in all, a mixed bag with the figs. 4 repeats from the cheaper sets which means we have one new native figure and the crystal skullies. There are heaps of the old-skool skele heads scattered around the sets so those that prefer can replace the skullies with ordinary skellies. Bizarrely, the top of the box which has the line of 1:1 figs pic (you know what I mean) doesn't have names for any of the characters, whereas all the smaller sets do. Part 2: Box, Parts Front of box: Back of box: Two instruction books: Parts. This set has come under criticism for being overpriced - myself included - but the official piece count is 900 plus, which is pretty good considering it also contains the baseplate. 6 big bags and 2 of those 12x12 bricks in dark tan. (Note: set does not contain live Black Jungle Panther™) The DSS, helpfully comes pre-scrunched thanks to TLC. Even in a $AUD150 set they can't get that right... sigh. The dark tan baseplate. Say what you like, I'm in love. I know some people don't like these, but they were such a staple of Castle/ Pirates for so many years that I don't consider them a juniorised piece at all. This one, recycled from the 05 Police HQ and 06 Hospital, is much better in design than the King Leo's Castle one as the different heights and asymmetry make it look much more like a natural piece of ground. Perfect for MOCs. And it's dark tan - how could anyone not love such a huge slab of dark tan? Note this love doesn't extend to applying the stonework stickers which are, frankly, crap. Random instructions page: Part 3: Temple of Doom - or just a doomed temple? The complete set, front view. Isometricish view: Back view: Top view: First impressions? It's very dark tan, isn't it? And green. And bright green. And dark green. And dark red. And normal tan. And dark bley. And pearl gold! In fact, it's a bit of a mish-mash of colours. I'm of two minds about this. I kind of prefer the palette to be a bit subtler, but I can see that a playset designed for kids isn't going to sell bucketloads all tastefully done in shades of tan with lashings of dark-green foliage. There's a huge amount of dark red in this set, which is always a welcome colour, but I'm not convinced it quite works with the 2 shades of tan on offer here. On the plus side, there's also a huge amount of dark tan in ordinary 2x2 bricks, tiles, plates and 1x1 and 1x2x3 slopes, which is great for anyone wanting to stock up. Let's take a closer look. I'll do this roughly in order of the build itself: a) The big scary face. This is a simple, fun build and very effective at projecting menace at the temple entrance. It actually detaches very easily from the temple (as pictured on the box art) to allow easier access to the inside. The eyes are flick-fire missiles, with Scary Face's hair conveniently providing ammo refills should you run out. All in all, from me. (b) The Back Spin the skelly head and stone steps appear - we haven't seen this feature in a while. Nice to get these pieces in dark bley. A conquistador hides under the stairs - this is a bit useless as the stairs can't fully extend while he's there . Moving right... a trapdoor - what could possibly be behind it??!!??!!? Answer: not much, really. A little red stair. I really like these 2 stickers though - very intricate. The staircase leads to what I like to think of as the Crystal Skull Transmogrification Chamber. Now, I know nothing about the movie except that it's supposed to be have a kind of 50s B-movie plot rumoured to feature (look away, spoiler-haters)..... aliens. These weird, creepy gold chairs look made from the bones of aliens if you ask me, with their strange vertebrae and silver claws. It wouldn't surprise me if bringing these aliens back to life was part of the plot of the movie... hence the crystal skull? I guess we'll find out May 22. In any case, transforming aliens clearly like a disco whirl as when you pull the handle, the whole of this assembly spins giddily around. A very clever and simple trick - it's basically just a wheel under the platform but the effect is great. Also under here is a bottomless pit (stickered)... I would very much expect a villian to be thrown down it at some point. "So, do you come here often?" "I don't know who designed this club. These chairs are REALLY uncomfortable." NB. I am really, really over those pearl gold 1x2 roof corner slopes which started popping up in the 2006 Castle range, infected Exo-Force and have now spread here. Can we please have these in a different colour? Or a different pearl gold piece? Pretty please? ( c) Left tower (looking from the front) A small tower with a trans clear gem. (d) Right tower Waterfall with booby trap. I like the sticker, it's very cartoony, which fits with the set somehow. When you turn the wheel, flick fire missiles spray out and hit whoever is on the stairs. Both towers have a trap where if you move the skull, another one pops out from the dragon mouth. (e) Central turret thing This thing is kind of annoying and doesn't really sit or work well. It's kind of like a laser beam sending messages to space, I guess. As the central dome rises, the two plates peel away. I find it is a little bit tight to work smoothly and the two plates doesn't really sit well together at the top. Maybe I just need to rebuild it. I'm sure this will also be explained in the movie. (f) Final trap - the stair that isn't there The final trap is at the front - as Indy goes down the staircase, you can push the red heads and all the 1x8 bley bricks come tumbling down. Simple and works well. (g) Alternate view Here's how it looks as pictured on the box with the head removed. As you can see, this allows better access to the centre of the temple. As you can see, sadly there is nothing actually interesting there except a staircase to the turret and 2 dark tan slopes which are just stuck there and look a little out of place. I mean, come on, everything else has a splash of dark red and gold! Your Destination: Nowhere! Part 4: In Conclusion So after all those endless pics, what about the set itself? CONS:As a playset, 7627 doesn't quite make sense. Admittedly, the traps that are there are well-designed and unobtrusive. On the other hand, there's a great big whopping entrance at the front - but I wasn't sure if the figs are supposed to sneak in through the backdoor and go up the spiral staircase and past the waterfall (as shown in the box art) or if they were meant to end up in the golden skull room. The middle area doesn't really connect with anything, nor does the giant space turret. It may be that some of these questions are answered in the film, but whereas with 7624, 7625 and 7626 I could at least picture a story myself (eg with River Chase is fairly obvious what's happening - a chase down a river with a croc and a communist staking them out)!, the Temple set is a little all over the place. The design feels a little off to me - not really bad but not really great either. PROS: On the plus side, the natives and crystal skulls themselves are great. At 900+ pieces, this is also a great parts pack for dark tan, dark red, plant pieces, gold oddments etc. I especially love the baseplate in that shade. I like the overall shape of the temple - a big staircase with secret nooks and crannies. The build is reasonably interesting and there are some clever tricks with the traps. But upon reflection I shouldn't have to sell this set - it should be able to sell itself! As I said before, I'm a huge fan of dark, mysterious old temples so for that I have to give it some love. It reminds me of the big old Adventurers sets and the whiff of nostalgia is itself a powerful intoxicant. However, for the price Lego is selling it in Australia/ Europe/ Canada I couldn't recommend it as a must-buy for full price when the smaller sets in this series are themselves so good.

Thanks for this review! You have reviewed my most favourite town set of all times, I am so happy to own this one. I actually is a story to go along with it: In the summer of 1998 I went on holiday with my parents to the country of Luxembourg, in the city of Wiltz we encountered a small toystore which still had this set for sale, (9 years after the release!). I did not had the sufficient amount of money to buy the set and had to leave it at the store, I was practically in tears... Four years later we passed through Luxembourg and I remembered the city and the store. We made a detour and stopped by the same store. Every other old set was sold, the only one remaining was this one! I bought it immediately and treasured it ever since. I use the baseplates a lot in my cities, they serve well as roads with parking spaces next to them. This was the first set I owned which had the huge 6x24 plates in them, I remember my surprise when seeing plates of such enourmous lenght... I recently made an entire racetrack together with this set and to promote myself I will place a link HERE	positive
Ahhhh... back in the days when Shell was the racing fuel of choice before that Octan company came to town, bought off the old Shell execs and ran them out of town on a rail... but I digress...

Batbrick thanks for the sweet review. You give me great insights into this set. Hehe, I agreed that Racer X is nice, but I believe we can get it in the other set for a much lower price.

Thanks so much dunamis for your awesome review .

Hey Dunamis, think you can get a straight-on shot of the face? The red pieces inside the eye sockets are topped with trans-greenish-yellow studs which make his face look eerily alive and very close to his screen appearance. It's a nice little detail that seems to not show through on pictures I've seen of the set. The legs are a little wobbly. I'm scared that he'll be leaning too far forward in about 5 years	neutral
Nice review dunamis ! I built it two weeks ago on the LEGOWORLD speedbuild in Oslo and didn´t have time to get the "feel" during that crazy race. I agree with you that the base is nice & sturdy, makes it stand real still ! I´m looking forward on your next score! Four eyes arms On copmike	positive

Thanks for the great review Oky Wan The two vehicles look quite nice for a small set and the minifigs look great! The two sided head is nice, although it would've been nice if it was a new head rather than the standard frowning face. The cyborg looks good, nice and cartoony, I like the printing on his back. The belt on the hips should be useful, not to mention the robotic hand. I assume that anything that fits into a 1x1x1 cylinder can fit in it? I hope so Thanks again Oky.

Quote But I have to say that these two small vehicles just look plain ugly IMHO, without any inspiration nor orginality Indead. The only reason to get this set is if you couldn't afford the Batcave back in 2006 and want a Mr. Freeze fig for a cheap price.

In actuality, I think that this may be my favorite Batman set of all time. I know, I know - it's a small set with crappy tiny vehicles; so it probably sucks for the fan who likes to display sets; but look at the MOCing side and you see this set has a ton of potential: -New Batman fig. Well, mainly the torso; but it looks nice, sleek, and armored! A definite plus whether you're a MOCist or batfan. -Mr. Freeze. Because nobody bought the Batcave when they should have...and by nobody I mean me. Plus, I love that head! -Cheapest way to amass the lightning piece. The other sets that have it are lolhueg (Well, not really, but I don't have $50 to toss around on a little skeleton tower...), and it's a great piece. -Two little blue gems. I may be alone on this, but those are my favorite parts (the gems), and that's my favorite color for them! <3 <3 <3 -Several other useful parts, including a +O piece in black, some light/medium blue bits from Mr. Freeze's kart, the oddly placed grappling hook, and some cheap wheels. Now, I don't know about you guys, but this is as close to a Batman Battlepack as we're going to get, lol - I'm buying at least three, maybe more once I get my summer job ^.^ (Oh, and the fact that the US price is only $10 helps a little, but this year you guys can't complain - you got practically every set first, ESPECIALLY the new castle! T.T) ~Trexxen	positive
I got this yesterday and built it this morning. Apart from the figs, it is very crappy. Mr Freeze's buggy is OK but the bat buggy is easily the worst vehicle I've seen for years. Colours are all over the place, the grappling hook feels cheaply made, the inclusion of those odd pearl silver parts which have been in the Exo-Force sets seem especially random here, the terrible Bionicle flame piece... It's the first Lego vehicle I've built where I've immediately had the urge to disassemble it and pretend I never bought it! Really, I only got it for Mr Freeze so I shouldn't complain. But still. It's a real step backwards. The comparable Catwoman dragster set was heaps better. The Penguin sub is sweet though Thanks for the review anyway!	negative
Coming in at around $50 US, Turbo Car Chase is one of the bigger of the new Agents sets. A big box with a helicopter, car, and gate in it. Seems like a winner, but how good is it really, and is it worth the cash? Let's start with the Minifigs. This set comes with a standard Inferno Henchman, Spy Clops, and Agent Chase. The Henchman is you basic LEGO criminal type with a gun and a jumpsuit, nothing real groundbreaking here. Spy Clops, on the other hand, is very cool for, technically, half of a Minifig. His head has a neat electronic goggle print and the rest of him is a torso mounted onto a set of six legs made from Exo-Force robot arms. The whole thing is really well done and neat as hell. Agent Chase (Turbo Car Chase! ) seems to have a standard agent body and a double-printed face with one side a sunglasses and headset print. The other face is a determined Agent look. The set also includes a laptop with Doctor Inferno wallpaper. The laptop is a new piece and works like the LEGO books that are in a lot of Harry Potter sets. Molding on the keyboard is really well done and the thing can be held by a Minifig along either corner, but not in the middle and not while closed. The gate in the set is nothing revolutionary by itself, and I sort of get the feeling that it was included to drive up the piece count and the set price point. That being said, there are some things to like here. For instance, the gate has four wheels of barbed wire attached to it. The barbed wire is new and makes me want to start building some World War I trench MOCs. The rest of the gate is fairly big and it has a handy ramp attached so that vehicles can roll through it easily. The main feature of the gate is a sound brick. It's much better then LEGO sound and light units of the past, when the gate is opened it depresses a button and an alert klaxon blares that sounds every bit like a prison-beak in progress. The triggering action works surprisingly well and it's pretty much for this feature alone that I'm not going to immediately break the gate back down and add it to my parts bin. The designers did make an effort to create more then just a fence though. A nice control panel connected to a big spotlight crowns the piece, and a pair of cameras watch the opening. It's really hard to mess up a LEGO helicopter, and this set is no exception. The Inferno Chopper is a nicely proportioned and well built machine. It looks properly menacing and has the uniform orange and black of other Inferno property. It's armed with a set of four Technic pegs cleverly used as guns on outriding mounts, as well as a pair of the newer-style flick-fire missiles. I personally don't care for flick-firing missiles, but these look decent enough and seem to stay put so I really can't complain about them. Along the fuselage are a pair of intake pieces that I've never seen before and I'm guessing are new. They're pretty well designed and will come in handy for MOCing down the road. The action feature of the aircraft is the wench system. This is very different then other LEGO wenches in that you build the entire mechanism and housing. You can then use it to raise Spy Clops up and down from the bottom of the chopper using the rotor. Now, this also keeps you from sitting there and just giving the rotor repeated spins to simulate flight. I'm not too thrilled with that, but there are a hundred other LEGO helicopters out there with fully rotating rotors, so I guess I can let it by just this once. As you'd suspect, the bottom of the cockpit is completely open, which makes this a vehicle pretty much solely for Spy Clops (Sorry Henchman). But there is plenty of room beneath the body to attach a plate with some seats on it to accommodate another pilot without drastically altering the design, or even removing existing pieces. The Turbo Car is a slick little honey of a LEGO car, and the silver pieces that make up the body work contribute a lot to that fact. The front license plate appears to be an Exo-Fore code brick. But it also hides the activation lever for the passenger ejector seat. The seat works about as well as the Spruce Goose, which is to say not well at all, but here it's the thought that counts. The interior of the car is really well done. There's even a radar screen for keeping track of pesky helicopters. But the Bond-like features don't end there. A lever in the compartment raises pair of guns in the hood and a knob on the rear deploys a quad rocket system with more flick-fire missiles. This is a car that won't be stopped easily! The rear has two cones sticking out. I'd like to think they're smoke nozzles or oil-slick sprayers. All-in-all, this is a really good set. The car is pure LEGO vehicle love and looks fantastic. The silver pieces are very nice and it's a shame LEGO doesn't use metallic colors in System sets more often. There are, however, a LOT of sticker for this set and I know how much that bugs a lot of people. I personally like how much detail the stickers add to these sets and don't mind them so much. The set also comes with an Agents ID card for Chase which you can put little star stickers on from other sets as you get them. It's printed on a real nice piece of sturdy plastiboard and would be cooler if you could put your own picture and name on it instead of pretending to be Chase. Sold by themselves, the car and chopper would be must-haves. All tossed together with the gate sort of makes the set a little less then the sum of it's parts. And with 498 parts (most of them small) that's not so hot. It's only slightly over-priced in my opinion, but if you do shell out the money you won't regret it. I'm very comfortable recommending this set to anyone. Close to perfect, but the price and some minor flaws bring it back just a little. I'd say 4.33, but out of 5 is close enough!	positive

Deinonychus, on May 23 2008, 10:12 PM, said: Pics and thoughts tomorrow! I picked up this set earlier in the week and was quite pleased with it (in fact I have missions 1-5 and am happy with all of them - this series is much better than the old Alpha Team ever was). I look forward to reading your thoughts on it. I will say 2 things about it now though. 1)My set came with defective instructions. In 2 places pages are missing and duplicates of other pages repeated. For instance, the car instructions are missing steps 16-21. Fortunately, I was able to make out what pieces went where in the missing steps by studying the illustration in step 22. I hope you have better luck with your instructions. 2)This set contains the best LEGO sound brick ever (it's just begging to be incorporated into my Arkham Asylum).	positive
Mr. Mandalorian, on May 24 2008, 11:58 AM, said: What is a sound brick? Ditto. Maybe its like the Exo-Force light-up brick, only with sound instead of light. That would kick [INNAPROPRIATE WORD DELETED].	neutral
WOW! Thanks, Deino, for this great review! I can't wait to get this myself, but right now I gotta save for the CW sets! The car is with no doubt one of the most mind blowing things TLG has come up with and we can only hope that there will be more models made out of almost only metalic colors! The spider cyborg, while not as innovative as some of the other cyborgs, is a very nice fig, and his head will be very usefull for Splinter Cell MOCs! And those intake pieces are only relatively new btw, they are in almost all of the current $10 Racers sets. Any chance of you taking a pic of a line-up of all the silver parts in this set? Edited by Oky Wan Kenobi, 24 May 2008 - 11:32 PM.	positive
Great review, Deino! Man, that car is just so beautiful, and the helicopter is nice too. Unfortunately, this seems pretty pricy, and I hardly think I'll be getting it any time soon, what with my limited budget and all. Still, it's great to see how well Agents is shaping up.	positive
I love it ! Fun, playable, cool looking, and killer minifigs! Sweet!	positive
Wow, thanks for the great review Deino This set is really a must have for me. The sound brick seems great, the helicopter looks very nice and the car is superb! All of the James Bond features are really cool, though I'm very interested in how the ejector seat works (or doesn't work..). The car itself is very sleek and full of beautiful silver, and the inclusion of the new rims and windshield mean that I won't have to buy many Speed Racer sets. As for the minifigs, they all look great, especially SpyClops. Though it looks rather easy for him to fall off of his spider legs. Can you confirm this? A great review of a great set, thanks Deinonychus	positive
ES.JPG 47.94K 110 downloads The ejector seat A long Technic axle runs the length of the front of the car. It comes in to the seat area here and nests into the gray joint which is attached to the small gray Technic beam. The beam is attached to the ejector seat (bottom white 3x2 plate) with a Technic pin. The seat, in turn, is attached to the side of the car with a Technic pin. The result is, when the axle is pushed forward, the gray joint and beam tilt the seat and "eject" a Minifig. After about 20 shots the Minifig only went outside of the car 3 times...the rest of the time he just bounced around the inside of the car. So they get an A for effort, but an F for execution	neutral
Thanks for the great review! I'm really liking these agents sets the more i see them. The car seems to have alot of features. Its to bad the the ejection seat doesn't work as well as one would hope. Oh well. Makes me want the big rig even more now!	positive
Thanks for your great review! It looks very nice indeed! The gate have very interesting mechanism. The car looks very slick and cool. It looks like those typical kind of James Bond car. This review gives me very good insights.	positive

MacK, on May 26 2008, 01:30 PM, said: You cannot say that the battle pack contains the same amount of stuff that the other two sets have and therefore should be priced the same. It just seems that Lego is ripping off Canadian army builders, to me if the battle pack contained a small catapult, or wall so that it contained about the same amount of stuff that the other sets had it would be fair. It seems stupid that you will only get minifigs from one set, while you can get about the same amount of minifigs plus a bunch of other stuff from two other equally priced sets. That’s why to me these battle packs are a rip off, because of what they contain, IMHO the Battle Packs seem to be only worth about 10 dollars. MacK, I can understand your concern when pricing is concerned. Pricing is always a big issue for us to determine whether to buy or not to buy a certain set in a particular country. Pricing varies differently across different countries such as US, Europe, Canada, Australia and etc. This is something very hard for us to decide on. We can't be sure why TLC placed their pricing strategies this way. Well, I think we should appericate what TLC is trying to do for us, by not using price as the only factor to judge whether to buy this set or not. At least, I am sure there are many of us trying to request for battlepacks to muster armies for their MOCs, Armies Collection and etc. Different people have different judgements towards different sets and different themes. I respect your opnion. IMO, let's don't let price be the only determined factor to decide whether to purchase a particular set or not. Instead, consider an array of factors that is offered. However, I do know that consumers like me and you are always affected by price. iamded, on May 26 2008, 01:40 PM, said: Thanks for the review Whitefang! Your additions look great, I like your mace much better than the use of a small technic cog, your looks much sturdier. And that helmet looks really great on skellie soldiers, I never thought to use that before. Very cool indeed! iamded, I am glad you enjoyed the review and my slight modifications. That mace was a much looking weapon. It looks much firm than the orignal look. The design was inspired from Dwarf Mine and Dwarf Mine Defender. I would not want to have so many troll flags hanging around. The nose cone helmet, was to give the soliders a whole new look. To me, it retains the classic look, yet it belongs to present theme, suitable for my Skeleton Elite Guards.	negative
Thanks for sharing these close-up images of this battlepack WhiteFang. I actually had this set in my hand at Legoland Cal. and could not decide if I wanted it.

For those of you who buy so many of this and the other battle pack with Crownies, what do you do with all of them? Is this simply to create a large-scale army, or do you plan to build large castle scenes with all the figs. I'd love to see some pictures (on the "share your castle army" thread).	neutral

Great review! I just barly missed the Jungle series, growing up with half a year of Jungle and mainly Orient Expedition and Dino Island. I like Egypt more, but this set (despite the 4x4 palm tree) is practically perfect. I love the detail and vibrant colours. Gotta say, I've got a thing for Pippin Reed myself. By the way, what does "VHTF" mean? Edited by sdpirate, 28 May 2008 - 01:06 AM.	positive
VHTF= Very Hard to Find. To answer some earlier replies... No, there are no stickers in this set. While some Adventurers sets of the era had stickers (the 5956 Zeppelin had tons), all of the interesting mesoamerican designs from this set are printed. Also, simonwillems was correct; my mechanic is missing his hat, which should be a black kepi. They're extremely expensive on BL, though (proving once again that this set has some awesome parts), so I ordered a replacement from Lego. It's in the mail and should come soon.	positive

So i just piced up a new digital camera and i thought what better way to try it than doing a review of my newest set. The new 7738 Coast Guard Helicopter! itsmy first review, so go easy on me! lets start off with the small stuff. First the mini figs. You get 4 figs total. Two helicopter pilots, a diver and a civilan to rescue. The torso's are nothing new on the pilot and diver. Same ones as in the last coast guard line. But i like the colors alot better in this coast guard line than the previous generation. The yellow and blue really work well together and the coloring on the badge looks great! The civilian looks to be just a dock worker with an overall torso and a beenie. The diver has nice vented helmet and a pair of flippers that suits his duty perfect! Next we have an absolute work of lego art. The rescue raft! The orange flaps can be moved back for easy entry to the raft, as well as the white "support" beams with the caution tape. I put support in perenthaces cause they really don't support anything. Just there to fill in the gaps. At the top of the raft is a red locator beacon, ccommunications antenna, and a cargo loop for lifting the raft. lets move on to the interior of the raft. Not much here. But you can see the techinc beam that attaches to the top loop,and to the floor of the raft. So far this has proven to be very sturdy and has supported the full weight of the raft quite well. You can also see the white box that holds the equipment of the raft. Here you can see the life saver tube. Here's a shot with our dock worker peaking out the side. The raft says max ocupants 4, but with the storage box, that might be a tight fit. Now lets move on to the Helicopter! in my opinion this is one of the best helicopters TLC has come out with to date. I really felt they captured the look and proportions of a real Coast Guard helicopter. it uses a lower hull and tail section of the new airliner, and cargo airplane. It really seems to work well with this application. The engines have good detail using new "cheese graders" as vents, as well as the new engine stacks that come in the new speed racer sets. The rotors also appear to be new as well. lets move on to the cockpit. We have two seats for our pilots with a sticker sheet for intruments on a flat 4 wide plate. There's also an antena being used as a flight stick. Another shot with our pilots at the helm. Now lets moveon to the high lihgt of this heavy lifting machine. The med bay, and lifting winch. http://www.brickshel...icopter_020.jpg here you can see the winch arm at rest, along with the medical strechter. The bad part is that the med. strechter doesn't include the ussually included fold away wheels. here's a shot with the winch arm extened ready for rescue! In the second shot you can see the drum that the wire coils up in. It coils up via a recently new power functions "pull" back motor. To operate, just pull out the winch cable, hook on your load, and presse this orange button on the side... The bad part of the new power functions winch is that although its very smooth in its operation, its not very strong. It will only lift the raft a couple inches before it runs out of torque. It also has a tendency to want to pull the crane arm backin while its lifting. It doesn't matter if its a light load, or heavy load. The bay doors open on both sides for easy postioning of the figures and accses to the strechter. Here we have our diver looking over his rescue-e. Nice and roomy if you don't mind a crane arm being in your way!! At $39.99 and a peice count of 445, i felt this set was a great good considering what your getting. The raft construction is very creative and is probbly the highlight of the set by itself. The helicopter is probbly one of the best, if not the best helicopter TLC has ever came out with if you can get over its size. in a scale of one to five.... Price- Peice count- Playability- Design- overall- .5 I would have given it a full 5 out of five, but since the winch can't pull the raft all the way, it didn't fell it right. Even with this minor flaw, i still highly recomend this set!	neutral
Wow. I was skeptical of this Coast Guard line. Though getting to see some detailed pictures of this set I really want to get get it. Alas, I have not the money to get it and it isn't available in my town. Oh well. Maybe I can catch it on a sale at some point. Good review!	positive

Klaus-Dieter There is no real way to lift up the stretcher. Due to the crane arm being in the way there really isn't any room for any kind oflifting straps. The set does include a 1x2 plate with a hinge for the diver to stand on so at least he can hold on to someone, the crane lifts them up and then he can put them in the strechter. Thats my guess at least. As far as the motor, i don't believe it uses bateries since you pull out the motor, and all the button does is recoil the winch line back in. I have to say it does a very good job of that, and is very smooth. (as long as you don't have anything to heavy) One detail i forgot to meation is the shark. Its nothing new, just the basic shark lego has had around for nealy 2 decades, but it was a detail nothing less.	neutral
Nice review! The helicopter reminds a Sikorsky chopper,isn't it?	positive
I could tell from the pictures that a lot (maybe all) the designs on the raft were stickers. In the whole set are there any printed parts besides the torsos or is it all stickers?	negative
This is a very good review, thank you! But I have some questions about the grey new parts in the life raft. Are they 1x1 like their counterparts with the clips or 1x2? And can they be held by a minifig by the handle? If so, these could be very useful for brick-build weapons & tools! Also, I'm looking forward to some orange ETA 2 Jedi Interceptor MOCs now! Who wants to be the first to make one? BTW, which Jedi has an orange ETA 2?	positive
I noticed that you said the torsos are the same as the last line; the last line had orange torsos, this one has yellow torsos. -Chuck	negative
What an outstanding copter! I love it. The orange looks fantastic. This is probably Lego's best copter to date. Thanks for sharing the review. I would definately recommend that you downsize your pictures a bit though.	positive

Thank you for clearing that up I felt that it was OK to review an old topic, as stated, rather than just go ahead and start a new one. A shame that this set, as all other Batman sets, have gone up so highly in value but still all things considering (general after market Lego price hikes) it is still a wonderfull set even with its market value today (that is if you can ignore the MRSP).	positive
I bought this off ebay, while not having been collecting space as a child, it was mainly Wild West and City... I have decided, upon reading KDog's M:Tron Bar Brawl Mania strip in his Space Comic, to buy as many M:Tron sets and figures I could find.. except I got distracted and bought some different sets as well... To start off with, here's a picture of the box: Here's a general shot showing the entire set: A front view: The buggy: Another shot of the buggy without the minifig: The flyer: The flyer without the Minifig: M:Tron crate with some equipment and hoses, I don't know the use of the hoses though : The cockpit open: The cockpit closed with the crew: The Magnetic crane: Another shot of the Crane: Rear View with Hatch open: One of the side slots that can carry either the Buggy or the Flyer: Top view of this excellent Vehicle: Excellent for getting Spyrius or Blacktron out of your way : Final shot: Excellent set, one of the biggest space ground vehicles and one of the best sets made by LEGO. Undoubtably better than it's newer counterpart the MT-101 Armored Drilling unit.... A great addition to any collection and has a lot of cool neat features that make it have a lot of playability. Simply excellent! Five out of Five!	positive

It is just so dense when you build it, full of nice surprises, no technique required, and a wonderful stearing mechanism that I rank as more important than the suspension of the mars version. This thing was meant to crush anyway, who needs suspension? I also like the way you never felt that the M-trons deserved a base after building this, it was that good... The colour scheme was perfect... It's space and I like it... enough said Great review BTW God Bless, Nathan Naturally you're entitled to your inferior opinion...	positive
I love the design of the front canopy of this set, but I always felt that they could have done more with the rest of the model. This set is good candidate for customization though. There is quite a bit on unused space inside, especially in the middle section. I want to try putting a Technic-style engine into mine at some point, along with the necessary gearing. I got my MCM brand new off ebay some years ago for a pretty good price, but the box was very worn out and the big trans-neon panel, which floats freely inside the box, was a bit damaged. As for the hose/jetpack things, I always assumed that they were either welding torches or flamethrowers. Take your pick. Quote Kinda sad to think that with TLC's recent ban on magnets in their products First time I've heard of that. What are they going to do for the train couplings?	neutral
CP5670, on May 28 2008, 08:52 PM, said: First time I've heard of that. What are they going to do for the train couplings? New couplings are going to be available soon. There is a thread with pictures of the new couplings here.	neutral
Fluyt, on May 28 2008, 01:56 PM, said: Since when is that? The new train couplings have magnets, only with a special casing. You're right, I should have clarified -- it's the old loose magnets that apparently are being discontinued, not all magnets altogether. As you noted, the new train couplings still have magnets, but they appear to be permanently attached to a fairly large housing, which I guess will prevent kids from eating them. But the old M:Tron round magnet pieces are presumably discontinued.	neutral
It looks like you're right about the old magnets. I got a few off PAB two months ago but they no longer have them. I guess I should grab some while they're still widely available on Bricklink, as they can be useful in a number of situations. On a side note, one interesting thing about this set is that it seemingly had two US/Canada names, Mega Core Magnetizer and Multi Core Magnetizer. Brickset, Lugnet and all the other sites I've seen call it Mega, but I have some North American catalogs from that time period that call it Multi and the box also says Multi on it. I actually didn't know the Mega name at all until many years after the M:Tron line.	neutral
Asuka, on May 30 2008, 02:17 AM, said: Of course I don´t want to offend some Technic lovers, and although I always was more the System kind of guy, why can´t they just use some technic beams with studs at least?

Harley & Mistah J. I want to preface my review by admitting that I’m an unrepentant Harley Quinn fanboy. I’ve been enamored with the character since she first appeared in Batman: The Animated Series back in the 90’s, and I’ve since followed her misadventures through her introduction into the regular Batman series during No Man’s Land, into her own series, and even on the short-lived and not-so-good Birds of Prey TV show. So please excuse any pro-Harley bias. So, down to business. The 267 piece set retails for $30 US ($35 at Toys R Us) and builds up very fast and easy. It consists of Batman’s Bat Cycle, Harley’s Hammer Truck, and brand new Batman and Harley Quinn Minifigs. There is also no lack of weapons. In addition to the usual bag of Bat-accessories and guns, the set also comes with a pair of gray revolvers. Batman in this set has the new “armor” torso print and the hips are the same color as the legs, hinting that this is supposed to represent the movie style Batsuits more so then the traditional comic book “underwear over tights” look. Harley Quinn is a very cool looking Minifig, and I haven’t grinned so much at a new Batman character figure since my first Batman Minifig a couple years ago. The figure is very true to the character, and the torso has been accented with a few shape lines to try and distinguish her as a female despite the boxy body. Harley’s jester cap is an interesting new piece. It seems (to me at least) to be made of a slightly different grade of plastic then we’re used to. It’s molded in red and painted with black and white, and it comes packed in its own separate little baggie. I expect that this piece may have cost LEGO a little more then usual to produce. Harley also has a buildable accessory, a giant mallet. Sure, she can’t stand up all that well unless it’s held in specific ways, but it’s neat and most importantly, it’s funny. It’s especially fun for smacking the everloving crap out of other Minifigs with. The Bat Cycle is in bag number one and is a very fast build. This isn’t some little Japanese sport bike like Nightwing’s cycle. This monster is almost a car and seems to pack just the right amount of intimidation for the Caped Crusader to exploit. Thanks to the thick tires (two in front, one in back) it stands up just fine on its own and rolls very well. The huge exhaust pipes are a nice touch and give the thing a look of engine power. The only real flaw is the inclusion of the flick-fire missiles mounted on the sides. But, as with any LEGO model, they can be easily left out without hurting the look of the vehicle. The hammer truck is the bulk of this set and a lot more fun then it looks. Of the monster truck persuasion, the vehicle is designed and built with a surprising level of solidity. The axle mounts are particularly impressive. The big wheels and tires just beg you to drive this thing right over the Bat Cycle (or Batman). The mega-mallet gimmick is also a surprise. Not so much for its technical complexity, there isn’t any really, but for the fact that once you start turning the knob at the rear to swing the mallet back and forth, it’s really a lot of fun. There are some low points to the truck design. Again the flick-fire missiles are tacked on and there’s a cargo crate/bed set into the back for Harley’s loot of jewels. The crate would have looked a lot better molded in black. In brown it breaks up the look of the truck a little. Speaking of which, the look of the truck is very pleasing. The red and black Harley Quinn color scheme works really well on the vehicle. There are a few stickers here, and unfortunately, the diamond patterned ones are applied over multiple bricks. The rest, however, are great. Not only does she have an “I Love Joker” bumper sticker, but she has a Joker playing card taped to her dash, I guess serving as a picture of her beloved Puddin’. There is also a sticker for activation of the hammer, which boldly shouts HIT ME! This is a fun set. A neat new Batman vehicle and a big truck with lots of playability. The Harley Minifig is a must-have for any Bat-Fan and, if you only get one of the Batman sets this year, I’d recommend this one. The price versus piece-count on this set is a little bit of a deterrent though. This might not be the best set for collectors on a budget or people looking for something completely new and innovative, but anyone buying this for a child can rest assured that the kid will get your money’s worth out of the set through its play value. When added together and averaged out, the pros and cons of this set combine to give it a score of out of 5. Even if Harley herself is a clean 6 out of 5	positive

Wow! Great review of what seems to be a great set. I love that ponytail. This looks to be a must have set! (It probably won't stay together for long though...) Thanks very much.

Excellent review by an excellent reviewer on and excellent set. This theme really does seem to be one of TLC's best. Edited by Plural, 31 May 2008 - 03:24 PM.	positive
I first I thought the whole Agents line would not be very good. But boy have I changed my mind! This set looks amazing, as do all of the other sets in the line. I really like how the small vehicles all fit into the truck. I don't like it when sets come with smaller vehicles and don't have anywhere to store them, so they just float on the side. That light projector is fantastic! I can't believe they are actually printed! This is definitly on my to-buy list! Thanks for the amazing review!	positive
Thank you for that fine review, svelte_corps. That´s a pretty cool set, much more solid than the Armoured Drilling Unit, with a nice little transporter and some for sure pretty interesting additional power functions. A very smart idea indeed! Did I miss something or is there really only one (and probably improved) shooting device? And there´re even some levers to control the vehicles.... wow. A matured MarsMission on indeed! Now let´s get rid of these poor utilized jellies and we´re right on the way....	positive
Iron Moose, on Jun 4 2008, 11:28 AM, said: So, is there some way to get all those motor bits at once, or do you have to buy them on their own? I don't think I've ever seen them in a store here... Only from S@H so far, or if you buy sets which they come in. All the ones you need (apart from one additional small motor) are available in the 4958 Monster Dino set (which I got half price). I ordered the extra from S@H at the same time I bought the set - but only because I had already looked at the instructions and knew what I needed. (If people have the Ferris Wheel set as well I think the small motor comes in that.)	neutral

Thanks for the great review Sveltecorps. I bought some of the MM last year and ended up selling them off for SW. This new set has got me interested in MM again, partly due to your cool review! One question though, Did you get this set in Aust shops or S@H, just wondering if i should be looking for it yet?

Excellent review. Loving. This. Set. I mean, come on, it's a flipping tank! Awesomeness is written all over this - from all those blades and scoops at the front to the mini rover. And yes, you can even turn it into a motorized battle tank! Reminds me of the old technic days when they advertised in the manuals how to hook up the kits with separately sold motors. Another day, another review of an awesome set. Yes, this is sure TLC's year!	positive

No, but this IS one of the most anticipated sets of 08...	neutral
Thanks for the great and very detailed review. I love the new holostickers! I'm still not sold on this set though. I'm not sure why... I think it's the big wing piece and the too-technicy build (from looking at the instructions). The platform seems kind of out of place. And for the size of the set, the functionality doesn't seem as good as it could be. It reminds me of 7699 Armored Drilling Unit - looks impressive but doesn't seem to do that much. I do think Mars Mission has improved this year though. Bar none, this is the weakest of the new MM sets I think.	negative
Mr. Mandalorian, on Jun 4 2008, 01:19 AM, said: And then we have this thing. What is it? Defense laser? Communications array? Satellite T.V.? That certainly feels like an homage to the Deep Freeze Defender... which itself feels like an homage to the Galaxy Commander.

Iron Moose, on Jun 4 2008, 02:34 AM, said: That certainly feels like an homage to the Deep Freeze Defender... which itself feels like an homage to the Galaxy Commander. Thats the observation I had when I saw the first pictures of this set online a few months ago. I am a proud owner of the 6973 Deep Freeze Defender and 6980 Galaxy Commander, so I'm looking forward to see how the 7644 stacks up next to them. There is a definite lineage here, and these sets clearly demonstrate the evolution of Lego set design over the years. The MX-81 may not have the most playability out of all the new MM sets (although it has ALOT from what I can tell), but its hard to beat the look of a large sleek space cruiser sitting on your shelf or dresser, at least for myself. Anyhow, this is my first post to the forum and hope my welcome won't wear out here anytime soon. Edited by Spacefan, 04 June 2008 - 06:43 PM.	positive

Iron Moose, on Jun 4 2008, 02:15 PM, said: Do tell. (I'm being curious, not confrontational. ) Well, first and foremost like many other people I'm no fan of those dreaded unprinted minifig torsos and stickers. But also the cost to piece ratio of the set, it just seems too expensive for everything that you get, such as too many small parts and a lighter than usual piece count for the price. Though if it had included printed minifigs and other elements, I maybe would of been able to swallow its 100 USD cost a little easier. But Star Justice is still Lego SPACE in the most classic sense thats available today, and I will probably pony it up just because... Anyway, I hope were not breaking Forum protocol by not discussing the 7644 review of the original poster or that particular set in general.	neutral
Thanks for the review. I actually quite like this. I can't afford it, so I'm not getting too attached to it, but in its own way, it's great. It's certainly reminiscent of Space sets of the past, as others have said, and the drop-down ramp section is just really cool. As an idea, you understand. Sure, the lab is a little crap, but at least the effort was made (sort of ). The sheer fact that it's so big though, really makes me like this. There's just something appealing about large spaceships. Not capital ships, just big space ships. With lots of guns! Spacefan, on Jun 4 2008, 10:34 PM, said: Anyway, I hope were not breaking Forum protocol by not discussing the 7644 review of the original poster or that particular set in general. Hey, it's no worse than Batbrick and I. No, really, it isn't even in the same league!	positive
Thank you for that nice review, Mr. Mandalorian. Wow. Somehow it´s almost like Classic Space´s back indeed.... It´s a great star ship. It looks stream lined, original and impressive and even the huge plane wing part looks rather cool and smooth on it. It´s equipped at least with some kind of engines on top of the wings and although they´re made with only two a little 'juniorized' parts it´s better than nothing. There´s a lab or some sort of engine room with enough space inside to allow one or two MFs to play Scotty.... yeah! The two cockpits´re nicely detailed with a cool use of these orange 1x1 round plates and to detach one or all two of them reminds a lot of the playability of the good old Space sets. It seems even like it´s easy to attach them to some kind of Cloud City Twin-Pod Car thanks these hinged wings. Looks like some solid fun to me. Of course.... the cockpits aren´t airtight and even this reminds unfortunately of the post blue, grey and trans yellow era of CS. Anyway, there´s no real fun without some MODing I guess. Another great advantage of the set´s that it´s not overpacked with shooting things. One technic shooter, cool in grey and only one trans orange prison pod too. Well, I can surely live with that especially since it´s nicely asymmetrical. The drill rover´s very charming, a little like a rebuilt Oldsmobile Convertibe stranded on Mars. Sweet! And that platform feature´s plain nifty and well done too, very playable and useable for a lot of things. Hmm.... recently I complained a lot about the dense use of studless technic beams for the inner structure of vehicles like these ExoForce tanks par exemple which makes MODing (in an economical way) pretty frustrating.... but the beams here´re used in a very proper way. It should be fairly easy to MOD, let´s say, the back of that lab section up to perhaps even the cockpits to create a larger airtight area that could be boarded from the platform.... just to fit this certain spacers need for, um, realism.... There´re many more nice details too like that 'satelite t.v.' thingy and that cylinder with trans blue 2x2 dish for the knob or these cylinders with cones on that handle, and that Alien craft´s pretty nice and detailed as well. Like I said before.... I really feel like Classic Space´s back.	positive
Hey, thanks guys. So you tolerated the bar jokes and faded lighting? radiant7, on Jun 3 2008, 09:01 PM, said: I appreciate your review Mr. Mandalorian, but why the negativity?. I'd try to find more positives about the set instead of kinda criticizing it after each picture. I personally think it looks freakin' awesome!. The size is very impresive and I nearly fell of my chair when I saw the first pics earlier this year. It's quite unlike anything I've ever seen from Lego. Algernon, on Jun 4 2008, 06:34 AM, said: I don't understand why there's so much negativity... this is actually my favorite of the new MM sets. The finished look is very sleek and not very gappy at all. The deployable landing pad is great, and it'll make it easy to put on a shelf without taking too much room. Lots of greebles... although I will concede that it's just begging to be modded. Still, though, I'm definitely buying this one. :) It has a really great look to it! Spacefan, on Jun 4 2008, 10:38 AM, said: I don't understand the negativity either, one man's treasure is another man's trash I suppose. That said, having grown up with Lego during the 80's this set has a certain nostalgia factor in its overall look and feel that harkens back to that earlier period in my life which I fondly remember. Aside from the Factory Star Justice set (elements of which I loathe), I expect the 7644 to be the closest thing to a Classic Space revival that we'll ever see again from the Lego Group, but I hope to be pleasantly suprised someday. Though I'm not living in the past, and do appreciate everything Lego is doing now and will do, and has done since. And, like you, I'm one who's definitely buying this set. No matter how few of us there may be. I'm sorry you guys thought I was being negative- I actually love the set. It brings a real feel of Classic Space to MM (No, I'm NOT talking in the third person. ). However, it does have its own small issues, which are nothing, really. I said that there's not much of a lab- but that's the beauty of lego. There's a lot of room in the ship, so it should be a piece of cake to mod to a bigger lab. Too many bars? I'll take them off. I really like the set, I just want to change it to suit my tastes. It looks beautiful- It will find a home among my other MM sets as a favorite. Iron Moose: Good question. It's about 17 inches wide, 11 inches tall (with ramp down), and 16 inches wide. As for the platform, it's pretty stable. It tilts back a small degree so it doesn't collapse when tapped on the nose, but I wouldn't leave it on the edge of a table while in that position.	neutral
I think this thing is compensating the poor lab with the bar army.	positive
Hello SheFOLS and AFOLS, as well as TFOLS, welcome to EB News Reviews, I am your host...For tonight anyway... Shadows will take over after this episode, if we make more... Today we are reviewing Mars Impulse sets 5616 and 5617. Starting with 5617 Alien Jet, I must say it is a small and quick build, the jellie, is made of hard plastic, which surprised me, as I had expected Jellies to be a soft plastic. The jet is mainly 2x4 plates, some swingy hinges, the "seatbelt" and a thing which I cannot seem to name My one gripe about it is that the Jelly cant see where he is flying, it looks better with a MF in it. There was a red 1x1 as a spare part. We move on to the 5616 Mini Robot, which is basically a "safe" brick, with binoculars, soem cheese slopes, little arms, and legs. The best part i must say was the metal detector and "safe" brick, as these seem to be quite rare in sets (By my knowlage anyway). The austronaut has a face, shown in Dr. Sinsters review. The set also comes with a pick-axe and lime green gem. Extra peices where a cheese slope, a green 1x1 and a white droid arm. That concludes these mini-reviews. I also will use this opportunity to show my photo setup. Both sets are reccomended, if you either need a army, or are just trying to get a variaty of figs like myself.

A very nice little review of a pretty nice little set that I wish I'd bought between 1 and 10 of. Just for the griffin. Oh well. Your review has shown me that it's useful for more than just that, so maybe I'll try to pick one up someday. Can't have too many black capes, books, or printed things. Speaking of which: WhiteFang, on Jun 9 2008, 09:41 AM, said: Interesting parts It comes with a wizard book, owl, 2 printed tiles with a spider and stone prints on it. The far right, seriously I don't find any good use for it. Can any EB members enlighten me on that gray thing on the right? The gray thing is technically a plume, like any castle plume, except in this case it's a feather (presumably from the griffin), and made from the mold to the old Indian feathers in the Wild West sets. It's a case of an old part coming back for a slightly new use, in a new colour. Beyond that, the "stone print" tile is a bundle or rolled up blanket or package, depending on where it's used. I don't think it's ever meant to be a stone. It was used as a rolled up pack on the back of the Star Wars speederbikes, for example. Nice pics, plenty of useful information. I'd give this review an A+ Thanks for doing it!	neutral
Ohhh great idea to review the "old" Potter sets! Especially the line from Prisoner of Azkaban... I was in my Dark Ages then. Luckily I was able to catch up on the missed figs with one internet order. This Draco is the best TLC has made, if you ask me. The new one (also doubling for Belloq and "guards" in the Indy line) doesn't look quite as hautain as this one. Buckbeak looks cool. Looks like his neck/head can be moved, right? Rather similar to LEGO horses. Well designed. The orange brick doesn't have a pumpkin face on it, right? Unlike the one from Philosopher's Stone in the set with the troll. I'm looking forward to more reviews by you, sir WhiteFang! Good work	positive

Great review. The hippy and the "story" at the end were hilarious. I think this was easily the best of the Spiderman 2 sets. You're right though - it wasn't movie acurate, as the actual movie dock was far shabbier and more trashed than this. Ah well, I guess TLC couldn't do everything.	positive

I picked up this set mainly because of the many (5+spare) glow in the dark parts and the promise of 2 racers and one helicopter for the price of a little more than two racers (90kr. vs. 2x40kr.) The box The back of the box shows the two alternate models you can build if the polybags rip. There are 3 cheese slopes and two 1x2 tiles that glow in the dark, where the tiles are exclusive for this set. The total parts count is high at 142, but there are no really big pieces among them. Inside the box you will find the building instructions, a sheet with some odd sticky labels (thrown away) and 3 polybags marked by the bag building difficulty. The models The lime colored car doesn't bring out anything new. We have seen racers built like that before, but it does contain some nice bricks for the collection. The police cruiser surprises with an interesting design along the sides as seen here. It is harder to build because of the greater level of details: The helicopter is without doubt the hardest vehicle to build in a bag. I can't finish it because it's larger than the bag. You can't put on the top blades nor the tail of the thing, so it beats the forklift from 7733 where the top bar is the new kind that doesn't completely fit. There is also instructions for the alternate models, but it requires the bags to be opened... The vehicles are pretty standard for the racers theme with the police car being the highlight of the set Conclusion I like the difficulty curve between bag 1 and 2, but the last bag should be labeled 1000000 instead of 3. It requires some inhuman skills to build that helicopter in the bag... ? Lime colored car: 3 - We have seen it before, but it has some nice pieces... and lime. Police Cruiser: 9 - It has a massive diffusers, rare parts and a high level of details. It is a shame LEGO relies so much on stickers. Helicopter: 6 - if you see it as a set for one fourth of the price of the cars, it is quite amazing, but you can't bag build it and I would personally prefer some more detail instead of the big size. Overall it is a nice little set, but the police car is the main attraction. I wouldn't get the other vehicles if they were sold separately.

7656 General Greivous's Starfighter Release: 2007 Number of Pieces: 232 Minifigs: 1 Brickset Welcome! This is my first review, so contstructive critisism is very much appreciated! On to the review: First, we start out with the box: The box art is the same as always since 2006. nothing special. Then we start the build. The build is fairly easy, and will take the seasoned builder about 15-20 min to complete. Here is the finished model: and bird's eye view: As you can see, this ship is very sleek. The fins or "wings" each have an outer slope and an inner one, with the guns in between. There are also cones on the front of the fins, which give the ship an even more sleek look. In the middle of the wings there is the main body, with a big slope and stripes decorating it. This set has a very good playability factor, as I'm about to show you now. The guns on the ship are pretty cool looking to begin with; a bley slope attaching a lightsaber hilt and a trans-neon green stud to the fin on each side. But theres more than what meets the eye: Yes, the guns flip up! ...and they can flip all the way back to hide them, for whatever case they need hiding. Lets have a look at the back, there is a tail fin used as landing gear and some lightspeed boosters: But wait... The tail fin can flip up for flight thanks to a hinge attached to the back of the cockpit. Heres another playability factor: The cockpit can slide open very smoothly and easily. Heres how this is possible: A clever system under the hood allows the cockpit to open. See those two bley pieces on the black ones? Those bley ones attach to the tan plates under the hood, and the hood and windsheild attach to the black peices. The black and bley pieces work together as a sliding system, so the cockpit opens. Viola! And then the cockpit snaps in place thanks to the red hook and clip. Its a very accurate system, and works very well. You'll want to open and close it over and over again! Now, finnaly to the fig: The General himself. A very impressive fig, with a new head and torso mold. In this set, (which is one of only two with Greivous in it) he comes with 2 green and two blue lightsabers, all with bley hilts ( ). I was hoping for chrome hilts, but its a minor fault. Grievous also comes with a new mold pistol blaster (not pictured). Heres the General in the cockpit (sadly a weak cockpit, no details): He just half lays down on a small slope. In this set, he doesnt come with a cape beacuse with it on, the cockpit doesnt close. Thats about it, heres the... FINAL VERDICT: Build: 7/10 Fairly easy but fun. A little bit weak. Playability: 8/10 Many playability factors, but some are boring or pointless. Swooshability: 8/10 very fun to fly around, sometimes pieces break off. Minifigs: 10/10 one amazing fig with 4 lightsabers and a new blaster. what more could you ask for? Design: 9/10 very sleek, but hardly any real texture. i like it, but others might want greebling. Price: 10/10 Overall Score: 9/10 A very cool ship with a very cool minifig and accessories. One of the best SW sets I have ever seen for its small price I highly recommend it to any kind of SW, LEGO, or SW LEGO fan. Hope you enjoyed my review, please leave feedback!

Thanks for the review. Bearing in mind that the whole point of this set is to get a cheap troll warrior, I actually quite like it. The cart isn't brilliant, but for 13 pieces it's not that bad. The troll fig is great as always, and I guess the rats are always nice to get (not so much in real life though). The sets that contain the trolls have a fairly solid number each (I mean, Tower Raid has three!), but nevertheless I think I may have to pick up a few of these. WhiteFang, on Jul 2 2008, 02:49 PM, said: In addition, the flick missile really works. Use a little bit of force from your finger and flick it, the missile will fly. Well, it certainly does not impress me at all with such playing feature. The troll's hands are going to get quite sore then aren't they?	positive
Its a good review but you forgot another thing. THE Troll needs a shiled like they used to in the 2007 castle line the sets always had shields for the minifigs and it could be better if it was 3.00 instead of 3.50 but yes it is a good impulse great army builder.	positive
A more affordable troll warrior for those of us avoiding the large sets (me) is always nice! Thanks for the review! God Bless, Nathan	positive

Guys, thanks for your kind comments. It seemed most of us here love this impulse set, mainly to build army. Guess, I am a little bit too critic in my review. I was expecting a little bit more! Nevertheless, I intend to buy multiple sets of this and build on my orc armies and split them into different battalions. This is indeed one of the better ways to acquire orcs.

Opps, I was eager to do a review as well, when I bought these sets. I hope you enjoyed reading this comprehensive review. Nikola Bathory, on Jul 3 2008, 04:08 PM, said: Hey, your review is great (as usual!!) As for the set itself - well, it's an impulse set after all - small and cheap, nothing special. Well, the rat is special, hehe, for me the rat is the most interesting in the set (cause I don't have a rat). I don't have a troll warrior either, but I'm not very interested. Give the new theme a chance. I feel TLG have made an effort to revive certain elements that are present in past castle themes. Although it is not as good as the past, but it is certainly better than the recent castle themes. Shoc, on Jul 4 2008, 01:00 AM, said: Why is mouse friendlier than rat? Well, mouse sounded more friendly, because it can associate with Tom and Jerry. But, calling it a rat equal calling it a pest.. It's just a matter of putting it in different terms. That's all. Edit: Instead of posting another post to explain why I used mouse. I will write it here. Tom and Jerry is reflected as a cartoon. Children associate Jerry as a mouse, since its supposed to be heart-warming and make us laugh. In real life, there are many different pets we raised. One of the possible pets we considered is a mouse. Mouse are supposed to be shy and friendly creatures that live in harmony. While rats lived in packs, hunt food in the dark and is widely regarded as a "pest". In this review, I am trying to illustrate rat and associate it with mouse by presenting it in a much friendly approach. There is no right or wrong answer. It's just making use of different words to represent how I feel towards a particular thing. Edited by WhiteFang, 04 July 2008 - 08:08 AM.	positive

Looking at this is making me want to build one of the favourite sets of my childhood, 6649 Street Sweeper (might do that today actually). Cheap. good pieces (despite the lack of a bin lid... that's just inviting disaster isn't it?), nice fig, and one of those blue brushes, which I've always loved but never managed to use. Thanks WhiteFang.	positive
Thank you for the nice review. This set looks good. I have too many of the blue sweepthings, but the fig is nice and I didn't have this face, so I will pick up one some day.	positive
Wow, what a great little impulse set! I relly dig the face as well as a chance to get some cool accessories like a broom, bin (no lid....sigh) and a mushroom top (Hat). A really nice review and story too Whitefang, i think this guy will be joining my set of Lego when he shows up in Australia. Cheers ISC	positive
WhiteFang, on Jul 3 2008, 03:18 AM, said: This set is simply wonderful. You know, that's exactly what I thought. I love it! It's simple, well designed, and cute. There are some nice pieces in there as well, and I really do quite like the fig- the new coastguard torso looks great. Thanks!	positive
I really enjoyed your review of the kayak! So many little things in one set that aren't currently in my collection. I didn't even realise it came with a buoy! Cool helmet, lifejacket, face, and oar, I will definitely need one of these! Cheers ISC	positive
One of the better impulse sets IMO.	positive
Thanks for another review WhiteFang! This is quite a nice set actually. It evokes some of the design elements of the MX-11, while looking different enough to justify me buying it. The head on the astronaut is one I like, so even better. I hadn't realised it was that one actually. Does 26 pieces make it one of the bigger impulses sets? I think I may have to get one, if not two... Plus it's called 'Crystal Hawk'. How can that not be considered cool?	positive

IMO, Impulse set total piece count should be 30 or less. It will be ideal and more ways to construct a much better impulse sets such as past impulse sets that we came across.

I know the word "Secret" base but whats this! The Base is hardly secret with a massive laser gun and wide screen sticking out It looks good, Lots and lots of Orange! Woo!	positive
I didn't exactly know where this belongs the best but i think it fits the best in here cause it's somewhat space related. I got this nifty little set yesterday from an auction ebay, new and sealed! I think the rock raiders theme was a great theme, and i wish they would have continues id back then. But anyway, let's see what we got here: Set Nr.: 4910 Name: Hover Scout Number of minifigs: 1 Number of pieces: 39 Release Year: 1999 First, a picture of the little box & instructions: A general overview of the set: And here we have the lovely (?) Miss Jet! (yes, the minifigures had odfficial names in this theme ) The little vehicle: And finally the Crystal Analysis Station. i like that very much, even if it's simple, but it does a good job and the amount of equipment also is cool: That's it, little set, little review, but big fun. I can recommend that to everybody, it's great for the parts, and the minifig is lovely. Gets a 10/10 from me	positive
Great review . Man, this brings me back! I still have like 5 of those rock monsters. In response to your statement, Rock Raiders does belong in this forum, being everything space related. 1) It's on an alien planet 2) In the computer game's start and in the story (yes, there was a computer game-my cousin has it) they are in a space ship 3) There are huge alien rock monsters trying to kill them.	positive
I got this set last year. And I think you made a mistake when you have remove a piece to access the probe droids and equipment, you just have to slide the entire main part. And I have a question, is this equipped with the new flick-fire missiles that don't fall off?	neutral
Thank you for the nice review. I like the design, although I didn't want to buy it. The new little speeder is very nice, but maybe a little to small.. Darth Mauls eyes are looking a bit more dangerous now.	neutral

Nice review, thanks! TLC is really going all-out with the Agents theme. I wonder if it will last longer than one year (unlike other recent one-and-done themes). My only real criticism of the theme is those freaking stickers. My god, look at the size of that DSS in this set!	positive
I forgot to comment on this review! Great job ReZourceman, like svelte-corps said your pics really show off the set and what there is to it. I just ordered this and the volcano base off S@h and I can't wait for them to come, so I'll comment on these reviews I forgot about I love the Inferno boat, as you say in your review it looks very heavy duty and ready to take on the Agents. The sub I quite like from the look of it, though there is the problem of too little space I will try and correct that. The dark blue is especially good. And I love Slime Face, his torso is very cool. svelte_corps, on Jul 11 2008, 09:14 AM, said: I can't say this is my favourite Agents set; the boat is a little oddly proportioned and the sub, although retro looking, has practically no interior and would be difficult to customise to put more in (unlike, say, the clever job Batbrick did with the Penguin sub in his review). Wow, thanks for that little mention Is it impossible or just very hard to mod? svelte_corps, on Jul 11 2008, 09:14 AM, said: I do agree with you about Slime Face - he has a fantastic torso with all the slime dripping down which is a bit obscured by the air tank. It's really encouraging that in the last 2 Missions we've had great extra villains added in. The only thing I would add about the octopus is that the glow in the dark plastic is mixed in unevenly with the aqua blue, so it doesn't glow in the dark evenly - it's kind of like the Mars Mission jellies in that respect though much cooler! The octopus sounds great, thanks for that, is he meant to be on any side? I'm guessing he's a mutant Inferno creature. About Slime Face, is his head much different to the Joker bombs? I know he has slime marks on his head, are they very apparent? Thanks again for the review! Batbrick Away!	positive
svelte_corps, on Jul 19 2008, 10:20 AM, said: Nothing is impossible to mod! Probably the easiest part to change would be the front where the missiles are and the treasure chest slides out - you could make a sizeable compartment there. However the middle section is so narrow and the end fins are just that - fins - that it might be harder to expand without changing the shape of the sub. You'll find out soon when yours arrives! Thanks for that info, I will definitely try anyway when I get the set, see if I can't loosen up a few dark blue bricks at the same time! svelte_corps, on Jul 19 2008, 10:20 AM, said: It's not really clear but since all the other mutants are evil (or at least controlled by Dr Inferno), it's probably a safe bet the squid is too. Slime Face's head is different to the Joker bombs - different eyes and teeth (although the smile is similar I guess) and the slime marks are much more apparent in the flesh (or ABS) although they don't photograph that way. Joker bomb face below for contrast: Ah, thanks for that info, I see that they are more different than I thought now. I hope the slime looks good when I get him! Batbrick Away!	neutral
Inertia, on Jul 21 2008, 12:29 PM, said: Wow, thanks for the review, that is one awesome set, I think we need some new agents, there's so many Inferno minifigures now... Maybe next year?

Great looking set. And that glowy blue octopus is really cute, I might just get it for that. Be great in a Space moc.. Wondering, from the pdf instructions I saw, it wasnt clear what the Agent in the sub is sitting on, hows his seat work? and it looks like theres a compartment below him...	positive

This looks like a good set and I'd better catch up with the rest of your reviews, ASAP!	neutral
Thanks for the review. This is one of my favorite space sets of all time. I even had 2 of them back in the days. My only complain about this set was that I found that the wheels where too small , I had some trouble passing the rover over the little "craters-mountains" of the space plates	positive
This is a great little set. I like how it combines two very different color schemes for different parts of the model. I have made some slight modifications to mine, adding a roof on the vehicle and a back wall on the outpost. Also, those white 1x1 headlight plates at the front are thinner than the modern kind and seem to be quite weak. I got this set off ebay a while ago and one of them was broken in shipping, even though the set was otherwise in display model condition, and the other one broke off while I was building the set. I replaced them with the newer variety. mutex, on Jul 10 2008, 11:37 PM, said: My only complain about this set was that I found that the wheels where too small , I had some trouble passing the rover over the little "craters-mountains" of the space plates The only bad thing about this set is the name.

Thanks for another informative review of the best Lego theme ever, and not in attempt to hijack your thread but to add to it, here's a pic of my blacktron 1 version of this beautiful set. the 6927 has to rate as one of the best 5 classic space sets ever along with 918, 6970 and 928.	positive
This set never got me as a kid. I suspect it was because of the wheels; I had mostly Basic sets so it would have been more of the same. Looking at it now I can see I have misjudged it, and I love the lab-lift method. I'm going to have to build this to see it in action! Thanks for another great review.	positive
Yeah, first time that I am getting a set before everyone.^^ First of all: The package The european version has no "Limited Edition" button. Hooray!!! Sorry for the blurry back-shot. We see the hospital back, a few bubbles with set functions and a little comic. Comic: Bubbles: The figures are injured Spongebob, Patrick and the new Fish Doctor. Spongebob has a headprint... ...and a backprint (other than the normal Spongebob). Spongebob and injured Bob: The set comes with two litters. The ambulance car is a bit extraordinary. I don´t know how the car is like in the show (and I saw a lot of episodes) but it looks a bit strange, mostly because the weehls are too small. Of course we get another SS (not so D this time). The litter fits in the back, with help of this lid. I wish it would be the hinge-lid from before 2004... Now we come to the meanpart of the set: The hospital! The entrance has got babyblue traindoors and a hudge sign that shows "Emergency". The tubes are nearly everywhere in this set. I was getting insane when I came to the part, where I must put the stickers on the tubes. This parts are very usefull, but I wanted that the set looks good, because I will display it. So I stickered just two of the parts and not all four. Now we come to the interroir: The doctor has a desk with computer. Sadly it´s not very well placed and he must duck because of his fin. Next to the door, we get this little case, wash basin and two drawers. Again we get stickers... Not that I don´t like stickers. It´s just: Everytime I get to the part where I must put the stickers on, I think how I can re-use the model and if I rebuild the model, later and and and... I hate it to deside! A few posters are in it, too. The set is a great addittion to your own Bikino Bottom, but the playability is not very big for the kids. They can just play that Patrick steals the ambulance car, like shown on the package, and is hitting Spongebob. Than the drive back, the doctor gives Spongebob two medicines and let him go. I bought the set mostly because of the parts (tubes in lightbley and a few woodpieces). But I am thinking about let it stand in my little Bikini Bottom (just consist of Crusty Crab and Chum Bucket). Playability: 3/10 Figures: 10/10 Price: 8/10 Design: 9/10 TOTAL: 30/40	positive
Thanks for the review, looks like a great set. I'm surprised that spongebob's bandage has a full body headprint so kudos to lego for that	positive
oh so spongebob was the injured one. I thought this set depicted the episode wherein Mr. Krabs was the one rushed to the hospital.	neutral
Great review. As much as I hate spongebob LEGO, I just might get this set. It has a good number of useful parts, like the computer and keyboard, and all of the brown pieces. How much does this set cost in USD?	neutral
How much euro did you pay for it? It looks a great set, great interior, nice figures and funny posters. :) It's also nice: the newest Spongebob sets are now also available in our stores and they are the coolest (Belgium)!	positive
The fish doctor is supposed to have a new torso.	negative
Nice review, NFT! I´m not that much into SpongeBob, but these two pieces just for themselves are interesting to get: container cupboard 4532 and cupboard drawer 4536 the latter not being sold for the last 6 years! Both together are an excellent way to create detailed interiors. 6 of those for me, please!	positive
My fish doctor has the torso from 7902 Doctor's Car, which is unfortunate, because the other torso is more stylized and cartoonish, I think. However, I did have that mad scientist lab set, so a bit of digging through my old collection will hopefully yield the better torso.	neutral
mommy and daddy are naughty!	neutral
Yay! It's good to see your kids get to build some stuff too, Sinner . All through the review I was thinking 'This was a present - but who actually put it together?' so I'm glad the last pic cleared things up As for the set - it looks much bigger than I expected - I think it does make a good sized dollhouse. There are a stack of nice pieces in there - cupboards, oven, trans-blue 2x5 bricks, all the accessories, plants, flowers, food, the light-up brick, the pink roof slopes - but not enough to justify the $AUD129 retail price. Maybe on sale I'd pick it up and resell the Belville figs but David Jones hasn't even had a regular 20% off Lego sale for the whole of this year that I've seen. I think the Playful Puppy set is a horrendous ripoff for $AUD20 though. I agree with the baby catapult - the range is terrible. Lego just isn't trying any more, is it? At least they've moved on from throwing cats off three storey buildings. 2 questions though. 1) Was it a fun build? 2) Are those large figs anatomically correct under their frou-frou finery? If not, what the hell are they doing in the second pic whilst baby Sylvia explores the oven?	neutral
I was sort of hoping for a flick-fire baby. Still, this looks decent, for what it is, I guess. Obviously, it really is all about the accessories, and it's got 'em, but not enough to make me spend that kind of cash, and I don't even mind having a pile of pink parts around. If you throw in a complete turkey or some birthday cakes, it's a slam dunk, but as it is... eh. Thanks for the review, though, it's very nicely presented and leaves no doubt in my mind as to just how easy this set would be to misuse for other purposes.	neutral

Sinner!!! You know, I had never seen a BELVILLE set in any review with such great pictures before! I just can't take my eyes off, in the Master Bedroom. The scene is quite, a little hot. Enough of me, peeping up there. Let's take a look at the interior. I am very surprised by its construction of the house. It's quite big and is nice of you to buy a great sweet gift for your daughter. I am very sure, she will enjoyed playing with it. Somehow, it reminded me of Barbie Doll products. Maybe, its too pinkish for me. The accessories is the "plus factor" in any BELVILLE sets. It offered quite a handful of great accessories to add into any types of MOCs construction to add in the plus factor in it. Sinner, you are a very nice Dad! I like how parents, buy educational toys for their children to expand their imaginations instead of sitting in a couch playing video games and etc.	positive

My daughter is 12, and she still plays with all her Belville stuff (mostly the fairy princess castle sets). If your daughter is anything like mine, you will definitely get your money's worth out of it. However ... as soon as my daughter says she's done with it, I plan on raiding the sets for all those great food and accessory bits. Patience .... Great review, by the way. The Belville sets are indeed overpriced, but they're probably Lego's best attempt at wooing the girl audience (I still hate the fact that TLC thinks they need separate "boy" themes and "girl" themes, but whatever). They're a very nice alternative to Barbie -- you get posable figures with realistic body proportions, plus some creativity and building aspects thrown in.	positive

Love this set! Nice review also.. I had the set in my hands a few times but never bought it, though I drooled at it, I remember. I guess I didn't get pocket money at that time, it was not that common around europe in the 80s I guess. So better to say that no one bought it for me.. A few years later I got the safari truck, which is also really sweet. I like the colors of this model and the detail of it. The minifig is really classic, made only for this set (appears in some later train sets as well) and shows the exact image of the truck on the shirt, including the motor piece. One of the most detailed and loveliest little sets from a sweet era of Legoland city! PS Voted "O" for Outstanding. Edited by Zzz, 14 July 2008 - 09:50 AM.	positive

Thank you very much for the review. NOW I remember! I got Mission Control when I was only 5 and built it with the help of my older sister. I loved it so much, I never rebuilt it but now... I just have to! Space Simulation was one I never got but looks to be a great set.	neutral

The Figs They're possibly the best part of the entire set, all in all. Nice new head, although the glasses limit its usability. I am in LOVE with the head on that fig. It's perfect for any number of figures - a good 'scarred hero' face has always been on my want list. I'm turning him into my Viking warlord after I post this review. Again, a new head. Great stubbly beard thing going on. My second-favorite head of the lot. Great for warriors, especially with helms. The torsos are fantastic for special forces figures, if anyone's planning to do something like that. Not TOO fond of the lime green on there, but it's still extremely usable. This is actually a really cool machine gun. I like it. I think this would be a good point to note that ALL designs you see - outside the figures and dinos - are stickers. That means a crapload of stickers. If you can't stand stickers at all in a set, don't buy this.	positive
The Copter This is one BIGASS copter. The photos really don't do the size justice. Lower cockpit with cool computer. Too bad it's a sticker, although I'll definitely leave this one on. Upper cockpit with cool computer. See above. Awesome gatling gun. Yes, even the TECHNIC BEAMS have stickers. I'm actually really fond of that little canister thing. I can see using it elsewhere. Yes - that's a sticker. The rope and hook. I forgot to mention it before, this set comes with two accessories besides the machine gun - binocs and one of those little things to slide down the rope. Also, the thing that 'extends' the rope turns. The other side, because they're slightly asymmetrical. One of my favorite stickers. The door says 'SURVIVAL EQUIPMENT'. It's on both sides. Definitely a keeper.	positive
Photos are not available, but basically it is: -guns +chains +ropes +crates	neutral

Possibly the Steel Sprinter and Urban Avenger, but I can say with finality that I will NOT buy the tank until I find it available for $30 or less. On that note, if anybody DOES find it for $30 or less, shoot me a PM. ;)	neutral
Thanks for the awesome review, metalandi! Your pics are very clear and you go into detail about all the functions of the set. I agree, this is a great set - one of the best of the CG line for sure, way better than the boat set with the tower on the Bionicle baseplate, and cheaper too. I even like the helicopter better than the oversized version. Lots of great parts and a really nice build by the looks of it too. I can't wait for this to be released in Oz!	positive
Seeing the pictures in this review certainly reinforce my original thoughts on this set: Here's an oil-rig mod waiting to happen...	neutral
Very nice review and nice set to boot. Lots of little features that increase the playability. Great pics too (i remember you had trouble before with the Tower Raid castle set, as i just got mine and was looking to review it, but saw your review in archives.....shakes fist at how slow aussies get sets ) Great Reviews On!	positive
Good review ;) I will buy it this year :)	positive
TheBrickster, on Jul 18 2008, 02:35 PM, said: Excellent review Metalandi. It's always great to see early pictures of new sets. This set really reminds me of an oil rig, and could probably be easily modified as one (if one wanted an alternate model). The two components that I like most are the boat crane and the control room, but other sections are pretty slick as well. Are those printed pieces in the control room, or stickers? I'm really starting to gain an appreciation for these new coast guard sets. They've come a long way over the years: http://www.majhost.c...Guard/09set.jpg 575 Coast Guard Station -Released 1978. I picked up the Control Boat & Tower (7739) a few weeks ago but haven't opened it yet). In any case, thanks for taking the time to review this set and share it over EB. First, thanks to all your great response for my review, i'm glad you like this set aswell. As it comes to stickers, the tiles ant slopes in the control room are printed pieces! The rest as coast guard logo patterns and so on are stickers. I forgot to make a photo of the sticker sheet unfortunately	neutral
I It!! I dont think i'm gonna buy it but i LOVED the review Nice Oil Rig worker; he looks so ROUGH Undersigned MoWo	positive

I haven't been to my local stores for a while now, so i don't know if they have it there, but maybe i'll find some time tomorrow to check it out. Heh, I live in Japan (probably the only one here who does), so I don't have S@H at all. If S@H US or Canada had it (which they don't), I could probably get it forwarded.	neutral
the worker looks like he soiled his pants um oh yeah... Nice reveiw! very cool set... Im not sure about the bottom floor glass being dark grey and the top floor glass being light blue.	negative
Nice review! This is just the "Crown Jewel" for the Coast Guard theme. I love the layout of its platform. It looks real neat to have it placed it in the midst of the deep blue sea, awaiting of any emergency rescue. Sometimes, I feel that this set can used it to merge with my Aqua Raiders sets. I thought of using it as a land base, for the raiders to dock in their stuff before submerge into the ocean. Ok, it's just a wierd idea of mine. Just feel that Aqua Raiders and Coast Guard can work hand in hand, since they are naval expertise! It seemed, I can't view all the pictures somehow. Nevertheless, I can still view some of it quite well. I love the command center. The amount of computer printed pieces simply make me smile, with the monitor, keyboard, radar screen and etc. The helicopter is cute too. However, I pity the victim that is loaded at the back. It seemed a little bit too dangerous. In addition, this set seemed to have quite alot of stickers, which can be quite discouraging. I do hope to see this set soon. So far, I quite like the Current Coast Guard sets.	positive
Great review metalandi! Thanks for posting it with a number of pictures, the only question is why Lego decided to produce so many sets I want to buy in one year!	neutral
Thanks a lot for the review, Brickster! I never had the chance to get some classic town sets, but I wish I couldve! I just wonder why Lego cant release sets like this anymore....	neutral
thanks! I own this set...! It was a good time as TLG released a lot of little buildings. (just look through the 63xx-setnumbers)	neutral
TheBrickster, on Jul 19 2008, 02:30 AM, said: I just can't believe someone would rate this set a 1. It appears to be a trend among these classic reviews, never with a comment of why. maybe a TFOL... it is our "destiny" to show them that LEGO existed before 1997 and was -IMHO- way better than today. we need more classic reviews. I hope I can continue with technic sets.	neutral
Gave it a 4. it's not exactly town plan, but it's above average.	positive
Thank you for all these reviews, TheBrickster! And: The idea with the polls is a very nice and interesting idea. (It will only take a while until I will have commented on all - so please give me some time. ) I gave this set a four: The vehicle, the minfigs and the design of the house are excellent - only the interior could be a bit spiced up (telephone, some other equipment).

WhiteFang, on Jul 18 2008, 09:11 PM, said: Paramedic Unit, does not seem to suit well for this set's name. It should be named as Clinic, Outpatient Treatment, Family Doctor and etc. The definition of a paramedic is "...someone who assists physicians in providing medical care..." I think in more modern times a paramedic is generally thought of as a more qualified and experienced ambulance technician but the dictionary definition would seem to fit with the Lego model quite well. Cheers Rog	neutral
Wow! Old thread. Just for the record, so long as it is here. Paramedic's are advanced Ambulance technicians. Unlike standard EMT's they are trained for Advanced Cardiac Life Support. They can push drugs, defibrillate, place a breathing tube etc. in the 1980's when the set was made, it was quite common for Paramedics to respond to calls in "fly cars" or special response units. They would join up with Ambulances at the scenes that required their skills. If you ever watched the old American TV show "Emergency", Johnny Gage And Squad 51 were one of these response units. They were mostly phased out in the 90's in favor of simply putting the Paramedics and ALS gear in the ambulances.	neutral
4 stars. the suspension wheel holder totally rocks. yeah. though the Slope Brick 45 2x3 x 1 1/3 Double disappoints me a little. btw: the 6350 Pizza To Go Van looks soooo cute! thanks for the review! (and keeeeep them coming...!)	positive
Oh! Never seen that set before! Fun and strange that wheel supension system. Has it ever been used in any other sets?	neutral
Indeed they have; they've appeared in 15 different sets, in total. They also have an identical width with the wide 2x2 wheels holder which is used on cars today. They are still excellent today, since retrofitting these suspension parts onto today's off-roader trucks won't give them weird proportions or any problems, and it looks perfect. Plus they are useful if you're lazy and don't feel like constructing the pin-suspension used in the early 90's for truck-trailers, altough stability probably will suffer.	neutral
4/5. I've had this set since I was young. Never understood why a tow truck needed to be an off-roader; maybe it was used to tow the other off-road vehicles. The suspension made the truck too tall to tow some cars, so I often took the hook out and use the truck as just an great off-road truck like 6672 (which also had the suspension wheels). Other tow truck sets better filled their roles better, but that doesn't diminish this set at all. WhiteFang, on Jul 18 2008, 09:19 AM, said: I think it looks really out of proportion. No, for 25-odd years this vehicle was perfectly proportioned with all others in the town/city line. It's all these new 6 and 8 and 20 wide vehicles that are ignoring convention and making it look out of proportion. Granted speed racer sets are more of their own line, but 6660 is smaller than most of the cars produced in the last few years.	positive
How would this one look compared to the new GV Pickup Tow Truck? I would like to see that one tow this one.	neutral
Exxon Gas Station Set #: 6375 Year Released: 1980 Piece Count: 254 Minifigs: 3 List Price: approx. $20 One of the gems of my sets from 1980 has to be the Exxon Gas Station. It has very nice colors, lots of great details, and a high level of playability. Starting with the instructions: The backside with a great picture of the complete set: The set includes three minifigs including two gas station attendants and my favorite, the Urban Cowboy: One of the best things about this set is that it includes not one, but two very detailed 4-stud wide vehicles. Here's a picture of the red one which is a two-seater: The car has two working doors, a hood that opens, and a little holed brick on the other side for pretending to "fill 'er up". Here's another image at an angle: Isn't she a nice set of wheels! Here's the yellow car. I always liked this one better, perhaps it was the color with the black pieces in the back, although it is a one-seater: The set includes four fuel pumps that are numbered (with decals) and included a string as the hose: Here's a little accessory rack for oil and tools: And another rack for tires: The set had a nice Exxon logo on three 1x6 bricks: A large jack allows the cars to be lifted high into the air for tire and under engine repairs: I love the office with its large 5x6 window. Inside is a chair and desk. And the entire set: Happy Motoring in Legoland!	positive
Cool set I really loved the classic town sets. This set has lots of detail, great reveiw. Do you know what is Exxon?	positive
Nice it's like an alternative to the Shell petrol company sets we had over here in the UK. (or did you have them to?) Edited by Skipper 24, 19 July 2008 - 04:21 PM.	neutral
i think we only got Shell stations in europe in the 80s... Never got this one, but it looks like a typical Lego gas station ... once again, i just don't know how you were able to keep stickers and prints in such a great condition! i am sooooo jealous! the tires of the cars are a problem though... it was difficult and painful to put them off the wheel and back on later... the black hat... g... i would have looooooved to have that when i was a boy...	negative
I much prefer the Shell version of that station which had the full awning over the roadway, and the special road plate with the extra lane to pull into to fill 'er up...	neutral
I love this set, it's nice and simple. Maybe it's because I build this set by myself by ordering all parts and buildinginstruction. And I made one extra tanktransporter :	positive
Brickster, once again, this is another excellent Gas Station, awaiting to be in the limelight! I don't understand why I always loved these Classic Gas station such as Shell, Exxon and Octan. They just look so lovely. No City or Town could ever survive without these important key installations around, to pump gas/petroleum for all vehicles, that depend it for fuel consumption. As always, all Gas Station will always inculde a road plate, and I am glad I am still seeing roads included in such sets, such as the recent 7993, Service Station. However, Town Plan's Gas Station, did not include a baseplate though. Nevertheless, let me continue with this review. 3 Lovely mini-figs, included in this set. It's not common to see Exxon torsos these days. I just love that lady staff very much, especially with its classic hairdo. 4-studs car just simply rocks, with such fabulous simple design. Furthermore, it gave you 2 cars instead of one. What more can you ask? You don't see TLG giving more cars in recent sets these days. What surprise me about this cars, is the ability of opening the front engine column. I remembered vividly that only trucks or massive vehicles, does have this playing feature. Nevertheless, it's an excellent addition. For a 1980 Gas Station set, this is a perfect set, even when it's going to fit into my current Town buildings. I am sure, it won't have a hard time to match with the rest of the facade. I can use this gas station and stationed it near the country side. This set is so hard to resist, with such elegant design of its fuel pump. There are a total of 4 pumping stations. The vehicles won't be fighting against each other, for slots then. The reparing area is very nice, it will be even better if it include a shelter on top of it. The office is simple and nice. I had never expect an office to exist in Gas Station. Most of the time, there are groceries stores, for the consumers to get off, buy off some stores and load it in the car. No major complains from me. I am not trying to be selection bias. I had demostrated key points which is good enough to justify my score. And, I gave it a "5". Outstanding Classic Gas Station set.	positive
Okay guys, I have built the set! So let's review! Set Name: 7649 MT-201 Ultra Drill Walker Price: $69.99 Pieces: 759 Bought from: Tor R Us in Michigan, US. The Box: First we have the front. It shows the Set, it's functuns, and the Limited edition sign. The box is huge, about the size of the Dino Attack chopper set or the Mars Mission Base. Nowadays, most set that are $50.00 or more have a flap displaying the sets functions. Opening theflap on this box Reveals a GIGANTIC picture of the set. And the back. The bags, numbered: Next, the manuals. They have piece call outs, page numbers, etc. There are 2 manuals with this set. Sticker Sheets: They actually aren't all that bad. Random Manual image: Build: First, we open bag 1. This will build the Alien Craft and the minifigures. Now here we have some interesting parts. A green spine from Exo-force, and a black rim for the set Container Stacker. Next we start the build on the alien craft. It is pretty sturbdy, but has no cockpit for the alien. The alien stickers are really cool. They are rainbow-ish, and has a silver back. Next come the build on the wings: And the finished craft. It is pretty good, and has a nice sleek design. However, I think I will use the large ship for the commander out this year to fight the driller instead. Next is bag 2, which builds the rover and Astro Ship. First is the Ship. It starts off with Doctor Inferno's colors. It builds up very nice, and the detail is absolutley amazing. Next the roof is built. It has some speed racer slopes. The hinge piee now has a hole through it. Sorry for the blurry pic: More is added: Then comes the bottom piece. The detail is very nice, and the hinge piece has a use later on. Then you build the crates. Each one holds two crystals. Added to the ship, also a pic of the finished ship. Here we start the rover. It sports anice detail- The orange studs get coveded by the grill to look more like an engine. The detail in this thing is pretty good. It has a gun and shovel. Here is how it fits into the ship: It slides in... And is secured thanks to the hinge. Okay, so next we open the number 3 bag, which builds the body. Here are some interesting pieces: Then we start the build. It begins nice and study: I just love these stickers with the bulldogs on them: More of the build, with the stickers added: Next we add in the front part. The detail is again, outstanding. With the turntable added. It can move down as well. The next step is to build the water tank. It utilizes the bionicle boosters(big white things) And added to the walker: Then we build that drill. It uses a lot of rims and such. With the gears added: The front part uses a lot of those new droideka 3-prong things. And bionicle eyes. The drill can spin thanks to the gears. And added to the vehical: Next is the cockpit. It has a nice space for the Astro's bckpack. Added: The final stage is the legs. Thank god they aren't like Striking venoms. They are all the same, however. See those two rubber parts? Those keep it in place when on surfaces like glass. Next come the large part of the legs. These are similar to the Assault Tiger's legs. The final result is very sturdy, thanks too... Notice the amazing classic space sticker? So we finally come down to this: The final result is amazing. It is sturdy, and has great detail. It is very realistic. And, when the ship is removed, the drill goes down, and the turret is aimed up... Hope you all enjoyed the review!	positive
Can't wait, ~VBBN~. I probably won't buy it, but it'll be nice to see a review. Well, the awesome Mars Mission set was matched with an awesome review! Good job ! Edited by Adam, 21 July 2008 - 02:25 AM.	positive

OK, minus ten for the placeholder, but plus about ten million for the review. This set is just amazing. It's really earned it's colors, and I'm sure no Classic Space fan can complain, even Snefroe . I didn't know it had the tilting function for the drill- S@H is so pathetic with its pictures, and they really missed this amazing function. The detachable ship is so cute, it's almost Classic Space in it's design. Major thumbs up to TLC. Hell, make it a hug, even.	positive

Grevious, on Jul 20 2008, 12:43 PM, said: Wonderful review. I'd die if I had to upload that many pictures... Man, this is it: the pinacle of Mars Mission's second and final year. Man, this baby is flawless. There are so many indications that the designers took care in designing this kit - like the space for the pilot's backpack, the compartment for the mini flier, the sturdy leg design - etc etc etc. Kudos to TLC for making Mars Mission go out with a bang. I have high hopes that whereever the space theme goes next year, TLC will make it worth the wait. Thanks! And yes, it took me half an hour just to resize them, and an hour to upload them to brickshelf. Algernon, on Jul 20 2008, 01:09 PM, said: Is it seriously? This set was a must-buy for me in the first place, but now that I see it in so much detail, it's just perfect... even the alien ship is better than usual. I love the scooter that flies out of the escape pod, the backpacks, bulldog stickers, and water tank. :D I'll be getting this one! SPACE FANS UNITE! Ah, very good! And the detail is truley a part in this set. The water tank is actualy pretty nice. Sinner, on Jul 20 2008, 07:29 PM, said: Nice review!

Today i'm gonna review the bigger of the 2 castles from the fright knigh theme. I got this one last week at a pretty fair prive at ebay, new and still sealed. I love opening boxes that had been lying arounf for years and being the first to build an old set. Since i know this castle theme is not liked so much by the general public, i'll try here and change their minds, cause i really think this is a great set. This time i have to say my pictures turned out pretty amazing, even if i am still using just my cellphone cam, but i'm really pleased now with the quality. Here we go! Set Nr.: 6097 Name: Night Lord's Castle Number of minifigs: 7 Number of pieces: 598 Release Year: 1997 Let's start with a few box & instructions pictures: The inside od the box, with a few alternate models: The back, with another possibility how to assemble the 3 main parts: Instructions: Next, the 6 minifigs, starting with the witch on her black dragon: All 5 figures of the fright section: And the poor royal knight: We go on with the set itself, first a general overview (it's really high!): On the "first floor" there's a trap with which you can drop stones or other things down on unliked guests, the pot comes originally from fabuland i think, i love this thing: In the same floor there is a second trap, if you pull the bar, the door opens: We move on to the tower itself (did i mention it's really high?), on the ground level there's the place for the witch to do her spells: The wall is a secret door, which reveals a skeleton when turned over: on the next level there is this little thingy, first it only seems like a barrel.... ...but when you pull the two 1x4 tiles on the back, a skull is being revealed, scary, huh : I don't really understand what this is for but i assume it's a telescope to watch and observate the dragons, i do find that a bit senseless since there haven't been telescopes in medieval times (or have there been): The back of the tower with the prison and the room for the treasure chest: The prison opened. It's secured with a chain, which i like very much cause you really can lock it with that: Treasure chest: From the highest peak we now go down to the very ground level, at the back of the castle there is another secret wall-door, flanked by two shields: At the back half of the inside there is the throne hall for the Bat Lord, with a nice warm fireplace in the back (this is, where the secret door is placed): The second half is pretty empty, except for these two baskets. i don't know exactly what they are for, but i ike the idea for using them as water places for the horses: One thing that might be a bit stupid is that 2 of the 4 side entrances do not have doors, so they are open and a guard would have to stand there the whole day. You can see it in his face he isn't very happy with that : That was my last review of the sets i got the last weeks, but i'm looking forward to make much more in the future. Overall this is a pretty good set, i don't know any other one with so much details and playability. The minus point is, as already said, that it is too open on the sides, but that can be solved easily with a bit of modding. Also i must say, this set isn't that much juniorized as many might have thought, though the design is a bit unconventional, but exactly that's what i like most about it. All in all it gets a 9/10 for me hope you enjoyed the reading and the pictures, can't wait to see your response. Edit: Oops, i forgot to put one figure of the fright knight faction on the photo, but it's the one in the last picture. Edited by KimT, 10 August 2008 - 01:28 PM.	positive

Metalandi, thanks for doing this Fright Knights review, by opening up a MISB set which you have bought recently. I am very sure the feeling is very nice, especially touching the bricks which is preserved for 11 years sealed in bags. I am quite fond of the Fright Knights theme. Unfortunately, this theme was released during my dark age. I never really bought sets from Fright Knights. Instead, I bought plenty of minifigs to build an army. If I could turn back time or find another MISB set with a reasonable price, I am very sure I will get it. My soldiers need a castle to stay in. I will be looking forward to your next review. Keep up the good job	neutral
Ah this brings back memories, i have this set and i loved the playabilaty factor opposing to older castle sets i have! In medieval times there actually were primitive telescopes, you can read about it here. Thanks for this review, great storie, great pics!	positive
I got a couple of the small sets from this line when it came out. Recently, I acquired several more from Bricklink because I just really love the way they look. This theme really had good intentions, but the execution was flawed. I hope one day Lego returns to a darker tone, but maybe next time it could be more Castlevania inspired. That would really turn some heads! Plus, vampires and gothic aesthetics are really popular now. It will probably have run its course by the time Lego would be able to develop a theme around them, though.	negative
This is a great set and a great review - Thanks for doing these! I remember my brother getting this set (I got the police station 6384 on the same day). Truly classic sets - It's a shame that I don't have them anymore although I do have the two immediate descendants of the sets... Cheers Rog	positive
Lovely!! I can't stop making comparisons between this fire station and last year's, which is also very well detailed, with great features and awesome playability. The concept design of the second one it's very much like the one reviewed here. This is good as TLG is taking back those great values to make the new excellent sets we all are enjoying by now!	positive
I have a slightly different version of this set, and i must say it is great! Boy to these reviews bring back memories, thanks!	positive
no question. this is a "5" one of the best and most influencial town sets ever, imo	positive
I honestly glad i got the latest fire station [Cant remember set number] Its waayyy better I voted 3 its realy not that great but its ok.....	neutral
Good, but I like the heli of set 6571 better: Another "4" from me.	positive
A nice little model with some neat features for it's age plus the all-yime classic fireman as a bonus. However, this design of chopper (the police station around the same time was the same design) I think dated very quickly. While is was good to use the hinged car roof - which was relatively new at the time - together with the inverted screen it was superceded very quickly by designs that stood the test of time far better (for example 6657). Also, I don't think I could everbuy a Lego fire helicopter because it is not something we have in the UK/Eire. Police, Coast Guard, Ambulance, military, etc, etc but no fire helicopters. Not something I would therefore want in my Lego Town. Great review though. Many thanks again for doing these. Cheers Rog	negative
Hello all Eurobricks members and Town Lovers, Today, I will be doing up a review on Snorkel Squad, one of the most important and basic vehicle in any Fire Department. Snorkel Squad, in simple english terms, it refers to Fire Engine, fighting fire, always on standby, ready to save the citizens from crisis. Trust me, you will understand why this Snorkel Squad is superb impressive by the end of this review. On a side note, there is only part that is replaced by another color. Can you find the difference? Name: Snorkel Squad Theme: LEGO System / Town Year: 1987 Pieces: 151 Minifigs: 2 Price: USD$13.50 An image of a 6358, Snorkel Squad Looking smart on their stand-by This snorkel squad is a fanastic fire engine, that is ready to save people from the fires. It's primary color "red" is used in all fire emergency department and vehicles. In case of any emergency, this snorkel squad will be activated and arrived at the scene as soon as possible. No time to waste! Personally, this is the best fire engine that I had ever seen. Meet the Fire Fighters It comes with two brave fire fighters. Both of them wear the standard fire fighter outfit that is present in almost all Fire Station sets in Classic Town. The torso is very nice and formal, and looks real impressive onto them. I love the buttons on them. Furthermore, these white helmets are a symbol to the world of Fire Fighting. These are the people whom save lives by risking their own lives in dangerous situations. Water Hose compartment The water hose is a string that is stored in the front. It can be rolled out, and the fire fighters are able to use it without much difficulty. They will just pull out the hose and spray onto the fire. The next picture, shows a much clearer look in its interior. In addition, the fire logo that is on the compartment, is actually printed. Yes, it's not a sticker, and that is great news for us! Interesting features These clamps on both sides, is supposed to stablise the fire engine when the ladder is heading upwards. It is a simple mechanism, which illustrate clearly what it does. This feature is recently seen in Construction vehicle such as the Mobile Crane. Of course, it is not a complicated feature. It just made use of three quite common white parts. Swivel Mechanism These swivel mechanism, in my opnion are very fun to play with. These connectors on the front and the back, enable the long fire engine, to make sharp turns on any junctions, arriving at the scene fast enough. This is not a fire engine that only travel straight roads. Try it onto your base plates, and you will be surprised, how well it can turn. Best Playable mechanism in 6358 The driver will be activating the ladder at the back of the vehicle. In order, to adjust the height and making sure that the ladder do not fall short, the tiles on the plates are acting like a stoppage. The ladder are able to rotate 360 degree without much problem, if you removed the driver out of the control panel. It goes up as tall as 30cm! Look at that amazing height. Too bad, I have not constructed my Cafe Corner yet. Otherwise, I can give you a better feel of how amazing this baby can go. I used the old road baseplate as a guide, and roughly it can goes as tall as 30 to 35cm. Look at the black hinges below. By shifting it to the last, that was the maximum height it can move. This is a very good way to adjust the height. Oh, and I forget to mention that there are 2 storage compartments for the fighters to place their equipments behind. Quite easy to access. No doors? Apart from the standard roof top on the driver's seat, there is no doors present at both side. I am quite sad to see that there are no doors. Maybe, these fighters are supposed to jump off the seat, instead of opening the doors? Well, I guess this is the only major flaws that I had found in this set. Heading off *Got you* Meet the Model 6358 Fire Engine Summary review Playability: 10/10 (Superb fun. The ladder and swivel mechanism is really very fun to play with.) Design: 9.5/10 (Excellent design. It got an almost full 10. The lack of doors, dropped my ratings slightly.) Price: 8/10 (A very mid range price. I don't think it cost very expensive. But, I am not sure how much it cost now.) Overall: 9.2/10 (Best Fire Engine ever, and one of the great looking one too. Get this model now.) I gave it a "5" based on my Review Score Card. What about yours? Hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine. Comments and Critics are strongly welcomed. Pictures can be found in My Brickshelf (When moderated)	positive
A great review, I like this set it captures the classic town feeling well, and the ladder is cool! I can't help but feel thought that these reviews are being churned out to quickly, you should leave a gap, I am being flooded with all these great reviews!	neutral
This definitly is a nice set, i think this was also the first set to use that white basket Nice one Whitefang!	positive
Guys, thanks for all of your wonderful and encouraging comments, towards this set. This was one of my most favourite set in the late 1980s, and I am glad to restore it somehow, with a small little part missing, which could not be that hard to replace. BerndDasBrot, on Jul 22 2008, 12:06 AM, said: But this review induced me to get over this humiliation from my childhood ( ) and check ebay for the 6358. Bernd, I am glad reviews like these, mananged to change your perception towards this set. Honestly, this is a very good set to pass by, and I hope I had highlight the key features in this set. Hope you will have an easy time, getting it from eBay or Bricklink. rriggs, on Jul 22 2008, 12:31 AM, said: Great classic firemen and - in your version - a suspiciously blue fire extinguisher Good job, by spotting the replacement part, which is hiding among them. That's why I show the orignal image. Lord Of Pies, on Jul 22 2008, 12:34 AM, said: I can't help but feel thought that these reviews are being churned out to quickly, you should leave a gap, I am being flooded with all these great reviews! You should really take some time off, and sit in front of the Town and Trains forum, looking through at your childhood memories, where classic reviews like this are released in this forum. I am leaving some gaps in between my reviews now. I supposed Brickster will slow down soon. Captain green hair, on Jul 22 2008, 02:07 AM, said: This definitly is a nice set, i think this was also the first set to use that white basket CGH, you are absolutely right. This is the first set that made use of the white basket component. In fact, there is only 2 sets in the entire LEGO theme which have make used of the white basket. It is the 6477 which is released in 2000. I am quite surprised after 13 years, they are able to produced it again. TheBrickster, on Jul 22 2008, 10:10 AM, said: What an awesome little set! I really like this engine but don't remember seeing it during the late 80s. It must have been out during my Dark Ages. I love the basket/section for the firemen. Equally nice is the fire hose which extends a good length. The color combination of red with white and the trans. blue windshield looks goos as well. This is a great engine and one that would look perfect in a classic tabletown - and it's 4-studs wide! Very nice review WhiteFang. I look forward to seeing more of your Classic Town reviews. You shared the same sentiments as I do. It's a pity that set was released during the Dark Age of yours. On the other hand, these sets are my childhood sets which I grew up with. More Classic Town reviews, all the way! Edit: This is my 1000th Eurobricks post since I joined! It has been another great milestone for me, in Eurobricks! Edited by WhiteFang, 22 July 2008 - 06:46 AM.	neutral
That's a great review/poll, WhiteFang! I gave this set a 5: It's simply ! The only thing which I miss are the respirators for the firemen since they already own air tanks. But otherwise this set is brilliant! I like it much more than the new one from 2007 since it's not that big and juniorized. Klaus-Dieter	positive
Quote I am not against with the newer sets. It just that, part of the reasons which reflected in the review had fufill the basic key factors of a typical Fire Engine. In addition, it was my all-time favourite under the "Fire-Fighting" theme. Yes, I agree! This set is wonderful even today, and is one of the best fire kits ever release. And actually, realistic scale is not really a necessity in lego - it's just my personal taste. For example, I've never liked the tiny planes in the old airports that much, but I can see why a lot of people like them better than the new ones. Edited by Grevious, 28 July 2008 - 03:17 PM.	neutral

Okay, if this were the first review of the set, I'd understand your want to reserve a thread for your review, but seriously, there are already reviews out there. Couldn't you have just waited at least until you had actually built the thing, or even better, until the review was actually done?

SWMAN, on Jul 29 2008, 10:33 PM, said: I really like the new Gunship. Different enough from the old one to be better, but similar enough that they don't look totally weird together. Really like the new minifigs. Didn't think I would like the new Clone Troopers at all. The accessories are fine.

Pedro, for your first review, you have amaze me with your photo session and the strucutre of your review. I am very impressed by your high quality pictures. You have done an excellent job! I love the Tower Raid very much, as it offers high playability. With the wall and flooring, falling down, when the ram hits the wall, it's quite interesting to play with. The mechanism of the ram is very fun to play with as well. I will try and pull back and released it, to knock a row of soldiers. This is one of my favourite sets in Castle 2008. Well done.	positive

You have done an excellent job! I completely agree. This is an amazing review - bits of humor, great photography, and detailed descriptions/photos. Based upon this review I've placed an order for this set (along with some convincing from Amazon's 20% sale ). The only drawbacks in this set that I can see concerns the tower with it being 1) small compared to the seige tower and 2) missing a few walls. However, this is also the joy of LEGO as one can simply purchase a few bricks and build their own walls and/or expand the tower's size (or even attach it to a castle). Of course, this increases the price of the set, but considering how cheap bricks are on BrickLink, Tower Raid is still a very good value. I hope you continue doing reviews, pedro.	positive
Th set was fantastic becuase it was cheap and supplied a very good amount of pecies and had rather good minifigures.	positive
Name: Jungle Duel Set ref: 7624 Number of minifigs: 3 Number of pieces: 90 Price: $9.00 A basic review of 7624 (my apologies for the blurry and grainy pictures my camera is acting up ): The build is nothing speicial on to the figs Indiana Jones, Mutt Williams and Irina Spalkoi, nice array of minifigs although I think they should have included a russian soldier or two. If you look to the right on Mutts jacket it has his name in script, the tent is great aside from the fact that the fabric bends easily a nice amount of speicial pieces the weapons rack is pretty nifty so is the table when you swap the white piece with a black one overall it is a very nice set, the $10.00 price tag isnt so bad either, thanks for reading. Playability:10/10 price:8/10 figs:8/10 build:5/10 overall rating:8/10 I recommend this set to all Indiana Jones and lego fans. Edited by wulf, 29 July 2008 - 02:50 PM.	positive

, that was a weird race! Anyway, I love the look of both sets, but i'll have to go for the Dino Attack Quad for a couple of reasons: It is post-apoc, which I love, features tan and dark red colours which are far more useful than yellow, you get more "bang for your buck" with the Dino set, you get a little dino (sure you can hate it but better than not having one right?), and the fig has much more useful pieces and a better face. Thanks for the face off TheBrickster! Batbrick Away!	positive
that was an intresting race And i was split between the two until i saw whitefang`s reply and the fact you can use the sprinter as a militery thing(which you could do for both but sprinter just pulls it off better) and i like the radar on the back of it so i`ll have to go with the street sprinter. thanks for the nice topic brickster	positive
Dino Attack for me! You just cant say no to a huge Bazooka! Though the tan and dark red works for me too	positive
ooooooh! this is a very hard choice,i like this new coast guard theme but i LOVED! Dino Attack.The Dino Attack set has a weird looking gun,but IMO the Coast Guard set looks.........cleaner if you get what i mean.The little Dino/lizard thing is practically worthless (thats why i have a bin full of those little guys).I want to keep liking Dino Attack i just can't.So i know your like "just get to the point already!" so i guess i have to go with coast guard. TheBrickster, on Aug 3 2008, 09:41 AM, said: I did not know that Europe had a different quad (or at least one without the bazooka). Interesting that the gun was removed from the European sets, or added to the US sets. I sort of like the chain. I also notice a big difference in the boxart. Destroyed city to prehistoric volcano. I wonder if the story was different as well? Thanks for sharing a good picture. ----------------------------------------- Well, it does look like the Dino Quad has the upper hand; almost double the votes. wow i would have so much wanted the european one more than the US one, i mean that bazooka or as they called it a "sonic screamer" looks very silly	positive

Thanks for posting the review, I’ve been wondering about this set. To me it does feel a bit fig light, for £50 I’d expect maybe one or two more clones. I’m not to sure about the oversized issue, it seems to me it’s better to have something a bit to large and have a better level or features than something smaller will less.	negative
I personally think this is a great set, but a little pricey. I wish it was available in the US though.	positive
Great review! Man doI wish I had those red droids. I'm using the Dell XPS-1, and holy crap is it clear. Those pics were beautiful!	positive
I always thought this looked liek a cool set, with lots of nice (and sadly unique) pieces. Unfortunately the only Attack of the Clones sets I got were the Jedi Starfighter and Yoda vs Dooku. Amazing sets, but I would love to have owned them all. I'd never really looked into this set very much, so thanks for the review!	positive
This is actually one of my favorite Star Wars sets. Awesome rare pieces, and excellent construction. Geo figs are a plus too. Best of all, it's nice and cheap.	positive
I am fairly confident that something involoving geonosis will be released in 2010 but any way I had this set ( one of my first ones) but i droped the ship and it blew up. I found all the pieces but in never rebuilt the ship. Although I still have the figs ant the canon. Overall this set was above average in my opinion. Great review!!!	positive
Thanks for the review. I'll definately get this set sooner or later. IMO the Tiny Turbos are awesome. I actually bought nearly every set so far, built the models, added the stickers and packed them away in zip-lock bags in the attic. Sadly I don't have display room for them (yet). A fine set, carwise.. Dump the slammers and buildings into the spare bag and keep the cars. KimT TINY TURBOS ON!	positive
Tiny Turbos are good for parts, but I'm not so keen on them as they have no minifig drivers. So, I wasn't sure about this set. But your review has made me like them more, I probably won't buy the set but I appreciate it more. Thanks for the review!	positive

7153 Jango Fett's Slave 1 Review Parts: 358 Figs: 2 Price: £20.00 (I got it on offer I think the RRP was £40) The only set to include Jango Fett and young Boba. Also the decals on Jango are from Fine Clonier. (I'm trying to say they don't came with the set) 1. Manual Worn manual. Random page. Another random page. Looking at this page you can that this set has numbered bags. Back cover. Look how old Yodas computer looks . 2. General set and Minifigs The sets contents. Jango With his hair on. Jango with helmet on with front view of face. Twist Jango's head to initiate super bounty hunter mode. Jango's doubled sided head. Boba. Nothing to special although I think the torso and head are exclusive to the set. 3. The Ship Not really scaled up right as you can see. The guns can rotate. The central sections interior. Not sure what this is. Is it a hyperdrive or a bomb or something? There are these side panels on both sides. Behind the panels. A secret compartment. Trans orange minifig heads in the compartment. I think they're supposed to be saturnic charges. Side storage compartment. The back of the ship. How those trans orange minifig heads fallout. There is a magnet on the inside of the ship. But for what... The secret prison which also has a magnet on the top so it can stay on but easily come out. The doors on it can lift up to put prisoners inside. 1 of 2 identical wing things. They can fold for flight mode. The controls. Bottom jet thing. LET ME OUT OF HERE! The prison is great for capturing small children. 4. Overall Build: 7/10 Impossible to build without a hard stable surface. Minifigs: 10/10 2 Exclusive figs. Design: 7/10 Nowhere near to scale but has some nice features. Parts: 8/10 Good parts like that big cockpit canopy. Price: 9/10 For the price I got it was pretty good especially with the figs it comes with. Playability: 7/10 Lots of features but it would be better if it came with a JSF. Overall: 9/10 Lots of features and comes with exclusive minifigs.

Nice Review! I will say i like the latest Slave I the best as it is longer than Jango's. I haven't seen the first one so i cant really comment.	neutral
That was indeed a set that never appealed to me. Its build was just plain wrong and awful. I only bought it because I found it on clearance at around 15€ (and they had 4 of them. If I had known better then, I'd have bought all 4; Seeing how much that Jango Fett minifig is worth now... ) But I ended up heavily modifying it in its propoions and now it looks ok next to the new Slave One (which is the best one of its 3 incarnations, I think)	negative
I got the Original JSF for Christmas, which I might buy and review. Wonderful set, the Obi in this one is really awesome and it's really just a great ship, sticker free. Probably my favourite, I'd fly it if any ship from Star Wars. Maybe I should get it and the Slave I from Episode II... after all, I like Jango despite having a crap story.	positive
A very nicely done review. I remember getting this Slave I - it was my first large Star Wars set.	positive
Outback Desert Racer G'day Mates! Today from the Legoland's Desert Down Under, I'll be sharing an image review of Outback Set #6550, Desert Racer Set #: 6550 Theme: Outback Year Released: 1997 Piece Count: 48 Minifigs: 1 List Price: $4 (USD) Starting with an image of the box: And the back side with three alternate models: Instructions and decals: The pieces: A side view of the vehicle: Diagonal view: One minifig: And the complete set: PROS: - Price is under $5 ($4 USD retail) - good impulse set - Goes well with other Outback sets - Combination of yellow and green pieces - Working doors and liftable top for playability CONS: - Stickers on doors, hood, and 1x4 tile. No printed pieces - No accessories (a wrench, gas can, and other extras would have added to the set) - No extra tire for blow outs SUMMARY: I picked this set up new a number of years ago as a true "Impulse Buy", after buying one of the larger Outback sets (Amazon Crossing or Outback Airstrip). It's a neat little addition to the theme with its working doors and playability factor. Although I only built it once before today, I would buy again if I had the opportunity. Hooroo for now! Some good Aussie music to leave you with: Down Under	positive
I remember having this set (actually i even still have it, at least the pars are SOMEwhere ) when i was a child, and i used it for making races, as it is there for. All these many reviews let me think again at that i also planned to make some reviews for the town section. I got your message TheBrickster, don't worry! I got a lot to do at the moment, but i should find some time this upcoming week.	neutral
I can prodly say I own this little bugger. It's not much, but it is a nice addition to the series. They are also easy to build, so you can get a rally going quite fast. Stauder.	neutral
7261 Clone Turbo Tank Parts: 801 Figs: 8 Price: £70.00 (ouch! ) EDIT: new box pics added. My version of the set comes with a normal Mace Windu figure and an extra clone trooper. Also the Mace Windu, BARC trooper and jet trooper minifigs were exclusive to the set (Well you could make the jet trooper yourself) . Also my set came with 4 extra blasters (you'll see them later) and Baby blue vent things instead of trans blue. 1.Manual & Box The front of the box. The box compared to the motorized AT-AT and the hailfire droid and dwarf spider droid. Minifgs. The back which has pics of the sets functions and alternate models. Inside the box it has a white cardboard divider probably for strength seeming as the box it so flimsy. Pretty hefty manual. The TT manual compared to the one of the AT-AT ones. Random shot. Another random shot. Poster at the back of the manual 2. General set and minifigs The whole set. I accidentally left one of the plates up when I took the pic. Close up of the figs. Two battle droids come with blasters and a mini turret. The republic. From L-R: Jet Trooper, Mace Windu (not LUL), BARC Trooper, Normal Clone, The Commander, Look out. Jet pack. Mace's torso. BARC trooper legs. BARC trooper torso. He has got to be my favorite clone trooper by TLC. The mysterious commander. On LSW he was called Cody (right) but he has star corps Armour making him commander Bly (left) . Normal Clone and the look out Clone with electro binoculars. 3. Speeder Bike Side view of the BARC Speeder. Menacingish front view. (is menasingish a word?) Printed back engine piece. One of my shield things came with a crumpled handle it is worse than it looks in the pic. 4. The turret The turret. It can rotate and point upwards. But what if you want to blast all those Battle droids that are shorter than the height of the turret blasters... add another hinge in! That extra hinge in action. 5. The Tank It's to big to get a decent side view pic Johnny the cabin boy on the crows nest. Front 2 seater cockpit. The 2 seats. Better be careful you don't fall off your seat there are some pretty big gaps down the sides. Back cockpit with dual missile launchers. The back seat. The engine. The large central storage. The turret controls fold down to lock into place so it doesn't fall out when driving. You can put 2 minifigs up top. Mace and a Clone driving. you can see those 4 extra blasters, 2 orange at the front of the pic and 2 between the chairs. The turret and jet trooper. BARC trooper on the BARC speeder. The commander on the lift chair in the back cockpit. Another shot of that chair. 6. Overall Build: 8/10 Quite enjoyable because it incorporates Technic and system parts. Minifigs: 9/10 On a set this size it has quite a lot including some exclusives such as the BARC trooper but it could of had a droid or 2 more. Design: 7/10 way out of scale but generally pretty strong due to the technic frame. Parts: 7/10 Lots of plates and nice minifig parts. Price: 6/10 Justifiable because of the amount of figs in the set. Playability: 7/10 Includes some CIS units to fight the clones. Overall:8/10 Needs more droids and it could be bigger. I will also probably have a break form reviewing for now seeming as I have just put out a whole load of reviews. Edited by KimT, 09 August 2008 - 08:51 PM. indexed as 7261 Review 2	positive
Thanks for the review, I'll index it later. I've added a poll, so that members can vote their opinion and refrain from useless comments like "awesome!!" (This has been done to all reviews in the SW review index). Keep up the good work. This is one of my favourite sets - I have both versions and as it is known, the only difference is the minifigs. I really like the tank, it has great playability and if it had wings, I'd definately swoosh it. KimT	neutral
Skipper 24, on Aug 4 2008, 04:04 PM, said: Did your version without the LUL mace have trans blue grill things (like the ones on the back of the speeder) ? Or was my set a one off. I bought mine online, thinking it was the new version but I ended up with that very lame LUL fig. I just hate that fig... It's completely useless, we can't use any part of it for anything (although, I only discovered yesterday that the lightsaber blade was a standard one and not glued, as I always believed, so all isn't completely lost) In the end I still was rather disappointed by the set. It's too full of holes ( Hum; I think there's kind of a paradox in that sentence...)... But the BARC Speeder and green clone are indeed fantastic. Oh, and yes, mine came with sand blue grill parts instead of the trans-yellow ones... didn't realise it at first, and I spent half an hour cursing, thinking they forgot to put them in the box. But in the end, I don't know if the replacements are any better , since they're supposed to represent some kind of thruster light or something... All in all, I think it's my worst set... Not necessarily for the set itself which is OK, but psychologically, there's too many things that went wrong with it...	neutral
Nice review AGAIN, Skipper. I passed on this one because of the price, but it's a nice set. Good for you for getting the newer version with non-LUL Mace and an extra clone. That purple blade sure is a beauty. The tank itself is alright, just an AT-AT on wheels, in my opinion. The turret is great, though, and so is the speeder bike. I didn't realize that the jet pack had two "nailguns" (harpoon guns) on it. I thought that the nailgun was a new piece... but the jetpack is very cool.	positive
Pretty nice set, but the newer minifig packs had greater variety in both the figures and equipment. My favorite one among all of them is 6704, which is also the only instance of both Blacktrons appearing in one set. Quote I wonder why this set had no blue or black astronauts? Whatever the case, I always loved the small minifig sets that Lego released, as I could never get enough astronauts. My favorite was the set of Futuron astronauts. I think the blue and black guys hadn't yet been released at the time of this set.	positive
LOL, I don't know what's going on there!	neutral

7674 V-19 Torrent Number of Pieces: 471 Number of Minifigs: 1 Price: £49.99 The V-19 Torrent starfighter was an assault fighter with exceptional speed and maneuverability used by the Galactic Republic during the Clone Wars.It was a predecessor of the Alpha-3 Nimbus-class V-wing starfighter, in terms of purpose and usage. It first appeared in the Genndy Tartakovsky?€™s Clone wars 2D series. Basics Box front: The box art shows the torrent flying above Tatooine, with the new blue and white ?€œclone wars?€? style packaging, Box back: The back shows some of the features of the set including the lifting mechanism and adverts for 7679 Republic Gunship, 7675 AT-TE and the 7673 MagnaGuard starfighter Inside the box, there are 2 instruction books, a very small DSS and 9 bags that are not numbered. Bags: Instruction books Random manual shot Parts list Book one is mainly the construction of the body and one of the engines, Book 2 is the other engine and the wings. For better pics of the manual look on lego's website. Sticker sheet: A very small sticker sheet is included, which includes 2 republic insignias and a nose sticker. Minifigure One minifigure is included, a clone pilot. The whole "OMG only one minifigure in this set" and "Its not movie accurate, i hate you TLC!!!11one2" has been beaten to death, so please don't make this review turn into that and to be honest i don't care because its an awesome figure. TLC have made the effort to print the life support device onto the chest plate so props to them. He has the "clone head" like the rest of the clones have in the CW releases, there are no extra clone bits apart from a long blaster, that's not included here. Interesting/other pieces Printed piece! Rare/unusual pieces: there are 2 pistons included, as well as 2 weird looking technic pieces that serve as the landing gear during the build. which might explain why the set is quite expensive, it musn't have been cheap to manufacture them. The build It starts off relatively simple, the first 16 steps is getting the basic shape of the cockpit and the mechanism to make the middle wing move up and down. After that the next few steps are getting the landing gear/wing folding device done, it's actually the same thing so when the wings move into attack mode the landing gear retracts. This is then locked into place by the white beams that form the basic shape of the fuselage. Up to step 46 is the fuselage, as well as fitting the hydraulics. This is what it looks like when the fuselage is complete. The cockpit is not "air tight", there's is quite a big gap Top: Bottom: The final few steps of book 1 is the construction of one of the engines, here it is attatched : The yellow bar is not permanent, its used to keep the white bit at the top from moving downwards. The steps are repeated in the second book so that both engines are now in On to the wings! First one attatched, The middle one is attached now: and finally the last one: It is now finished! The pieces that are left: So, you're probably wondering, how does it enter attack mode? well can you see this bar? push that bar to the center, and pick it up, the hydraulics move the central wing downwards as well as the side wings to enter attack mode: The outer wings have flickfire missiles on them, they obviously don't work, but it increases the playability of the set. The cockpit opens in a similar way to General Grevious's starfighter released last year, using a sliding mechanism For other pics see here : http://s25.photobuck...eview/?start=20 and i'll be taking other requests for pics, maybe a video of it switching between modes. Build: 7/10 very symmetrical build, the mechanism to move the wings might annoy some people. Minifigs: 5/10 1 fig in a £50 set, however it is a starfighter Design: 9/10 very accurate to the source material, Lego have really made the effort to make the movement feature work. Parts: 8/10 lots of technic, white and dark red pieces Price: 7/10 could be slightly cheaper, Playability: 6.5/10 need to buy some enemy sets to get the most of it, flick fires don't work. comments, requests, questions and criticisms welcome.

Thanks for the review, simonjedi. This just re-affirms that the V-19 is my highest priority this fall. Behind the RGS, of course. Is that new printed piece a 2 x 2 Tile? It looks like an excellent detail part for MOCing. Those black pieces used on the landing gear look very Bionicle-like. If they haven't been used before, I'd suspect they will be. Not that I'm a Bionicle expert or anything. It is a shame that this set only includes one clone. That seems to be the only drawback to the set. Everything else looks spot on.	positive
First, thanks simonjedi for a great review. I'm interested in what you think of the hydrolics. I could spend hours just deploying and undeploying the wings and landing gear. I'm a little worried, the very first batch of the hydrolic piece for, umm, I think it was the off-road 4x4 Technic set, was very fragile and broke after a few uses. These seem to be holding up but I'm anxious to see if they hold up after 100-200 uses. quote name='Walter Kovacs' date='Aug 4 2008, 11:47 AM' post='337841'] Those black pieces used on the landing gear look very Bionicle-like. If they haven't been used before, I'd suspect they will be. Not that I'm a Bionicle expert or anything. [/quote] Right you are. They are Bionicle Bohrok head pieces. So pretty old in Bionicle terms and fairly useless in my opinion but they do make interesting looking landing gear as I deploy and redeploy the wings and landing gear. Hopefully, we'll get a pilot in the battle pack to help mitigate the fact we only get one here. -Tohst	positive
The printed part isn't new it came with 10178 motorized AT-AT walker. Also nice review, I would get the set if it was a little cheaper or came with more than 1 fig. Whyhas it got 2 instruction books the set isn't particularly big?	neutral
Thanks for the review. I've added it to the index and added a poll in which members can vote their opinion on this set. I think this is a very good set. I like the colours and the very playable feature that allows the wings to lock in attack formation. Now all I need is to buy this baby. Edit: I gave it an Above Average rating, since it's well designed, looks sturdy and fits the SW theme sets perfectly.	positive
pedro, on Aug 5 2008, 12:29 PM, said: It looks pretty big compared to other starfighters too. Did it take a long time to build? It took me 3 and a bit hours to build it, although i had some problems with the technic and i had to take pictures during the build.	neutral
Thanks for this excellent review simonjedi . This looks like an awesome set and this is the set I am most looking foward just as well as the Separatist Spider Droid (7681) .	positive
I love this set and I gave it "Outstanding". I might note though that the cylinder is just there as a dampener; when disenegaged the wing function still works, just not as smoothly. Interestingly though the cylinder is an old piece, (I have a few others) it's just that this is the first time it's been used without a spring... I had no problems assembling this set.	positive
I voted outstanding, this is simply an amazingly good looking train and comes with indeed 11 minifigs! I sold this one because i need a budget to build my ship, but i kept one because i love it! Not bad for a first review Ruben!	positive
Oh Ruben you lucky so and so this set is one of the most beautful i have ever seen! Splendid looking build and 11 figures, all the same faces like but still you get that old woman pig-tail head piece which is just great! I thought you meant the monorail set when you told me about this but guess i was wrong (don't laugh i've been away from lego for quite some time) and for 80 euros it was a real bargain from a great friend! Really nice review hope this sets brings you years of joy!	positive
Really Nice Train, I always wished TLG would have made the passenger IR train longer and maybe used some of the nice features of this train, I still love that faucet piece.	positive
This is a great review of a great set, Hairy Ruben! I voted for Outstanding since the only thing you can say about this train set is that it is outstanding. It has been the best passenger train in all the time from Lego's beginning on until now. I bought the rereleased version of it in 2003 - and I really, really do not regret it! Klaus-Dieter	positive
Hairy Ruben, on Aug 5 2008, 12:00 AM, said: The interior of the two however is laid out a bit differently. The space in the front carriage is occupied by a cockpit (or whatever it is called in trains) and some space to store your cable connecting the front lights with the engine. I can imagine it must get quite cramped and dangerous for the minifig driver with all the cabling. Further back we have a quite random, weird looking engine. One part reminded me rather of a jet engine on a commercial airplane. The engine is accessible by means of the two side cargo doors. At the end of our first carriage we hit what looks like the train's restaurant, two tables and no chairs. There shouldn't be so much of the light cable in the front section or "cockpit." Most of the cable should be in the central part of the train. Then it is not so crowded for the engine driver. I have never had a problem with the cable and the space available for it. The only problem I had was that the cable had a loose contact after some time. When the train went into a curve (can't remember if it was a left or right curve) the light went off. I have now got the same problem with the cable that I put into my Santa Fe Super Chief. Always when the engine turns into a right curve, the light goes off. My dad could repair the cable for the metroliner. Even though he is quite skilled at repairing electronic things, he found it very difficult to repair since there were no screws to open the electronic plate. It annoyed him a lot. So I've been asking myself if I should really bother him with a second cable with the same problem. The train set itself is outstanding (and that's what I voted for). I only have the legend 10001, but it's 99% identical to 4558. I also have club car 4547. I don't have the legend club car 10002. The reason for this is I always had the choice between one big LEGO set or several small ones for Christmas when I was a child. I always went for several small ones. Metroliner 4558 would have been a big train set, but I really wanted a passenger car. So I bought 4547 with my savings without having the metroliner. I was quite happy when the metroliner was re-released. I bought it with my own money. Then I could finally use the club car with the train it was created for.

Thanks for the review Hinckley! I love this set! I still haven't renewed my BM subscription, but i'm sure I can find this on ebay or bricklink. And what an addition this would be to my army. Edited by ~VBBN~, 05 August 2008 - 01:32 AM.	positive
Nice review Hinckley. I just got mine as well by paying quite a high price for it since its exclusive to US. However, I had not opened it yet and I left it in my friend's car. I gave it for an above average for that cool little jeep. For an exclusive BrickMaster set, this is certainly one of the best vehicles I had ever seen. I like its construction built. If this is ever released in the main stream, I am sure it will be a hit to get a small sized Indiana Jones set.	positive
Outstanding set and review, thanks for presenting it! I've had this since it first came out, but didn't think it would be that impressive, so I didn't bother opening it. Now, I'm tempted. Aside from the slight size issue, I can't find anything here to gripe about, except for the limited availability. I want 5. I think that makes me a parts monkey. Eek eek. You're exactly right about this selling like mad. It's another one of those missed opportunities for TLG. Sure, it's nice to get people to subscribe by offering it as part of BrickMaster, but in the long run, put it in the stores for $6 and sell a million. Just give us Indy's manbag, we need it for postal employees and such. As is the running joke whenever I comment on one of your reviews, I'd give this a solid 985. Not out of anything, just 985. Or, in clearer terms: + 1/2 (though I voted 5)	positive
Nice review! I would like to get this set... unfortunately I don't get Brickmaster mag, and the prices on BL/ ebay will most likely be ridiculous. I wonder why Indy doesn't come with his murse (man purse) in this set? Thats the best part of the fig. The jeep itself is very nice, especially with the dark green. By the way, what is frown? Brownish... something, I guess. Oh yeah, and funny comic.	positive

Thanks for the cool review, Hinckley. When I saw the picture originally I thought it looked good, but not that good. But seeing the pictures in your review, I love this, I voted it as outstanding because it has great parts, and a brilliant construction, ingenious perhaps! SirNadroj, on Aug 5 2008, 02:30 AM, said: Simply put, I'd have to admit this is one of the best Indy sets. I agree. It's so sad we Europeans can't get it...	positive
Thanks for this great review hinckley! I agree with you this set has to be released as normal set. I just recognized how clever the building technique is, you couldn't see that on the packaging shots we got before. Hopefully i'm able to grab this off ebay or somewhere else sometime!	positive
Surprisingly well designed set for Lego OVERLORDS... I mean brickmasters!	positive
I voted Average. It's a cute set, and one which I built from parts many times as a kid. (I didn't own the set though.) Thanks for the review!	neutral
A nice set to go with the outback theme. I am kind of dissapointed they they didint continue the theme, as I only managed to grab 6487 and 6550, none the less, this set is very interesting as it's one of the few to feature working suspention. Stauder.	positive
Great review Brickster Why exactly did the outback, Adventure etc. themes never quite catch on......Just a thought. What a great set! I wish I had it, But in 1997 I was just back from my whirl wind trips around the world and had drifted away from Lego I don't know why. But I will say this I love the actual suspension that came with this set and the trains sets I have been trying to buy up as much of it as I can, And now I see I need to add one more set to the "I need to get that"	positive
Stauder, on Aug 7 2008, 06:17 AM, said: The great thing about the copter was it had 2 suitcases, which as far as I can tell ain't a common part, not rare, but still nice to have. And it had the guy with the green jacket. The winch wasn't bad either, the only flaw was it was a "standard" lego copter, meaning similar ones where avalible in quite a few sets. Do you plan to review it? Oh, I wish I had it. I don't recall seeing 6487 in the stores back when I purchased the other Outback sets. I'd love to see a review.	positive
Very interesting indeed! I especially like the folding ladder. I never thought of making such a clever function. I might have to use it in my future LEGO models. Another great reveiw Bloody Jay! ;)	positive
Tks for the review once more Jay ;) I totally agree with you Jay !!! This set has very nice details suche as the mini gun, movable ladder, green barrels and great figs !!!! However, it is very expensive for what it is and I don't think there are that many very usefall parts in there !!!! (well, I could use those treads !!!). If I ever buy this set, its really not for the design, which I totally dislike...	positive
Thanks for the reviews once again. It looks like qite a nice set to me, although the European version will lose the big gun. I like some of the stickers (although I wish they were printed), and I actually quite like the dinosaur. I probably won't get it though, the set I'm most likely to get is the Fire Hammer.	positive
Quote I would easily pay $30 for this, no questions asked. But $40 was a hard sell for me Is it easier for you to "eat" if you know that this would cost you around $60 if you live in Denmark :|	negative
This is my first review, so I thought: the smaller (the set), the better! 6626 Snowmobile Year: 2000 Subtheme: Arctic Pieces: 20 (+1 extra) Note: Polybag; 6577 is the boxed version Price: €.1 + S/H on eBay MISP (Mint in Sealed Polybag!) Building time: less than 2 minutes. If it came out in the last months, if would be called an Impulse set. It actually came out a few years ago; being those my "dark years", I missed the Arctic line. Now that I'm back into business, I wanted some! But not all of the sets were good (or easily available). I had the chance to buy this one, and I0'm happy with it. As you can see below, it consists of a figure on a scooter; the only accessories are those chainsaws that lie on the sides (unless you take the skis from the scooter and have the minifig wear them!). The extra piece is a TransYellow 1x1 round plate. According to Brickset and Peeron, the difference between box and polybag is the sticker "sheet". You choose whether the nose is better with or without the sticker: I'd say "with". The judgement: it's cheap, it has a cool minifig with a cool head accessory and a nice torso. I don't think I like that orange colour that much (and I can't understand why those blue pieces have to be... blue; I guess it's beacuse the whole line uses blue with orange!), but I have to say this is definetely a good set. I'd give it a 4 out of 5 in its category. If you want to own at least a set per every theme, this could be your Arctic one.

Nice review Cobra. Thanks for sharing. I think Arctic was one of those neat themes that never really took off. I like these little poly-bag sets as they make great starters/introduction sets for themes (or) serve as a nice supplement or add/on to an existing collection. I've always liked the thick green hood piece used in the Arctic theme and have thought about using it in a SW Hoth scene. In any case, nice review! I've got an Arctic set that I built recently and will share a review soon.	positive
What? My st came up as the first post....	neutral
This is a very nice looking set. It could do with a few more clones, but hopefully that will be fixed next year with battle packs. Back to the set, I think the colors on this are great (I love dark blue) and the design is pretty good too. It seems to be pretty accurate compared to the real thing. Thanks for the review!	positive
Well, here is another Separatist set that looks like it is worth getting to me. My Gunship is going to be outnumbered pretty quick. Nice review.	positive

Thanks for the review PMJ . I like the play value in this set even if I don´t own it . The way the orbs are put into the rocket is awesome and I really like it, but at the end the set have some lack of detail .	neutral
Really awesome review svelte_corps . You did a really complete and in-depth review of this beast and with your nice pics is really enjoyable reading your review, so congrats . I like this ship even if it looks so bulky but I need to buy first other sets, so maybe this beast will be landing in my collection the next year (Or this one if I am lucky ). I can just ask for something, can you post a pic of all your clone wars sets together with this one (all the sets in one pic, not many pics with this an each set ) please . Edited by darkrebellion, 12 August 2008 - 02:20 AM.	positive
I read the Visual Guide recently and learned a bit more about the Twilight. I won't get into spoilers but it seems that the ship becomes a sort of endearing family van for the characters which is neat. Big bulky, uncool, but it gets you from one place to another. If it factors into more than just the 90 minute film, I may pick this up. It seems that there's room for a lot of personality in this ship once you see the film. It is a Corellian freighter smuggling spice for the Hutts. That's cool right?	neutral
Zzz, on Aug 12 2008, 09:00 PM, said: And I simply LOVE that there is space inside. You said there is not really some cause of the landing gear mechanism, but it seems it should be easily fixed. Do you think there is enough space to put some plates over the landing gear and add some beds, kitchen und TV? I think this set is so perfect to mod it into a Clone Wars mobile home, your back garden ist just perfect for this. It does have that homely feel! There is room inside with technic beams to lay plates etc on, the only issue is that it's kind of fiddly to access. You could do it from either the side door or rear door though, maybe move that tow line at the back. I have to say, it is a set that grows on you	positive

Joebot, on Aug 12 2008, 04:17 PM, said: Seems like TLC has done a pretty accurate representation of the ship. The real fault for the ship's messy design has to go to Lucasfilm, not TLC. My guess is Lucasfilm is trying to recapture that "what a piece of junk!" magic of the Millennium Falcon. I guess we'll have to wait to see the movie to see if they succeeded or not. The idea of a "space mobile home" reminds me of the Winnebago from "Spaceballs." Great review!! Informative, entertaining, and opinionated. So many people shy away from stating an actual OPINION in their review for fear of offending anyone. What's the point of making a review if you don't state what you think about it??? Nice! Its $99 = £52, but our price is £80-90! That Ugha Warrior looks like Man Friday from Robinson Crusoe!: EDIT: Also I am going to use that Wing technique for WW2 Mocs! Its perfect!

Good review there! My daughter loves the backyard garden of the Twilight My opinion of the ship has changed after reading this, thanks!	positive
[/quote] Part 3: A Closer View[/b] Close-up of the main body of the ship: Front-on. It is well-designed how the figs appear in line of sight (unlike the 6211 where Jabba and Leia were photoshopped in to the box art). Don't ask what Rotta is doing out of the line of vision there. Some things are better left unsaid. [/quote] Rotta: Can I get on your knee to look outside? Anakin: No! Rotta: Can I pull this lever? Anakin: Don't touch it! Rotta: I want to drive! Anakin: If your not quitting I will get you back to that mean white woman. Rotta: I need a clean diaper! Anakin: Ashoka, Get of the toilet! It's my turn to get some rest. Ashoka: I thought I would become a padawan, not a babysitter! [/quote] [The rear deck is so large that it is wasted just being used so Ahsoka can bungee-jump. I came up with a much better use for it. Outdoor garden! Despite having one roboticised hand, Anakin was still quite the green thumb. And his light-saber was very useful as a hedge trimmer. So much so that he set up a side business between Rotta-rescue missions. Here's a promotional postcard: And to finish on a light note, I'd like to remind you that you do get another Ahsoka hairpiece, which can be used for all sorts of things. Ugha warrior upgrade: Dr Inferno hair transplant: And finally, attack of the deadly blue-ringed octopus, native to Australia's beaches and oceans! Thanks for reading! [/quote] LOL, the garden would be lovely to see in Gardeners World. Never thought Patrick Star also liked gardening.	neutral
Having plenty of time on my hands this summer I did some reviews. Yes, I'm aware this has already been done, but I'll just do it once more. No harm there Set# 5615 Set title: The Knight Price: 2.99 Euro / 3.49 USD Pieces: 21 (yes a whole 21 bricks) Release: 2007 The Box: A neat little box that has a great size for dropping into your shopping cart. For once TLG didn't shove the bricks into an oversized cardboard box ;) The Knight: This is a great minifig. Though he looks a little unsatisfied...might be because his head isn't put on "all the way". A great army builder fig. The only thing that I find a little annoying is that the "collar" isn't completely rounded. It looks too much like an animation and left-hand work. The Weapon Rack: YES! Thumbs up for this. Plate mail, sword, shield and jousting helmet. Plus the spear and open helmet on the fig. So many great additions to put into use. Bring it on pesky skeleton army. The all in all verdict: A great set. A little too expensive compared to the Crossbow Attack in which one gets 2 knights and a skeleton plus bricks for 5.49 EURO / 5.99 USD. But still a great army builder set. And the 7090 set, does not have the same Knight fig. KimT	positive

Thanks for the wonderful review. This is really a beautiful set - I love the old lego houses from the 80's and 90's - they were always very quaint and well designed. Actually, I like the old car designs too, but only for their nostalgic value (in reality, they are very unrealistic and look more like go carts). That said, not all four wide cars are silly looking - the 4-wide cars in these city sets are awesome and fit in with the modern CITY style great.	positive
This is an awesome set, man... and a great review. Just too bad it is so rare! I voted 5. By the way, does anyone know if there is a review for this? Or other sets that come with a camper, perhaps? Also, I was wondering if the creator houses are in scale and could be used with minifigs and such.	positive
Hello all Eurobricks members and Town Lovers, Today, I will be doing up the third item in the SHELL Promotional series in 1998. Three out of the eight promotional sets are under Town theme. The third in the line is the Exterme Team sub theme which is promoted in 1998. Extreme Team is a bunch of adventurous, daring, breath taking individuals that risk their lives for an unforgettable excitement of the lifetime. Their vehicles range from land, air and sea type of extreme taking types. Extreme Team is one the unknown themes ever released in my "Dark Age". I only had this small lovely set in my Entire Extreme Team collection. Hope we are able to see more interesting reviews under Extreme Team as well. Name: Extreme Team Raft Theme: LEGO System / Town / Promotional / SHELL Year: 1998 Pieces: 19 Minifigs: 1 Price: USD$2.00 An image of a 2537, Extreme Team, Raft This will be an exciting water adventure! This is another great addition to your female population count. She is one of thhe daring individuals in the Extreme Team, that take her raft beyond limit, into the rough waters where she might face possible dangers. Look how confident she is, with those witty eyes of her. I am very sure she will survived the course of her entire journey. Raft's Design This is a very simple design, with just a big piece of wooden plank and a couple of logs tied together on the side, and it is ready to take it down to the water. Speaking of some real adventure, do you dare to take this raft in the unknown waters? There is a small holding area, where she is able to place her critical equipment to ensure her safety throughout the journey. Bottom of the raft Excellent range of equipment This set actually provides very good range of equipment. There is a pair of oars, hammer, life vest and backpack. The most wonderful piece of equipment is the pair of dynamites. First of all, they are printed. Next, they can be used in Wild West or any playing possibilites which involved in explosives. This is a very good impulse set to stock up these accessories. I wondered what she need to use these dynamites for? Her Extreme Team black jacket is very nicely designed, with their logo "X" or another way of saying "Xtreme". I find the green arms and black jacket matched pretty well, with that blue cap. Front view Relaxing herself, listening to the calm sea To summarise, this is one of the better impulse sets ever produced. It comes with a simple raft with tons of good accessories, and a very cheap way to obtain dynamites. In fact, these are my only 2 piece in my entire collection. Somehow, this set managed to find its way to my collection in my Dark Age, and I am very pleased to have this. No major flaws on this set, it fufill the conditions of an excellent impulse set! Summary review Playability: 9.5/10 (High playability involved. You can used it as an Indy, Adventurers or whatever purpose for the raft) Design: 10/10 (Very very simple design with superb great accessories. For a promo/impulse set, it's very good) Price: 9.5/10 (A very inexpensive set based on the 1998 pricing. Great way to buy this to add in some adventures of your own) Overall: 9.7/10 (This is a fanastic set, mainly for its accessories. Get it if you still see any of these. It's defintely worth the money, if its reasonable) I gave it a "5" based on my Review Score Card. What about yours? Hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine. Comments and Critics are strongly welcomed. Pictures can be found in My Brickshelf (When moderated)	positive
Overall, an excellent set concerning the price range. Nice review, WhiteFang!	positive
Aerial Recovery Set #: 6462 Theme: Town Res-Q Year Released: 1998 Piece Count: 201 Minifigs: 3 List Price: $25 (USD) My personal favorite of the Res-Q theme released in 1998 was this helicopter, 6462 Aerial Recovery. The set offered a pretty modern helicopter, raft, three-wheeler, rescue gurney and net, and three figs including a diver. The set is action-packed and offers a high degree of play value. Starting with the box, front side and back: Front Back I always liked the rough ocean/sea water pictured in the boxart. The same image from the front of the box appears on the cover of the instructions: But the back of the instructions picture a plain view of the copter: One sticker sheet with a few "Res-Q" stickers is included, mainly for the tail section of the helicopter: Interestingly, the set includes three figures, one being a diver. What I always found strange is the inclusion of an "X-Treme Team" Diver who has the logo on his torso (although it's a very nice fig): Back shot: I think this was my first set with a Lego three-wheeler. I always liked it a lot: The set includes a yellow raft (also found in the Divers sets) and some scuba gear: NOTE: the raft has a black piece in it's center for lifting up by the helicopter For sea and emergent rescue, a gurney can also be lifted by the helicopter: The set also includes a net with hook to lift the three-wheeler and other items. An extra string pulls the net closed: Here's a shot of the helicopter: The front section has a large trans. blue piece enclosing the cockpit: Inside is a printed radar slope: A smaller trans. blue piece appears a bit higher for access to the middle section of the helicopter and/or a small storage area: In the middle section is an place for the gurney and a box for storing some of the adventure gear: Here's a picture showing the gurney: On the side is a pulley mechanism that swings to the right when not in use: On the opposite side is the winch to raise and lower the grappling hook: Here's a picture of an open storage box: I like the tail section with propeller: Decal is not shown Here's another shot of the copter from a different angle: And the final image, the entire set: Final Thoughts Personally, I think this is pretty nice set. I like the thought of using the helicopter to rescue people at sea using the working winch. Extras like the trike/three-wheeler and the rescue net make the set even more fun. Hope you enjoy this Res-Q review.	positive
Thanks for this review TheBrickster, i also have this set and think it's one of the best helicopters TLG made in the 90's. It's quite big and has got place for 2 minifigs in the cockpit. I also like the fact that there's a victim included in form of the x-treme diver, which also is a theme i always loved as a kid. Do you have any other Res-Q sets left to review? It would be an honour for me to also do a review of one or more sets which are left, but unfortunately i got not much time at the moment.	positive
Looks like a nice helicoptor, I love the 2 cockpits. I love the diver's head, I really need one of those.	positive
This helicopter is so cool and I agreed with you that this is a high playablity set. It's not common to see such a big scale helicopter which has two cockpits back then. The color scheme works well for me. With so much features such as the lowering of the grappling hook, storage box, storing of the gurney and etc. One thing which can be improved onto the helicopter is the rotors. It could be extended a little longer as the size of the helicopter is too big. It makes the rotors rather weak as it is not able to support the weight. I am confused why there is an extreme team personnel there. I thought he was supposed to be recovered from the Res-Q team? Although there is so many questions in my head such as why include the black tri-cycle bike, Extreme Team, and etc but this is still one very good set to play with. Too bad, I had never seen this before. Somehow, through your review, I like it very much. The only big scale helicopter which I owned is the 7738 Coast Guard Helicopter and Lift Raft. Neverthless, I gave this a "4". Thanks Brickster.	positive
I think the set is too unrealistic, I like the new ResQ sets better (and I'm somewhat a Lifeboat freak so I'm always following such a sets with interest). I would like to see some rigit inflatable boats some day ;) but about the chopper, I like the accessoiries.	negative
metalandi, on Aug 24 2008, 04:17 PM, said: What exactly makes you feel this set isn't realistic? Since the question was asked... 1) tiny rotors 2) dual cockpits (only seen on a few military copters) 3) stretcher extends beyone edges of fuselage when inside the vehicle 4) Extra long canopy (really only seen on military helicopters), and "military" design. 5) Black colorscheme for rescue vehicle. The the stretcher, minifig designs and rescue logo are the only things about this copter that really suggest that it is a civilian rescue aircraft. It's a toy set with alot of play value, but I agree with Karto that these kind of desgins really turned me off to alot of the TOWN and CITY sets of the 90's. On the positive side, the new CITY sets, with thier realistic non-futuristic designs have really tempted me to buy more vehicles.	neutral
It took quite some time, but now i'm finally continuing with city reviews. This one beeing about a really good set of the RES-Q theme, and also one of my favourites of this theme. It brings a lot of playability and an incredible amount of useful pieces, even with only 145 bricks in complete. Set Nr.: 6451 Name: River Response Number of minifigs: 3 Number of pieces: 145 Release Year: 1998 Price: ~20 USD (Back then, when it was new) Unfortunately i haven't got the box of this set anymore, but the instructions are still there in good condition: We get 3 RES-Q minifigs in this set, from which i really love the detailed torso's: A shot of the complete set with both the boat and the little car off board: The before mentioned car is really, really little, but it still got enough space to transport 2 minifigs: A closeup of the rubber dinghy: The speed boat as stand-alone: As already said before, this set brings a big count of equipment and accesoires with it, which is really good for a set this size: In the middle section of the boat there is enough space for a minifig to sit in and put on his diving equipment: And last but not least, a shot from the whole set wirh everything attached, at the front section you can see a wench which also adds a lot to the set: When i got this set back in the day, i was really happy about it and for sure spent a lot of tie playing with it, because of it's great features as the wench in the front of the boat, or the car the boat can transport. I hope you like my little review, stay tuned for more in the next days! edit: I forgot the poll, can sombody add it please? I don't know how to do or if it is possible to do that myself Edited by metalandi, 15 August 2008 - 03:59 PM.	positive
This is one of my favourite sets. I remember getting it in Tesco soon after it was released. Those were the days... The res-q line was good, and this set made it better.	positive
If you still have all the parts, try to rebuild it, you'll see that it's a great feeling!	positive
Nice review. I always wanted this set. The speed boat makes the set. Thanks for sharing.	neutral
Well I for one really like this set it has to be one of the nicer ribbies that TLG has made tons of playability and nice options for redesign, Great set overall. Thanks for the review.	positive
Very nicely done - this cart is a striking resemblance to the crossbow cart we got in 2007.	positive
Nice review I agree with Thok it’s quite similar to the more recent crossbow attack, though this one has the added benefit of two shields. This set would I fleet be more useful to army builders than most of the modern castle sets, even though many people don’t like frightknights.	neutral
Thanks for the review. I've added it to the index. I'm not a fan of this theme. But I have to say that this is a neat little set, that does hold some good things. Figs and weapons are always welcome and one can never have to many wheels. So I rate this "Average."	neutral
Great Review! This set has cool features. I just wish that Lego would release this as a Lego Legend and release it to Australia too, since this is a set about Australia. I would've bought two if this were a Lego Legend. That is how good it is. I like the building with latticed window and windmill. I also like the cargo airplane, windsock, and radios. Plus it looks like it's got great minifigs.	positive
This was a cool set I thoght of it as i was building The post plane.	positive

I suppose it's the yellow. The plane in this set is much different than most of the other Classic Town airplanes in that it has the double tail section. Here's a shot of the new 7732 Air Mail set - definately a nice set:	positive
Whats wrong with another yoda and some nice light blue bricks? I probably would destroy this set, and keep the minifigs intack tough, chrome lightsabers on!	neutral
Thanks for the review KimT! Oldies reviews(old sets ) Are always appreciated. I feel this set isn't that great. 1- Yoda: He is by far the best part of the set. Although, is his weapon blue? 2-Lord Tyrannus: Pretty nice! I feel the middle part of his torso is a bit bland, but that isn't a problem. I wish they would make a fleshie one too. 3- Speeder bike: I always hated this design. The back looks terrible to me. Way too bulky in my opinion. It jusn't give me the image that it's the same as the movie. The lightsaber is amazing! Why is it only in this set? 4-Yoda-Lifter: What? That is terrible. But at least it has some nicely colored parts.... A fine set, but not the best IMO.	negative
Nice review I realy like this set, two nice minifigs in an affordable set and i do like the speeder but that lift thing is strange, but now at least i know what it is, thanks for letting me know!	positive
Thanks for the nice review KimT . I like this set especially by the fact that it is the only set containing the Dooku minifig and the curved lightsaber , I also think that the minifig is cool but I also own the Dagobah x-wing and the wookiee catamaran sets so I have enought minifigs (A clone wars version would be very cool ) and the extra-thingy is well, just OK. The bad part is that I don?t buy the set when it is out and now is go for $40 on ebay and bricklink . Edited by darkrebellion, 18 August 2008 - 09:51 PM.	neutral
I wonder how expensive this set would be on Ebay. (Shop Victoriously)	neutral
I was very lucky to get this set and I love it, I dont have it built cause i bought it for parts but it was fun while it lasted. .	positive
I got this set a long time ago. The review pretty much says all there is to say about it. (Never knew what the red/brown thing was anyway, I used it as a canon.) Isn't this also the only set up until now that had Count Dooku in it?	neutral
Very nice review. One thing you have to consider: when lego sees pics of the star wars universe, they have to decide which would be the easiest set to make with the most playibility. Therefore, they chose the HMP. Quote Thanks for the review. It's always good to have a 2nd opinion on a set. I've added the usual poll and I'll index it tomorrow (must sleep).

I remember getting this for christmas, and despite the earthy grey parts I relly enjoyed it, and it is nice to see pictures of it again- Thanks.	positive
Excellent review Metalandi! I really think this looks like a fun set. I esp. love the mountain, bridge, and baseplate. It has adventure fun written all over it. Thanks for taking the time to review this set. I've always seen it in pictures, but never close-up.	positive
When I first saw this review title, I thought it said "Rapid River Review" thinking it was an Indian set (6766). Nice review though. I never got into Rock Raiders. I would have loved the large drill bit piece for set #s 4970 and 4940. This set looks like a little boulder hawler, and a nice set to introduce someone unfamilar with the theme. I esp. like the fig and the little 2x2 drill bit tile. The overall set looks like it has some very useful mining-type pieces. Nice review and thanks for sharing.	neutral
Rock Raiders was the shit back in the day. Awesome theme! I had this set as well as the Tunnel Transporter, which was amazing.	positive
Thanks for the review! Rock Raiders was one of the last new themes i knew as a kid before my dark ages came. Unfortunately i never managed to get any sets from it, beside a few months ago the 4910 The Hover Scout, which i review a while ago. Wish i can get some of the bigger sets in the future.	neutral
Easily one of the best town sets ever (and pretty expensive for its size too, is/was it that rare?). I hope I still have all the pieces from mine, unfortunately, my stickers are in pretty bad shape (took them off because I needed the bricks, stupid stickers covering multiple parts , only downside to this set). The design is simple, yet so detailed, and the pizza van looks great. 5/5	positive
I rate it a full 5 too. And I wish Lego would make a set like this in 2010. A town needs pizza! Edit: don't always trust Peeron. Sometimes they miss some pieces, and sometimes they just can't count them! Edited by The Cobra, 24 August 2008 - 11:41 AM.	positive

Excellent review White Fang! - and a great set to commemorate the establishment of Classic Town.net. I almost ordered this set back when it was re-released by Lego, but passed on it.

nice review,3 or 4 years ago my Dad picked up two large boxes full of classic era legos (classic town,some pirate,and alittle episode 1 star wars etc)i couldn't find the building in this set but i had the little van from this set.Its very sturdy, i should know my idiot friend dropped this from my second floor window and it styed togethersure the pizzas fell out and they probably got cold thanks for the review!	neutral
I got the original version as a surprise one Christmas. My parents liked the design so much they got it for me. This is one of the best town sets. If it didn't have the delivery van it would have been on par with 6683 Hamburger Stand, a great set in its own right. The van, and they way the back holds the pizzas, is ingenious and bumps this set up to the highest levels.	positive
Nice review. I have this set, and I like it alot. Its a master peice!	positive
INDEXED Allright, hi everybody again! Today, i'm gonna review the biggest set of the RES-Q Subtheme, 6479 Emergency Response Center. With this one i think, the reviews of all the RES-Q sets are complete now, and while i'm in a reviewing mode right now i thought i'd bring that up. This set hast got many nice aspects and also some very rare pieces, and comes with a wonderful amount of vehicles, including a speedboat, a tow truck, a helicopter, and a trike which can pull a little boat. So sit down, get your popcorn and beer, we're off to stormy weather at the coast! Sub-Theme: RES-Q Set Nr.: 6479 Name: Emergency Response Center Number of minifigs: 5 Number of pieces: 420 Release Year: 1998 Unfortunately i don't have many of the boxes of my res-q sets anymore, so i'll start right off with the instructions this time: On the backside there is no alternate model as usual this time, but only a different shot of the whole set: Next, a general overview, sorry about the slightly bad picture quality on some pics this time: Originally this set has 5 minfigs (which all are really nice!), but the guy who drives the tow truck has been lost in the flood Here's a picture of the missing fig: Let's move on to the vehicles, we have something for the water, the ground and the air in this set, first the great tow truck: I love the mechanism with the hooks in the back: Next on, da Speedboat! At the rear, it's got a stretcher and a wench, which adds a lot of playability: If there's a a little accident near the coast, the trike comes to appearance: For more complicated stuff, we have a little helicopter (i broke the rotating piece at the top yesterday, ouch! : ) No space for a victim you say? Well, not really, but the helicopter also got a wench with a hook in the back: Now it comes to the station itself, at the docks a neat life belt sign is mounted (remember, at this time there weren't real ones as today): A little more right an equipment holder is placed, with various tools on the front... ...and fire fighter equip at the back: At the very front a little lighttower secures the shelter: I haven't quite found out what this thing is supposed to be, maybe somebody knows Another equipment holder, this time with all the stuff you need for diving: More equipment... ...and even MORE! We come to the hear piece of the station, the control room with lots of buttons and scrrens: Last but not least, a quick shot of all the accesoires and tools that you get, which really is an A-MA-ZING amount! This set might have a few junioriced pieces, as the big window in the front or the "briedge" on the roof, but that doesn't matter, because there is nearly one other set in which you get so much rare pieces and such an overwhelming amount of accesoires, so i can recommend that for everybody who is a pieces-fanatic. Not to forget the playability, the great figs and the, in my opinion very good color scheme. Once again thanks for taking the time reading and looking at my review, i hope you liked it. Edited by TheBrickster, 31 December 2009 - 09:19 PM.	positive
I own this set and it's one of my favourites, simply because of the cool colour scheme which you mention, plus all the vehicles and accessories.

Baby, I will like to take a moment to said "Outstanding piece of review for your first attempt!" You have done well with the pictures and its flow. I have to admit that I love this Fighter Tank very much. The downside of it which is overpriced, and two Clone troopers do not really justify the purchase. Well, if I have the spare cash, I will defintely get one of this. Keep it up.	positive
It's a shame it only comes with two figs. It would be great for my ancient Middle-East project.	negative
Thanks for the pics so far. Will you have high-res pics of the other sets in the instructions?	positive
MattZitron, you have done well to display images of the Dung Stain hull... Its a darn shame that it can't be extended. However, I see no reason why LEGO couldn't produce a special middle hull piece that is compatible. Although the way they've made the hull is a bit stupid. The old system was a lot more flexible. Better still why can't LEGO design a hull that can be extended in length and width... Then they could be as made as long or wide as desired and that would be great!	negative
Good work Samsta! No wonder I wasn't aware. 4+ Pirates and all...	positive

WooHoo!!! Thanks for these pics. I'm probably more excited about the dark red 1x4 arch than anything else. I have a large project that I'm doing in dark red, but there has only been the 1x6 arch made in that color....until now! Now to figure out how to score about a hundred of them :/ -Jeramy	positive
I received this set with a $25 gift card, so It was a great buy. It follow with a similar build to the 2007 trucks, but has a few improvements. Of course, the name of the set could have been a bit more creative... And yes, this was an academy review. Set name: Truck and Forklift Number: 7733 Pieces: 343 Theme: City Year Released: 2008 Price: $25.00 USD, ?19.99 GBP, 24.00 Euro 1/Box Now the box follows a design similar to most other City sets. It has the set information and photo of the set on the front, (sorry for it getting cut off, I will remake it). Now the back of the box shows what each bag builds. Bag 1 is for the forklift, bag 2 is for the cab, and bags 3 and 4 are for the containers. It also has the set's features. 2/Contents The instructions: There are 2 books included with the set: One for the forklift, and one for the truck. Minifigure(1) The first minifig you build is a simple cargo worker. Interesting/new parts: Here we have some interesting and new parts. They include a yellow seat, a 1x2 plate with clips, and a 1x4 slope. 3/The build Cargo1 The first cargo palette has a few crates on it. I really like the sticker on the small box. Forklift: The forklift is a very fun extra to build, and it is probably the best forklift that we have had so far. It is very realistic and is very strong. Cargo2 The next piece of cargo is some Octan barrels on a meter. I am not sure what It is supposed to be, but it is still a nice addition to the set. Minifgure(2) The second minifigure is a classic driver with sunglasses and a coffee mug. Very nice. New piece! This is a very nice new piece that is included in the set, a hollow canopy. I believe it is also in White with the police mobile command station. Truck: Now anyone who has had one of the Lego City Harbor sets from last year, then you will probably find this build to be very similar. Mostly in the cab part of the truck. The trucks build is very solid, and very realistic. I sense ths will bring the ratings up quite a bit. Mystery Cargo: For some time specualtion has been going around, what exactly is this? It seems like nuero poison.. I am very happy with those 2x2 cylinders in trans-yellow. In fact, you can join in and guess what it may be in this topic. Containers: The first container is built to hold one palette. It fits onto the truck. It produces a very pleasing result, and has a better look to it than the Containers from last year had. The second container has the ability to hold two palettes, and has a design similar to the first. Then, you build on the wheels. The back ones have beautiful mudflaps! Finshed set: ---------------------------------- Parts: 10/10 (lots of useful pieces, great colors, and some very cool new pieces.) Minifigs: 8/10 (I would have liked another but it was $25, so I guess its okay.) Price per part: 10/10 (almost 350 pieces for $25. ) Playability: 8/10 (Forklifts are always fun, and there are lots of things to do with this set.) Overall: 36/40 90% A- This is truley an outstanding set, and It will make a great addition to anyones collection. Mocers would aslo like this, due to the fact that it has some really nice parts. It has a great build, and utilizes some awesome new techniques. It also has details, something you might look for in a set. Highly Recommended. Hope everyone enjoyed the review! If you have any pic requests, questions, etc., please ask! I look forward to hearing your comments, and the judges comments as well. 7733 Peeron.com 7733 Bricklink Catalog 7733 Shop At Home	positive
Thanksfor this review, i also got this set recently, and i'm very happy about it. I live the design of these new trucks, and the forklift is also great. Not to forget the good amount of cargo. Btw., i think the "mysterious cargo" only are normal fuel barrels	positive

Great review! I dig this set. It could have only been better if it had been a 6-wide version of the old 6367 Semi-truck. Still I ask: what's so special about the special edition?	neutral
That explains why it isn't in our local stores. I also got it from S@H, but my box hasn't got the "special edition printing" on it, surprisingly.	neutral
Nice work VBBN I'm not really into technic myself, but you've definately done a fine review on this set Funny that it actually fits a minifig. Perhaps we'll see fans design forklifts with technic and having it minifig sized	positive
That´s really a sweet and charming little Technic set, thanks for that fine review!	positive
Nice review. The figure fitting inside is great. I think the price might be a little high but you did get it from TRU so what else is to be expected.	neutral
I loved all of these "walker" sets. It was such a smart technique. I made one myself with what I had ...ahhh good times! Thanks for the great review.	positive
Great review! The Y-wing is an awesome starfighter and the detail in this set is superb. Funnily enough I was just swooshing mine today! Edited by pedro, 27 August 2008 - 08:25 PM.	positive

fallenangel309, on 19 September 2011 - 03:43 AM, said: Not a threat at all - I was simply pointing out that yodalikespie made the mistake of inquiring about the new Y-wing before we had any information on it. To my understanding, it's not so much the fact that he bumped the thread as the fact that he bumped it for no good reason. I'm not certain where the Moderators stand on this issue, but I feel that yodalikespie's question would have been better received had he posed it after a substantial amount of information had been gathered on 9495 - as I've said, there simply isn't much one can go off of at this point to determine its value relative to 7658. Roger that. Sad that the original review pics aren't available any longer. Would be nice once the new set is released for comparisons.	neutral
Thanks for sharing this review with us. I'll add it to the index. One of my favourite impulse sets along with the Troll Warrior (or is that Orc warrior)	positive
Thanks for that good review, ~VBBN~. That´s really a fine and pretty solid looking mecha. I think that the designers did a good job on this last wave of EF sets, and the inclusion of these mini robots was also a pretty smart idea!	positive
Since my last post I've had the chance to build the Tiger, and I was surprised in a good way. A much better set than I actually thougth. Front	positive
I just bought 2 of them since they were 5$ each from lego. I really wish they did not cancel this series.	positive

Thank you for the nice review. The set is not that bad, but a shield would be a nice addition. I also don't like the flickfire missile. A camp site with a fire and a chickenleg would also be nice about the rat; Isn't it just foodsupply for the troll? The only problem would than be that the food is running away.	negative
More firefighter, there must be a pyromaniac in Legoland somewhere! Theme: City Set Name: Firefighter Set Number: 5613 Number of Pieces: 25 Figures:1 Released: 2008 List Price: £2.00 (GBP) $3.50 (USD) 2.99 (EURO) 5613 Peeron.com 5613 Bricklink Catalog 5613 Shop At Home Starting as always with the box I didn’t know red cylinders were flammable. Interestingly an action shot and not other sets you might like to buy. The contents of the box. Looks much like every other impulse set. Firefighter, not sure there’s much else to say apart from I wish they’d included breathing equipment. Looking pretty pleased with himself if you ask me. The equipment rack is fairly standard and easy to build, it does however include a fire hydrant. Inbuild shot, will I be able to finish this complex build.[/. Unsurprisingly I did. I nice selection of kit is provided. All together, I think the fire is a bit odd but it does add playability. If you want to increase the number of your firefighter and their equipment this is a great way, though there is something missing in my mind. The Rating System Figures: 5/10 (Fairly standard I already have a fair few) Parts 6/10 (Good selection of tools, but lacks the breathing apparatus I’d expect in a set like this) Fun Fun Fun 5/10 (There’s clearly something to do even if you just own this set.) Design 5/10 (Not going to win any awards but it’s robust) Price 8/10 (Nothing to complain about, you get a lot of accessories for the price.) Grand Total 29/50 (Reasonable design and good accessories a good set to improve any fire department.) Conclusion. This isn’t a set I’d necessarily buy, but while I was at Bluewater today I decided I should try to review every impulse set myself, so that why I bought it. Still I think it has some good playability and a good set of accessories if you need more firefighting kit, I just can’t get passed the lack of breaking apparatus, that would have made it a better set in my view.	negative
That’s the problem I couldn’t quite tell what, it’s a bit of a problem in a reviewer. Maybe a hose to clip to the fire hydrant I don’t know.	neutral
Brick built robot, surely we?€™re getting near classic space now? Theme: Space, Mission Mars Set Name: Mini-Robot Set Number: 5616 Number of Pieces: 24 Figures:1 Released: 2008 List Price: £2.50 (GBP) $3.50 (USD) 2.99 (EURO) 5616 Peeron.com 5616 Bricklink Catalog 5616 Shop At Home Let look at the box first. Space man approaching the robot from behind. I?€™m not sure you can still buy the base easily anymore. The contents of the box. The contents of the box, it?€™s rather white. Fairly standard Mission Mars spaceman, he?€™s got printing front and back but sadly no air tank! How does he breath? *As has been pointed out he does have a printed tank but I'd rather a physical one* Note the megaphone is in flashlight mode not weapon mode, that?€™s important.. The robot itself feels a bit clumsy the metal detector is never going to touch the ground and it feel a bit wide. I don?€™t like the look of him something in the eyes. The reason why so we can have a box to put crystals in. Both together and ready to explore new worlds etc. Sadly the robot was homicidal, remember in space no one can hear you scream. It?€™s not a bad impulse set and if it marks the return of brick built robots to Space then it?€™s a good thing. I just feel the robot could have been better built. The Rating System Figures: 6/10 (Not to bad but nothing wonderful) Parts 6/10 (Lots of white and not much orange, but where?€™s the air tank!) Fun Fun Fun 6/10 (Probably the best impulse set as a stand alon toy lots to do with a robot and his human boss) Design 5/10 (The robot feels clumsily put together I think it needs work) Price 8/10 (Can?€™t fault the impulse price.) Grand Total 31/50 (Not well designed but does have more play value than other impulse sets.) Conclusion. I was surprised that Mission Mars got impulse sets as it didn?€™t seem to sell as well as other lines last year. However I think this is a fairly good set, it has more playability than other sets and does come with a metal detector been a while since I?€™ve seen one (though I could be wrong) sadly the robot isn?€™t as good as it could be.

Opps well that’ll teach me to do reviews without my glasses! Thanks for pointing that out Stauder.	neutral
I wasn't all that impressed with what you get in this set for the price. But you have an interesting point; that the robot can be considered a reference to the Classic Space bots. Makes me think I ought to try modding the robot later...	negative

This here was a set that I new I had to get. A beautiful minfig, amazing minfigs, what more could you want? So was this set worth it? I guess you will just have to read the review to find out! Set name: The Batcycle: Harley Quinn's Hammer Truck Number: 7886 Pieces: 267 Theme: Batman Year: 2008 Price: 35.00 USD, 44.96 EURO 1/Box The new box art for batman is pretty stunning. It's clean, and really sells the set. For this set, Harley Quinn's truck is pictured attacking Batman, with the set information. The back of the box shows a nice little comic, the other sets, as well as the set functions. 2/Contents The instructions: The instructions for the set are, as always, clear and straightforward. They display the colors well, and have what we expect in an instruction book. 3/Build Minifigs: The stars of the set! Batman is back with a new torso, much more metalic than before. Harley had all new printed torso, legs, a new head, and that sweet new hat. Batcycle: The bottom part is very sturdy thanks to a small bit of Technic. The red throws it off a bit, but it isn't seen once the top part is put on. It has a nice use of the smoke stacks, and looks very nice in the end. The top part is simple, but suits the purpose well. It has handle bars, and a nice motor. The blue is a little strange though. Hammer Truck: The hammer truck begins with a very sturdy base. It has lots of detail, and really looks cool. Rims Added: Lego did a very nice job at giving it a checker board appearence. The only problem here is that you stick a sticker over two bricks, multiple times. Jewels: Inside of the crate are these shining jewels. Look how they illuminate the darkness in Gotham... More Added: Then, we add on a spoiler and the crate. Looking very nice now. The detail is again, outstanding, and It has a good amount of smoothness to it. The infamous Hammer! Okay, I haven't said this yet, but the square pieces need to stop. First on those SW backta tanks, now on the hammer? It creates a sloppy look for the hammer. Still, this is the ultimate wacking weapon. Added to the truck: On the truck it works pretty well. But the handle is to short, and it's near impossible to smash Batman. The finished truck: The finished truck is really nice. The big wheels give it the monster truck feel, and the way that Lego alternated the colors works well. The cockpit is a little palin, but that's not a major issue. The "I love Joker" sticker is one of the best stickers I've seen. It's simply a classic. The finished set: ---------------------------- Parts: 9/10 (Lot's of good mocing pieces, and red and black are always usefull.) Minifigs: 10/10 (Awesome!) Playability: 9/10 (the hammer is a little short) Price-per-part: 8/10 (It's a liscensed theme, so meh.) Set 7886 is a very nice set, and has some great details in it. The minifigs are very cool as well. However, their are some flaws. First, the hammer is two short, and is kind of square. The Batcycle has a few awkward colors in it, which throws it off a bit. This set is definatly worth the money. Batman fans will love it. And also wacking fans will like it, for that hammer... And if you would like to buy this set, Here are a few useful links: S@H link Peeron link Please let me know your comments. And pic requests and questions are welcome!	positive

LEGOMAN132, on Aug 29 2008, 06:35 AM, said: This set is nice it looks like a DHL van Makes you wonder if there was some kind of promo or hookup in the pipeline that never happened?? I have this set and I really like it. It works well with either the new City sets or with my older 1980s/1990s sets. I actually like the use of the old style car base and mourned the day that these became exitinct the first time round (c1990). Thanks for the review! Cheers Rog	positive
Nice review. I like this little set. Some how it reminds me now of "Postman Pat" in dutch "Pieter Post", an english childrens tv series about a postman in a little village somewhere in Yorkshire. Aah, sweet memories I would rather have seen a postoffice released (with some women minifigs) instead of the green post bigplane. But maybe in a couple of years.	positive
Thanks for this review. I was thinking of getting this set and having read your review went out today and got it. What a great little set. What I particularly like: Very sturdy build. Feels very solid as you build the pickup (compared to the Fire pickup & trailer I also have) The orange pieces (my first pieces in this colour!) The tyres which give the smoothest ride of any Lego Town/City vehicle I've ever built The raised suspension and side runners The Coast Guard dude (again a first for me) and his mega-cool flippers and aqualung The jetski controls - The handlebars actually move left to right which is a great detail Little details that Lego didn't have to do (the grey handle by the ball joint; moving handlebars; the new tyres) As you can probably guess, I have voted Outstanding for this set! Erdbeereis1, on Aug 29 2008, 06:02 AM, said: Color separation is not a problem here, and since it is a small set, the piece call out is not a necessity. You do get a piece call out with this set (I did anyway). It's on the back of the small poster that is included in the set!

Nice set, nice review, I already have one coastguard set (that truck) but I like the idea very much. However, the Rigid Inflatables could be much improved (see the real ones at www.rnli.co.uk or www.knrm.nl)	positive
As I've already said somewhere on this forum, this is the largest Islander set I own and therefore my favourite. Thankyou for your great review. I picked mine up for only 5 pounds along with Crocodile Cage and King Kahuka, but I can't help you with the original price. I would search the web but I'm too tired right now...	positive
I feel the same way about the Islanders sets Brickster. They are a nice change from the regular pirate versus soldiers that is the norm. I think it would be interesting to see some new Islanders sets released in the new pirate line to see how TLC would make them.	neutral
Great review, well done for sure!! I love these reviews of old set, and this one is especially unique. I must agree with you the color scheme is magnificent. Makes me want to go to ebay and buy it now! To bad for Spongebob though, he got in with a real bad crowd...	positive
Another very nice review, and im glad to see it has some nice pieces as well as characters too. Looks to me that no one on BL has it in Australia for sale so I may pass on this beauty. Though I did pick up King Kahuka recently. He makes an appearance in my Medium entry	neutral
Well, for some weird reason I missed this before, so I tell you now: very good review (as we are used of you, Erdbeereis1). I like all the Islander sets, and own quite a few myself! For people that don't own any of the Islander sets yet, the 6262 King Kahuka's Throne is a great way to start! Lots of minifigs and accessories!	positive
Well, this is a not so old set and i bet most of you already have it. So here is another review from me. As usual, let us start off with the box art. Box art: I like the box art. They put a nice background for the AT-AP. At the side we have the minifigs scale and at the back there is the function shown and advertisement for other set. The content: The content is consist of 6 packets of bricks and a instruction book. Yeap, no sticker sheet. Instruction book: The instruction books not only show us the steps but also show us all a clear pictures of the January release sets and some sets show with their function. Well, this includes the AT-AP functions as well. Besides, there are bricks checklist as well and the how do you start off before assemble your sets and a little poster where the clones with their AT-AP battling the Droids. Here's a random page. New pieces (to me): I never see both of this piece before so I assume it is a new pieces. Anyone have any idea is there any other sets that contains this piece? The blasters: We are given a 2 long blasters which is great. Which I it is more accurate as most of the Clone troopers use a long blaster. The minifigs: The minifigs is 2 Shock Trooper but is different with #7655 clone troopers battle packs's Shock Trooper. The leg is different in colour, we are given white hip while the one in the battle pack are given a black hip. Furthermore, we get a new printed headgear, which I think they have improve it, check out the mouth printing, the colour is brighter. So here is the headgear: The headgear limit itself from turning to the side this is because the front part it is too low until it block by the torso. The Shock Troopers: Without helmet on: We are given a black stud, no face printed. How I wish that I have extra. With helmet on: Comparison with Shock Troopers from Battle Pack: The AT-AP: Here's the AT-AP. It looks ugly at a certain angle and looks great in a certain angle. Anyway I still like the set. I like the walker vehicle. Below are the pictures taken randomly: Top view: Side view: Without stabilizer leg: With stabilizer leg: Rear view: The Functions: Well, the functions are not so impressive. Just something turning around, open here and there. The only function that is say as special is the retractable stabilizer leg. The cockpit: The cockpit can fit two Clone Troopers but too bad we are only given two and is not enough as there is no gunner on top. Inside it there is a guns holders, which can hold two guns but fall off easily when you are trying to remove the guns. Well the other side have some speedometre thing and a controller. To reveal the cockpit, you have to open the top hatch. Look below: so you can see what's inside: Oops, the side hatch and back hatch as well: Open and close: I think this pieces is use not to let you open the hatch but to make some design, I mean make it able to move inside. With Clones: Beneath: So this is the pieces that hold the stabilizer leg when is not in use. This is how the stabilizer leg move: At last~ And of course the revealing cockpit from below and at the back. Guess the droids have alternative way to take this things down faster. The leg: There are pieces blocking the leg to go to the front I mean overhead and lose balance. The base in not movable The side armor: The side armor has door and this is how it is attach. It is very flimsy, when you want to adjust it to be a little steep to creat the shape, they might just fall off. So it is connected to the body with just a technic pin. and to hold it properly, here is the support: The side hatch: It open and close easily, very loose, nothing to hold it tight. Here's some view when the side hatch is open. The cannon: The cannon on top is movable and adjustable. The big cannon can move up and down while the smaller one can cove sideways. But the smaller one tend to lose balance when it is without minifigs, means the one on top and below will not b align. This is the pieces that only enable it to move up and down. To prevent it from moving freely, LEGO put two pieces to block it. Completion: I try to make the sets looks great. I think this angle is right. Spare parts: It is so few compare with #7673 Magna Guard Starfighter and it is more expensive. Overall: This set is not really a good set. The hatch is quite flimsy, top and the side since there is nothing to hold them tight. Besides, it is lack of one clone. But to complete your walker collection, you must have it. Pros: -no sticker needed -new improved headgear -long balsters Cons: -lack of clone -flimsy -expensive as few pieces are given] Hope you guys like it.

It was also weird that they included Shock Troopers, but it was probably a way to get people to buy it. This set also seems like one of those that was kind of thrown in with a mix of other sets like the Tie Crawler. I never picked it up, and with the new Clone Wars sets out, I won't. Me too. I don't like the the Shock to have white legs because I am very fussy and I don't mix them. I also expect other Clone to be in this set but it came with 2 Shocks. I buy it because i like the Walker vehicle.	negative

Did anyone encounter the problem with the main turret? Apparently, the very tip of the piece (cone shape) can't be put onto the "pole" piece. I check the instructions 2 times and still can't find what i'm doing wrong. Is it just me or did anyone else got this problem as well?	neutral

I seem to recall having a problem with the largest turret as well. I forget how the instructions look though, but the bar not fitting in the cone sounds familiar. I just checked mine and what I did was I took the red bar and stuck it into the round piece with the fins and then attached the cone to the stud on top of the round part. Worked fine for me.

Though, I still definitely enjoy the company here to contribute more reviews when available(meaning after I find a better way to co-exist both my hasbro and lego stuff spending). millacol88, yup, those accessories definitely makes me want to start lego clone troop building.	neutral
Good review for a simple set. While it does come with the basics for an impulse set, I just feel that it lacks something though I am not sure what. Perhaps a printed magic scroll? I am still not a fan of the printed cap (especially the stars), but I do like the printed pants displaying his various goodies hanging from his belt. The plain torso is to be expected from a wizard minifig I suppose. Overall, it's not a bad set but it certainly feels to be lacking something, IMO.	neutral
Thanks for the review. I love this impulse set, I bought two of them so I could make a Wizard and his apprentice. I didn't have an owl either so an extra is pretty cool, and I like the trans globe piece. Batbrick Away!	positive
I Scream Clone, on Aug 31 2008, 02:27 AM, said: Kudos on a well presented and written review. I think the reason this set didn't release in US was because it didn't have any warnings about choking anywhere on the box, therefore no lawsuits in US for LEGO. Cheers ISC No that's not the reason. I'm sure you'll get this set eventually. As for the box, well, there's always been 2 box-designs - one for the US and one for EU (actually there's an Asian one as well). The EU doesn't have the box count or the don't swallow (we know that). The US version has the brick count and don't swallow warning (typical US). Thanks for a super review strawberry-ice-man. I like the wizard, I'm only sorry they put him in an impulse set. Who'd want an army of medium blue wizards? So it's the worst army builder, but a cool wizard. Does that make sense?	neutral
The next in my attempt to review every impulse set single handed Theme: Space, Mission Mars Set Name: Alien Jet Set Number: 5617 Number of Pieces: 21 Figures:1 Released: 2008 List Price: £1.99 (GBP) $3.50 (USD) 2.99 (EURO) 5617 Peeron.com 5617 Bricklink Catalog 5617 Shop At Home As always we begin outside of the box It looks rather exciting at first glance. Set that cost a lot more than this one. Now for what?€™s inside. The contents of the box, the impulse sets never look that inspiring. Now for the alien, I have to say I?€™m not impressed. I?€™m not a big space fan and I only bought this due to my impulse review challenge, but as the main point of the impulse sets is the alien is a little hard to build a good set round something with one point or articulation. It lacks what make Lego minfigs so great their articulation. Now for the space vehicle, as always with impulse a short and easy build ensues. Took maybe 2 mins at the most. Time to mount the alien in his craft. The craft looks a little wide for him. Slightly better from this angle but still not winning any awards. I?€™m disappointed of the impulse sets I?€™ve reviewed so far this is clearly the weakest of them, but what really disappointing is the other seem so good and useful. The Rating System Figures: 3/10 (The alien is not a good minfig) Parts 6/10 (Some interesting parts but nothing that special.) Fun Fun Fun 2/10 (I can?€™t think of anything to do with this set to be honest.) Design 4/10 (Poorly designed the box makes it look much better.) Price 6/10 (Despite the impulse price tag I?€™m still unhappy about the price.) Grand Total 21/50 (Less than half marks the lowest I?€™ve given so far.) Conclusion. In many ways I?€™m annoyed, from the outside of the box this set looks quite interesting and certainly appears to be well designed. The idea of a small alien fighter/flying craft is in my opinion a good one, but sadly when you?€™ve got the finished product in your hand it looks nothing like the box art. While I think Mission Mars had some interesting sets and I might still get some of them this one will not be a repeat purchase for me.	negative
Well set out review with alot of great content! Gotta ask you though, how does the set look nothing like the box art? With so few pieces I'd have thought one could mentally put it together given the box front.	neutral
I’m not a great communicator but what I was trying to say was that on the box the sets looks quite exciting and well made and that the Alien fits much more snugly than it does. So I was a bit disappointed that it seemed wider and less compact and certainly less exciting when I opened it,	negative
Thanks for this review. As for the set? Well, I am not to crazy about this set, But I want some sort of small alien fleet vehicals, and this would work well. But I would rather ave my money to buy classic town. Edited by ~VBBN~, 01 September 2008 - 02:48 AM.	negative
I already don't liked the aliens, but if the fighter was better I would already bought him. Now I will maybe buy one of it just for the 2 limegreen pieces.	negative
Sets we miss include minfig sets like this one?€? Theme: Space Set Name: Space Mini-figs Set Number: 6703 Number of Pieces: 30 Figures: 6 Released: 1988 List Price: ? (unknown) 6703 Peeron.com 6703 Bricklink Catalog Lets begin by admiring the outside of the box. Wow 6 figs and all equipped, I was four more of these. We don?€™t get instructions so the back show how to put the figs together. Now for the men themselves. The complete line up, of all six figs, it seems strange half are in black. A closer look at our four Futrons. A look at the Blacktrons looking like nice guys with their visors raised. Time for a closer look at the range of tool these good men received from the Lego Company. Yep one accessory per person. The question is what could you do with this set, I mean it?€™s just spacemen in a line? Do you see the man who mugged you ma?€™am?. A good set from an age when we could look forward to every few years a new set of minfigs and just a box of them The Rating System Figures: 10/10 (An excellent selection for the time) Parts 4/10 (Good accessories but nothing else.) Fun Fun Fun 7/10 (I can see lots of opportunity for fun with this set..) Design 8/10 (Well it?€™s not really designed much but it?€™s a great idea.) Price ?/10 (Unknown at this time though mine was from Woolworths!) Grand Total 29/40 (A good mark for a great set.) Conclusion. Until the Castle Battle Packs came out this year we?€™ve been suffering from a lack of minfig based sets, and from this review I think you can see why. For many of us and I include myself here Lego minifig are one of the best parts of the hobby and sets like these allowed you to build up a much larger number of figs. Lego did well with this set a nice range of figure and also a good selection of accessor	positive

Thanks for the review. Is a great one. This set is not really a good set but i like the Spider Droid. The Hailfire Droid scale is not right, i think it is suppose to be even bigger. anyway, this is the first set that re-release the Commander Droid. So i grab it.	negative
Thanks for the cool review JimButcher . Actually, I really like this set, it is small but very clever and even if the hailfire droid is undersized, what in the whole line is not under or oversized . The new spider droid is the best small build I have ever done in a set and the droid commander is pretty cool . I am happy with the set and I will get another with my comic-con exclusive .	positive

mass-manufactured and designed to withstand extreme amounts of punishment... It's an Iron drone, and it's marching on its Sentry! Set data 7711: Sentry Year: 2006 Theme: Exo-Force Subtheme: Robots Pieces: 74 (+4 extra) <- both counting Hinge control stick and its base as two separate pieces Price: Euro 7 circa, MISB, including S/H, on eBay; RRP was Euro 5 circa / 5 USD. Probably 5 UKP. Building time: 20/25 minutes (10 minutes building, the rest of the time placing stickers!) More info: Brickset - Peeron Being 2006 my last dark year, I wasn't a big ExoForce fan but they were ok. I tought 2007 models were better, and still think 2008 models are the best. That basically means 1) It's a shame that there will be no more of this line and 2) this is my first 2006 model, yet I bought in in July 2008. Ok, let's do this one. Box front: box was battered due to Italian Post; they'll do their best to give Lego boxes a "war" outlook. Close-up: the Japanese katakana read "tokushu butai" -> special (military) force(s) Box back: amazing alternate model; some like it more than the original design. Box content: a small but capable sticker sheet, two bags and instructions. Sticker sheet: and they're numbered! Random instructions page: connecting legs to the body Instructions page - sticker detail: that's why they're numbered. Instructions page - parts inventory: does anybody check if they're all there before building? Surely not me. Loose pieces: nothing rare, I think; small Techinc parts come in different colours, as usual (you often don't see them when the model is complete, but sometimes you do) The Iron drone: "strong and durable" (and much better looking than those crappy MM jelly aliens) Building starts. The open cockpit - front and rear view Left leg - front and rear view; right leg is built of the same pieces. Left arm - with laser cannon The cannon - great use of the hollow studs with the "Plant Tree Palm Top" Right arm - with twin missiles Complete model - front view Complete model - side view and rear view Rating and review. Parts and building: nothing new, but both models are O.K. Instead of waiting the last page of the manual, you'd better put the stickers in place while building. Looking at the box you'd tell stickers background is (trans) purple. It actually is trans clear (excpet for the yellow and black stripes - warning: hazard!). Try not to put your fingerprints on the sticky side! Consider using tweezers. Posability: both legs and both arms feature three joints; and that's good, so that the weight doesn't have the Sentry falling down. Final model: smaller compared to 2007 Claw Crusher and 2008 Batlle Arachnoid, but cheaper and surely worth the money. The "minifig" is just another Iron drone, not much to say. Final rating: 3,5/5 Edited by Sinner, 01 September 2008 - 02:22 AM.	neutral
Thanks for the review. This is one of the few first wave sets that I didn't get. I'm not really sure why as it wasn't too expensive.	neutral
Thank you for that fine review, TheBrickster! I really like how this two small sets create an intense and adventurous atmosphere against the backdrop of a pretty exotic region. The sets´re well designed and very nice with a fine amount of rather unique and well fitting gear. The whole theme offers a lot of playability in a set-up that´s a little different to TLC´s standard sceneries for sure. And... it always reminded me of 'Who Goes There?', too...	positive
A nice set review. As for the theme itself, I though it was a very interesting theme. Sadly I don’t think Lego put enough effort into it, I was personally upset not to se a second year even if I didn’t buy any of the sets. It reminds me of the artic theme Playmobil did at one point in the distant past to be honest. I think a number of good artic scenes were missed, when it came out a really wanted to get a ski plane but it never came, I built it myself in the end but I don’t know how Lego missed that one. On a slightly random note I do know that at least one Lego minifig did make it all the way to the real artic with a research team, sadly I don’t have any pictures to offer you.	negative

Nice review Brickster! The Arctic theme is very nice. The minifigs have a great look to them especially with the hoods. The colors for the Arctic sets I have always liked, and somehow the idea of minifigs exploring the arctic is fun to me.	positive
It's amazing! It's stupendous! It's almost like WhiteFang is a reviewer with previous experience! It's almost like I wrote all of Shadow's lines! It's almost like Staudie is being as annoying as ever. Oh wait, that's all true! Great review of a neat little set. I used mine as the air conditioning unit on the roof of my Chinese restaurant. Then some dork told me it didn't look believable or something. I liked it. Um... so. Great review! Thanks for presenting it! I give you a And, let's just take a moment to get sentimental. A year ago, today, Staudie had a lame idea: Interview the members of EB. He flailed around with it for a few interviews, including the infamous one where Hinck attention whored Sinner into a corner and Sinner were featured, reprising their roles from the Whacker and the Walrus. It was quite memorable, but then, a short time later, someone new joined the team, bringing it to a new level of polish and bad jokes. Still, this tribute isn't dedicated to that genius of the written word, nay, it's dedicated to the whole staff, including the new guy who is still a secret so don't bother asking, I'm not telling! Ha! I salute you, EB News, it's been a damn fine year! I hope I can survive another.	positive
Great review, Whitefang and Co.! A thoroughly enjoyable one, I'm glad we have a series of reviews that you can expect to be packed with humour and craziness. Looking forward to the next! ~Peace	positive
It can NEVER be a happy ending for Stuadie! So why did you give him one? Nice review	neutral
This is a very good review, no doubt about it. About this set, this is a cheap way to buy this set with a witch and some nifty accessories such as the black cat. In fact, I think this is the first time I had ever seen a black cat. It's simple, but not very useful in my collection. Because other Fright Knight sets also offer the witches too. I don't need many witches. Overall, I feel that this is an average set.	neutral
Yay, another Fright Knights review! Odd comic at the end. Skipper 24, on Sep 1 2008, 07:05 PM, said: Ever wanted to turn into a animal, wanted to curse your enemy or just wanted to be rich beyond your wildest dreams. You should go visit the Witch and her Fireplace. She can brew you up a potion for any occasion or purpose. So head down to see the Witch right now. Sounds like a song or nursery rhyme, somehow. Anyway, to the review, it is a great review, such a small set but you've summed it up well. This is one of the few unpromo Fright Knight sets I didn't get, sadly. Not 'sadly' because of Willa the Witch, I have about four of her, but the special cat, and the other bits (one can never have too many Lego bats). I voted the set outstanding, I think it is for its size. KimT, on Sep 1 2008, 08:16 PM, said: You already know how I feel about the review. Good or bad feelings?

Review of 7670 Hailfire Droid and Spider Droid *Updated* Theme: SW Episode II / Clone Wars Parts: 249 (- figs) Figs: 4 Price: £20.00, $20.00, ?‚?25.99 Year: 2008 I think many people were deterred from this set because of the low piece count and a high price for it although it does come with 4 minfigures. 1. Overall set and figs Official box pic. This indicates it is a Geonosis set from the background but it is no different from any other set same old brown separatist ship/s. The whole set. Some red tan droids would have been nice like in the Geonosian fighter set. All the minifigs. The super battle droid body is slightly different to the one in the BP. It looks more grainy and silver. I doubt this has any relevance for it being a geonosis set but I like them better how they were in the BP's The Super Battle droid body dwarfing the commander droids body. I think that the new Commander droids body is better than the old one with just the yellow strip even though it is less accurate. New twisted Battle Droid arm, each droid has one of these. I don't really like having droids with these new guns I think the older guns suited them much better. 2. Hailfire Droid Hailfire droid by itself. It is certainly smaller than the original. Seeming as this is the main part of the set I was hoping it would be bigger but I don't mind it being this small too much. Wheels and rockets can fold outwards and inwards The wheels which spin round two large clear discs and made from loads of these tiny links. This is probably the best way to make the wheels on this small scale. The only other alternatives I can think of are using the tracks from the Wookiee Attack set or catterpilla tracks, both of which wouldn't look right. One of the missile pods. These use the new flick-fire missiles which don't fall out are an excellent idea. They should have come with the purple cones like on the Magna guards staffs instead of red though because in the film the missiles are purple. One of the new flickfire missiles that don't drop out when the model is tilted forward. I don't know what the holes in them are for though. The 3 "eyes" are made up of 2 trans red cheese bricks for the sides and 1 trans red stud for the center.You can also see how the missile pods are attached to the side of the body. This is the back of the Hailfire Droid. There is a plate with a hole in, I have found only one purpose for this. The Hailfire Droid is the Commander droids war chariot! What do you use the plate for? 3. Spider Droid The Spider Droid. The design has been greatly improved from the Wookiee attack set. Not only is it more accurate but also more poseable which is useful when setting up battle scenes. The ball joint provides the place to put the antenna which isn't long enough but the dome form the old set looks more like the droid form Star wars Episode II. The eyes are made of a telephone piece with 2 trans red studs on. In the original it had orange studs. The eyes can be seen in action 2 pics down. I told you it was a telephone. 1 of 4 identical legs. These are very easy to adjust into what ever position you want and are much better than the originals. But a word of warning never pull them apart as I did they become very loose when put back together so I put some blue tack in the holes. 4.Overall Build: 7/10 A little to repetitive for my liking. Minifigs: 8/10 4 figs for £20 isn't too bad plus they come with new guns. Design: 9/10 Both vehicles are very well designed but the hailfire's small size let the set down. Parts: 8/10 Comes with lots of useful (maybe not ) Brown track links. Price:7/10 Not too bad with 4 figs and loads of little brown links. Playability: 6/10 Not to much on it's own Overall: 7/10 If it came with some clones and tan red droids it would be better. Afetr Jar Jar wiped out a small droid patrold he realized he was being watched Mesa in big dodo this time...	neutral

6205: V-Wing Fighter Number of Pieces: 118 Number of Minifigs: 1 Price: 9.99 USD/ 13.99 EUR/ 8.99 GBP Theme: Star Wars/ Episode III Year Released: 2006 Brickset Folder Bricklink Catalog Welcome to this review of the V-Wing Fighter. This will be my eighth review on the boards. Strangely enough, there was another set called the V-Wing Fighter that came out in 1997 for the Space theme. Note that I am missing several small pieces to this set, but they are mostly insignificant to the overall look. The Box This is the standard box type for all 2005-2006 Star Wars sets. I can't say that I like it as much as the 2007 or 2008 box types, but it'll do. It features a profile view of Darth Vader and silver text. Overview This is the whole set. This ship is meant to protect the Chancellor at all costs. They are usually found in groups of three or four. Front This ship is very sleek, and you'll notice that it's colors are dark red, light bley, and dark bley with a touch of black. It starts at the nose very narrow, but as the body progresses to the back, it gets wider, like a "V" (hence the name). Back Here is a view of the rear. Note the trans-neon green discs used to represent the boosters. Also notice the dark red R4 astro droid and the hinges used as aromor. Flight All four wings (two on each side) can open up for flight/ attack mode. They can open even farther then the pic shows, but it's not an intended function. The wings a great, but it's a real pain to position them correctly, and the bottom wings close when you set the ship down. Tail fins This is what the tail fins look like on each side, with two flaps attached to the top and bottom. If you look closely, the tail fins and wings look a little bit like a mini ship themselves, maybe controlled by remote. No, this is not an intended function, either. Guns, side The guns are very simple but very clever, using a double Technic hole piece, two black bars, and two Technic pins. Also note the landing gear. Minifig Finally, here is the minifig: a clone pilot. It has light blue arms and legs, white hands, a helmet with black markings and Republic insignia on it, and a double-sided torso. The front of the torso is great, featuring shoulder straps, armor plating, and a life support system. While this minifig is not altogether accurate to the movie, it has still been one of my favorite Star Wars figs. Back The back of the fig that can double as the front of clone marines. This side features shoulder straps and armor plating. Cockpit Lastly, here is the pilot seated in the cockpit. He fits perfectly, although it is not air-tight. We wouldn't want the poor guy to suffocate, now would we? That wraps up the review, here is the FINAL VERDICT: Build: 8/10, a nice, easy, build, and the last of the small SW ships ($10 or less). Playability: 6/10, pretty fun to swoosh around, but that's about it. Could use a vulture droid, but that would take away the 'small' factor. Swooshability: 10/10, very fun and easy to swoosh around endlessly, without fear of it breaking. Minifigs: 9/10, there really is no need to have more, although a Palpy fig would be outstanding. The pilot is a great figure though. Design: 9/10, extremely accurate to the movie, but the cockpit is not airtight. Price: 10/10, you couldn't ask for a better deal! Overall Score: 8.6, an excellent set. Unfortunately, this is the last of the small SW ships currently. The fig is great, and the sleek design is accurate. That just about sums it all up, feel free to leave your comments! Edited by JimButcher, 15 September 2008 - 03:11 AM.	positive
Yeah this was an ok set. I remember getting a few of these at TRU. The boxes were smashed up and I got some 30 percent off.

Is your knight army feeling short? Do your knights get consistently run over by the skeletons? If so, this is the set for you! 852271 Knights Battle Pack Set Info Set Name: 852271 Knights Battle Pack Theme: Castle Released: 2008 Price: USD 12.99-GBP 6.49-EUR 9.95 Minifigs: 5 It's army building time! Packaging The figs come in a plastic box with a slide out tray. To open, you slide out a tab on the bottom, and pull the tray out. The Weapons One plus of this set is the good weapon selection. You get a whopping 5 shields, a spear, a lance, acrossbow, a pointed lance thing and a lovely chrome sword Minifigures Now the main focus of this set, the figs! One thing that's nice here is that you get a good selection of different knights. The figs are quite nice, with different faces and helmets for almost every one. Minifig Backsides! I really like the archer's quiver. Two sided head The Archer has a scared head on the other side. Brickshelf Folder And now, the ratings! Price: 6/10 (Certainly a bit overpriced. It should have been $10. The Star Wars battle packs have only 1 less fig plus some parts for $5 less) Parts: 8/10 (No bricks, but a nice selection of weapons) Minifigs 9/10 (The figs are great) Overall: 23/30 LEGO S@H Brickset Bricklink Even with a bigger army, the poor knights are no match for modern technology... Summary Even though the pack is a bit overpriced, it is still great for increasing your army's size. I would get this set if you are a Castle fan looking to expand your army, otherwise don't worry if you pass on this set. Thanks, and happy building!	positive
I love this battlepack! I bought two last time I went to Legoland California, and it certainly gave the knights a good variety of new troops. However, I have one complaint, and that is the guy with the lance. I am wondering why he has a lance while fighting on foot. If TLG really wanted to give him a lance, they should have given him a horse.	positive
Great set, but with two HUGE cons. - Availabilty: only on S@H? Well, surely not in Italian stores. - Why are the figures already built? Are today's kids SO dumb? Let's go back to those old minifig packs!	neutral

Probably to reduce the size/complexity of the package, thus, saving TLC money. I don't see it being a big deal as customization is always an option. Concerning the set: Not much to say other than it does what it's suppose to do: build up one's army of knights. The variance of faces and accessories are great. I especially love the chrome sword. The price isn't bad either since the package comes with five nice figs and some great equipment. Edited by dj2005, 03 September 2008 - 06:46 AM.	neutral

Instruction Manual The back of the manual has the 2008 Police sets and impulse sets pictured.

Extra Parts This set comes with a surprisingly large amount of extras for such a small set. All Built After it's all built, you get a pretty nice set. The road sign looks nice, but it is a bit strange seeing that arm stick so far out. The little equipment rack is pretty nice. Brickshelf Folder The Ratings Price: 8/10 (Decent price, but could be 50 cents cheaper) Parts: 8/10 (Nothing special except for the road sign which is a big plus) Minifigs: 10/10 (You can't wish for more than 2 in an impulse set!) Overall: 26/30 LEGO S@H Brickset Bricklink Mr. Brickop has finally put LEGOland's most notorious criminal behind bars... Summary This is a great impulse set.

I would definitely recommend it. Thanks, and happy building!	positive

The Back The Back of the box shows a small battle happening between a knight and a skeleton, as well as the main feature of the set, the firing crossbow (more on that later.) The Instructions Not much to say here, its the same as the front of the box. The Back of The Instructions This merely shows pictures of other sets in the castle line. Random Instruction page This set does not use piece callouts to tell you what parts you will need in each step. However, the set is so small you should never have trouble finding a piece. The Minifigures This is the main reason I bought this set. You get two knights, one with a standard helmet, and the other one with a new mold. You also get a skeleton warrior. The Horse The set comes with a skeleton horse that looks great. However, it is a single molded piece that has no articulation. Close-up of the Warrior riding his horse Here you see the brave skeleton riding in on his...ah......er......um......noble steed! The Accessories/Weapons For Minifigure Accessories, you get an axe, a skeleton sword, and a skeleton shield. Extra Pieces I was left with one skeleton arm and one leg when I was finished the build. The Crossbow Wagon and now, to the main part of the set, the crossbow wagon. It is really just a plate with some whells attached and a lot of those cheese wedge pieces to create the track for the projectile. Back View This view shows the mechanism that makes the crossbow fire. It is powered by a rubber band. You pull back on a technic piece, which creates tension in the elastic band. When you let go, the elastic pushes the piece forward, which in turn hits the projectile and makes it fire! It works fairly well, but I would have prefered it fired farther. Entire Set The Skeleton charges at his adversaries! The knights prepare to counterattack! Overall Build: 10/10 The build is simple, easy and quick. Set design: 7/10 The crossbow could have worked a bit better. Playability: 8/10 The crossbow is fun to shoot. Minifigs: 10/10 It doent get much better than this. I love that domed helmet mold! Price: 8/10 The set is very affordable and worth the price. Overall Score:43/50 Conclusion Overall, this is a great set and a solid army builder. You get three minifigures for a fair price and the crossbow wagon adds some much-needed playability. I bought two of these to bolster my army and to stock up on those rare domed helmet pieces. Basically, get this set! Thank you for taking the time to read my review. I hope you liked it!	positive
I agree that this set is worth the price considering the amount of minifigs and even a skeletal horse. It also comes with a lot of blue 1x1 slopes that are always useful and quite rare to obtain. Another weapon for the soldier operating the catapult (or a shield for the other soldier) would have been great, but that is pushing it. The crossbow itself is quite nice and is better than what most $6 sets come with, IMO. Overall, a good set indeed. Thank you for the review and the other review concerning The Knight, of which I hope to buy in the near future as it looks like it comes with a great deal of goodies. The weapon rack is useful, too.	neutral
Cardinal Brick, on Sep 4 2008, 07:47 AM, said: Nice review . I still thing sets like this are the reason castle has done so well, it allows you to collect a large number of minfig for not very much cash, which I certainly indulged in. My only complaint is that you end up with the evil skeletons out numbered, however heard of the good guys winning with the numbers in their favour. I've experienced that problem too. I find my knights outnumber my skellies about 3:1.	negative

It's so hard to perforate the lungs or pierce the heart on a skeleton with a spear or crossbow bolt, isn't it? A great set with a reasonable price. Thanks for sharing it with us. Added to the index.	neutral
You're really rolling these reviews out, huh? I am not sure how I feel about this set. While it does include five figs, three are skeletons and are generally worth much less than say three trolls/orcs (I know they didn't exist at this point in time so this is understandable). The amount of horses is nice, but I'm not a big LEGO horse fan. What this set does have is a great appearance and brings atmosphere to the table. $20 is an affordable amount for those of us who do not wish to splurge too much on a toy while being enough to actually get a large enough set to create something out of. Personally, I'd rate it in between average and above average. Like another Castle set (I can't remember which), I just feel this one also lacks something.	neutral
I really like this set, and it's probably my next purchase from a store (if I can still find it). There's alot of great pieces (I especially like the spiked thingy on the front), and it makes a great addition for any skeletal army. Above all, I just love the spine-chilling feeling of it. If I were a minifig in a Legoland, I'd be scared out of my pants-piece if I saw a carriage like that rolling towards me in a dark night.	neutral
That’s a nice review, though I do feel the price was a little high but as you said you get so much in it. Last year Argos in the UK reduced it to £7.99, which was a true bargain and sent me all over London looking for a store with more in stock. Again as with all the Lego castle sets I think what makes it work so well is that Lego are now providing a much larger number of minfigs and that’s often what makes a set.	neutral
I really do love this set. It has 5 figures, which is unheard of for a $20 set. It comes with plenty of weapons and accessories and has a great design. The detail is really well done and for anyone who wants to just buy one set, this set allows for hour of fun just by itself. I already have one of these, and hopefully will be getting a second.	positive
Great review! This is my 2nd favorite lego castle set (tied with Skeleton Tower) that I own. My first favorite is Drawbridge Deffense.	positive
Great review, Erdbeereis1 this really is a fantasic set. let's hope Lego makes more sets like these (with 5 minifigs+4 horses at a price of $19.99? ) actually, it's about RM200 here. and it's not even price-to-piece count. anyways, amazing review, ad if i could get more Castle sets this year, i might even join the Reviewer's Academy	positive
Big Cam, on Nov 20 2009, 10:41 AM, said: You say in the review it's great to get 9 minifig's, but there are only 2 minifigs and 3 skeletons?? He's probably counting the four horses as well.	neutral
I voted outstanding, because i think this is the best cement mixer TLG ever made, also love the 6-stud wide based vehicles, as you mentioned. I both bought and sold it again this year, and i already regret it, but i had to sell some stuff because of a loss of space	positive
Lovely review, really. But the sad fact is we've seen it before, twice. http://www.eurobrick...showtopic=20293	positive
A great review of a very good set, I must echo KimT though (I seem to be doing it an awful lot) it would be improved by the addition of one more fig to the set, as it’s the same price band as last years catapult.	positive
I've skipped a few lunches on behalf of this set. It's a great army builder, but so are many of the new castle sets. What makes this great in my opinion is the figs - 2 orcs and 1 dwarf - what else could one want? Thanks TLG for making this set and thank you for reviewing it for us Review added to the index	positive
INDEXED Going through the boards I was amazed to find out that no one ever attempted to review one of the best Lego classics, the 6399 Airport Shuttle. While I was studying for exams a few weeks back I decided to take a break, built the monorail and take some pictures of it. Resulting in the present review. Along with this I made my first ever poll. Here we go: First, some data: Setnumber: 6399 Setname: Airport Shuttle Released in: 1990 in Holland, though Bricklink says 1991 Number of parts: 731 Number of figs: 9 Price: unknown, prices on Bricklink vary from $261 up to $2300 (!) but this was an expensive set even in the nineties The box: Mine is a bit battered by the owner before me, but there's still plenty to see. This is one of the largest boxes I have (look at the minifig in the down-right corner for the comparision) and it is a really neat storing facility for many sets. The box shows the set, and in the background the silhouet of the set that is to accompany this one: the airport from 1990. I like the angle of the box, showing the two stations, track and train in one picture. The back of the box shows some really nice ideas for other setups, why oh why has Lego abandonned this kind of showing what's possible with one set...? Inside flap of the box, showing details of the set and the functions, Detail on the front of the box, displaying the dimensions, it really is a huge track layout for one set! The instructions: there is a nice little booklet showing the same picture as the box art with the figures lined up underneath. The last page nicely folds out to show the entire setup of the tracks, The figures: A brilliant selection of minifigs including airport people and a cook. All figures that are supposed to go on the shuttle carry a ticket and there are also some suitcases (tickets fit inside, of course) Station # 1: The set includes two stations. Here is the first, depicting the airport. There are lots of details: a phonebooth, two seats, some flowers, a map, luggagelockers and of course the streetlights. A detailed shot of the station showing the luggagelockers and ticket-validating machine, Part of the beauty of this set is the fact that it is so extremely detailed, just look at the signs to show where to go next (stickers), and the scenery opposite the street... The station has the same shape as the Airport Shuttle logo, how sweet is that? The station pictured as part of the layout. The stations ends are made with airplane wings to smoothen the arrival of the shuttle. Station # 2: Here is the second station, my personal favorite: An elevated stop with a little snackbar underneath and stairs leading to the platform. Some chairs and streetlights here as well plus two old fashioned trees, The part of the set that can be used in any layout: the snackbar with hamburger sign (sticker). Yes, those hamburgers look tasty indeed! Also notice the lights hanging from the platform overhead and the ticket-validating machine at the bottom of the stairs. Here we have the platform with information panels and seats. Also notice the two trafficlights for the train. Here's how it works: the train will travel in the direction the arrow is pointing. When turning the knob the two grey blocks will move towards or away from the track-center, activating a button on the centerpiece of the train (the motor) which makes the train start it's journey around the track. There is only one speed and the train can only be put to a stop or change direction at stations. The station as part of the layout. The Shuttle: Now on with the train: There are two carrriages connected to a centered motor. the power is provided by means of a batterybox containing a 9v battery. The batterybox is in one of the carriages and displays: Airport Shuttle. A total of five passengers can be seated inside leaving room for their luggage and two drivers. The front carriage with the button for the batterybox showing. The underside showing the gearwheel (metal) that brings the power from the motor onto the geared track. The black pointy things alongside the gear-wheel react with the direction knobs at stations. This is how the shuttle negociates with height differences, everything hinges and rotates, making the shuttle capable of performing steep climbs. The motor is powerful enough to not slow down at such a climb! Detailed shot, showing the first set of covered wheels in hinged position. The shuttle on the layout. The full layout: This layout is quite huge, involving lots of track pieces, ramps, ten large stanchion-poles and the two stations. To show the movement of the shuttle I have made a 20 second movie, which can be seen in My Brickshelf gallery of this set. Conclusion: Well, to conclude the review, some final thoughts: This truly is one of the more detailed sets around (at least from the nineties) and one of the largest in dimensions. The monorail system is cleverly thought out and works excellent. Track extensions are hard to get however and very expensive nowdays (especially the switchpoints and long straight track pieces). The tracks included with this set will provide you with hours of fun though, because there are a lot of them. It can be quite hard to incorporate the monorail in your town without having a clearly-based-on-the-monorail-alone town. I tried to incorporate it some years ago (link here), posing a real challenge. The Ratings: Price: 8/10: this is an expensive set, if you can get it for under $200 get it!), this set is rare in any condition. Parts: 10/10: lots of rare pieces, cool minifigs, 9v system, roadplates, lots of minifigseats en red trainwindows. Originality: 10/10: there are very few monorails released, this one being the only town set. Compatibility: 8/10: can be a bit hard to incorporate in a town, but hey: you got the monorail so no complaining here! Total: 36/40: I can only reccommend this set to anyone, It is my personal favorite set upto this present time! If there are any questions, ask them, all comments are welcome of course!	positive
Yes, this is one of the best town sets ever.	positive
Who was the one who rated it "above average"?	positive
An aweome review of an Outstanding set.	positive
Sets like this just don't come around too often do they... I didn't realize exactly how much detail really was in this set. TLC should bring back the monorail! Great review of an amazing classic town set!	positive
This remains the definitive city set in my eyes. I never managed to get one but from the instructions it seems to be perfect in just about every way. I got the two space monorails a while ago but the much higher prices on this one have kept it out my reach. This set is a lot bigger than either of those though. I always liked the monorail system a bit better than the trains because you could easily incorporate height into the tracks and spread them out in all three dimensions. Quote Edit: And bricklink is wrong giving 1991 as the release date. You're right; it was 1990. It was apparently released in 1990 in Europe and 1991 in North America, going by some US and German catalogs I have from that time period. Edited by CP5670, 06 September 2008 - 06:06 AM.	positive

Tenorikuma, on Sep 7 2008, 08:30 AM, said: It would be cool to see a review comparing this set with the newer orange garbage truck. Well I might want to do that, but then in a different way as the railroad maintenance: I will then review the orange one and make comments on it compared to this one.	neutral
Yeah its very nice along with all the older sets. I've got the Cement Mixer that was released around about the same time as this.	positive
Thanks for the review. Like many such town sets, I would characterise it as cute. Contrasting it to the new bin lorry, it's nice that this set has two minfigs (more realistic) and two bins. Those bins are a great addition to Lego, although wheelie bins would be nice now (need some kind of 2x2 container you can clip a plate onto as a hinging lid, and clip mini-wheels under the back two studs). Having two minifigs is a superior point for this earlier Lego rendition of a bin lorry. In fact, even though our bins are now emptied by a private company rather than the local council (as was the case up till the mid 90s), and of course for the last two decades there have been wheelie-bins, bin lorries have three guys - the driver and two collectors. However, our bin collectors for sure don't use a broom or shovel! Indeed on occasion they've befouled the street themselves if something goes wrong with hoisting the bin on the mechanism! The shape of the lorry in the set is still quite accurate, pretty good for a four-wide vehicle (I must admit to preferring the newer vehicles).	positive
Thanks so much for the great review, I love that truck! I hadn't realized there was a real 4-wide recycle truck out there. I must get it one day to replace this abomination currently doing garbage duty in my town: I think that truck has seven pieces total in it. I do like the blue color though ...	positive
Greetings! Just looking through the review index when I came across this one. I recently acquired this set through ebay which came with a practically perfect box and instructions. I would almost say that no one played with it much as all of the parts were brand new. Anyway, I just wanted to say that this is a great set that was worth the $14.99!	positive
Great to find this review of a classic set and it's far better than any yuk set from 1997 OMG what were they thinking ! I prefer the six wide for trucks, but for the 80's it was perfect and even today still holds it's own !	positive
I owned it and loved it when I was young ^^ I really miss it.	neutral
Perfect Perhaps the front sprouses are for foaming the runway? You've certainly kept that set in near mint condition, haven't you? Now all we can wish for is a new firetruck combining this L&S version and the new	neutral

Name: Cargomaster crane Set No.: 6352 @ Peeron.com Theme: LEGO System / Town Year: 1991 Pieces: 133 Minifigs: 1 Price: USD $26.00 / GBP unknown / EUR €19,95 Aargh stupid tree! for more than fourty years this 'megabrick' has tormented our town! we need some help! Long before my dark ages LEGO released this relatively small set. since they didn't have a construction site like nowadays, they released these small road-works. I was only six years old and really into small sets since my ADHD didn't allow me to sit and build for long periods of time. So these smaller sets were ideal for me. The instruction booklet. The complete set. The set itself is not really a surprise to set up and play with. First you'll build the smaller parts of the set like the container and the small verhicle. No real surprises there, except for the smaller car that fits perfectly in the cargo container. Just pull off the seat and steering wheel, and the car just fits. The crane itself is just as easy to build as the smaller parts. just place bricks on top of eachother. Although you'll still have the wire to connect and pull through a diversity of bricks and plates. The carco container and small car. Being out of my dark ages really tunnelled my vision toward bigger sets and completing my town. This set really comes in handy if i need construction or traffic workers in my town, I can just MOC a few containers for tearing down trees, fixing traffic lights, and so on. Behold the mighty cargomaster crane! It's pretty easy to say that a set as simplistic as this one is not much fun to play with. However if you see the bigger potential in your town this one could be of great value to any city. Playability: 7/10 (with only one container it gets a bit boring) Design: 9/10 (it's small, and fits perfectly) Price: 7/10 (Average, but not really cheap.) Overall: 7.7/10 (a nice overall set if you're building on minifig scale) Gimme my pizza!

Information Name: Fire Control Center Set No.: 4953 @ Peeron.com Theme: LEGO, Legoland Year: 1991 Pieces: 516 Minifigs: 4 Price: USD $85.00 / GBP unknown / EUR unknown Bricklink search results Brickset Lugnet Introduction This week I got the flu. so since I have to stay home and get better, I might as well make a review. It's one of the most amazing older city sets, thus making it a really valuable review. This is the story about four handsome firemen living in one of the most amazing city structures out there. The 6389 Fire control center. The box I actually didn't remember the box to be that small. (Borrowed from Peeron) The four hunky firemen Oh jeah what women doesn't like a man in a uniform The manual Even the manual is aging... but then again it's 17 years old! Review As you all know a city must have some standard civil services, like a hospital and a police station. A fire house also is a must for any lego city. This particular fire house is one of the most amazing sets ever to be released. In this cool set you get 4 minifigs, all fire fighters, two verhicles, and a helicopter Firefighters have to move around The futuristic fire truck is definately my favourite! Chief's car The smallest verhicle of the set, it's a small all-terrain jeep for the fire chief. pretty much a standard car in those days. a real simple layout, and a trunk which holds a small fire hose. It's lucky to be in this set, because it complements the whole thing The car Luckily it's red and it has de cool signs on the side. Helicopter Another great addition to the whole set is the helicopter. Again in a basic setup for that kind of verhicle at the time. This one has the nice addition of two hoses to put out the fires raging in lego city. The chopper No, it doesn't really fly Really cool fire truck thingy This fire truck is definately the best of the verhicles in this set. It's actually a futuristic model of fire trucks. I haven't seen any other fire truck like this. I saw a police truck like it though. but we're talking fire fighters right? Actually the whole thing han open up to reveal a number of fire fighting appliances such as a hose, a computer, and a oxygen tank. The fire truck click for bigger version! The main building actually looks kinda empty when the trucks and chopper are gone. However, this still is realistic compared to a real fire house. Also the front has those amazing sliding doors, which make this thing really look cool and clean. Off to fight a fire Main structure, with the slinding doors pulled down Actually those sliding doors are also the hard part of the model. Since all the bricks must be perfectly aligned, or else the doors will stutter. But if you're a little familiar with lego then you don't need to worry. From the back Enough room to play with I'm going to give my perspectives on each of the sides On the left we have the garage for the bigger fire truck. The only real flaw about this set is that this garage isn't long enough for the fire truck. This could have been solved by making it two or three studs longer. Notice the cool sunroof! In the middle we have the chief's office. complete with coffee machine, a diversity of computers, and a tape recorder, most likely to tape any incoming calls. A lot of details are crammed up in there. just like in the rest of the set. To the right is the helicopter platform. I really like the grey-blue-yellow of the platform because it doesn't look so red anymore. Don't get me wrong, red is a cool color, but not too much red! And the helicopter actually fits, and stays in place during playtime. The baseplate filled up This picture says it all. Again the four lego hunks are greeting all the ladies The minifigs are from a classic series, this happens with more of my lego sets. Bottom line is that this set is one of the best fire houses lego created. Verdict The build is pretty easy but takes a while to really see where you are with your building. It's nice to have a hospital from the same era, this create a more uniform look to your city. once you completed the model your baseplate is pretty filled up but still has a lot of opportunities. Playability: 10/10 (cool trucks, a chopper, and sliding doors, nuff said!) Design: 9/10 (insanely good design) Price: 10/10 (couldn't get better than this) Overall: 9.6/10 with a score like that one can only say... get one... NOW! Time to go home The trucks and chopper back on their rightful spots	positive
I have this one. The newer 6571 station is better in some ways, but I always liked the big airport-style fire engine in this and the windows covering the garages. One mod project I have in mind is to expand the base, adding a second room in the area beneath the control center. Interestingly, this set had two different box pictures. There was the original 1989 yellow Legoland box and a 1991 blue System box, and the blue box has the vehicles in different places. Quote Price: USD $85.00 / GBP unknown / EUR unknown If this is referring to the original price, it wasn't that much. $50 is more like it.	neutral
I think the 6382 Fire Station is the better one from the 80ies.	neutral
Big Supie, on Sep 7 2008, 08:46 PM, said: I think the 6382 Fire Station is the better one from the 80ies. I have 6382 and agree that it is a great set. It doesn't have a chopper like this set and the fire engine is not as flash. It does have a downstairs in the building though (at least a door and a front wall anyway!). It's nice to see a review of this set as it's one that I often looked at in the catalogue and thought of getting but never did. It's great to see the details that I otherwise would not have seen. I don't like the firemen with hair though! They should have helmets or caps IMHO! Thanks for the review! Cheers Rog	positive
From memory Argos sold it originally for about £21 GBP. I seem to remember this as I could not afford the airport released the same year as this was about £29.99! Seems such a small amount of money now, Now have 2 copies of this set, only 1 boxed :-)	positive
Found this set on a flea Market in Munich, yesterday. Just 25 years after its release. The instructions for a total of five models, two of them printed, the other 3 are just photo instructions in the book. It still has the box in good shape, despite some wear from the age. Sadly five little pieces were missing, and 5 wrong pieces inside instead (2 complete wheels and a classic 80s-90s plane wing (dumped into my bricks). But I was able to replace the missing Minifig torch and the 4 missing plates with identical pieces from my collection. The Box and Contents The set still has the original box. Inside the pieces, plastic insert, instructions and a 1987 Technic catalogue, imagine that set livespan today. Four years and the 8841 is still in the catalogue. Classic technic design from early 80s showing a function drawing of the Steering and the main model A small set, but with a flap shoeing the contents. All pieces in the inner box and the papers included. 5th Model: Soapbox Racer This is more or less a soapbox racer with working steering, but no engine. It's got a rather blocky design, but still looks sleek enough and is a simple build little over 100 pcs out of 180. The Soapbox at step 2 Just included the steering at step 6 Completed and ready to race downhill. Total: 7/10 Simple, but effective 4th Model: Simple Chassis very simple and boring alternate using just 1/3 of the 180 pieces in the set. It even hasn't got a seat construction. It's just a plain steering mechanism attached on wheels with a spartan chassis of just a few pieces. This is the whole model at step 5 Just attach the steering mechanism and wheels and you're done Total: The worst alternate model of the complete set. Just a boring 4/10 3rd Model: Balance Very original small model. It's a small model of a working classic Balance. And it works with small parts laid on the scales, altough they've got just a 4x4 Footprint. IT's a fast build. just 15 minutes and you've done it. The model as it looks at step 3 Finished. Easy build with just 63pcs out of 180 Total: Very original model, it actually works with small weights, but a very simple build. Still a 7/10 Alternate Model: Tractor with equipment This is the second model. It's a simple but boxy design featuring a harrow and a plough. The tractor has a similar design to the very first tractor set, but much smaller. The plough is about 24-wide and the harrow is completely SNOTTED even back in 1983. Has two functions: Working steering and the coupler for the equipment. Uses almost all pieces of the set. The tractor at step 8, the steering isn't completely attached now This is the completed tractor The complete harrow Finished alternate with the plough attached. Total: Nice, but quite ugly and boxy design for a tractor with 4 wheels of the same size. Takes me to a 6/10 Main Model: Desert Racer This is the main model, with a nice (for early 80s) but boxy design. It has two functions. Steering and a working 1-cylinder rear engine, which is of the old 2x2 piston type, since the small piston design wasn't invented back then. This is the only model of the set, which has piece callouts in the instructions. The printed alternate model has no callouts, they weren't invented on both models back in 1983. The three smaller photo instruction alternates have a piece callout at the beginning showing all needed pieces. The seat is a nice, but blocky design and use a primitive SNOT technique. This is the model at step five. The piston is already attached. Imagine this state on step 5 in modern sets. Back then LEGO had challenging instructions, not the step madness like today This is the engine just made of plates with a hole in the middle for the piston Step 9. The piston engine is completed. On step 12 the roll bar and the seat are installed. Only the steering isn't completed yet. Front view of the finished model. Just 15 steps needed back then. Bird's eye view of the whole set Displayed on the box Model Verdict: Nice design, especially the colorful seat in SNOT technique, but quite boxy especially the engine, since there were only the huge pistons. Still a 9/10 Set Verdict: Design and Models: 7/10, very boxy designs, due to the age. The chassis alternate sucks Build: 9/10 Classic 80s technic building. Quite challenging but fun Sturdyness: 7/10: rear section damaged after the table fall, but rather easily fixed Fun: 9/10 Blast from the past.

I have some decouplers but we don't use them because they are not really that reliable. LEGO just release a whole line of trains at the same time. I just discussed with my parents and they told be LEGO had those sets longer in store back then. I must have gotten the 7745 somewhere in 1983 or even 1984 although it was released in 1981. I started of with the 7710 (push along train) and then upgraded the tracks with current rails when I got the 7745. The 7745 was realsed in 1985 ;) Lego had 2 12V passengers trains between 1981 and 1984 (the 7740 & 7725) During the 80s the avergae life of a train was about 5 years.	neutral

I checked the instructions and indeed the chairs are in the wrong place... Whoops, you are totally right, I meant 7740 instead of 7745 (fixed it)!

The best 12v legotrain is for me the 7740. The 7725 is still a goodlooking train and the only one with short wagons in a electric version. Before I started to with bricklink, I started to build this train in blue. I've build 4 trains of it and sold 2 of them. Still one for sale . You can also build this in other colors, like a yellow one: Or you can build a black version, which I made a death train of it. Driven by a skeleton .

Her name was Sky Lane. It's quite sad, though, to actually play the game--the "Xtreme Tower" is the only set that made it into the game itself, and it was a really watered down version of the Information Center from the first two games. But the island was, in the game, filled with incredible buildings that would have made really cool sets.	negative
Nice review. Is that one minifig breaking out of prison? (Just wondering about his clothing.) The worst thing is the name. Anything with Xtreme in the title almost deserves the lowest score possible on principle.	negative
Thanks for the review! I loved this theme, it had some of the greatest pieces ever arranged in any theme, brilliant printed parts and figures, and some good colours. Snap Lockitt (Hippie Dude ) is a great figure with a cool name, I own him from another set, but unfortunately not this one. It looks like a very good set, no stickers and good printed parts too. Nice review. Pencoin, on Sep 9 2008, 05:21 PM, said: Hippie dude? Thats Snap Lockitt, Island Xtreme is one of the best themes ever, Im trying to get the sets off Bricklink, thanks fo the review I need this now. Hahaha. That made me laugh for some reason... I don't know why though, I agree with it.	neutral
It is not very often that I rate a Legoset 'poor' (it's the first time actually), but in this case I had no other option. The idea of this set is good, and I like the mostly yellow minifig, but the design of both the airplane (weird 'window'-piece, a propellor that is way too small, minimal skies underneath and a strange colourscheme) and the hangglider (two handlebars on the wings, too many colours) makes the set mark the essence of LEGO's downfall during those years. I really appreciate the fact that you made a review of this set, Brickster, it made me look into the details of 6735, but I am just as sure today as I was back then: I will never buy this. Anyway, thanks for the review, the quality of the set may be a disapointment your review certainly is not	negative
Thanks for the nice review WhiteFang! I quite like this set. The front looks a bit bare, but for a small set like this, it doesn't really matter. This set gets a 4 from me as well.	positive
Thanks Erdbeereis1 for your kind words. Glad you liked this set. Just wondering whom has rated poor and below average. I will like to know why you voted this way. Perhaps, you could share with me and the rest on your thoughts and views.	neutral
Yeah, the name on this set is strange. I think all the boxes say Garbage Truck. I guess it's up to each builder to decide whether 1x1 round plates are recyclable material or not. It's a great model in any case. I love these highly detailed city trucks we've been getting during the last year or two. I used to have a preference for the late 80s/early 90s city line but some of these new sets have really surpassed them in detail and functionality.	positive
A good set, with a nice color scheme. I still prefer the last one that had a removable bin.	positive
This looks like a great set, and I'm happy you were dumping spongebob, he deserves that. This set looks very nice, and if I see it I will probably pick it up.	positive

I think the only improvement to this set would have been the use of chrome exhaust pipes and front grill. I bought this set with a lot of excitement, but unfortunately have not put it together yet. What are your thoughts on these larger 6-stud wide detailed vehicles as opposed to 4-stud wide classics? Here's an image of 6668 Recycle Truck released in 1992: PS. I like the use of "taking out" Sponge Bob in your review. It's hard to say... I think if the older 4 wide cars and trucks were as well-designed as the new 6 wide ones, I might prefer those.	negative
Thanks for this review. I really love this set. It's perfect for my town, and brings a sense of "classic" when I see it.	positive
I like this set, but I can't give it a good grade for playability, as the rearmost hinging section is too stiffly hinged, so when you open it, it's likely to break if you hold it just over the shovel and broom. My truck thus has that function, and with it of course the whole container tipping, disabled. I also moved the cab a bit forward and the front axle rearward to give the cab the typical garbage truck look, as they are often very low slung. This also created space behind the cab for some equipment.	negative
It would be cool if someone made a MOC in which hippies steal the truck and cover it with flowers and bright colors and stuff!	neutral
