these are my only space base plates from classic space actually with only 2 plates i could not do much serious expansion with it instead i merged it with my old city baseplates and used it as a docking station for scientific purposes or restricted facilities that is guarded by the police these baseplates are very useful and is suited for creating a space command center up in the space  
these are pretty good but i think they look too much like the standard town roads from that period i like the black space plates from the early 90s better 6710
first what i liked sooooo much was the cover of these plates with this large picture of a classic space scene i still have a 306 misb just to keep that nice feeling of taking it out of a plastic box and look at it there were different versions of the cover though second the markings of the landing platform changed at some point id have to check it later when im at home think it had something to do with the interupted yellow lines
i also love these plates i build a lot with them eg this  unfortunately they are not available in bley 
year released 1976 piece count 53 minifigs 2 lego brought out floating boats quite early and in many ways the first were the best ill explain why later this set in particular is interesting as it came out in two versions one that includes the first minifigs and another that included the nonarmless type set 709 the police signs are stickers and are in surprisingly good condition considering the age of the set i am missing one sticker on the front though note the technic bush and axel they are the old type the position of the second figure is not a mistake i think hes supposed to be sitting down the first boats out by lego needed a weighted keel to prevent them keeling over i have tested this i suspect this is because of the density of the old hulls and the flat bottom but i could be wrong it cant be just because of the flat bottom as the new cargo ship doesnt need one the keel in detail the bottom extension is for a motor not included nor made by lego at the time the keel had longer studs even now it holds extra firmly this is why i prefer the old design you can extend or shorten the hulls as you please or even insert other lego in the middle you can easily add wheels or any other piece to the bottom of these hulls i wish they would go back to this idea the 4 hulls were of this concept but were too wide probably so the keel wasnt needed the old minifigs aside from having odd feet and no arms had a normal stud as the neck thus when you turn the head it tends to come off i love this set
this set showed what potential variations on the standard brick had back then i think that tlg was still finding its legs back then and learning new things so this is a solid set for the year it was released nice review sinner
thank you for the nice review sinner holodoc on aug 1 2008 0859 am said nice review sinner the old sets i donÂ´t know  every old set especially equipped with the old nonmoveable arms minifigs look very odd nowadays i agree with you with the hull shape and its possibility to be extended but every other aspect the lack of detail the keel itself you canÂ´t float it in shallow water keeps me from rating it higher than 310 in my opninion the best police boat so far is 4021 click to enlarge well if youre meaning really old sets than i agree with you but a lot of the sets from the very late 1970s and onwards are still very nice this set just isnt a good example thats all oh and i also agree with you about that police boat however the newer one in the city line is also great imo the only thing that weighs against it is the giant size which makes it feel awkward in more classic towns edited by grevious 03 august 2008  0630 pm
well what to say i got this boat late 70s when we were on our way to italy to spend the holidays there my parents always needed to keep my quiet during the 3day trip and the best way to do that was to buy me a lego set i got this one in a gas station in germany as far as i remember italy didnt have lego sets so a gas station close to the italian border but still in germany or austria was very often their last chance i often saw large quantities of lego sets in those gas stations though i remember seeing yellow castle and the galaxy explorer standing on a shelf it would be my birthday 13 weeks later so i always made sure they knew what to buy for me
so youve been bitten by the classic bug too sinner great review but one would think arms would come in handy pun intended when you are a police officer right its a shame that many of the original figs must now be forced to stand looking like they have their hands in their pockets eh i have no idea where i was going with that last sentence
way before my time tooin fact this set came out twenty years before i was born the baseplate doesnt actually have dotsim not sure if they were there once and then rubbed off a possibility as the studs are rather smoother than i imagine they once were or if this particular one didnt have the dots this set also shows that the difficulty lego has in doing vehicle scale isnt new the house is the perfect size for microfigures from the lego games however the car is massiveover twice as tall as a microfig
image link from brickset i thought i would do a pic review of the 1st lego castle the yellow castle 375 released in 1978 first let me say that this set was truly ahead of its time it introduced new building concepts such as the hinge and new figs most were still the armless faceless minifigs during this time this set introduced me to castle which was my first real favorite theme i enjoyed breaking it out from the garage and building it again the majority of the pieces are 1x1 1x2 1x3 1x4 1x6 and 1x8 standard yellow bricks the set also includes yellow 1x4 1x6x2 and 1x8x2 arches yellow 2x2 2x3 and 2x4 bricks various grey plates 1x2 black inverted slopes red drawbridge pieces two classic red castle doors 8 hinges 2 for each corner and a few other nifty pieces including six red 1x1 windows a complete inventory is available at peeron 375 inventory a view from the front the drawbridge is 6x8 the front tower stands 12 13 bricks high plenty of room for horses the drawbridge does work the string originally black is attached to the opposite side between a plate and the arches the right side of the castle identical to the left ive always loved the 2x2x3 sloped bricks and corner pieces the back i love these red doors a 1x4 brick attached to the other side of the baseplate keeps intruders out that banner was the original sticker piece notice the wear the rear tower largest of the towers and backside two hinges at each of the corners allow the corners to open for playability before opening open lots of arches add to the detail of the inner walls inner front this set included 14 figs how about that for quantity unfortunately i peeled off worn stickers from the shields and the breast plates years ago the blue castle guards and knights are the keepers of the castle i still think that these helmets are the best lego ever made they just look good the black and white knights and the red knights ive always prefered to use the black and red guards and flags from the knights joust sets conclusion the yellow castle is truly a classic set and im so glad i kept the pieces to this together after all these years if you have a chance to buy one or even obtain the set instructions its worth building and wouldnt be difficult to substitute grey or other colors i hope you enjoyed this review and feel free to share your comments
nice review i havent built yellow castle for many years but i do remember the fun i had building it when i was young yellow castle just opened up an entire new world for me also i liked all the alternate models on the box od wish i still had that
question for you guys whats the best way to clean lego i was noticing that the baseplates and gray plates to this set are very dusty and could use a good cleaning mild soap water soak is there a better way
the original knights displaying their bright colored shields and breast plates and a good wash helped to brighten them up
quote so youre using two layers stickers doesnt that make it very thick not really i think it works out very fine 1 print out the image 2 put on the plastic 3 cut out the image 4 apply on the part
great review the set is really nice i love that the front of the motercycle can turn and the engine is just beautiful with its half stacked bricks like kieldaman said the price used or new is quite a bit but there is a good variety of bricks here like the bricks inside the wheels did you get this set from your father great review luxorv
wow talk about illegal connections eh great review i really like this set even for its age
luxorv this is a well written presentation on this lego vintage review i never knew the existence of this set and even though the design is not part of the modern lego design concept but the overall appeal back in the 1970s certainly appeal to many i could not mind to own such vintage lego model and put them on display and potray as if it was a chart of evolution of lego motorbikes thanks for sharing and i cant wait to find out your next review
great review for a classic model i love it
nice review great nostalgic set like you said it has nice designsimple yet effective i like construction vehicles so this set has even bigger impact on me
i voted outstanding regarding this set i found mine at a consignment store it was inside of a larger set from the same time period
and again those tears in my eyes with original box i really love those classic space stuff looks like i need to clean my stuff this summer
very brave to give an impression about one of the oldest sets ever reviewed a lot members here are younger than the set itself i think you will have to have grown up with it to like it nowadays we have seen quite a few better airplanes than that one for example this years 7643  but thanks for letting us know btw the 1x1 round brick with the solid stud is no 3062a instead of 3062b with the hollow stud
fantastic review iÂ´d love to read more like this trivia about oldrare pieces is almost as fun as the set itself
outstanding review of a very special set i actually remember seeing this set on the store shelves of local department stores can you believe it fantastic review walter i really enjoy looking at these vintage sets this one deserves a blog
daoudbazaar on jul 15 2009 0526 pm said  there is no 45Â° slope in the original plane design  and no front cockpit window  except that it wouldnt have been the spirit of st louis oooops youre completely right the spirit of stlouis didnt have any front window nor rear wheel anyway i think a standard ryan m1m2 plane would have been a better choice less a legend but more a flexible plan for multiple uses
i really like the design it has an aesthetic value lacking from most official lego planes and follows closely to the real thing minus the colours something that cant really be claimed for more recent sets
483 alpha1 rocket base year released 1979 piece count 170 minifigs 3 vehicles 1 two sections list price unknown despite the nuclear nonproliferation treaty of 1968 lego dared design a rocket base complete with a rocket system that may have had nuclear capability in 1979 luckily the rocket was defective having rather flimsy white bricks that did not stay together well during launch attempts lego scrapped its wmd program and the result was this classic blue era space set known as the alpha1 rocket base instructions on the backside of the instructions the set is featured with the space command center space cruiser and a few vehicle sets the set includes three figs and this great rocket fuel tanker heres the front section complete with computer and the rocket fuel section the set has some interesting features including the control section fuel control and launch pad on top of the control section is a nicely design radartracking system heres the open control room the launch pad and fuel control the fuel control includes two sink pieces and blue steering wheels and legos wmd weapon of mass destruction the alpha1 on the launch pad heres a shot of the launching mechanism unfortunately i have lost one of the blue sinkfaucet pieces as well as a black hose a closeup of the alpha1 rocket the white bricks never stayed together well often times coming apart within your hands the arming and guidance system was nicely designed a view of the complete set and another this is a great set the base fuel vehicle and launch platform offers a great amount of playability my only complaint is the rocket as mentioned above i dont think i ever played with it a sa kid because it always fell apart share your comments regarding this classic space set
thebrickster on jul 4 2008 0414 am said a closeup of the alpha1 rocket the white bricks never stayed together well often times coming apart within your hands huh did they not think of putting a technic axle down the center of the rocket come to think of it when were technic axles invented its a neat little set makes me think i oughta make some similar kinda layout in ldd very elegant for playability
nice rewiew the set is good too
thank you legocastlegirls for your quick review y its the first time i realize the back of the market street the tan bricks are a replacement for some windows id guess i do love that building especially the top floor with the neat balcony wub of course you are again left alone filling the interior but i just had some food parts ordered at bricklink xd one thing id like to know this is an onlineexclusive right can i order it at a legostore kln  oberhausen and get the sum rewarded on my voucher booklet sweet i heard it here but im not sure 8 if anyone is looking for how to fill it with interior go read the latest brickjournal 8 theres a whole chapter written about designing the rooms interior on
thanks for the pics legocastlegirl one thing that i find strange is that tlc doesnt use a female mf head for those two females mf in this set but a female mf head is available in ldd and pab wacko
i still havent bought the cc or ms but reviews like this make me wanna buy them instantly thanks for this legocastlegirl 
i also missed your review but now that i found it i really happy i just ordered the set  thanks for the pics peter
legocastlegirl on jun 20 2007 0520 pm said i also think that this is a replacement for some windows and i like this idea because i often see houses with that kind of windows there was once windowtaxes in the netherlands when rich people became poor they placed bricks in their window so they paid less taxes some older houses still has walls were once were windows historic information on d p

here is a review of the new monster dino creator set with power functions first lets start with the box which is much larger than it needs to be it is one of the new style recloseable boxes rather than the rip the sides style this set is typical of creator and comes with three sets of instructions the monster dino a kind of spider and a crocodile the set comes with two of the new motors one small and one large a sound module plus the new ir controler and receiver there is a mix of techniques in this set the core is mainly studless technic there are some studded technic parts and most of the details are standard creator style there are two mechanisms one to control the legs and one to control the head and arms the leg drive is from the large motor and the arm and head are operated from the small motor the completed mechanism will stand on its own without any detail added the detail is added to the base unit to complete the model the operation of the dino is very good the design for the motors and drives is very compact and well thought out the walking motion works well although there is no steering and it will fall over it it encounters obstacles the sound module is built into the head so when the mouth opens the dino roars sort of glyman made the comment that this set is ugly as sin and i tend to agree i think there are too many colour variations with different shades of grey black and that lime green p which confuses the look of the finished model but i guess it might apeal more to younger kids i also do not like the spikes along the back which glow in the dark because the are loose and keep falling off this set is not cheap at 70 but i guess this is because of the motors and ir controller while on this i was surprised how good the range was on the new controller it would still operate ever when not in direct line of sight i would give this set a 1010 for playabilityit has kept the kid amused for hours i would give it 610 for value for money it is a bit pricey overall 810 it took approx 3 hours to build and has been well played with i have posted some more images and some videos of the finished models on my brickshelf page here if you have any questions please ask pete edited by whitefang 23 may 2009  0628 pm indexed
thanks for your review ickelpete y nice little movie you made whats on tv in the background  d after reading i wonder more than before what this dino has to do with creator wacko the complete mechanism is technic only the designpieces on top are classicstyle i agree with your comment on the colourselection x is that turquise next to lime looks like  well im not telling you what i think of right now  pretty lego set but not for me im waiting for the first pics of the ferris wheel or even better the 8275 technicbulldozer  wub new motors on
thanks very much for that review i downloaded the instructions last week and i was largely impressed with what was in it however like holodoc i am waiting for the bulldozer i might have to settle with the dino though if lego charge australian some absurd price edit i just watched the videos thanks they are great the dino is better than i thought edited by sinner 10 july 2007  0229 am
thank you very much for that interesting review ickelpete y well the color schemes pretty bad and the design of that dinos a bit to blocky for my liking but the two alternative models youve builtre quiet nice at least therere a lot of possibilities coming with that set 
ugly as hell but an awesome parts pack worthy of purchase
 such a beauty the functions are great cool video i want to get this set so badly great review y
the box is has really strange dimensions  its very flat but has a large front  the 11 scale regarding the spines because theyre made of the softer nonabs plastic the stuff the 1994 cutlasses and brown muskets were made of they lose their shape a bit and so are hard to grip they simply fall off i suppose tlc use loads of different colours because a single or twocolour dino isnt very nice to look at especially when the surface isnt very smooth  it takes your eyes away from the surface and puts it on the colours someone should make an all terrain dino that can walk everywhere from this set  i dont have the skill with technic  i always end up layering and never finish any models 
got this baby via shophome a little early and i though it was time to post my view of this set  snefroe you need to get this one   sorry for the lack of pics but there are already many pics online of this baby so here it is  best space set since a way too long time this is my first new space themed set since more than 20 years and i must say that i’m not disappointed at all i have much to say about this little gem first let’s cut it straight about the martians minifigures they are absolutely rubbish i can’t imagine how lego could produce such atrocity this said let’s move on to the dropship a real piece of art reminiscent of the aliens movie dropship the cockpit is spacious and provides a great field of view too bad there is no hinges to open it you must remove the canopy completely to switch pilot the drilling unit can be attached under the ship with the clever use of a rubber piece it stays well in place once attached good point some people don’t like the inclusion of the 2 containment area for the martians and crystal on both side of the ship but i kind like it it makes the ship less empty the 2 wings are complete with air intake some armaments and 1 standard launcher on the right wing normally i don’t like launchers but this one is very discrete and well integrated on the tail section are 2 thrusters that can be rotated and provide thus some “realistic” movements to the ship one of the last highlight of this ship is the landing gears or i must say landing dishes 6 medium sized radar dishes provide and incredible stability to the set they are quite sturdy and can take a beating i’m not going to review the alien spaceship in detail since it’s quite uninteresting i consider it more like a bonus addition to the set than anything else the look is passable and there are some interesting building techniques in it that’s all to end the review a little proscons table we all love proscons table   pros  incredible design  at last a decent space set  modular functions  quite sturdy  beautiful  great value for money cons  martians are rubbish  no hinges for the canopy  the drilling unit could use some more details score 910 by the way  i added a nice cool feature on my site  you can download the stickers for some sets that i own before building i always scan the stickers we never know it could come handy check this out on my site you need to go in the lego lists on the left vtx classic games
mutex on jul 13 2007 1016 am said by the way  i added a nice cool feature on my site  you can download the stickers for some sets that i own before building i always scan the stickers we never know it could come handy check this out on my site you need to go in the lego lists on the left vtx classic games thats a good idea and very nice thanks mutex y nice review hmm now im pretty sure that ill have to mod that cockpit a little when i get that set
great review i must admit i didnt like mm at first site but seeing this review and looking at the mm boxes at stores appeal to me rather greatly i may get a couple of these sets great job y 
the dropships looks neat and your review is good it isnt my theme but it clearly is a fantastic set for the space lovers under us mars mission is really a good step in the right direction for tlc
of course right before i post this i see that ickelpete reviewed this set earlier in the week sorry for being redundant but it is already written so here ya go monster dino reviewed by dunamis set 4958 792 pieces 8995 from lego online store build time 35 hours here we go with another offering from the creator line im kind of fond of these sets as they are pretty imaginative and usually have instructions for multiple models i like the reusability of all the pieces and the varied things you can build the box the box that lego shipped this thing in was absolutely huge when i first got this in the mail i thought i had won the lottery and they had shipped the ucs falcon early once i opened the shipping box i was surprised to see an unusually large creator set box the box itself is pretty standard creator type box but this one shows off the power functions prominently on the right side of the box the back of the box shows some of the motorized features as well opening the box is a matter of breaking two seals were back to the reusable cereal box type tab system for those of you who stay up a night wondering about legos next box design inside the box we have a bunch of sealed bags immediately the power brick remote and motors stand out as they are each in individual bags also there are three manuals the manuals the three manuals are 76 76 and 56 pages in length they are laid out well and are pretty standard with all the usual trimmings  piece call outs for each step  parts inventory at the end of the primary model build  page numbers color separation in these manuals were fine for me interestingly the instructions for the primary build took a full manual plus about a quarter of another manual random manual photos parts list ill explain a bit more below but it would have been nice to have some written documentation on all the functions of the motors remote and receiver such as motor load guidelines and specific explanations of all the remote control functions it is severely lacking in this area the pieces obviously the pieces were most interested in are these new motors and wireless remote control note that before you fire this bad boy up you had better byob since this is prominently a european community i had better clarify my acronyms over here across the pond byob usually means bring your own beer in this case it still means bring your own beer im on my second heineken right now but in addition to numerous bottles of beer you will need a total of nine batteries to get through this set i kid you not anyway there are two motors a small and a large each with its own very unique name according to the manual the smaller one is called motor and the larger one is called xl motor very creative indeed the battery box takes six aa batteries and there are two compartments to hold them here is the first that seems pretty normal however the back side of it holds the other three batteries and it seems to be very poorly designed note in the photo above where the bottom battery is placed compare it to the previous photo and you will see the difference i played around with trying to get that bottom battery out and you better pack a lunch or byob because it is no small task why couldnt they make this compartment just like the other side there is a single power cord connector and a three position switch the middle position turns the power off and the other two positions seem to provide the same functionality in either position as far as i can tell perhaps a little blurb in the manual would have been nice to clear things up a bit the remote takes three aaa batteries it is fairly small and lightweight even with the batteries installed it has two thumb controls which could be levers if you insert technic bars or even pins the two controls are color coded and match the plugs on the receiver to control two separate motors in addition there is a four position switch which i assume changes the channel finally there are two tiny levers that seem to have no function im not sure if they are a trim control or variable speed control i messed with them and didnt notice any difference in the motor speed again some documentation from the incredibly verbose lego manual would have helped as far as the rest of the parts its really a mixed bag there are a lot of varied parts in this set to the point that there is almost one of everything lots of technic gears pins studded beams studless beams axles wheels etc also lots of little 1x1 slopes in various colors teeth horns etc you cant really say it is a parts pack because there is not enough of one thing to make it a parts pack a couple of notes it seems the quality control issue on the axles has been fixed i initially reported this back when i reviewed the 8285 about a year ago all the axles worked fine for me the color quality control issue is still alive check out the different shade of red in these two parts also included is the sound brick this looks just like the other sound or lightup bricks we have been seeing lately it does have a load dinosaur roar sound embedded in it though so hide the younglings if they are a bit on the skittish side finally ive never seen one of these before although someone will no doubt rattle off a dozen sets where you can find this part in about 5 seconds no i am not referring to the studded beam i put that in the photo for scale the build the build was fun and was fairly straightforward as i mentioned there is a lot of technic parts so if you are not a fan of the technic line you should run not walk away from this one there were no gotchas to speak of but you need to pay careful attention to the placement of the wires that go from the motors to the receiver they kind of sneak them around a bit so watch closely otherwise it was fine here is what is left over so far i have only built the primary model as seen on the box there are instructions for two more models both of the other models seem less complex than the primary model and are likely quicker builds the dino took me about 35 hours which included some time to screw around with the motors im an old school technic fan from way back in the 80s so i had some familiarity with the old technic motors obviously 25 years has improved some things and these seem much more powerful the design if you have built the 4507 prehistoric creatures then some of the design will feel familiar especially the head and tail it is almost like they took the dinosaur from that set and figured out how to motorize it this is not necessarily a bad thing just a comment the set does a good job of showing off the features of the new motors and remote it is nice to see how one motor can perform multiple functions in this case the small motor makes both arms move and opens and closes the mouth of the dinosaur when the mouth is completely open it pushes the activation switch on the sound brick which emits the roar sound pretty cool the xl motor handles the walking feature of the dinosaur there is both forward and reverse forward works really well while the reverse just makes the dinosaur look like he is doing a michael jackson moon walk wow i never thought i would use michael jacksons name in a lego dinosaur set review it is almost like the dinosaur cant get traction going in reverse however as noted previously forward works really well this guy actually gets going at a pretty good clip as you might expect he kind of waddles like a duck since there is no articulation in the knees it is a bit awkward but it works the xl motor seems to kick out plenty of power overall the design seems to be a mixed bag the way the tail is attached seems to be an afterthought the arms look to be too small however the walking mechanism and legsfeet are pretty cool as well as the head and mouth i guess it is a reasonable effort to get people introduced to the parts and well see designs improve as time goes on here are a few views of our new friend but what about the atat of course the real reason you are reading this is that you hope i will have some epiphany on how all this relates to the new walking atat judging from the box on the atat it looks like we get one motor i dont see the remote which is a disappointment as i hope it is not controlled by a switch on the body and you either turn the atat on or off if that is the case the first thing i am doing is scavenging the receiver and remote from this set to add to the atat granted it could be that it comes with a remote but is just not seen on the box also the atat box looks like one of the images shows that the head turns i sure hope this is controlled separately as it would be really lame to not be able to control this independently from the walking feature im kind of skeptical on the walking feature of the atat i suspect it will be rather cumbersome but hopefully i will be pleasantly surprised needless to say this is all speculation but those are my initial thoughts based on this set overall thoughts its an ok set kind of pricy but i suspect a large part of that is due to the motors and remote i havent built the other two models they seem less interesting to me but at least it has some variability also you get a ton of different parts which can either be a good thing or bad thing depending on what you are looking for the dinosaur is average the color selection is marginal black and lime green and the tail section is just lame i appreciate it more for the mechanical functions and how the motorized parts work it does do a good job of waking up my dog who seems pretty irritated by it it is a nice set to show off to the neighbors or the endless caravan of my wifes friends that seem to materialize out of nowhere people are quickly impressed by it and then promptly move along once you start trying to explain how it all works im a bit disappointed that the manual did not explain more about the remote and motor functions i suspect that there is more than meets the eye and ill just have to play around with it to find out it would be nice if lego had a website that showed all the cool functions of the motors and remotes so we fully understand the capabilities final rating 72 build 910 pretty quick and fun the mechanical part is cool functionality 610 it is a creator set so you have multiple builds as far as it being a dinosaur its just ok motorized parts are cool though design 610 partly cloudy some things are cool others are lame parts 810 new motors and remote are cool lots of varied parts included but nothing to write home about price 710 it is kind of expensive edited by whitefang 23 may 2009  0623 pm indexed
great review dunamis i hope you have as much fun with this as i have one point yes they are new axles they have appeared in a few sets this year
oh is he ugly or what ive never seen a dino that needed to go on a diet more then him d but id get him for the pieces all those limegreen pieces drools but meh im not really in to mindstorms so i dont think id get this but anyway nice review i now know exactly what hes like kml
wowthat set is really something but i prefer pehistoric power and triceratops or are they the same i can never tell
awesome reveiw thanks i gotta get this one y wub
ickelpete on nov 4 2007 0641 pm said if you really want the power functions the bulldozer is better value as you get two large motors two small motors and two receivers compared to the one in the dino set alos watch toysrus and argos both have had the bulldozer for 7075 in there pre christmas sales usually for a week only i am hopeing they will be on sale soon as i want a second bulldozer to get some more motors thanks for the tip but even 7075 is too much right now 55 was just about affordable but now my wifes buying for me its going to cost me zero zilch zip nada nothing which is even sweeter xd
i ended up buying a misb set recently from a lego collector who is clearing up his collection excellent set to get the ir remote and ir receiver and other motors without paying insane amounts for the bulldozer now there is a quite a number of parts in power miner lime green and 1x1 white teeth plate for the mouth and claws the dino alone has 20 teeth in its mouth the glow in the dark antennas on the backbone of the dino is a nice touch as you can let him walk in the dark somewhat i do agree with the reviewer the box is insanely huge i dont think lego wanted to show a 11 scale dino they just wanted to promote the power function stuff as large as possible also the remote is smaller than shown in the picture as the hand holding it i think is smaller
thanks for the early review i dont know much about the rebals show at all but i can say that the over all design of the walker really appeals to me and the minifigs look top notch i also like how the spring shooters are pretty much hidden in the frame nice job
looks really nice one complaint is the back it is a pitty that lego didnt use any plates greebling there
whats behind the printed 4x4 dome is that 2x4 yellow plate im planning to replace that
flieger on 24 december 2014  0304 am said thanks for the review i have two questions  what is the driver standing on when the hatch is open and he is looking out  could you show the face of kallus without helmet please my only complaint is that the colours of both kalluss and the driverss uniforms are wrong kalluss uniform is way too dark and should be more dark olive than black and the driverss uniforms are too bright and should be more greyish compared to what we saw in the series here are the pics of kallus his head would be good for a steampunk character agent kallus front by whitesidewjw on flickr agent kallus back by whitesidewjw on flickr the driver isnt really standing on anything he is just kind of wedged in there irispen on 24 december 2014  0420 am said whats behind the printed 4x4 dome is that 2x4 yellow plate im planning to replace that yes there are several yellow accents on this however in person it looks really good edited by whitswj 24 december 2014  0255 pm
smitty500 on 25 december 2014  0721 am said awesome i am really looking forward to buy this but is it really 5000 us i was hoping more around 3000 i mean it fits the 10 cents per piece count and has 4 figures so for a licensed theme you cant beat that but i guess lego can never satisfy everyone
whitswj on 24 december 2014  0253 pm said here are the pics of kallus his head would be good for a steampunk character thanks indeed his face printing is really nice they captured his looks and spirit well
great set really impressed odd that lego didnt include stickers for the controls  cant think of a reason they wouldnt have and why do only 3 of the 4 figures have leg printing i just cant understand lego at times
namioik on 25 december 2014  0853 am said i mean it fits the 10 cents per piece count and has 4 figures so for a licensed theme you cant beat that but i guess lego can never satisfy everyone this is true i just had that price in mind when i saw the first images of it it did not appear to be this big or complex but new sets are getting so much more advanced than what they used to be
thanks for the early review how tall is this next to the most recent recreation of the atat im picturing the two of them standing next to each other looking silly due to the scale differences
the legs are about 2 shorter than the atat its cockpit is a little larger than the atats head it doesnt look out of place as an escorttype walker or heavy walker especially as both are built in the same style although if scale differences really bother you the most recent atst is probably a better bet for you edited by hjmediastudios 29 december 2014  0432 pm
its a different helmet ezras is an imperial cadet helmet the same one he wears in breaking ranks
thanks for the review and pics this is a really nice looking walker one question  how snug are the atdp drivers sitting in their seats the cockpit looks good actually im not crazy about the atdp helmets on the show but i dig the minifigs good stuff awesome facial hair for kallus
hi i need some helpwhen i atach the pod to the place where the legs are placed the small piece that unites the pod to the legs is loos from the bottom so the top of the walker just moves around freely wich is different from every video review that i have seen where they can rotate the pod but its not loose the small piece that serves as the axis isnt staying locked on the bottom piece and i have reassembled it all and still its the same  help edit sorry i found out what went wrongdidnt push hard enough d edited by mrpinache 05 july 2015  1210 am
super outstanding review i am outside at this moment and this review is certainly great to read while you are on the move i am looking forward to get this upcoming new modular it is definitely fun to play and real awesome indeed thanks oky for this very fine review
brilliant review and thanks for plenty of detailed shots of the interior i may invest in this set but ill have to wait until 2015 star wars is sorted and budget for the arrival of pirates in april
fantastic review could easily be the years best and its only january 1st youve got a duplicated picture in the bit where the candy is being moved from the outside and through the barber shop and i was expecting a final bw picture or two where the detective makes his report to the woman in red and gets his reward candy of course or she in turn reports back to her real boyfriend the candy smuggler edited by rollermonkey 01 january 2015  0408 pm
great review oky i really love your introduction text you put a lot of effort in this review with lots of nice touches well done for me the set gets 4 out of 5 its a great set but theres something preventing me of giving it 5 stars
great review oky i managed to pick this set up a few days ago and i must say it might be my favorite modular yet for the feel alone the pool hall barbershop and the detectives office itself are all wonderfully designed
nice review thanks a lot managed to improve my opinion of the set a bit but im still getting two to build larger buirldings as soon as we get the next 2x vip points special
this modular building will be my next set thanks for the review
thank you for the great review of this set im also curious for the backside of the mirror
snaplock on 01 january 2015  0740 pm said totally agree with you the height does seem rather small also 2x buildings on a 32x32 baseplate with a lots of spare studs behind the buildings are these buildings 12 studs in width it still looks great style wise however this might be a set i buy and look at it after i have built it  regret the amount of  i have spent on it 239 for us aussies  both are are 14 deep on the upper floors do is 3 studs deeper on the ground floor buit thats pretty much it cant believe how cramped the upper floors of the barber shop look weve come a long way from the wide and empty halls of cc and gg
amazing review very thorough with lots of details
thanks for the review im a fan of the set but will be modding quite a bit have to get a small bar into the highlander and then turn the secondthird story above the barber shop into a proper apartment the detectives office is great and will stay as is
awesome review and an awesome set what are the different shades of blue i know theres dark and medium blue but whats the other blue locutis
thanks very much i love it wub  it needs tweaking but isnt that half the fun incidentally when people were calling it rhino i thought it was just a reference to captain scarlet seeing the stickers in the middle made me realise my mistake buy buy buy
thanks dude this is a great set can you please take more pictures thanks
wow this year my wallet size has been bugging me sigh still its a goodlooking set and i will get it too many big sets
thanks for that very interesting review snefroe1 y that vehicle looks really nice with a lot of playability but too much technic brick construction for my liking it seems like theres pretty much space wasted inside of it some kind of small laboratory or a room for the crew and at least a mining toolshed wouldve been cool
awesome review if i pick up any mm sets it will definately be this one
sinner on jul 15 2007 0102 pm said incidentally when people were calling it rhino i thought it was just a reference to captain scarlet yeah me too thats a great programme is it not and i mean both new and old anyway i like this ill probably get it when it finally becomes available in the uk i think theres a few things ill mod but overall its very nice although its interesting and slightly creepy how much the lights at the front look like eyes and as ive said many a time before i love the motorbike edited by brainbox 16 july 2007  0111 pm
8 such a wonderful machine great review too bad all my money is going towards the castle theme  my wallet is planning to kill me
i agree iamded life on mars while not even that truly great was far better than this line  i am hoping the next space line lego does takes place in just that space  by the way iamded i continue to stalk you batbrick away 
lego 41062 elsas sparkling ice castle lego managed to get a frozen licensed set in the new wave of disney princess sets however im very surprised by the size its a 40 set and comes in a small friendsstyle box roughly 12x12 size  i almost didnt see it on the shelf when i was looking for it because its so small i mean i know its only 40 but its a friggin castle and why did lego only make this a smaller set if theyd made a 200 frozen castle they still would have sold every one they could produce they made big harry potter hogwarts sets and those sure sold and have you seen the toys in the frozen section of stores huge playsets for barbiesized dolls but i suppose im getting the cart before the horse here reviewing before ive even opened the box so name elsas sparkling ice castle set number 41062 pieces 292 price 3999 minifigs 3 theme disney princess year of release 2015 links bricklink peeron brickset the box the front of the box is standard lego fare other than the large anna and elsa in the bottom right corner oh and surprisingly nowhere on the box is the normal minifig lineup the only way to know what characters are included is to look at the set pictures the 11 this set uses one of the minidolls as the actual size sample thats probably not a bad choice since the minidolls are not nearly as well known as a minifig the back on the back the play features are shown in insets around a rear view of the castle like friends sets you also have an array of play accessories the seals is this standard on 2015 sets or is this specific to this set ive never seen 3 tape seals on a set even huge modulars or technic sets only have 2 so 3 on a set this small seems excessive perhaps lego expects people to try to steal the dolls if so why bother with extra tape a tiny pocketknife makes quick work of the tape so the third strip doesnt even slow you down the contents in the box are 2 instruction booklets bent a white plate a sticker sheet and 3 numbered bags of parts the stickers these are very hard to photograph since theyre shiny i mean polished chrome shiny those dark lines across the corners are not really there theyre reflections of my ceiling the manual backs the back of one booklet has a friends win girl the other has an ad for the lego disney princess website that site is so girly theres even sparkles following your mouse cursor around so i didnt stay too long or look too deeply the sample page the interior pages of the manuals are on lavender backgrounds its standard lego instructions with part callouts and insets when needed the build 1 the first thing you build is anna but im not showing that yet then you build this little picnic scene its tiny but effective and nice to have something not icy in the set since the movie has the in summer song for olaf im curious whats in that sandwich though  green and pink after the picnic is the olaf build but ill save him for later too the build 2 next is this small sleigh it has an amazing amount of style for something so small the curved front and decorative whips on the back make it look sleighlike instead of blocky but come on it already had pink accents are the pink flowers really necessary technically yes so the whips can mount to them but still its just overgirly for my taste the build 3 the sleigh needs a ramp to help it rocket along for a couple inches at least the ramp starts like this with a hidden lime green jumper plate that gets a cookie on it i couldnt remember anything in the movie like that so i asked my wife and she couldnt either a hidden cookie under a hill the build 4 after putting the tilting 2x8 onto the base and adding decorations this is the result a lime green bucket holding a pair of ice skates a flower in the snow really green and white round studs that i assume are supposed to be grass and snow the build 5 the sleigh looks huge sitting on top of the tiny hill but it actually works pretty well assuming youre on a smooth surface like a table you can give the sleigh a little nudge and itll shoot down the ramp and a few inches across the table the unevenness of the slopes vs the blue tiles holds the sleigh in line well and the bumps in the slopes dont seem to hamper anything the build 6 moving on to bag 2 man thats a lot of colors in this base already and im already starting to feel like theres transblue cheese thrown around randomly the build 7 continuing and rotating some steps and even more colors thrown in magenta in elsas ice palace i sure dont remember any of that the build 8 wait seriously an ice cream stand in the castle that is what the magenta is for i kinda actually like the looks of it but it doesnt fit the set the build 9 spinning back around now theres a light aqua spiral staircase added along with a roof this is where im really starting to wonder about legos thinking those light aqua stairs and the light aqua 1x4 tiles are exclusive to this set as far as i know its possible some other 2015 sets use them but nothing in bricklink yet seems expensive to produce to me when theres no huge reason to need them another blue for the tiles would have been fine and the spiral stairs really elsas castle is known for staircases but not spiral ones there should be a huge straight ice stairway out front or sweeping curved stairs inside but not a spiral the build 10 and now we finish the tree again why where is there a tree next to elsas castle and so weird with ice hanging from green branches that have both snow and flowers on them huh did lego watch a different movie the translight blue bits before looking at the upper level a brief pause to look at some other parts heres the 1x2x5 brick in translight blue and the 2x4x6 rock panel in glitter translight blue do those look like the same blue to you and again another unique part for this set why do those rock panels need to be glitter when lego made the same panel in trans light blue in 2013 and 2014 for superheroes friends and chima sets apparently disney really wanted glitter because there are a bunch of transglitter parts in the new princess sets theres transneon green cones for jasmine ariel jasmine and sleeping beauty all get glitter trans purple cones so theres a bunch of new glitter parts for 2015 the build 11 back to building  time to add the upper level we get a bedroom with a decent bed although stickered the build 12 the other side of the bedroom has some little accessories perfume and a crown i assume the build 13 time for walls and a roof i like the small white macaroni bricks for a wall but whats with the lavender fence piece in the center ill grant that it looks nice a common white fence would have been a little boring but its another unique piece to this set the build 14 the very top of the castle is built separately not a whole lot to say here other than why is there a torch in an ice castle the finished castle once the roof is put on the castle is done and that big purple star on top says everything to me about the styling it just doesnt look like modern lego to me it looks like this should be an old belville fairy tale set from around 1999 if i saw a photo of just the castle with no figs or picnic blanket id assume thats what it was the oops not actually done yet accessories at the end theres a few bits left to add there are these dark purple skis yup another unique part in the lower level let me tell you theyre a pain to get into that location at least with my big man hands more accessories the top level gets a stickered book the sticker has a nice castle image on it that is while not quite exactly the castle from disney world very disneylooking i actually had to google and see if thats the castle they use in their logo nope but its the same style the leftovers there are a lot of extra parts in this thats almost 10 of the part count in the set right there they are pretty useful overall though its great to have an extra carrot and brown branch for olaf since you know those will get lost as hes played with the figs finally the reason for the set lets face it the castle set is just an excuse to make these figures and theyre great i mean just fantastic the print on them is just such a good match to the real characters compare to the cartoon version from the front of the box elsas hair is a little darker than the cartoon but overall these are just dead on if i had to pick out a flaw its the spell elsa is holding its too bad she can only shoot it forward with her arm down like that itd be nice to have the end of the splash part bent 90 degrees so she can have her arm forward and the spell shooting forward too oh one other thing the minidoll heads dont press down tight to the body like minifig heads do theres still exposed neck it looks nice but it means elsas cape can swing around the fig backs elsas cape is glittery on the back and you can see the removable bow in her hair the full set one final issue when you put anna on the sleigh her cape doesnt have enough flexibility since its a wraparound kind and so it folds out funny thats why on the back of the box it shows her standing on the back of the sleigh with elsa in the seat edit how on earth did i forget to comment on those orange flowers to each side of the castle im pretty sure elsa did not have any flowers blooming outside her castle the conclusion hm i really wanted to like this set but i just cant quite bring myself to it feels like lego pulled a random castle design from the files then redid it into white and trans blue to look icy and allow a frozen tie in set the figs are great but the castle isnt i guess the real castle in the movie would be a boring set and this one has play features but it just is too different for my taste the ratings value 710  40 for less than 300 parts is high especially when so many of the parts are tiny but on the other hand theres a lot of rock panels and 1x2x5 trans blue panels but the figs help save it design 410  not one of legos best not as bad as the lows in the 90s but not a great set minifigs 1010  possibly even a 1210 they are the reason to buy the set  playability 810  there are a bunch of play features but they actually detract from the design so i had to knock off a couple points parts 710  a bunch of impractical unique parts how often do you need dark purple skis or a lavender fence piece but also a bunch of nice parts if you wanted to make your own icy scene overall 710  a great bunch of figs but id recommend not bothering with the manuals just use the parts to build your own castle thats better
isnt getting parts in new colors a good thing it is a shame there is only this one set i think tlg could make a whole subtheme out of frozen i do agree that they overuse lavender and magenta i dont see why every girl set has to have these sort of colors instead of what would be accurate to the source material 
vorkosigan on 09 january 2015  1229 am said isnt getting parts in new colors a good thing it is a shame there is only this one set i think tlg could make a whole subtheme out of frozen i do agree that they overuse lavender and magenta i dont see why every girl set has to have these sort of colors instead of what would be accurate to the source material  sure new colors are good but cramming a bunch of oddball ones into a single set where they dont even make sense just seems financially unwise for lego id rather have seen a larger set than light aqua spiral staircase parts or lavender tiny fences lego made the stairs in dark purple last year for rapunzels tower and those probably would have been ok here or make them in a more useful color like white
when i first saw the pictures i didnt realize that this set had so much color barf going on in it also there is a bunch of stuff that does not fit in with the movie and it is pricey the minifigures are nice but no kristoff or sven i thought about getting this but this review is pushing me towards no
well the good news for you is youre in luck whenever you find sets since the figs sell for a good bit of money  right now the bricklink value of the 3 figs is about 30
mostlytechnic on 10 january 2015  0202 am said i think the transglitter blue panels can be icy or snowy just fine im sure thats why they used them for this set now if youre looking for realism like the photos in your sig seem to be it might be tougher but ive been thinking about using those big glittery panels to make a waterfalltype scene the guys over in the historic forum will kill me if my mocs start to glitter ill take a closer look when i see the set in a shop and as i understand i can sell the minifigs for the price of the set
very nice review indeed and i also cant wait for the release of this set it will be a superb wonderful addition to the lego disney princess theme
im pretty sure ive gotten other sets recently with three pieces of tape on them
i see the cookie smugglers from the detectives office have already infiltrated other lego themes
thanks for the review this will end up being a must buy for my daughter
great review i definitely agree the minidolls are too awesome and are definitely a musthave i love all the extra pieces from any set some of them go on my phone case
bennemans on 13 january 2015  0608 pm said there is a very simple reason for the flowers and greenleaved trees you should remember from the movie it was actually summer when elsa set of the eternal winter… true but all around her ice castle it is all winter so why are there nonwinter bits in this set doesnt make sense the picnic is because they wanted a minivignette for olaf to fit into but the rest of the green and flowers dont make sense tenorikuma on 13 january 2015  0958 am said im pretty sure ive gotten other sets recently with three pieces of tape on them cool good to know was wondering but havent remembered to look when im at a store recently whitefang on 13 january 2015  0912 am said very nice review indeed and i also cant wait for the release of this set it will be a superb wonderful addition to the lego disney princess theme thanks for the fp but a lovely sweet review i thought i bashed this set pretty hard
this seems to be one of those sets that lego really should have released a month before christmas it likely then would have been toy of the year 2014
im trusting there is something else going on behind the scenes because this should have been a huge set and released in november of 2014 at the latest maybe we will see more and better frozen sets when the postchristmas consumer spending wave hits edited by m0dulo 13 january 2015  1003 pm
i love how the fronthood looks like a lion
tks mate for this brilliant review d i loved your batfabuland story  always fantastic to read like always sweet i really love this set and i shall buy 2 copies one to build as is and another one for my town loool regular biplane for the tarmac and my swat copter  btw i would have a request could you post pics of the parts inventory please  many tks in advance  yoda
thanks for the review im definitely getting this mainly becasue its batman i love the blue bats the scarecrow is good as ever and those new pumpkins are just wub  theres a few things ill mod but nothing really major ill have to wait till i get this to decide properly though
what a fine review and what a funny story thanks y dark tan and new technic hub very interesting scare the crow on d
sinner on jul 19 2007 0415 am said sorry due to my convoluted sentance structure you misinterpretted me i meant that joel shumakers movies fall well within the category of being against the idea that batman is as big a loon as the guys that he hauls in just to be sure i hate x the joel schumaker batman movies thank you for clarifying we can still be friends now people are entitled to their opinions but the opinion that the joel schumacher batman films are any good is just wrong and stupid p sinner on jul 19 2007 0415 am said ill get back to you at christmas it is possible i made a mistake yes i also wrote to lego about it and i posted their reply thanks for the link i was too lazy to search
sinner on jul 19 2007 0408 pm said incidentally i love your new avatar copmike fabuland has a certain charm thanks   fab on copmike
out of nowhere this set appeared at my local tru hadnt been expecting this one for a while so a nice surprise sweet firstly the box nice pic on the front good selection of minifigs the officer and pilot look cool with their dark blue trousers a new r2 unit as well dont remeber this in the film but great to have one in a new colour wub back of the box shows some of the ships nifty features first thing you notice when you open the box is the awesome selection of bricks this makes a for a great parts pack loads of unusual red and dark red pieces its so refreshing to see a star wars set that isnt predominantly grey there are also two instruction booklets as soon as you open the first booklet you hit an error why would i want two obiwans  its also at this point that you come across a big disappointment on the box you get a flesh quigon what is actually in the box is an epiii obiwan come on lego  why change it  all the figures look impressive in the flesh despite the big mistake once i started the build it progressed rapidly red pieces seem to be a lot easier to find lots of clever techniques quite a few technic elements get used at the start it reminded me of building a technic set from the 80s at times here is the main body half way through the build the landing mechanism is a nice touch its not fully retractable but still folds away nicely you find the ship keeps tipping over as you build it despite the feet as its only at the end thay it all becomes evenly balanced at both ends here the feet are extended you can also see the yellow knob that rotates the radar on top of the ship landing gear up viewed from the front here are the radar a great collection of dishes they spin easily with little friction here is the ship at the half way point the front works well with the top flipping up to squeeze in the pilot more to come 
whats up kernow nice review thanks for sharing welcome to eurobricks i hope you have fun here d xd that quigonn thing is weird come on lego someone is just asleep at the wheel over there with quality control missing pieces injections molds slipping quality ice cube traysimo thats a huge thing to miss the minifig on the box doesnt come in the setfalse claims anyway the ship looks beautiful and i wanted this set when i first saw it and your review confirms that it is very cool thanks again xd xd
not sure i like this one much i like many of the new parts but the boat isnt that great and i would rather get each seperately so i can avoid the whole skeleton army nice review though
 mr tiber they have them at the toysrus in eindhoven in the new shoppingcentrum west of the bijenkorf and the bijenkorf is west of the central station
wout on aug 3 2007 0842 pm said  mr tiber they have them at the toysrus in eindhoven in the new shoppingcentrum west of the bijenkorf and the bijenkorf is west of the central station thanks for the info although thats like 80 km from my place while i have a toysrus like 25 km from my place d thanks anyway maybe ill be in or around eindhoven in the near future mr tiber
thanks for the review mutley777 on aug 2 2007 0237 pm said i have no idea what this is meant to be d thats to put the snowspeeder on there should be a 2x4 plate underneath the snowspeeder that fits in that gap
mutley  did you bought it  tru  are there any other sets exept of hoth base  and is there the republic cruiser
i thought after the kings royal castle uproar about stickers lego would have gone back to printed bricks obviously it is all about costs these days and not about keeping people happy
wow i didnt think wed get a review so fast 8 really nice review the pictures explain it all y  i really hope to get this set as it is really great i guess d
mutley777 on aug 2 2007 0500 pm said yep very reasonable y not too bad  might have to pick that up soon then i will be in tru in southampton over the weekend  i think ill buy the bigger sets here and get the smaller ones in the usa later in the year the smaller the boxes the more chance i will have getting them in my suitcase  i have to say i am very glad we are now not getting a 11 ratio between the numbers used prices in usa vs uk eg it is not longer 4999  4999 
nice review mutley y i agree with all your observations especially stickers versus printed parts  i get some of this and replace the snowspeeders with my v2s hoth on copmike
jgw3000 on 12 march 2015  0546 pm said jim great review as always you convinced me to get this one of these days although not a to priority any comments on which functions can be converted to pf and how well they work actually yes i am in the midst of making a pf version i will post a picture of the setup i have so far this setup is for driving the chassis and it works pretty fine
great review i see now why the b model is so popular i wonder though on the car if instead of the panels for the rear spolier or wing if they could have used studded panels and maybe layer them to give the appearance of ie a three element rear wing i wont mention the front lights if i had the money i would buy it for the b model h
this is a mega review youve taken the right pictures and the video demonstrations of the mechanisms really help get the good points of the set across whats more amazing is that the review still feels very concise and to the point youve actually convinced me to put this set on my list and not just as a decent parts pack lasse d on 12 march 2015  0847 pm said  the front shouldnt open like that  instead it should be easy to remove the whole front cover leaving the suspension easy to work on  the aero seems to be realistic except for the rear end where theres no indication of a venturi channel this should have been easy to include  there is no fuel tank nor fixed fuel connector right behind the cabin  there are no air jacks seriously this is one of the most unique features of a race car like this and lego forgot about them instead they automated two functions which are manual on a real race car  the top cars at le mans are hybrids with ingenious systems i would have loved to see the front wheels connected to some kind of spinning apparatus indicating a kinetic energy recovery system im not sure air jacks are the feature that will have people fawning over this set and pneumatics are being covered rather well later in the year  but i agree with everything else most notably removable front and rear bodywork the removable engine cover on 8674 would be a good starting point here and the inclusion of some nod towards a hybrid system its also worth remembering the preliminary design did have the big honking fin bhf that is mandatory on all current prototypes so maybe when that was removed any trace of a tunnel or diffuser went with it on the subject of steering wheels all modern prototypes actually have left or right hand drive the regulations demand that both lmp1 and lmp2 cars are nominally capable of seating two people of course in practise the extra seat is taken up by the hybrid system in lmp1 and electronicsextra cockpit access in lmp2 however this doesnt change the fact that it would be easy to link the steering wheel to the hogfront axle edited by jay psi 12 march 2015  0955 pm
ted have you described your photography setup somewhere i love the crisp quality of your pictures
a very professional review and really no stone unturned but im still not going to rush out and buy a copy
awesome review jim i love the pictures i dont like how lego did this model though too many compromises edited by omikron 13 march 2015  0724 am
true but i must say i like the new colour very fresh looking compared to the rather dullish regular green cant wait to build mocs with it
i have been waiting for this set since the pictures for the toy fairs eirlier in the year and i am glad to say i am not disapointed first the price it is not cheap at 9999 but i guess that is typical for a set with this amount of electronics in itthere is no parts count and i have not had time to add up the 2 pages of contents to get a figure first the box standard flip top with large internal picture and rip to open lid inside there are no numbered bags in this set which i prefer i like to open all the bags and put all the parts in the box before building next is a picture on the electronics 2 xlmotors as lego describe them and 2 standard motors 2 ir receivers and 1 ir transmitter i know these have been discussed before but i really like the thought that has gone into the transmittersreceivers each receiver has 2 outputs to corespond with the 2 controls on transmitter they also have a choice of 4 channels so one transmitter can control up to 8 independant motors by changing the channel switch the transmitter also has a neat motor direction switch so you can configure the transmitter operation the set comes with three manuals 1 is the main drive mechanism 2 is the cab and engine and 3 is the attachments front and back there is also the now standard parts list in the back of the third manual there is no alternative model instructions despite the pictures of one on the box however there is a reference to the technic website on the back of the box but at the moment the page only has an advert saying the set is to be released on 1st september so i guess i will have to wait untill then to see if the instructions will be online the build is fairly straight forward the main chassis is studless the next picture shows the motors mounted into the chassis and the drive for the shovel and claw it also shows the v6 technic engine this next picture shows the ir receivers mounted on the back the battery box slots into the back and can be easily slid out with the removal of two pins which is useful because i can imagine i will need to change the batteries on a regular basis the next 2 picture are of the completed model overall i was very happy with the finished dozer the functions work really well and as i have the monster dino i have used a second transmitter so i dont have to touch the channel switch i have included some video on my brickshelf page unfortunately this set does suffer from some quality issues for example moulding marks on the plates colour diferences some of the pins not finished properly some pins were very stiff and quite hard to push into the holes but the worst issue was an axle that would not turn freely in a hole which just adds extra friction into the system i am glad to see some studded technic in this set i much prefer sets that use both varieties of technic beam there are only 2 fairings which is a great improvment over recent sets if tlc had tried to make the bulldozer shovel with fairings this would have been a complete disaster marks for the set 810 for price with the number of motors i expected it to be greater 910 for fun my kids love this type of set that does something when finished 610 for quality tlc really need to work on this one 810 overall i would definately get a second one if i see it in the sales feel free to post questions but i will be on holiday next week more pics and videos available here
thank you vey much for this review i do have some questions 1 what are the white clutches geared into 2 is the engine geared to one or both drive motors 3 how well does it go on carpet 4 can it doze without breaking the blade
sinner on aug 3 2007 0120 am said thank you vey much for this review i do have some questions 1 what are the white clutches geared into 2 is the engine geared to one or both drive motors 3 how well does it go on carpet 4 can it doze without breaking the blade the clutches are for the shovel and claw on the front and back the engine is driven from only one of the drive motors it works fine on our rugs but we have mainly wood floors not sure if is fairly strong i have only chased the cat at the moment 
ah mani wanted to review it with mine oh well here in the us it cost 150 and has 1355 pieces total the pins and axles did seem a bit difficult in putting them into place a problem i have been having is the batterys are done after about 4 hours of play which i really wish they would last longer   overall it is a stupendous set and it is really nice to see our old friend the studs make a return

thanks for the review it really looks cool too bad its soo expensive  i must admit that i prefer the 8421 mobile crane for more or less the same price the design is more sexy wub
thanks for the great review of this set ive been looking forward to it as well and i am excited about the wireless controls like the dino i too am curious if this set has been released here in the us i was told that it was a sept 1 release i agree about the battery life my dino set lasted about 4 hours too
thanks for the review this looks like a great set and with four motors two receivers and a remote control i wouldnt say it is overpriced it is still a lot of money though if my scholarship permits it i will seriously consider buying this set
i cant wait to get my paws on this dozer  the new motors look very interesting and i it will be fun to see which possibilities they have in any future mocs
eyesonly on aug 6 2007 0911 pm said what i really want is for philo or someone to test its power and such sweet edit the power of the motors that is its getting late sing i just noticed that he has done that in brick journal 8 check out page 5661 for great info and a comparison to the gear motors to bad it didnt include the nxtmotors since they are very similar
thank you ickelpete for that great review i give you two y up i am not a technic fan but this set definitly looks sweet  i see great potential using this set as a model for a smaller dozer for my towntrain layout i really wub the crawler tracks they used i have been thinking about buying the snowmobile for the tracks but if possible i just might buy this set instead i could definitly use the other parts for mocs model on
eyesonly on aug 10 2007 0416 pm said when i read this i first though you meant set number but this model cant be found there yet and now i realize that you mean something completly different what is this code youre after there is a additional code in the booklet different for every one you should find it from the front or back cover also later editions have different codes some examples set 7905  4497674 front cover bottom left set 8421  4284910 book 1 and 4284922 book 2 back cover bottom right ill bet the code is then used to abuse the lego cache  mig
cute do mine eyes deceive me or is it actually minifig scale
innerrayg on aug 5 2007 0500 pm said cute do mine eyes deceive me or is it actually minifig scale oh no look at the small yellow cabin  no minifig would ever fit in that  other scale on
holodoc on aug 5 2007 0510 pm said oh no look at the small yellow cabin  no minifig would ever fit in that  other scale on my bad i must have been drinking cough syrup i thought this was some kind of minicrane they might use to lift very small bits of steel smack of the head against wall
5150 lego on aug 9 2007 0159 am said but one question what crane are you refering to that came with 7998 that is the new heavy loader and it didnt come with an any crane 8 sorry my mistake i meant 7898 
alright so i usually do quick photo reviews when i get new sets thats what ill do here but theres quite a few photos so i thought i might as well make its own review thread so i got the kwikemart by paying just2much on an early ebay copy i think its worth it as this week im gonna be super busy so i was able to build it saturday and stuff heres my video review i think its one of my best well lets get onto this photo review the set is 200 usd with a little over 2100 pieces the official release is april 15th for vip members may 1st for everyone else at lego stores and if you want full size pictures check out my flickr by clicking here the minifigures included are great you get three exclusive minifigures one being a completely exclusive character the first time lego has ever put an exclusive mould in a direct to consumer set and you get three of the series most popular characters in their normal attire for those who missed out on the first simpsons minifigures series the kwikemarts exterior is loaded with lots of sticker details the only printed detail youll see in the exterior is the dial pad in the phone booth which has appeared in some other licensed themes since last year   right here is there the store can be opened a simple technic pin and receiver keeps it in place and allows for opening and closing the roof of the store includes the garden shown in the paul mccartney episode the roof can be slided outin once you open it with the hinge part heres a look at the store with the roof removed the floors are a nice sand blue color coming with 8x16 thin plates and for the interior from the view of the store opened with the hinges at the back that i mentioned earlier the left front corner which includes some arcade machines of bonestorm and great white hunter an amazingly done buzz cola soda machine juice machine the checkout counter ect the right front corner with food aisles freezers and a frozen jasper sticker the back left corner which includes some nice coffee kettle builds the donut tray hotdogs ect the right back corner which has a door leading to a very small hallway that only has a mouse and cheese in it the hallway leads to the employees only door in the back and its very hard to get in the door way not that theres anything to do inside there also included is clancys copcar which fits three figures heres a look at the piece list in the instructions click on each to be lead to an enlarged version of the pic also included are some awesome printed pieces and two unprinted coffee cups honestly i think this set is perfect the price is fantastic and has a great ppp ratio they really went above and beyond by including snake in this set i honestly think its better than the simpsons house in terms of accuracy and the value here so many cool pieces printed and in exclusive colors so thats my quick picture review hope you guys enjoyed and id love to hear your thoughts
thanks for the review i cant help but think the minifigures are the weak part of the set snake and apu are great but the rest i dont know they kinda redundant now they could at least give us new torso printing like homer wearing his jacket or bart wearing his blue tshirt or marge wearing her coat or as i said in the discussion thread id have included jasper in cmf series 2 and a frozen version here overall the set looks kinda smaller than what i thought snakes bag needed a  symbol printed because it looks like he is stealing gargabe  pretty good review overall
hello everyone excellent review english is not my native language but i want to express my opinion simpsons house was the first of its kind and i can say without exaggeration that this is the most impressive set that im going my collection httpbricksetcomsetsownedbyceleb  i look at the video from the kwikemart and is difficult to say how good it is compared with the house the main disadvantages that i said to myself is this build the walls of the large panels next is access to the roof gray parts in front of the back door i think they represent the stairs is not on the level with doors on the roof and when you open them you can see the white block is openly trash my points of view boxes on the left of go to the store and powersauce box i want see make real and not just a cube fe such as in the unreleased star wars set about minifigures i fully agree with robert8 two more of the same homer marge and bart personally i put my set as a scene and all the replays minifigure are inside the house that was not identical characters next and also absolutely terrible barts accessory this set is made parking for bikes and it looks very cool but damn it is hoped to see the bart or lisas bike instead of useless balloons with paint the walls are made with convex inside panels why so can anyone know have not seen any pictures with such walls in tv show why did not they turn i personally really like how realized roof but my brother says that it is terrible  garden could do more in the series there were almost jungle i do not know how to be considered here maybe anyone can express any opinion or idea i look at the simpsons house and then look at the photo of this emart i can not understand in the house we have a garage two floors cool floor a lot of furniture all the rooms and walls collected from cubes many additional accessories and where is all this detail here it looks much smaller maybe even poorer if they still will release next year comic book store it will be even less of course it is difficult to estimate without seeing it live we have it will be sold only in may at first sight it does not look so impressive as the house can certainly the case in the limit on the amount of detail but why it was impossible to add  50 to the cost and make jasper the more detailed the roof the walls of the smaller elements that it was not convex sad thanks all for attention edited by celeb 13 april 2015  0510 am
can you post a pic of it next to the simpsons house just curious about size comparisons
looks great how does it compare to the house
heres a size comp to the house click for a bigger image
one thing that may justify the price it has 527 different parts if i counted correctly i alway heard the more different parts the more difficult the set is to produce the simpsons house already had an astonishig amount of different pieces but this one is even more extreme
great review
did anyone else have a problem with the piano against the wall of the simpsons house it just kept coming off way too easily and i was getting really frustrated with it sticking out and not fully going on so i had to put the two tiles that hold them one place over away from the wall for it to sit properly without falling out i think i might put snowball ii behind it since cats love to hide underneath or behind things lol but just curious to know if anyone else was encountering this problem with the previous set
awesome set i really like the robots and that tiny tank could be quite useful all the fancy machinery in there really make it more like a lab than a restaurant d the thing i found most funny was the positioning of the middle finger on the hand d d definitely gave me quite a laugh xd
great review of a great set wub i look forward to more
wow youre pretty strong especially for a hologram d thanks for that neat and funny review of a very fine set doc y

wub wub wub wub wub holodoc i seriously have some love for your review youre in it and using a fabuland wrench such a clever review with a great sense of humor i really liked this train set and it adds so much to a train layout especially when you buy multiples tlc is throwing away a potential gold mine by discontinuing this line  it is also nice to see those beautiful consistent slopes in that picture it really is sad that tlc is letting quality slip they dont seem to be responding to the issue they way they did the bleyfrown fiasco perhaps we afol need to make more of a stink to the embassy  again great job holodoc and thanks for sharing sweet y what an excellent and fun review
excellent review doc  im glad you can get out of the holodec y i could see this done with other colors than blue also sweet 9v on copmike
holodoc on aug 20 2007 0839 am said different colors no problem smarty pants xd
great review i loved the pic of your sigfig buried under legos d its too bad lego did not continue to make more of this style of set
great review y i have just bought my first 9v motor and you have convinced me i will buy a least two of this set 
yes my spongebob fans its time for another review  lets look at our bikini bottom map and head strait to meet miss puff at her boating school she is waiting for us to give us a guided tour of her establishment  another bit of sb history this set comes from the following episode boating school spongebob fails his boating test for the 38th time what a freaking retard lool hes so determined to get his license that patrick decides to help him he implants a walkietalkie inside sbs head in order to cheat and tell him what to do you will say that i am biais but i really enjoy building this set and i really like the sb theme  lets hope 2008 brings more of that cool spongieness  but i digress here are general pics of the instruction booklet and the dss g there are loads of crappy stickers in that one also  as you can see the set is divided in 3 polybags shamelessly but nonetheless wilfully hehe i will disregard the third one which is that playability crap course  i would have reviewed it but since it involves stickers i didnt want to ruin the parts and without stickers it would look dull plain and ugly it does look crappy with so imagine without so that review will not be 100 complete and i do apologise in advance but how many of you would have build that and keep it hehe off p 1 mfs and extras i will start with the really cool miss puff wub the fig mind you  she looks a bit stressed  no wonder that sponge menace will bring her to the hospital once again hehe as you can see that mf comprises 3 parts the small blue 1x1 round and the 2 major parts yeay another great stupid looking sb i love those idiotic faces  3 different sb figs and 3 idiotic faces hehe you never can get enough of them  here is just a regular patrick too bad patrick doesnt have different expressions  the pull back boat car nothing really to report except the fact that i left it sticker free  the only thing i built from the third polybag is that pretty cool ancker holding tower thingie  looks great in a lighthouse set hehe yes the roud tile bouey is printed  its the same as in sbs bed in the bikini bottom set  ok its time for those two great buildings the lighthouse and the school  pontoon  before reviewing them individually here is a general pic 2 the lighthouse one of the main reason to own that great set  sure it suffers from accute stickeretite sad but d  t worst is that door but nonetheless a great and simple building  great whitered colour scheme and a really fantastic 2 turning lights  i really like the yellow top of the lighthouse it adds to the comic atmosphere of that theme instead of having a more plain redwhite only the rear has nothing really fancy except tools to fix it in case of problems hehe the only thing i modified since i didnt build the third polybag is that i got rid of the trechnic parts on the right of the lighthoue to replace them with regular logs all hail the tower king  d 3 the school and pontoon i really like that little building and its great to see that once again tlc uses the amazing dark blue color  its really a simple design but looks fantastic and can be used for many things in a town hehe i also really like the combination with those dark bluish grey slopes  the rear reveals the desk stickers on the wall doh  and two clams serving as chairs really like on the show its really great to see that tlc stays really as close to the show as possible the pontoon again is simple yet really cool and effective and its really nice to have 2 lifesaving boueys the only thing i modified since i didnt build the third polybag is that i got rid of the trechnic parts in front of the pontoon to replace them with regular logs on the overall i think its really a great set  apart from the crap stickers i think tlc should have ditched or simplified the third playability polybag to lower the cost  oh well parts are always usefull except those one part shitty palm trees  so until my next review i bid you farewell my spongebob fans  and i really hope to see next year hehe will sb get his drivers license one day  for the sake of bikini bottom lets hope not  no license ever on  yoda
i like this one better than the other one for parts and such plus im generally a sucker for any different minifig but yeah that price is steep great review though
another great review thanks yoda man those smooth slopes really look like crap when on a roof  that was the whole reason they had texture in the first place  ill never liked those they feel so cheap the new sb head is great and can mrs puffs legs move i just ask since her feet are separate and in figs where the legs cant move theyre usually one piece at the bottom to keep them from breaking off the set looks great and seems to have a lot of playability
man that spongebob head cracks me up hilaritythis is a cool set although i much prefer the chum bucket set i dont see whats wrong with the course then again i can see why afols wouldnt like it its just playability really i like the breakable wall though the building is cool a few modifications ie making it more realistic real chairs for a start and it would make a cool little wharf for your lego town and to sw4j mrs puffs legs are connected at the feet if you look closely so thanks for the great review yoda
maybe mrs puff has a nice toy inside xd i like this review the lighthouse part and the school are nice enough for other towns and the figs are nice even mrs puffs 2 pieces you cant use for other things  pity that its 50 dollars 60 euro for half price i would think about it
holodoc on aug 16 2007 0926 am said there are far more interesting parts if you dont like sb what you cant dislike sb no one cant contrary to star trek d  vader on aug 16 2007 1148 am said am i the only one who thinks mrs puff kinda looks like a kinder egg toy theirs nothing wrong with that mind you yes i have a kinder problem xd  just seems strange to me maybe yes but in the show too so really no matter
holodoc on aug 16 2007 0448 pm said phaser banks 12 ready to fire  quick  lets beam miss puff out of reach asap  and prepare to retaliate with clamus pearl canon  bring it on trekie  p yoda
xwingyoda on aug 16 2007 1011 pm said hey patrick im on your side d  yoda oops i read too quickly so misuderstood 
thank you for the nice review sinner i also bought this set but in combination with 4883 when it was on sale 50  hurray at sh i made a short review of 4883 but wasnt really sure what to tell about 4884 so im glad you did that for me d i have different feelings about this set on the one hand i love the lion he is really impressive even my wife not known for being lego enthusiastic asked me if there were more animals of this kind the lion is  restricted  poseable and the colors used are fantastic wub 3 models can be built simultaneously  thats great on the other hand i still dont know what to do with these rotation joints wacko and the other models are somehow disappointing compared to the lion i seem to have missed the little lizard  i put it on my to dolist like all the creator sets great parts pack  but wait until they get on sale xd for me  i had a lot more fun with 4883 indeed roarrrr on 
sigh i really really wanted to buy this when it was on sale on sh and i never did and now its no longer available  its a great set with a nice amount of bley but a crapload of tan its like the perfect way to increase your tan supplies nice review you lucky aussie
sinner on aug 16 2007 0546 pm said nothing but the best for hinckley p  thanks buddy youre such a good friend another excellent review
sinner on aug 15 2007 1129 pm said and what i believe is a vulture so uh are you willing to sell that vulture sweet i was going to buy the set so i could moc an eagle out of that vulture but i never bought it pleeaase xd
thanks for the review i really like this set i love the acu minifigures and the dinosaur is really nice i think the helicopter has great potential for a shield helicopter only suggestion is that some of your pictures are a little bit dark especially the box front one but really good for your first review thanks a lot

yesterday i went to toys r us and bought the dilophosaur ambush beside that the shop had a display of the jw polybags for €349 i picked up two of them now here is my little review of this pretty nice set first some data line jurassic world year 2015 pieces 29 price €349 packaging polybag ok lets start with the polybag itself it is a standard size and had plenty of room for all the parts the front depicts the whole set with a little hexagon on the right with a seperate picture of the dinosaur and its name in this case the celophysis is called gallimimus weird choice next is the instruction sheet it is a doublesided paper with every building step in clear sight the part selection is nice there are only a few but all of them are pretty usefull for all kind of builds there are two parts which stoodout both are printed tiles the first one is the yellowblack warning tile in 1x4 you cant have enough of that the second one is a 2x2 tile with the jurassic world logo on it thats pure awesome the bigger sets seem to have only sticker for that so this little set is a perfect way to get hold of this nice tile the leftovers nothing special here is the complete trap it is a basic build and functions pretty well in the end the parts are more interesting as the build so it will definitely end up as a partspack now on to the star of this bag the celophysisgallimimus i dont know why lego decided to call this dinosaur mold any different but i think it has to do with movieconnection and the will to not produce a new mold nevermind this figure is great and the colour is very bright and totally stood out pretty beastie a comparison between the 2015 gallimimus and the 2012 celophysis the final set in all its glory final verdict it is a great little set the parts used a nice and usefull the printed tiles are the secret stars of this set and the dinosaur is fun two with a few packs of these you could easily build a celophysis pack with lots of jurassic world signs on their way highly recommended
nice review i really hope its avaliable for sale in the us
nice i had to buy the jw lego game to get mine
great review very thorough its not a set which makes me run to tye store but it definitely has some fun elements i do like your new grey background your pictures look great
reviews for this set really should picture them next to the bike shop  cafe which its intended to be compatible with right down to the size of the baseplates and grey tiles around the edge it doesnt look that great on its own but if you add the two sets together you get something that begins to look like a street scene
lightningtiger on 04 may 2015  1255 pm said thanks mostlytechnic for this review i only brought this set to continue the shop series from creator in my opinion its only half as good as the bike shopcafe one plus it doesnt fit the same as that pair of shops oh well maybe next year lego creator will have a better one brick on review on mostlytechnic  well it is only half the price of the bikecafe one too  but i agree it seems odd that theyve made a couple shop creator sets that dont fit together in style like this i guess theyve done that for years with the creator houses though  none of those really work together david thomsen on 04 may 2015  0133 pm said reviews for this set really should picture them next to the bike shop  cafe which its intended to be compatible with right down to the size of the baseplates and grey tiles around the edge it doesnt look that great on its own but if you add the two sets together you get something that begins to look like a street scene interesting to get two comments right in a row with opposite opinions  i dont have the bikecafe set but to me they dont looks like theyd really go together theyre the same concept two buildings that fold in half but the sidewalk is different size and they just feel differently styled to me
this seems like half of a set compared to the previous bike shopcafe as i like many of the elements i will probably buy a second one and build a mirror image version making one entirely a toy shop and the other a book storenews stand and adjust the sidewalks to work with the previous model then i think they will work well together i remember a little area in copenhagen that had this sort of architecture i would hope the subsequent models are better deigned to create more complex alternatives but these are both good starting points for original or enhanced models
informative review thanks y as usual it makes a fairly good parts pack wish i could pick up a few on deep discount but at full price one is fine i do like the stewards and some of the workmen overall i think im looking more forward to the belville calendar just for its assortment of unusual parts ugh belville still parts are parts and its got some phoinix summed up one of the most common complaints i hear about all of the lines in 3 simple words  no girlsagain good job now get lego to listen 
holodoc on sep 13 2007 0520 pm said pink bricks mine would fit in a matchbox   3 and 1  oooooooooo thank you  thank you  thank you  wub wub wub will pm address details holodoc on sep 13 2007 0520 pm said  but i wont send them anyway p d damn  you lil tease d any orange pieces
ive never been fond of these sets but still buy them every year because my daughters like them i am however looking forward to the belville advent calendar which likely will have some parts that usually are quite hard to get in it my girls will love it and i love all the belville parts httpshoplegocomproductp7600 if anyone has pics of what is contained in this set i would love to see them
930 euro is msrp here in denmark 7 euro would have resulted in a nicer reception from my part but the strong marked position of lego in its homeland together with the general high prices because some of us are supposedly rich makes the prices less bearable it is funny you should mention germany i thought the prices for lego were even higher there im sure i paid more than msrp last time i bought lego from from your country on the other hand the last thing i bought was the 5521 model team sea jet from 1993
nice review but i dont think ill get this set i dont relly like the look it looks ugly hmmm anyway
thanks i was planning on doing this review but i have been a bit swamped lately  great review of a great set it isnt too hard to convert the plane to minifig size either sorry i forgot to take photos i might add some photos to your review
hovercraft alternate model uses around 45th of the parts it is cool but a bit fragile
this is a really great set when i first saw it i thought oh a silly small plane who needs that and then i got it and i am very happy that i did this is one of the best designed lego creator sets and it was designed by the designer of the cafecorner
thank you sinner for bringing the pictures of the hovercraft i think it is a really cool model but the steering wheel doent work too well it doesnt turn easilly all the way around and when the craft turns it doesnt stay stable on the three wheels because the front wheel turns quite alot into the opposite side now to the third model this is quite a basic helicopter with the functionality of having the rotors turning it doesnt use that many of the bricks and doesnt even have a landing gear i have a question to all of you as you can see i prefer to show one or two large pictures and have the rest as clickable thumbnails most people use only the relatively big typically 640x480 pictures so that you dont have to follow links what do you prefer it is no problem for me to do it the other way but i would like to know if you have any preferences
thanks for this excellent review lasse d  i was thinking about getting this the other day but decided not to i regret my actions glad to see creator making great sets the theme has so much potential i just wish that this set had more models  oh well cant have it all anyway thanks sweet batbrick away 
sinner on sep 21 2007 0919 am said i agree errr sorry if i have annoyed you by posting the pictures looking at your brickshelf folder you had taken photos of the hovercraft as well and i seem to have stepped on your toes i prefer bigger pictures as i get tired of clicking waiting clicking waiting if the pictures are all there all you have to do is click then wait p  you didnt step on my toes because i took the pictures after you posted them p i just wanted to add them for completeness i can see the loading issue when you click a lot of pictures i normally hold ctrl down so that they open in their own tabs but they still have to load any other opinions
thanks for the review i really dislike this set but i thought much worse of it when we saw the first pic i think it was a good idea mech transporter pursued in a horribly wrong way x thanks again  batbrick away 
its for sure an at least interesting set the idea of attaching that small mecha to the bugs body is very good so it works like a counterpart to the aero booster pretty nice although only the two front legsre articulated thats a shame  thanks for the review rezourceman y
nice i really want this now the yellow mech was the thing i disliked on it but now its my favourite part of it zots
rezourceman on sep 22 2007 0952 am said suprisingly nice little buildvehicle oh my god they killed kitt 8  you basterds sing d p  thank you for the nice review  edited by wout 14 october 2007  0725 pm
i just got set number 7721 the new special edition crawler thing in woolworths in croydon england apparently it is a woolworths exclusive over here and i didnt expect to see it on shelves for a while yet pleased to get it just about to start building it looks like a very good set i love the yellow mech
does anyone have a box pic of this set dp8
this set is from 2013 doctor doom is completely based off the comic version tv show version not the movie in any way anyways nice review i personally own this set and its a nice set but could have been better edited by aegis2000 13 september 2015  0233 am
thanks for the review ive had that set for quite a while and its among my favorite marvel superheroes sets actually compared to the other stuff we usually get to accompany the minifigs all those laboratorys the most recent construction site and the hydra fortress  yeah youre being a little harsh here maybe youre still suffering from ptsd after watching fantfourstic
this set seems to appeal more to the non superhero crowd it is one of the only marvel sets i bought mainly because i thought that the building was a nice return to the old style of city sets i would love to see this sort of backdrop for a more realistic agents theme i also liked that most of the figs in this set were easier to merge into other nonsuper uses thanks for the review god bless nathan
hi again they have arrived wub they come dismantled inside the package instead of one piece like the blackhole stormtrooper did they have the head and swsign made with magnets to clip on to the torso it actually works even if it feels a bit cheapish heres some pictures  mr vader goes first vader package pieces stormie package pieces my collection so far   heres the blackhole stormtrooper review boba fett  luke maquette on copmike
casewindu on sep 23 2007 0819 pm said great reviews mike these are great i cant wait until you review the next around how much were these and where did you get them at wwwstarwarscom  this one is boba the sell for 65 each  shipping collection on copmike
beautiful indeedily and these magnetsll allow at least a quick change of heads and probably some nice poseability wub
good idea to make this review while you build the set ill be monitoring your progress and feedback the box so huge impressive
wow that box is big but i somehow thought it would be even bigger still it looks like for once lego are actully using all the space inside and not just a fraction like with other sets cant wait to see more dunamisyou lucky megablok 
thats awesome man lucky that you got it i want it so badly and it has a huge box too zots
xwingyoda on sep 27 2007 0918 am said many tks dunamis for doing that its really great and i cant wait monitoring your progress on the beast 8 like it was mentionned in another thread the box looks less gigantic than i thought  remember the isd box  that was a huge box  is the instruction book in the pizza box  how big is it  im sure its really big and i hope for our sake that the colours are clearly marked xd if you know what i mean d  yoda interesting question regarding the size of the box vs the isd here ya go also ill be posting more on the size of the manual a little later im going to be building for the next few hours sweet
very expecting indeed waiting for your kind photo  
my gawd that manuel is huge thats enough to put a sane man off of buying this setthank gawd none of us are sane thats all i can say xd just how many technic pins does this monster need 8 judging by that one pic theres gotta be a lot in this set
nice idea reviewing the set while constructing it this is the top of the bill for any legocollector also financially speaking and i like the look of all those thousands of pieces the manual is incredible i thought i had a really thick manual coming with set 8479 but this one exceeds it with ease review on
good review y me i cant build it before saturday 
the build the build is going quicker than i thought i am sorting as i open the bags that i need some bags are in multiples so it is easy to pick them out the build is a tad repetitive as the framework of the ship is somewhat symmetrical here are some progress shots note that two plates 1x4 and 1x8 are stacked in between technic beams then the part below is assembled to hold the structure together this took about an hour of sorting and building ill post another update tomorrow
a beautiful and humorous review with very fine pics y a fantastic set full of neat details and in a wonderful color scheme great for every city builder for sure i guess we waited for sets like that we dreamed about them im glad we got them now  edit congrats it seems youve got your bucket back p
thank you very much for the review sinner i definitly wub this set this will make a great addition for us townies i thought the size was too small i plan to make my house fit practically the whole baseplate plus i will definitly add floors that looked d  i cant believe tlc skimped on the floors
thanks for the review sinner y  although we had a not very detailed one already p i bought this set at tru with 20 off resulting in 54 xd definitely a must buy for every townie you get tons of useful parts to build other buildings as well shameless selfpromotion off  you have to love tan bricks though 8 moc on
thanks for the thanks guys sweet hinckley39 on sep 28 2007 1108 am said great job now sort that out and start building for our competition xd i started building today sweet matthewusa on sep 28 2007 0356 pm said i cant believe tlc skimped on the floors it didnt bother me as i downloaded the instructions prior to buying the set i think it was a deliberate choice to make the house flashy looking but not very functional due to the cool looking corners it isnt very strong either while breaking it i was reminded of a zip p simonwillems on sep 28 2007 0653 pm said the only thing i dislike about this set is the way the windows are attached in train windows so they turn inwards a little instead of the usual frames with shutterattachmentability these were my first windows like that and it surprised me i wouldnt be surprised if lego are trying to phase out the old windows holodoc on sep 28 2007 0758 pm said thanks for the review sinner y  although we had a not very detailed one already p i notice that but since didnt show what the original set looked like i saw that more of a moc 8 holodoc on sep 28 2007 0758 pm said you get tons of useful parts to build other buildings as well shameless selfpromotion off  i was actually considering adding a link to your moc anyway thanks p pauldelahaye on sep 29 2007 0738 am said i too have bought this set and the only thing i notice which is a bit odd with the exception of there being no floors in the house is the lack of a steering wheel in the car once again i think this is just a sign of all style no substance d paulc on sep 29 2007 0519 pm said the mixed rough and smooth roof bricks would annoy me on a model like the mtt but here it looks as is if the roof is quite old with some parts being worn and pitted and some parts being replaced with new roof tiles i quite like the effect fair point what confuses me though is the cg cover has the rough ones shown 
sinner you have convinced me i bought this set yesterday when it was on sale at international lego weekend in skrbk
hi youve done well on the pictures but i agree with freekysch a little more text would be great ever thought about joining the reviewers academy
thanks for comments i know about text im trying to write more but havent succes in this yet i thought about joining reviewers academy but im not sure because i have only maimum 4may be 5 hours each time when i can make review or something that needs some hours
very nice review seems like ill be getting my first castle set soon wub grevious on oct 10 2007 0933 pm said most of them are old pieces recolored but the ball on chain what’s the actual name could someone tell me that would be a flail 
thanks for this nice review nice comics presentation too sweet makes me want to get some new castle sets even harder now 
great review this is one of my favorite sets from the new castle line its simple and yet so effective oh and great comic you have there y
excellent review showed everything in detail then added a fun twist at the end another set i pretty much knew i needed to buy is confirmed y
nice review y the comic is very funny d i dont have this set 8 but im going to buy it soon

i just got this today it is amazing like my other two castle sets the joust and the crossbow i am currently starting to save for 2008 but for christmas i think i want the skeleton carridge and the naboo n1 fighter
great review you almost make me want to buy one i dont know what it is with these sets on the one hand they are so nicely designed and cute on the other side i never seriously consider buying one i cant explain what it is that holds me back
i missed out on the first one but i love the improvements made in this version like the tree having an actual brown trunk so it looks less like an artificial one and the carolers as well i may pick this up but im sorry to those of you who already have one
oky on 29 november 2015  1145 am said as for the controversy over rereleasing the winter toy shop i can see where the haters are coming from but i find their complaints to be quite petty i can understand if youre disappointed because you already have the first winter toy shop and were looking forward to a new set this year but theres always next year if youre a completist and feel like tlg is forcing you to buy a set you dont need youre wrong nobody is forcing you to buy anything but yourself if you decide to buy every set in a theme no matter what it is thats your problem not legos so put down your torches and pitchforks and just be glad that they improved the set design and gave us another chance to buy this classic set there are far worse things that can happen in this world than lego rereleasing one of their most popular sets sorry for that little rant so what is your opinion on rereleases like this please cast your vote in the poll above after mocking people for holding a particular opinion you then turn around and ask people to express their opinion no thanks i guess ill keep my opinions to myself i certainly dont want to be labeled a hater
oky on 02 december 2015  1249 am said i dont think that would be a realistic option as that would mean that they would have to spend twice the resources on this theme which i dont think they are ready to do but if more people would like this option i can add it to the poll i know but one can always hope cant one i hope the wv theme will be continued in coming years with new sets but given santas workshop and this rerelease i dont get my hopes up too much time to get mocing and reverse engineering
i didnt own the original toy shop so i bought it this time around i just finished building it saturday and i love it however i wish they had both rereleased this one and came out with a new addition to the village 
oky on 02 december 2015  1249 am said im not mocking anyone i just think that some people need to calm down a bit and that tlg is getting more hate than they deserve for this set but thats just my opinion and youre welcome to disagree with it everyone is entitled to their own opinion including you and me and yes i would love to hear your thoughts on this matter because i would like to have a friendly discussion on this subject thats cool and i appreciate that but i would recommend avoiding the use of the word hater then thats a perjorative term thats loaded with negative connotation as im sure youre well aware its the flipside to me calling you a mindless fanboy or a corporate shill those arent terms that invite friendly discussion they shut down discussion by belitting the other persons opinion and implying that they lack the maturity or intelligence to think critically i dont actually care all that much about this set you just hit on a pet peeve of mine is all and its one that i see spreading throughout eurobricks which is a shame the use of terms like hater whiner or fanboy are becoming much too prevalent around here
while i can see kids enjoying this im not sure i would buy the flex axles are nice and it is a decent number of white panels but i think i would get better return out of a larger parts set fantastic review though and your pictures show off this tiny model better than the box art does
love this model awesome swooshability interesting parts and a nice little model to put on my desk at work 
i seem to have been messing up axle lengths in various reviews its indeed 5l my bad thanks for pointing it out
nice review even with the missing demonstration video of the amodel looks like this is an excellent panel pack for the price and those soft axles will go down a treat will this set be the dark horse of 1h 2016
jay psi on 02 december 2015  1210 am said nice review even with the missing demonstration video of the amodel hmmm strange let me fix that
i just built the a model and i rather like it it is much bigger than it looks from the box  about 30 studs long there is only one function  the landing gear  but it works very nicely apart from that its a very solid build and achieves an elegant shape with an absolute minimum of parts i dont usually get excited about small sets but this one appeals to me i like the feeling that every single piece has a purpose
my favourite of the 2016 sets ive built so far id go so far as to say this is the best budget set in years i would have loved this when i was a kid  great swoosh ability 
i got this little set for xmas and i noticed all the gaps and decided to fix them so here it is img5344 by jj2sam on flickr first i added some beams to the wings and top to make it less hollow second i put some navigation lights on it i made the nose a bit wider and added a control panel and lastly i changed out the landing gear wheels to more appropriate ones img5349 by jj2sam on flickr more pictures are here
thats a cool little mod two small nigles though 1 your navigation lights are flipped on the main wings 2 the panels on the tail i think were supposed to be the intakes for the jet engine by using them to close up the tail youve turned it into a glider cant wait untill i find one of these on shelves
so this set showed up in stores yesterday and i immediately picked two up all in all it is a nice set but it is slightly different from what i was expecting the plane feels a bit flat pointy nose wide bottom etc and while the panels work very well as wings it feels a bit simplistic to just have singlepart wings the stickers really work for it though its a cracking set though nice parts pack and a nice model as well
i almost purchased this today because i like the wheel  disc combo so much
cool glad you like em and thanks for the kind words
not sure what people like about this set i think its the worst of all 1h2016 sets odd shape bland colors no new parts and the windscreen isnt even closed but the reviews are great indeed 
first thing i thought hot wheels whut the set looks like the hot wheels bone shaker
allanp on 01 december 2015  0418 pm said i thought that was the best compliment a salesman can get  seriously though even though i am not quite sold on the helicopter your reviews are very well done you put a positive light on it whilst still being completely honest hehe you have a point thanks for the compliment though
thanks for the review i wonder if the design inspiration came from the russian ka32 helicopter
i was waiting especially for review of this set let me add few things about this thing it all will be complainging of person who works with these type of machines so if you just want a unusual machine in your collection ignore my complaining  i see underground loaders almost every day and believe me this model would now work in the underground mine first of all its cab should stick out more from the frame each loader has cab placed out of the chassis to provide better view for the driver in this class of machine it would help a bit but in low loader ones it is extremely important this is the view from the cab of a low profile loader looking at front  and yes front of the machine is where engine is placed because at least at kghm all machines drive engine forward another thing about that cab is that seat and steering wheeljoysticks are placed perpendicularly to the machine chassis to provide same view for driving forward and backwards so another weak spot of the set the model lacks of trans clear lights on the engine part because all machines that work underground have same lamps on front and back another thing that comes to my mind is that warning light and antena would not live too long in the mine becuase it could be torn apart by ramming into tunnels roofs it does resemble shape of underground machine but not a loader only machine that comes to my mind is something that are used for movingplacing hydraulic support jacks in tunnels sorry for poor quality i didnt find better picture of it it does have claw four wheels and articulated chassis but have much greater range of movement of the arm anyway id give it at least 35 for overall look model itself as a set looks unfinished or cut down on pieces after visit of an accountant for me it looks like engine part was built differently with knobs for steeringclaw operating sticking out from back claw needs almost seven full turns of the worm gear to close from opened position and is rather annoing to use it in way it is built in this model bracket that holds bevel gears responsible for steering is rather loose being hold in place by single 34 pin on the other hand the steering works very well it seems that lack of differential will be more common in lego sets becuase it is another model that have fake engine driven by single wheel like in old russian rc cars i am ok with that but it is a pitty that this model has only r2 engine thing that i do not like the most in this model is how the claw arm works first of all it barelly lifts the claw of the ground the movement could be much better and it has major design flaw  universal joints are not placed in line with articulation points and this is main reason of 5l axle not being suported on both sides under the turntable while rainsing the arm it bends a little i really would like to see this model built differently with normal bucket and better range of movement edited by mlonger 05 december 2015  1108 pm
great review thank you the set to me is kinda blah interested more in the new panels than the rest of it
great review one thing reaaaaaally bothers me about this set both models have the engine connected to one wheel the other wheel on the powered axle is just left to rotate freely and that really bothers me as it did in 42022 on 42022 even more tbh since its main feature is being a frigging car looking at the pics it isnt even a space issue as it was in the hot rod where they needed to route the steering through so they just cheaped out and didnt bother fitting a diff in there or even a live axle link im not very interested in this set not into construction stuff but i think this is a worrying trend 
thanks for review mostlytechnic not a must have for me but this set have nice assortment of parts new turntable new panels i like yellow and if ill buy two of this sets  ill get enough wheels for proper 18wheeler and rubber connectors that i almost dont using at all but want to have more and more edited by victor imaginator 06 december 2015  0219 pm
efferman  would there be an instruction list for this mod 
a forum member on doktor brick has said he will make an instruction

lego 42045 technic hydroplane racer thanks to lego and eurobricks for making this review possible this was supposed to be a previewreview before the dec 1 release date for the set but it got stuck in customs or something and didnt arrive in time well id rather do a good late review than a rushed review so here it is name hydroplane racer set number 42045 pieces 180 price 1999 minifigs 0 theme technic year of release 2016 links bricklink brickset the box standard technic box action photo 2in1 logo inset of functions and the new try our app logo in the corner the box back more standard stuff with the bmodel and a larger app ad the contents 3 bags two manuals yes despite all the ads for their instructions app they included printed manuals for both the main and b models a big sticker sheet and two loose black beams the interesting parts theres a lot of panels in this set some are new colors the blue curved panel and the lshaped blue panels are a new mold i see them being used as mudguards on future sets or maybe even this year i havent looked at the other 2016 technic sets in detail yet the hose soft axle 7 long in black is new as well the normal 7 axle in yellow is a new color too and i have no idea why its in this set both models use it in invisible places so theres no reason other than making it easier to grab the right length axle to have it i assume other sets this year are using it but im not sure the manual and the dumbingdown continues now they have to show people to compare axle lengths to the 11 prints on the page that have always been there but how does the 11 work on the app might have to look into that for the record i pulled out my phone and tried to find the app in the google store couldnt find it so then i went to the lego website shown on the page and it had a link to it turns out it wasnt showing up because its tablet only so google wasnt showing it to me on my phone ill try again later with a tablet starting the build two technic standards a bunch of pieces linked together to make a specific pattern of holes and an engine block some weirdness this felt very weird to me  making the crankshaft for the engine they have you build it right to left i dont know if its because im a lefty or what but it felt awkward i need to look in some old manuals and see if its always been this way nope i randomly looked at 2013s set 42000 racer and it builds it left to right assembling the core heres the core of the racer upside down the engine block some gears at each end and a couple boat studs for smooth gliding and yes they cheated and those are only attached on two studs instead of all 4 im always amazed at how lego geometry keeps finding interesting ways that it works like here with those boat studs they fit perfectly into the bottom of the brick and against the beam the front end up front we get a standard blue seat with a couple hidden wheels behind it a boat doesnt typically have wheels but these will drive the mechanisms of this model so well let it slide an odd part choice here though  in the very front there are two tan axle pin without friction parts holding that 3 long liftarm on why theres no need in either model for the nonfriction pin and theres lots of the normal blue axle pins in the set so why include these two different pins and all done it looks like a huge jump here but its really not the front and rear connect to each other and then a bunch of big panels are added that make the model look way bigger the stickers on this set really make it work without them its pretty bland and boring so i recommend using them from the rear at the back we have a fan to propel the boat thats not so accurate all the images i can find of reallife boats use props in the water but since this is a nonfloating model we have to make some tweaks i guess there also should be fins going down into the water for stability and hydroplaning but again had to drop that heres an example of a real boat you can see they nailed the overall look quite well the underside for those that want to see the mechanicals heres the underside of the model minifig scale technic nope not quite a fig will fit the seat but sticks out of the cockpit and cant fit a helmet at all so close starting the b model again with the engine block but this time an opposing 4 instead of inline an odd part its rare for lego to include parts specific to the bmodel so i was curious when i found this 2axle with pin a fairly new part in the main model its used in a place that a normal 3 pin would have been fine and its the only one of these in the whole set so it obviously must be needed in the bmodel sure enough theres an assembly here that needs it the front of the boat more upsidedown building and that silver piston is basically only there as a spacer it has no real function yet it turns out later an axle goes into it so its a support for one end of the axle adding the wheels we keep building around the engine this model uses the same wheel setup as the main model taking shape the bmodel instructions tell you to put the stickers on in case you havent  they actually did a good job making the sticker work on either model but the silver piston used as a crossbrace is a bit weird it can spin so that axle hole on the side ends up facing whatever way it wants the back end the flex axles are used here under the panels just for appearance and to support the exhausts at the right angle same fan propulsion as the main model and just as wrong here  worse the gearing is switched in the main model the pistons and fan spin pretty quickly as you push the boat across the floor in this one they turn very slowly more instruction weirdness im always curious at how lego decides to do instructions heres how the panels on one side of the boat are assembled for the mirror image on the other side they tell you to put all 3 pins into the short panel as step 1 2 black and a blue add the white piece as step 2 and then add teh second panel and stickers as step 3 why two different ways all done heres a similar angle as most of the official images looks ok i noticed though how obvious the wheels are the back of the box image is a lower angle that hides them more and i like the mudguard panels as seats pretty clever from the side im not fond of the profile it doesnt sit level like i think it should the wheels are a stud too low sticking out of the bottom the underside like most bmodels there are compromises theres pins and axles sticking out but thats what you do when faced with a limited piece selection minifig scale yet nope not quite a bit too big this time i think the driver is supposed to sit in the seat with knees over the front of the guard where the grey pin is so the minifig is way too small spare pieces very few leftovers in this bmodel the conclusion so whats my conclusion on this model the bmodel is fairly meh and too similar to the main model however i love the hydroplane racer itself it looks great and is very swooshable for the price its surprisingly large thanks to the big panels on the sides yes this is one set that really needs the stickers to look good but they look great and are well worth putting on the ratings value 910  close to 10 cents a piece and a fairly large model for the price design 910  looks great other than the tiny fan on the back minifigs na  i was tempted to give a score since a minifig almost fits but thatd be cheating playability 810  not much functionality other than the engine and fan spinning but very swooshable and sturdy enough to be played with parts 910  a bunch of panels including some new ones just about every kind of technic pin and quite a few thin liftarms  overall 910  the set is a solid winner as long as your satisfied with the main model
thanks for a great review too bad there is only one blue curved panel in this set my opinion on the frictionless axlepins is that the flex axle might be easier to stick in them than in regularblue axlepins didnt actually try it though  edited by majklspajkl 05 december 2015  1146 pm
nice review thanks nice little set i might buy me one
very timely review jim my wife has just surprised me by giving me this set a few days ago and i have just built the a model two days ago and b model yesterday i agree with all that you wrote above i dont have tumbler tires but i have 9398 tires driving is smooth but steering  suspension will be bad as you said due to negative caster and tires hitting the chassis anyway tonight i will destroy the b model and rebuilt this httpwwwbusterhau8cmodelhtml
the set is a looker youve got to admit it but what it gives in looks does not make up for what it lacks in functions i really wanted this set badly even when i restarted my adventure with technic about a month ago than i learned more and more about what a good model can do mostly thanks to this forum and yt right now im a bit disappointed with the arctic truck  smaller sets offer more functions and teach you much more jim it was a great review nevertheless edited by pgplay 14 december 2015  1122 am
i think this model is more or less supposed to be a version of this thing a pretty obscure topic but also very interesting
how about this one ps i somehow didnt find this picture when i wrote my review
until i saw photos of this set i wasnt convinced i wanted it now after seeing all the combinations ab and tumbler tires i am definitely buying two copies i need orange parts and black treads anyway the only problem i have with this is that its going to encourage me to buy many copies of the drag racer just to get enough wheels to play with
why are all these vehicles orange
richard dower on 15 december 2015  0203 pm said why are all these vehicles orange they prove hard to lose in the snow
jimanyonei built this set a few days ago i dont like the way the crane arm section has no knob to turn the mini turntable you see the 20 tooth gearthere is a pinhole located next to thisi would like to add something here to make it easier to turn the winch section
i have the 42038 nice set but i found the tipping of the bed clumsy it was a pleasure to build and i do like the build with the tumble wheels
review  42001  mini offroader introduction technic mini models are sometimes regarded as models not worth buying i dont agree with this opinion whether its a special part or innovative building technique almost every mini model has something that makes the set worthwhile this time i will be reviewing the 42001 mini offroader this model is not a smaller version of an existing model so theres no real comparison with a bigger brother or sister if you will nor does the model resemble a real life brand or vehicle so it is what it is a mini offroader note all images can be clicked for hires versions set information number 42001 title mini offroader theme technic released 2013 part count 100 box weight 165 gr box dimensions 155 x 140 x 42 cm set price msrp 999 eur de  799 gbp  1299 usd price per part de 0100 eur  uk 0080 gbp  usa 0130 usd links brickset bricklink the box the box measures 155 x 140 x 42 cm which is obviously not very big the weight of the box is approximately 165 grams frontside the front of the box shows a though four wheel drive offroader challenging a fierce rocky mountain trailnow does it what the box actually shows is mini offroader challenging a small foam rock formation much like rocks used in star trek the original series yet smaller the box also states that this model is for the age of 7 till 14 more importantly the 2models in1 logo is clearly visible which means this set can be used to build two different models backside the backside shows a picture of the alternate model and a smaller version of the original model the conversion arrow and the 2in1 are printed to clarify that the main model can be converted into a secondary model sides one of the sides shows the 2in1 logo and a picture of the main model another side shows a picture of one of the wheels in actual size and again a picture of the main model contents of the box the box contains 2 booklets 2 bags 4 tires booklets this set contains two booklets which is not very common for a set this size both models share the same chassis which is why the build has been divided over two booklets one for the chassis 8 pages with 10 steps and one for the bodywork 34 pages with 23 steps for the main model and 20 steps for the alternate model bags the box contains only 2 bags which is to be expected from a set consisting of 100 parts one of the bags is filled with liftarms panels rims and two elastic bands the other bags contains all the other parts like pins axles connectors etc opening the bags results in the following collection of parts with the exception of the tires no abundant number parts that will add real value to your collection nevertheless there are some interesting orange parts and elastic bands tires the tires are provided seperately ie not contained in the bags from the picture you can see that these tires have a front and a back side so you should pay attention when fitting them to the rims which have two different sides as well highlighted parts this section describes the unique andor highlighted parts very small smooth technic panel 21 and 22 these two small technic were new at the time of release and this set was only one of two sets containing them in orange the other set is the 42007  moto cross bike at the moment of writing theres a third set containing these parts the black champion racer side a side b small rubber band i was under the impression that these white rubber bands werent that common but it seems that these bands are as common as dirt but hey you cant have enough rubber bands thin liftarm 1x5 with axle holes like the panels these liftarms were also new at the time of release looking at the the frequent usage in other sets this part has proven to be a most useful mammal thin liftarm 1x3 not a very rare piece per se but if you are not into bionicle this liftarm part can be hard to find your other option would be to buy the 9390  mini tow truck or the 8305  dual bikes from a while ago 2000 long pin with center pin hole this relatively new kid on the block is currently used in many technic and nontechnic sets and has well proven its worth axle pin connector hub with 2 axles like the previous part this newish part is also quite helpful in certain situations part list heres the complete list for all 100 parts building experience the build starts with the chassis of the offroader after connecting some liftarms two elastic bands one on each side are attached to the towball pins this is all there is to the suspension plain and simple the two elastic bands contract the lshaped liftarms which results in the long ends swiveling downwards the video below demonstrates the suspension the simplicity doesnt do it justice because it works like a charm the suspension is very smooth with the right amount of stretch and resistance this great working suspension adds a lot of value to this set to quote john hurt in the movie contact why build one when you can have two at twice the price i have purchased two sets so we can simultaneously see both models and make a proper comparison below you can see two identical chassis which will be used for both versions of the build at this stage we have arrived at the end of the first booklet which only took about ten minutes not surprising since the first booklet only has 10 building steps progressing to the second booklet you need to choose between building the main and alternative model thats a choice i dont need to make for this review so lets start with the main model main model when building the bodywork theres a rather peculiar building technique which you wouldnt expect in an official lego set the axle and pin connector hub with 2 axles only protrudes halfway into the double bent liftarm the thin 1x4 liftarm which is added in one of the following steps makes sure the hubs stay perfectly in place but i was still surprised to see this technique the finished bodywork for the main model looks likeuhhwelli dont know exactly it doesnt bear any resemblance to a real life model which makes it hard to judge one things for sure its not the best looking technic mini model the bodywork can be attached to the chassis by using a 7l axle and two bushes one on each side of the chassis alternate model unfortunately the alternate model doesnt look much better than the main model its even a stud less wide while you would like to see slightly more body matching the size of the tires and chassis attached to the chassis the body is even more out of proportion its not really ugly and the color scheme is great obviously this goes for the main model as well but the body simply doesnt match the chassis i can only imagine that this model is supposed to have a chibi look much like the microfighter star wars models comparison the following section shows a selection of images from different angles to compare the main and secondary model the main model has a bit more volume while the alternate model has a more sporty look front view the main model has headlights which are attached at a higher point while the alternate model has headlights which are placed more closely next to each other rear view a slightly different setup in both models where the main model again has higher placed rear lights side view the side view shows that the panels are used differently in both models the main models uses them as doors while the alternate model uses them as engine cover bonnet top view the top view reveals that the main model might have room for a minifig parts left the left image shows the parts which are left after building the main model while the second image shows the parts left after building the alternate model as you can see the main model uses slightly more parts than the alternate model features besides the awesome suspension which we already have discussed there arent a lot of features in this set theres actually a single feature which is only present in the main modelopening doors wow impressive well maybe we cant expect too much functionality in such a small model summary the offroader is a fun model which is fairly easy to build the suspension is simple yet very effective the model could do better in the design department but the suspension offers great playability and that is what this set is all about the orange parts are not very common so they are an added bonus all things considered this set is definitely worth the few bucks you need to spend on it pros great suspension fun to play with some semi rare orange parts great color scheme cons no resemblence to an actual offroader not the best looking model score below are my scores based on different categories 6 design not the best looking technic model 7 building experience the suspension makes it fun to build 7 features the suspension makes up for the lack of functionality 8 playability the model has carswooshability 7 parts some interesting orange parts 8 value for money great present for the younger builders 71 elastic hope you enjoyed it thanks for reading and please rate this set at the top of this topic
looks like you are late 2 years nice set that you can play on your working place while small pauses this set is very cool especially when you can 42001 chassis  imagination  httpwwwbricksafeesrm8tlcfj40 edited by rm8 14 december 2015  1117 am
rm8 on 14 december 2015  1126 am said dont worry we love your hq photo skills so you can post everything you want  well love that anyways hehe ill remember that thanks
i dont like appearance of this offroader at all but ive got it as gift so its in my technic collection now when i built it i was very surprised how cool suspension it has and how much playability it features ive also tried to build some alternative model out of it but without success anyway thank you jim for great review edited by tomik 14 december 2015  0545 pm
youve done a good job of this review mr imperialscouts but two things 1 background far too bright and the set is far too dark easily rectified with brightness  contrast adjustment 2 no poll to rate the set out of 5 nonetheless this should be frontpaged on classicpiratescom
sigh i think i got this for a birthday back in the day my parents were so awesome  tc
the poll doesnt allow you to select 2 from 15 it instead says 1 3 3 4 5 but besides that your review i give it a 5 because 1 shows the set in all angles 2 shows the characters 3 comment on the little creature comforts of the set 4 added a comic playability 5 showed true enthusiasm y wub
the poll is for the set not the review d  but thank you anyway and it appears mister phes made the mistake p 
its not too expansive and you get some nice pieces like that jail the damaged yellow corner and a shako of course wub for this il give it a 4 very nive review imperial scouts keep it up y edited by captain green hair 20 october 2007  1239 pm
nice review funny little story and a 4 from me a useful little set indeed sweet
how much was it again for the price it looks really solid if u add the prison to the back it looks real good
thank you very much for the review theforce the new police station looks great i really like its lovely interior  amazing by the way i have a question are there any beds tables orand seats for the prisoners in their cells
awesome these maquettes are really cool thanks for the review y peace
beautifulim really trying to resist these any word on whos next after boba fett a c3por2d2 pair would probably push me over the edge
thanks to this information its interesting for me 
a wonderful set and perhaps as close to classic space as possible y also theres a great amount of very useful and interesting parts too like these round stabilizer parts with clip  theres a complete different feeling with this new sets compared to the first mm ones 8 beside the a little more realistic aspects of it with the more enclosed cockpit nearly with some controls   its the overall more solid feeling i guess the other sets look pretty neat and fashionable at the surface but their internal structure is much more hollow and useless with some studless technic beams and such stuff very shining but hard and boring to mod just aimed for maximal cool looking box art and the rest went down for saving costs beside that already pretty good 7692 dropship that is the only thing i dont get with that is why the minirobots a onearmed one ach pirates on mars i suppose xd
that head might have been from rock raiders lovely set and a good review jifel
ah thanks so much again mr m this set looks great i probably wont get this though i hat mm as far as it goes i agree with xwingyoda on this one does the minibots wheels move edited by vbbn 26 november 2007  1034 pm
exobuilder59 on nov 26 2007 0554 pm said excuse me a mass of technic parts wow you better lock your doors tonight uh oh dont get me wrong i like the set but the worlds gone crazy when we need technic parts for the little bike 
piranha on nov 26 2007 0713 pm said jelly jetpack   come on you have to admit that a jelly with a jetpack is funny pathetically so any way i might make a vig of this involving a brick wall and plenty of transgreen peices xd
wub thanks for another great review sweet i am also glad that it is a very different alien fighter design as i already have three varients of the old type the fighter transforms better than i thought it would i was expecting just the wings i should be buying this set as well mr mandalorian on nov 26 2007 0345 pm said without antigrav support it would fall forward on its nose each time it transformed well since antigrav doesnt exist and will never exist there has to be another option looking at it in tank mode it does have a vague aerofoil shape so i think it should be able to work as a lifting body all it needs to do then is move fast enough to start taking off and then it can extend the wings 8
great review sinner on nov 26 2007 1222 am said well since antigrav doesnt exist and will never exist there has to be another option looking at it in tank mode it does have a vague aerofoil shape so i think it should be able to work as a lifting body all it needs to do then is move fast enough to start taking off and then it can extend the wings 8 this is clearly tlg officially supporting antigrav technologyi mean think about it how can it support itself without antigrav while transforming the answer it cant sweet p
thanks for a very thorough review i might think about getting this i really like the mini alien fighter and the transformation idea is always a welcome one both modes look pretty good despite the some of the odd coloured bricks which id mod out you know what it reminds me of some of the futuristic designs in the gerry anderson series
friggin sweet thank you mr mandy for the reveiw of this sweet ship y wub
hmmm i doubt ill be getting this set good review though
thanks guys lasse d on nov 26 2007 0854 am said wow this is actually quite a neat set it is definitively my favorite in the line after the big drilling unit begingeek im not sure it would nose dive when transforming from tank mode i guess it would pick up speed and transform quickly since it doesnt seem to have any downwards pointing thrusters endgeek i dont think that tank is very fast maybe if it drove off of a crater commander andrew of 501 st on nov 26 2007 0903 am said friggin sweet thank you mr mandy for the reveiw of this sweet ship y wub i see you know imperialshadows  
and another tks and congrats mm on that review  like the oher post i think that this set is a wastre of time and money and shelfspace its such a ripp off from that ugly alfa team crapjet i do not like the design of the jet itself the small flags as front is so lame  and i dont like those orange wheels as engines  furthermore i dont like the rover mode either  the only cool thing about it is the special martian jet which they should ahve sold separatly p at least some interesting parts but that far from saving that set imo  money saved on once again p yoda
great review mr m y i wub those green flames and the design of the ship is pretty good thanks for the review and great pictures they are clear big and describe the set just the way they should
8115 dark panther review check out my review of this great new exoforce set comic and rating will be up shortly and hopefully more reviews too 
yes finally hinckley youre the best is there a chance i can ever be in one of your ever so loved comics i just read it and so far so good in the 08 ef line looking forward to the rest of the review edited by exobuilder59 27 november 2007  0404 am
awesome i cant wait to get my hands on this one
great review y i am sure to get this set for parts now his legs dont look very poseable  thanks hinck vbbn
hinckley on nov 27 2007 0747 pm said thanks everyone im glad you are enjoying the review im working on the 8118 right now and will have comics up for both starting tonight the instructions do not have a comic but i always write one for my reviews featuring my sigfig or other fabuland creatures interacting with the new set translation interactingwhacking fabuland creatures sinner copmike and yoda usually xd 
thats a very interesting set and with all that purple a must buy i decided recently that i am going to resist buying lego unless its on sale next year but i have so little purple 8 i love the little robot p thanks for the photos hinckley and i look forward to the comic sweet as sir dillon said some of the links appear dead but i suspect it is a server error  
thanks for pointing that out guys it should work now 
8118 hybrid rescue tank review enjoy guys i am working on more maybe well have the 8112 battle arachnoid next the comics will be around eventually sorry for all the delays and the teasing i appreciate your patience
from the lego store in chicago if i recall his post properly my goodness hink youre going to pull an allnighter for reviews at this rate oh well its kinda worth it right p
another great review hink looks like a great set quote the cockpit isnt sealed and is actually aggravatingly unrealistic as it leaves the drivers chest vulnerable to enemy fire actually the cockpit lacks any controls as seen here where it looks like keiken is simply pounding a counter demanding food d gimme food or else my friend up there willl shoot your punk  into mars well i guess that explains why there are no robot snipers in ef if there were well wouldnt be much of a story would there xd
thanks for this other great review hinckley y  you sure you dont work as one of tlcs prs xd  everytime i see one of your reviews i want to buy the set and that is sweet to me but bad for my money 8 luxorv
thanks for that good review hinckley y a really interesting set and a turning point for lego minirobots instead of shooting crap pretty cool i hope the kidsll like it too for the design i love that asymmetrical look of the front part and the sleek guns of the flyer its smart that the gatling gun moves along with the tank too the set idea with two vehicles in ones not new but very play able and the treadsbig wheel designs cool i dont like the use of studless technic beams but well they do their job i guess and keikens cockpit should be easy to improve
asuka on nov 28 2007 0241 pm said for the design i love that asymmetrical look of the front part and the sleek guns of the flyer the asymmetry reminds me of the wookie vehicles in starwars battlegrounds y and i see they changed back to the first color schemes for minifig suits which i think where better than the dark suits of 2007 except for hikarus wub  luxorv
thank you for the review hinckley  already waiting for the comic xd
some of you might know that im not a big fan of exoforce but this set is an exception this looks like a futurist tank my kids would love this if i should have any d as always very professional review hinckley
crap  now i have to spend all my money on this wub wub and whats the code oh well awesome set and judt curios didnt the reviewers used to be bianca and gavin jifel
8112 battle arachnoid review ive opted to do another set review instead of getting the comics up i dont want anyone to beat me to the reviews so thanks for your patience and enjoy the review the comics will be up in due time thanks 
thanks for this new review hinckley wub for me it was love at fistr sight with this little set p its simple but nice and way better than shadow crawler for a spiderlike mech y you sure will be very busy these days and your characters will get breakdown before they finish filming all the comics xd luxorv
awesome thanks hinckley i was not planning to get this set but now it look as if i will have too i still cannot afford it anyway 
hinckley on dec 6 2007 0456 am said honckly wow dude  well at least you got the c and the k of course the e is missing its all right though eight letter words can be challenging p thats always the case for me although i have the assault tiger and will start on it next on the box it looks like it is wearing huge bell bottoms d i want to get the chameleon hunter i really like the look of it and forgot to pick it up guess ill have to go back to tru  cross your fingers that i find more indy sets xd ill just stick to calling you hink y less letters d 
zero1312 on dec 5 2007 0527 pm said wow nice review y but i have a question where can i find these ork sets everyone is refering to because of these swords in the rotors  are you talking about the dwarves mine sweet
thanks for the review hinckley i like the set it looks good and all those ork swords wub
zero1312 on dec 6 2007 0948 am said yes when in 2008 do these sets come to germany  um i do not know i live in the usa sweet
here is my review of the set 6265 sabre island overview sabre island was release in 1990 an it contained 92 pieces and its retail price was 1550 it comes with 3 imperial blue coats and a nice outpost for them the pictures  full review anyway you can see here a picture of the box the model shown on the box differs from the actual model slightly and the back of the box which shows some nice alternative models from the pieces provided a close up of two or three of the alternative models and now for the minifigs i prefer the red coats over the blue coats but these minifigs are nice and for the number of pieces one gets a fair amount of them the set itself makes a nice small outpost it comes complete with a palm tree a cannon with ammo on a turntable a small tower a nice large imperial flag and a little red row boat here is a shot from ground level showing the cannon and blue coat patrolling the out post the rowing boat was a nice touch and it comes with a small flag too no pirates will avoid the wrath of myself and my mighty island the top of the tower is rather plain and simple which in some ways is good as it keeps the whole set detailed yet not crowded but i feel a little something should of been added to the top though the back is lacking any type of walls so one can play with the minifigs inside yet their are also no stairs or any other ways for the blue coats to climb up their tower either the rag tag pirates attack sabre island but never fear the lord of pies is here me throwing a pie at captain ironhook from another angle overall i think this is a very good if somewhat simple set and makes a great cheap imperial set comments thoughts and opinions are welcome and sorry about the darkness in some photos i have not had time to take photographs when it is till light recently for when i return home it is dark   edit fixed thank you edited by phred 12 april 2015  0514 am
you even have the box splendid review i also own this one and i think theres nothing to complain about more figs would be appreciated though a sneaky pirate perhaps 4 out of 5
i remember buying this set and thinking what an amazing job lego had done it was my first pirate set and i still have it built sweet
its not a bad thing to vote sabre island 1 if someone feels that its genuinely worth 1 but twould be interesting to know why
i give it a 4 only because there are no pirates i aways loved this set nice little fortifaction lots of details i only wish i could have worked it in aberbrick
mister phes on dec 8 2007 0818 pm said remind us what aberbrick is mr radar or better still give us a link and give your moc plug xd ah you mean aberbrick im going to update too
lord of pies on dec 6 2007 0824 pm said but never fear the lord of pies is here me throwing a pie at captain ironhook from another angle lol somehow i cannot add a clickeble smilie i never had this set when i was young but i bought it some years ago second hand it is a nice in between piratesoldierset and i like it very much
athos on jan 2 2008 1059 pm said perhaps a catapult steve hmm maybe although a catapult doesnt really fit in to that time period all that well
did i hear right a catapult in the 16th17th18th and 19th centuries wacko perhaps its an appeal for lord of pies to have his own personal catapult to pelt the pirates with whipped cream pastries should they try to sail past but this begs the question why waste perfectly good pie on those scurvy mangy muttfaced villians
thats a beautiful upgrade of a classic set the new interior is great wub do you still have the tow truck
a wonderful work and a neat idea with that propane tank refilling station y very detailed and very charming indeed 
nice station phred love those fluorescent lights wub butstart dodging cannonballs now boom harr p
big pete on dec 15 2007 0530 pm said my camera battery just died so its recharging ill do the review and add pics later  nooo 
thank you big pete wub this set looks very good it looks well built and the statues are nice the ark looks great and the star wars hieroglyphic is classic d just a two things is marions face double sided it looks like a calm face on the back of the box where do the snakes come out and about the stickers have you tried putting them on the long bricks above the breakable walls once again thanks very much wub y
tinypiesrus on dec 15 2007 0539 pm said thank you big pete wub this set looks very good it looks well built and the statues are nice the ark looks great and the star wars hieroglyphic is classic d just a two things is marions face double sided it looks like a calm face on the back of the box where do the snakes come out and about the stickers have you tried putting them on the long bricks above the breakable walls once again thanks very much wub y marions face is double sided and the snacks come out right under the sticker that has r2d2 and c3po with the egyptian
tinypiesrus on dec 16 2007 1239 am said is marions face double sided it looks like a calm face on the back of the box yes it is  i never noticed until i just checked  will post a pic of the alternate face when my camera battery is charged  quote where do the snakes come out they sit on a pivoting plate behind the star wars heiroglyphics you press down on a brick at the back and the plate drops and they fall out from underneath quote and about the stickers have you tried putting them on the long bricks above the breakable walls well yes  that was where i guessed they were meant to go  but really  there is no mention of this in the instructions edited by big pete 16 december 2007  1249 am
outstanding i cant believe you found one id bet hinckley would be surprised about this
marions other face
thank you for the great review looks like a very nice set so many snakes
thanks for that cool review big pete y a very interesting set with a great playability and that sw stickers just hilarious snake shower on d
iamded on dec 15 2007 0651 pm said thanks for the review it looks awesome and 10 snakes is that box the ark though thanks again peace yes the ark is the box in the center
hollisbrick on dec 15 2007 1130 pm said could you take a photo of the ark thanks oh and the inside too pleese sweet the ark doesnt have an inside its just one brick built box
oky wan kenobi on dec 16 2007 0846 am said lol those star wars heiroglyphics are awesome were those in the movie or is this just a joke by the lego designers that would be the first time tlc showed any kind of reference humor the rest of the set is great too even the skeleton and the stickers yes thats right i actually like those things i like the new skellies because of their posability im a big supporter  user of stopmotion and i think theres nothing wrong with stickers i mean seriously why does everybody hate stickers so much  sure they are a pain in the megablocks to put on and sure they come off after a while and are never usable again but hey you dont have to put them on even better you can save them like i do and use them for your mocs could somebody tell me please im just curious however as i said nice set i might even get one gotta love that marion with the carot torch xd and that arc is neat too by the way are all parts on it golden some more pics on it would be nice as soon as your camera is recharged  thanks peace out as far as i know those insignias on the arc are in the movie too but i dont remember if they actually were on the arc or somewhere else there are a lot of star wars references in all the indiana jones movies looking at your name you might find it funny to know that the asian club of lao che in temple of doom is called club obiwan the plane in the first indy has the callsign cpo which i just found out the other day 
thanks for the review this is certainly bigger than i expected cant wait to see your other pics y
indy565 on dec 16 2007 1250 am said awesome i want it soo bad  how much was it 4499 as it says in the first line of the review  edited by big pete 16 december 2007  0104 am

great reviewthis set has lots of play value i see too bad about the hovito though  one request could we get some close up pics of the idol thanks very much
big pete on dec 15 2007 0604 pm said 4499 as it says in the first line of the review  yes but i dont live in the uk any idea how much it might cost in the us
thank you for another excellent review big pete y y
thank you very much for another great review big pete wub this is a good set but i probably wont be able to afford it with all of the rest of the lego coming out in 2008  oh i watched this scene a few weeks ago and the pilot is fishing while waiting for indy to escape thanks again you lucky lucky man p
indy565 on dec 16 2007 0405 am said yes but i dont live in the uk any idea how much it might cost in the us 5999 is the us price already up for presale on amazon
tinypiesrus on dec 16 2007 0441 am said oh i watched this scene a few weeks ago and the pilot is fishing while waiting for indy to escape the enigma that is badger on dec 16 2007 0557 am said this is correct and in pure serial film fashion the pilot is has just hooked a big one just as jones starts yelling for him to get ready to leave  ahhh  thanks  now i want to go out and buy the trilogy on dvd its cheap too  under 20 for all three at the moment
this set is pretty nice i love the idol id probably buy the set just for that d lol is it just me or in the earlier concepts of this set we saw a native on the box i wonder why they removed it  wacko
tks so much big pete for thisd awsome review of yet another fantastic indy sets  its clearly one of the best lines of all times with sw 8 that idol is superb and i love all the details of that set loads of cool defense mechanisms sweet vegetation and yeay another black carrot torch p and those mfs are really nice  i am so happy to see lego go dark tan wub now i clearly cant wait to enjoy building this set  fertility idol on  yoda
looks like a nice set i like the tiny turbos and have most of the older individual cars but i am put off by the ever increasing price of the large sets with lots of extra parts that im not really interested in i wish these were available as individual vehicles as well
thanks for the review its really cool that the petrol station is minifig scaled i wasnt expecting that d peace
thanks for the review this looks like a nice set to have multiple copies of i think that you may have mistyped the setnumber as i was expecting this cute car when i read the title i wondered how you could see a cementmixer in this set p
heres all the parts in assorted baggies and the horribly messed up instructions four astronauts and four aliens with an extra gold visor yay not bad the base of the horribly unstable alien craft the wings move up and down aswell as back and forth the purpose i know not next we build the nerf section of the base basically technic and the rest of the tube connectors heres the farthest i got the little missle to go its fairly dissapointing good thing i didnt expect much from this portion of the set heres the start of the command base more of the main structure will be adding lots of things to all the little beams heres a storage container and the surprisingly not flimsy radar on this side we see the alien elevator it uses a horribly long technic rod i have not seen one of this proportion its like a foot and a half long more of the inner base where all the little tubes shall go all the connected tubes and such i also encountered a problem in the instructions it says for the end of the elevator prong to be touching the tube connector where it is shown here but mine has a 1x space inbetween no matter heres the completed base  my knee again onto the spaceship the bulk of it is just technic supporting beams with some large slope peices covering it all up more on that later the white coverup the middle section lifts up to store the overly large jetpack as you see the storage containers take up most the bulk in the back and you can see the jetpack on the ground aswell as the trigger hand hold thing that allows you to swoosh it look in the back lego greebles despite the large cockpit it only holds one person laying down the wings are really the saving grace  double layered with a nice two toned effect kitty nudged me this picture so its abit blurry my apologies  extra peices and or peices i have no idea where the hell they go p overall the set is quite fun i must admit full price i probably would not go for it but i got it for just under 70 dollars for that price i can confidently say its quite worth it many useful peices nice figures other than the aliens and the tube things are quite fun to boot even though i liked the life on mars system more which i also have none the less its very fun to make them shoot around alright so its not much of a command base either and it looks abit bare but its still fun even if you ignore the nerf section overall i give it a hardy 35 out of 5 the openness and epic fail of a missile launcher are hard to get by but overall its a dandy set d merry christmas wub
i just want the shipjust the ship
thanks for the photos and review brickmaster im hoping to find this on sale as well no luck so far i love the white ship and i think the base would be amusing but ultimately hard to reuse incidentally that long axel is common in recent technic sets but i think it was orignally made for the hockey sets d
micvash on dec 25 2007 0558 pm said lol polizei is german for police oh  caseyref on dec 25 2007 0602 pm said i quite like it but i feel that my lego city is getting overrun with helicopters and planes also i have got the helicopter from the 7237 police station set but it is not as good as this plus iam sooooo dissapointed that the x stickers x are blue instead of black and green as they will not fit with the sets i have already got d nice review thanks your welcome

pspguy on dec 27 2007 0308 am said what if your asking how they are but together you snap the window piece into the holder errr no as brikbitz said on his site in the 7732 postal plane review quote you can see the traditional airplane window piece but the bad news is theyve changed the window pane its the new flat piece used in 4996 beach house it just doesnt work as well without the original bevelled edge it doesnt seal the window and there is small noticable gap around the edge not a major problem but it might get a bit draughty inside and certainly no high altitude flying i was wondering if it is the old or new type darthlegois619 on dec 27 2007 0820 am said nice review y i will get 2 of these at the least especialy since theyre going to be 15 aud wub  how did you find out the price if you are right then this is a must buy wub

great review sandra thanks for taking the time i love the theatre and the town hall and the married couple is just a cute little extra wub this looks fantastic not only for the model but for parts as well
i see the service station has a full arry of tools oxyfuel torch and other goodies not a bad set still very pricey 
thanks for the review legocastlegirl  excellent work y i agree with you the best part seems to be the movietheater thats perfect because i just love to watch movies in the theater so far this year ive seen 46 pictures and had some popcorn to  this is a mustgetset town on copmike
sorry for answering so late but i was very busy thanks guys for your comments y tedbeard on dec 28 2007 0808 pm said sorry to disagree with anyone however but this was not a great review i appreciate the effort sandra made but a great review would include more details such as what are stickers and what are printed pieces a great review points out flaws or limitations as well as what works or is really neat a great review would have analyzed the price per piece and compared that to other setsthemes one might look at the recent reviews of the indy sets or the new spongebob sets as examples of really good reviews the pictures are good but a great review above all should provide the reader with some new information perhaps even answer questions posed in the prerelease discussion thread i learned nothing new about the set from this review that said it was a good review for someone who had not seen the prerelease discussion and she did a good job of showing said person what they could expect in the set its good that you told me your opinion about my review it was my third review i made and i have to say that i made this review not for analyses just only to show the eb members some nice pics and to tell them my opinion lego is fun for me i dont like to analyse the pieces bricks prices colours i just want to build something thats why im at eurobricks and not at an other big legocommunity in germany lego is fun fun fun and everybody knows that lego is a expensive hobbie so why should i write it again and again julencin2000 on dec 29 2007 1007 pm said very good review thanks sticker sheet pic with 1 megapixel film posters thanks for the link julencin  xwingyoda on dec 29 2007 1025 pm said ps  tedbeard  do tone it down youg man  if youre not happy with sandras work do provide one yourself instead of bitching on how you view a review and on how sandras post is veryt far from one according to you  yoda thanks yoda sweet copmike on dec 30 2007 0130 pm said thanks for the review legocastlegirl  excellent work y i agree with you the best part seems to be the movietheater thats perfect because i just love to watch movies in the theater so far this year ive seen 46 pictures and had some popcorn to  this is a mustgetset town on copmike thanks copmike  so it will be a good year 2008 for you therell be a lot of good movies at cinema next year i cant wait for national treasure book of secrets the second movie after national treasure with nicolas cage

this is a great set lots of detail and that service station and gaspumps do it for me sweet thanks for the review legocastlegirl y
happy new year everyone i went to my local walmart looking for an exclusive bionicle set yesterday but was amazed to find everything there sw bionicle ef indie the works i nabbed the jsf and the rogue shadow and scampered home to take pics with my new camera wub the box the same as the other 07 boxes nothing new the back shows the various features with pop out r2  luckily the intruction booklet and the dss were intact not folded like the last mm set i got  the dss not too bad but printed parts would have been great the figs anakin is amazing imo wub fits the cw anie great i noticed on the sh reviews the kiddies were saying how ugly he looked  they need to see the cw cartoon for the sake of my health i should probably stop reading those d the build i wont go too indepth on the build since vader posted a very indepth review here the start of the build the body of the fighter starts out long and skinny the jsfs landing gear allows it to sit comfortably without getting in the way while swooshing r2d2s launching device r2 in position when launched he often gets stuck if you dont press the button hard enough  looks like r2 needs to lay off whatever it is robots eat so far the flag stickered its a big sucker sticker completed i forgot to add the nose stickers before i took the pic warning the nose cone sticker is actually two stickers i thought it was one peeled of one of the stickers and put it on the middle of the two 1x8 plates and didnt notice the other sticker wacko various completed shots i think this was a beautiful little set r2s launching unit and the flick missiles are annoying but easily fixed i plan to add proper cannons in place of the flick missiles anakin is a great minifig but he doesnt look so well standing next to my other figs the brickshelf gallery when public will
thanks for the reveiw on this great set i actually just came home from tru with this maybe 12 hour ago funny love the new hair sculpt wub
this is a brilliant review of a brilliant set sweet thanks a lot i know this may be a bit much to ask but could take some pics of the whole instruction booklet please if you can thanks a bunch but if not do know of a place where i could find the instructions
than kyou for the review i dont know if i buy this set now i know theres also a anakin in the atte with a new jedi but who knows
wow im surprised no one had done this already first off this is a truly lovely set that many people should own even though its sold out on the sh   now lets start off with an overview note i was missing a few of the pieces the rabbit the trike when i toke the pics the figs and a cat the engine i really love this thing its a beautiful 060 steam engine with a tender this is probably the most detailed steam engine lego has given us i loved it so much i made a nonholiday version for my town the flat cars i like these but they seem a bit simple their cargo is good for christmas or a birthday party the passenger car it resembles the green passenger car we got a while back but i like the interior in this one a bit better the caboose a simple caboose like the one from 2001 the sad thing about it is thats there is no interior and its hard to take the roof off overall i like this set but it is kind of hard to use during the non winter months the price is kind of good but with that price it should have came with the motor i give it a 910 happy new year edited by agentrick57 04 january 2008  1200 am
exobuilder on jan 4 2008 1046 am said i will gladly have your rabbit wub xd nah ill probably use it as a wererabbit
these jokes are killing me xd
thanks for the good review i wish i had bought one when it was going for only 2499 on lsah instead of the usual price of 50
i got that set from my grandma on xmas she ordered it early i really like the presesnts and that blue thing 3 wheeler here in america its 100 ouch i like the rabbit whats with the rats in the trees and the cargo train nice review edited by vbbn 04 january 2008  0131 pm
okie guys and gals here s time for some droid exploration with my review of set 7670 as a general statement i have to say its really a neat set that is not that expensive for what it holds 1 box art like always i will start with pics of the box art btw notice anything guys  no bloody crappy dss yes finally a set without stickers and that feels great d 2 the mfs nothing really spectacular there the only novelty lies within the inclusion of the new commander yellow torso bd apart from that there are 2 bds and unfortunately yet another sbd i like those but i have a huge amount of them and i would rather had something different you have 3 short blasters and a couple of extra parts 3 the spider droid i think its a pretty cool little buggar its a rather simple yet classic construction i think it has sweet parts such as the bd body in dark bley it really has a spider feel unlike the previous ep3 one 4 the hailfire droid this baby represents the pice de resistance of this set i truly love it  sure its a bit under scale but i dont really mind that its conception is superb even if i totally dislike assembling those technic treads especially 80 of those small things the ellipse of the treads is well balanced and that trans disc is a brilliant idea the great thing is those new flick fire missiles they dont fall unlike the other ones and they do look good on this baby also you can put the wheels together and the missiles to gain some shelf space easy storage on d  in conclusion those druids re really sweet and are perfect target practice for the upcoming rgs hehe  i hope you enjoyed that review and do not hesitate to comment and ask pic requests if any  yoda
xwingyoda on jan 5 2008 0424 pm said in conclusion those druids re really sweet and are perfect target practice for the upcoming rgs hehe  a druid battle pack would also be a nice idea for the castle sets thank for the nice review with many pictures may i ask what you paid for this my first and second idea was that 25 euro was a bit to much for this 
thanks for the reveiw ive got one of these and an atap in the mail hopefully arriveing tomorrow  edited by legoman 06 january 2008  1215 am
aaylasecura on jan 5 2008 1135 pm said yeah finally yoda got his sw d indeed d and i can tell you aayla it was about freaking time p agentrick57 on jan 6 2008 1214 am said you thought the bat tank was bad the tie crawler has 81 for each of the sides sing and dont get me started on the sand crawler x i know i still have nightmares thinking of that d thats why i didnt even mention that before  unknownartist on jan 6 2008 0818 am said next time try to do it with action it is rare that people do that they only do it with the set and not further  next timetry to ask it in a different way yoda
great review mate as usual for me the highlight of this set has to be the new spider droid even though its made up of some strange parts it really appeals to me i would love a few of those babys the hellfire droid is also well put together even if it is a little small but hey it looks fun i really like the look of this set but the price tag really puts me off why oh why did lego price it so high 
ah i finally got the 2 city sets i really wanted  i am so happy that lego went postal on us p  since they are rather small i shall do a mix review of these 2 sweet sweet sets 1 mail van 7731 like always ill start with shots of the box art and bloody dss now here are the extras of that set i really love the new torso of the postal worker my huge grip lies on the mail box that mail logo is a freaking sticker  for that part i was so expecting a printed part that is really really bad  apart from that the design is pretty cool the van is quite simple but i think its pretty cute i love the fact that the rear is a window 2 air mail 7732 like always ill start with shots of the box art and bloody dss the extras are ok another great postal worker you also have yet another red trolley with a package that is a bloody sticker yet again  g tlc should have more printed parts  that plane for me is a classic thing of beauty  really is consistent with the fantastic planes of the 80s thats the kind of lanes tlc should produce instead of those huge playmo planes actually i am happy that tlc released that one  for once its not a bloody airline exclusive promo set  here are general pics i love the engines of the plane simple yet superb also the top hatch opens to insert mail and packages the front control panel is a printed part  i love the classic double train windows and here is a poc of the undeneath of the set in conclusion i truly love these small sets they are the perfect size 4 wide car yeay  and the colour pattern is amazing as well i hope you enjoyed that review and do not hesitate to comment and ask pic requests if any  yoda
thanks for the great review yoda  im definitely going to get that plane ive sadly only owned one of the many lego planes there is  thebrickster on jan 5 2008 1123 am said i havent spotted these in the us yet im looking forward to finding them overall the 2008 lineup is a excellent and its going to be difficult for me to decide which themessets to pursue theres a lot to choose from really where do you live
thanks for the review i was always going to get these two sets so you havent swayed me at all xd i reckon lego could enhance this subtheme by releasing a post motorbike with or without a sidecar and post office obviouly the office would be the hub of all the activity while the post bike would take care of the postal run this would free up the van to take or recieve bulk mail or parcels to or from the airport it could then also do the parcel deliveries around the city the office would also serve as the reciever for all the parcels the new goods truck might deliver just some thoughts thats all sweet
thanks for a nice review and few comments to sets nice airplane finally some reminiscence for lego city golden era for me years 19821992 everything is nice but two things are freezing a smile on my face first of all the ugly new hinge used for plane roof i have already 4032 and those new hinges are looking really terrible when compared fe with 6368 second one is new minifig i dont know what i expected but this torso design looks too simple and too cheap concerning new car  i appreciate fact that tlc makes after long long years again postal sets but i dont like those newstyle cars matchbox wheels and bad rate between drivers cockpit and cargo space are damping me from buying 6651 mail truck or 105 canada post truck were much better edited by kanalk1 06 january 2008  0733 pm
while the plane does look nice i dont particularly care for the van but the van does have some good parts which is the only reason i would by one yellow mud guards the new windshield and the small door on the rear
im glad to see the mail van has the doors that used to be on the older cargo containers i had given up on those older ones but now that theyre still out there i may invest in the older cargo system instead of the new 6wide ones both sets are good enough ill get both im hoping for a postal building too even though i have the smaller of the old post offices a nice big modern one would be great im not too hung up about the design of the plane ive got the neat old cargo plane with the tail that swings open one of the best plane sets for big packages the truck is goofy looking but if i get sick of looking at it i can rebuild it into a classic looking one great review by the way the pictures are some of the better one ive seen in a review recently
thanks yoda for the great reviews i love the airplane its really cute the van needed to grow on me though but you did the trick i dont like the wheels of the van they will need replacing and wouldnt everything have been better if they were completely red dr brick
hey everyone my first 2008 set is this one 5613 i thought id share a review of it sweet id like to say sorry about my photos they were taken quickly first we have the box it is the smallest lego box ive ever seen and actually looks cute wub it will be heavy competition with playmobils specials back of the box showing an action pose the contents of the little box with a very tiny instruction manual wub the manual unfolded notice that every part has its part number beside it  the back of the manual showing some fire sets and the other impulse sets the parts 30 in total the small set built the firefighter has a small fire to extinquish armed with an axe chainsaw other saw and foam psssh thing xd  five extra parts in a 30 part set we get an extra black hatchet yellow bar tap light bley 11 plate red 11 plate modified with fingers and 22 dark bley radar dish besides the plate ive never seen these as reserve parts but im not complaining xd here is a small alternate model i created with it a small bbq what hes hungry and he needs to put something on the bbq  xd overall you cant go wrong with these impulse sets i paid 289 euros for this little set so thats a great value sadly the only impulse avaible were these 3 city sets no police and the alien mars mission looking forward to the knight and magician as well as those indy sets tt
thanks for the review tanotrooper this is a nice little set with 2 axes wub  and some nice parts cool alternate model too xd tanotrooper on jan 6 2008 0907 am said 93 cm by 93 cm by 45 cm xd tt xo cute i cant wait to see these impulse sets in stores wub peace
nice set and review what i really like is that this set gives you a lot of ideas for your own houses mocs kimt
love this set now more than ever wub i knew i wanted it from the first leaked boxshots especially with my love of yellow buildings just ask hinckley   great review especially nice to see the closeup parts shots those new 2x2 white windows are very much like replacements for the classic 2x2 windows tlg stopped regularly making a while back so its great to see them the wheels are trolley wheels common in sets including stretchers and handcarts the holder for them is a fairly recent part i think i remember a couple coming in a little single minifig jet engine repair set i picked up in a sh order within the last year oh honey be sure to wrench that chicken before it burns wacko thanks for another excellent review of a set im even more excited about than before y
agentrick57 on jan 7 2008 0949 pm said i didnt know that the other models in this set came with interiors this changes everything keep in mind there is not a lot of interior just mainly what was shown in the last two photos of the review still it does make the models really nice
great review thank you i have this on order for my youngests birthday next month as our first venture into creator looking towards the town house thereafter and then perhaps town plan or the town house
thanks for this great review i love this awesome set the creator line never disappoints this is definitely a mustbuy for me just like the other creator houses batbrick something wacko
i got this set on tuesday on the sunshine coast i was on a holiday and since kmart were having a 15 off lego it was only 40 y  im modifying my summer house its pretty small so far ive put a small kitchentoiletfridge  freezer downstairs and up stairs i will try to fit a bed and computer also im going to attach a small garage for my minifigs car 8
my sister bought this last week im so proud  this is a great set not too big and it looks really nice will
hey yesterday i got around to mod my beachhouse too i bought two boxes so i could have enough material for an extra floor and then i also added a kitchen a vine in the backyard storage for the upper floor try to spot the humongous flatscreen tv httpwwwbrickshel96cimg2656jpg edited by takuto20 23 march 2008  0217 pm
very nice i have been debating on whether or not to buy itit would appear you made up my mind for me y

howly cow this is y y y for you for making a review so fast thank you so much hope it keeps a lot of people from buying  kanalk1 on jan 16 2008 0926 pm said when i saw the way how is this plane made i was strongly thinking to play money for nothing from dire straits as a music accordant with whole set d lol d  great comment kanalk1 on jan 16 2008 0926 pm said this is my first plane in this scale and for 99 the last one this will never be my first or last plane and that for 100 x 7723 crap plane off
review gets y y  ugly plane gets x thanks for the review
thanks for the review but its an utter pass for me on this one  i already have a huge juniorized plane from the airport set  one is enough for me 
thanks for the review sweet i am stunned at the lack of an interior not that it makes much difference as i wasnt likely to want this set anyway as i own the passenger plane from last year sorry to steal your image but i just had to post this p
thanks for the review unfortunately the pictures did not load for me i have to say having seen other images i do agree with your comments the plane is far to big and not enough details that sums it up for me
daoudbazaar on jan 17 2008 0521 pm said thks for this caustic review d ill wait for the parts on bricklink i think youre a bit unfair with this small oversized submarine  oups sorry i mean plane here are some advantages i tried to imagine  1 thats the first submarine with a plane nose 2 thats the first unprinted nose 3 thats the first shark that make me laugh and which has a plain white fin 4 and at last you should have notice that that the first submarine with a wing made of several plates it is said that this set has more than 200 parts hide and seek  xd you may have lost several bags im eager that people buy this set a lot  id like to buy a lot of these new white 4x4x2 curved slope for my mocs can you take a picture of the plane crashing in the sink  is it fire proof  i think that will be too easy this year to decide what is the crap of year  great comments rofl rofl rofl d d d concerning last sentence  i have seen or built hundreds of different sets issued since 1980 until now but this plane is really a hot candidate not only for crap of the year but for crap of the decade last two days i thought about the sense of this set and finally i was enlighted  i must call to my folks living in a small village i am pretty sure that they will be happy for a new house for their pullets edited by kanalk1 17 january 2008  0631 pm
brick miner on jan 18 2008 0501 am said d  great picture agreed d d wonderful review now ill never even consider getting this set not that i did before xd thanks for your insight peace
an excellent first time  review iamded y well atleast a first time redman review anyway i really enjoy redman i hope to see him pop up more often your pics are great now that you ditched the phone p  and youve shown the set from many different angles and perspectives thanks for this brilliant review you have certainly convinced me to get a few of these and then some xd redman on edit btw is it just me or does my new avatar make me seem a bit creepy 8 batbrick is back  edited by batbrick 18 january 2008  1239 pm
tinypiesrus on jan 18 2008 1147 pm said batbrick youve always been a bit creepy p xd or have i muhahahahahahahahahaha skull imperialshadows on jan 18 2008 1151 pm said are you sure its the avatar doing it 8 i dont know maybe it just me doing this muhahahjahahahaha skull  all the time could be anyway great review i think i will get 5 of these xd batbrick away 
thanks everyone for your positive feedback its really appreciated d youd be surprised how long that redman presents thing up the top took me to make xd so it appears people do like redman expect him to be reviewing the good wizard and battle arachnoid in near future i know those have already been reviewed but new zealand never gets sets first so ill just be reviewing the sets i get xd thefrisian on jan 19 2008 0444 am said nice review very detailed y as for the spare parts mine didnt come with any both dark grey 1x1 round plates are used on the weapons rack one for the armour one for the helmet and i only got one robot hand for holding weapons thats strange maybe im just lucky xd i also got 2 spare orange viking horn pieces in my battle arachnoid d peace
thanks agentrick actually redmans based on the wrestling costume version of spiderman as seen in this set sweet peace
well today i finally got my hands on set 7038 now since the moment i first saw pics of this set i knew it was for me so lets start with the new troll helmet and torso these are both great this troll really stands out as a leader when next to the usual trolls in the dwarf mining set ok so heres a few shots of the front of the set now one thing i really like about this set is the way that lego have placed the back wheels higher than the front this allows the set to really appear to being pulled here we have a shot at the missiles on the wagon these are better than some around i have to say if you look just behind the bottom missile you will see a simple firing device simply push it down and then let it go to see those missiles fire the troll flag is moved behind the missiles for firing one thing that does bother me about this set is the lack of anything on the rear ok its easy to fix with a little mocing so its not the end of the world but i would of liked something placed there now lets move on to the crownies wagon this is simple yet good for holding weapons as for the crown knights themselves well there the ones from the impulse sets which is great imo heres a few quick shots of the 2 larger trolls we have so far i prefer the sand green one what about you well thats the end for now requests for pics and comments are welcome overall i rate this set as a must for anyone whos a fantasy castle fan i know ill be getting more of this set as for the new wagon well its joined up with the other trolls i do hope the impules crownies i bought today can handle them oh and yes i did change the knights heads xd  fantasy war on vader
seems like a good set should i get it btw how did you get you hands on this
this is fantastic i love the new helmets for the goblins sweet ive always loved the chicken leg thing really screams lego to me at least how lego used to be  great little bit the goblins are awesome too and the sand green one should look good next to the tan onesgives a nice feeling of a real species in reality not all members of a species are identical its great seeing them in different colors great review xd
a troll driven by a turkey leg what a wonderful little detail d d thanks for the review vader very clever using a flag to hide that crazy firing device i find it rather odd they used blue pins for this black or gray wouldve been alot more discrete about the big trolls i think using different colours is good i dont think a troll force would be very organized so different colours would make the effect complete y  as for your troops looks quite fearsome definitely compared to my pathetic number of soldiers  a nice set but i would rather get the attack on tower though no matter about the price difference
xwingyoda on jan 22 2008 0426 pm said tks for the review mate  now i have to bloody wait long because lego france has this line available in freaking march  pissed yoda on  d i love the new goblin p that helmet is really cool why on earth tlc didnt include that one in the dwarf mine  such another idiotic move  anyone keeping track of tlcs stupidity lately  that would be interesting  i clearly want a huge goblin army now hehe  and i totally agree with you mate the troll lokks better in sand green the cart itself is pretty lame imo  just a sordid excuse to include yet another annoying shooting crappy device but for a 21 set its okie i say  need my bad guys on  yoda i believe there is a topic around here somewhere based on bad lego ideas after getting this new helmet i really wish lego had included it with the mining set its bloody annoying having to buy yet more of them from bl  the shooting bit is better than some sets that have had one at least this one is smartly done and of course it can also be hidden
question whats different with this special edition btw nice shots
wow 8 great review y i usually dont buy city sets but i think i might get this one just for that awsome forklift wub general tarful

mr tiber on jan 19 2008 1026 am said hmmm put it in my pirate port and use it to carry rum perhaps thats the mysterious cargo mr tiber replaced the petro with rum d
great review my only grip with this set is you can only fit one pallet in the truck it should have been the same size as the trailer so you can at least fit 2 pallets seems like alotof wasted space if im going to transport cargo i want to use the maximum amount of space aviable xd
i got this set last week and just to add a few of my own points cons  the forklift spring feels a bit flimsy  i dont know how long it will last or how much stress it would take  and the end coil isnt really heavily secured to the lift mechanism time will tell on that one  30 stickers its the exoforce of city sets the truck set does look less plain with them on though i would reccomend lining them up with the green brick in the second container rather than applying the first lot without a guide or they may end up uneven  its very hard to put the minifig in the forklift without dismantling or breaking open the set slightly  the cargo box attached to the main cabin of the truck doesnt hold very strongly  minifigs are dull  that dark blue torso with pattern is way overused  green stickers are a different green to the bricks themselves pros  lots of nice pieces including the large white panels and cargo pieces and i like the green white colour scheme  the cargo doors open well and the hingeing mechanism doesnt stand out to the detriment of the rest of the set as some people have complained about the mail airplane  studless floor in cargo containers makes it easy to move pallets in and out  fits in better than the heavy hauler to a minifig sized city  new 1x1x4 slope at least i hadnt seen it before overall  nice set with some good pictures although a bit flimsy and way too many stickers  the same issues i have with the cargo plane as well although that had more colour issues
ricecracker on jan 21 2008 0528 pm said hey thanks for the review the brickster i was just wondering if you could possibly upload a picture of the instructions for the forklift and if possible tell me the piece  of the 1x4 slope bricks to bricklink them thanks i dont have a scanner for the instructions but the 1x4 slope is listed as piece 4515362 in the instructions
yay another redman review you are an excellent reviewer iamded redman your pictures show all the details included in the set and your thoughts bring new light to features and bits i hadnt noticed or thought about before y i love this little set i will get two i reckon because i want all the wizard bits in a minifig box as well nice little humorous pic at the end too one improvement i think could be to include the pics of the back of the box and other side of the instructions anyway honestly there isnt much to improve you are an excellent reviewer  redman on batbrick is back 
thanks for the review of this nice little set for its price 3 euros here in holland it contains quite a lot of useful parts the only thing that could have been better in my opinion is the wand i always liked this one
yay more redman probably going to get one of these and turn it into a carnival attraction
doctor sinister on feb 5 2008 0953 am said there are two  hopefully these are the numbers you need 4525919 4525920  dr s they are perfect wub thanks very much sweet its built very oddly wacko
rupeeclock on feb 5 2008 0516 pm said holy snap that thing is ugly x luckly those doesnt fly above us  really i love the way they look granted they go back to the 70s but so does the 747 or the c130 you cant argue about tastes and colours i guess p dr s  how much did the set cost edited by hairy ruben 05 february 2008  0436 pm
thanks for the review i like the looks of the set but im not sure about it still is it work 35 would you recomend buying it
thanks for the review that seems to be a nice set but as far im concerned i dont think its worth eur 4999 there arent so many parts though those new curved slope will add some more building possibilities y what lacks   a 2 x 4 cut out in the lower part of the nose to retract the landing gear  a 4 x 6 cut out in the lower part of the tail to allow passagers to get off through the back like in a dc10  some real plates and tiles instead of these crappy wings this part is the useless one that tlc ever produced n
if i do end up geting this set it will be for my slowly growing army btw nice review y
wow what a screw up from lego that one is even more out there than the extra obi wan in the rc xd
nice review all the important stuff is there weird cockup by tlc to put an ani face on indy i didnt encounter any mistakes in my four indy sets great selfmade temple of doom indy fig piranha so uhm has anyone found out yet what the extra hieroglyphic stickers are for
i have noticed that at my local tlc store orlando they have this set in a glass case on displaywith the cw anakin head on indy i did not realize this was such i widespread problem
supremecommmandergrievous on feb 9 2008 1132 am said i have noticed that at my local tlc store orlando they have this set in a glass case on displaywith the cw anakin head on indy i did not realize this was such i widespread problem i saw this review on sh quote in lego world were all detail conscious right our setreally my 8yrold sons came with the wrong head for indiana jones thin eyebrows no five oclock shadow lots of red scarsreally hard for him to get into the character everything else is great  especially the falling wall and snake trap i might get this set today i hope i dont have this problem 8 dp8
piranha on feb 7 2008 0909 pm said figs first off we have our hero indian what the hell why is there a freaking cw anakin head on indy there was a production slip up as instead of indys head i get anakins   i open the box up and there staring me in the face is his ugly face the same thing happened to me with the head  boy was i pissed sing and i also got this set from cruddy wal mart
i got this set and there werent any qualmsmisprintsmis packagings hmmm must be a small problem
welcome to my sigfig sgt joey sh will lead trough this review of the new city 7743 police surveilance truck first of all the box front back the minifigs 3 police officers and a bad guy now the vehicles the cute little atv wub the main part of the set the surveilance truck a shot of the interior the trailer back of the trailer the truck back side the little building front the interior and last but not least spare parts and not needed stickers thats it hope to see you again at the next episode of sgt joeys reviews
i like the new station but the truck is a good question i still like the classic 1994 one and the 1980s can that was one of the first units i got
it looks to me that the little building is supposed to be like some sort of customs checkpoint between one nation and another or like a toll facility on a highway i like the little checkpoint but i think that should be part of a separate set and 7743 just having the police mobile command center truck
great review keep them coming i might get this set now i must have those grey barrels oh dear d xd p xd this was a hilaruos review too edited by vbbn 10 february 2008  1121 pm
thanks everyone heres part 2 the second instruction booklet includes instructions for both alternate models which is good i hate having too many manuals here she is the plane its very nice and well proportioned but where did iamded get that laser overview the landing gear is very sturdy and nice and the wings are surprisingly good top view iamdeds head fell into the propellers i was trying to save him honest a view of how the motor on this one works by pushing the orange button you can make the prop spin it is well integrated like the chopper though the prop only spins for about 2 12 seconds still its a nice feature the tail is also well made simple but lovable oh and check out that tank the prop spinning agh is that my hand final view there seems to be some sort of explosion here 8 well i think i got iamded more than me atleast the second model is also great though not as good as the chopper the lack of space to fit something into the cockpit brings it down a bit but it is a very nice model overall i recommend it though unlike the chopper it will be hard to mod into minifig scale so far so good with 4995 here are the leftover pieces from the model enjoy batbrick away 
lt veers on feb 11 2008 1155 am said great review batbrick iamded got what he deserved xd xo  p great review batbrick this looks like a wonderful set i love that plane it doesnt bother me that its not minifig scale as it looks more for display imo wub looking forward to seeing the final model y peace
i really like this set even though i was hoping for a minimotor d chock full of great parts too thanks for the review sweet
thanks guys heres the final part the instructions for the boat begin on page 46 the overall set its actually much nicer than i thought it would be the pictures on the box make it look ugly top view tommy guns do not actually come with set  side view the designers have done an excellent job with the hull considering the lack of many slopes pieces you can see it is pretty much minifig scale too here you can see that by pushing in the red technic axle the anchor on the front will be hauled back into the boat back view these outboard motors are pretty cool though i wish they could go own into the water more overall though the weakest model its still a lot of fun and has a clever way around the lack of a shapely hull i was impressed with it after the building it it even has two rounded snotty bottom pieces on the nose of the boat to give the impression it is speeding through the water with the front lifting up lots of leftover pieces for this one the pieces sorry about the poor photograph there it was getting late  overall the cargo chopper is another great set in the fantastic creator line loads of fun great play and some clever designs it challenges you to make your own things and even includes some nifty pieces bley barrels wub  i wont give it a rating but ill just say i certainly recommend it to fans of the theme and lego fans in general now finally iamded and i teamup in the face of a larger foe get that lord of pies batbrick away

another firstrate review its a nice little set with a big number of minifigs and 2 flintlock guns is also a nice bonus
a nice review and a nice little set for anyones pirate collection a 55 for the review
laurinator i dont mind an occassional old review coming back to life for discussion but it seems youve replied to many old reviews that have been stagnant for years please try to refrain from bumping a lot of old topics as it pushes down new content that should really be the focus of discussion now
hi guys i picked these up the other day but its taken me this long to get round to posting the reviews so here we go tub comparison with a minfig thanks brainbox the lighting changes a bit throughout the photographs as it was going dark outside so i only really had my desk light and i kept getting in the way 4837 mini trains now the box i really like its no different to those of last years sets but the colour here is simply fantastic and really seems appropriate for the theme so this is what you get inside all the pieces are still inside the bag the optical illusion was accidental d  no pieces of particular outstanding interest but the dark green cheese slopes are rather nice look out for those later 1 2 3 this is the main model and uses all the pieces in the set bar these two which according to the inventory are spares but as with all my other creator sets im cheating and leaving them in this is far and away the best model of the three and evokes the iconic version of a steam train the green looks superb but im not sure whether thats due to the model itself or the actual colour moving on we get to the second model 1 leftovers yes i admit i was using a piece of paper this isnt actually a bad model i dont think its quite as nice as the previous one but its not bad its different from the first model as well which is good too muich of the same can be a bad thing finally we come to the third model leftovers now ill be honest i dont really know what this is its not that good a model compared to the other two thats all i can say really and of course all the pieces fit into the tub overall i have to say i do like this set despite the weak third model the strength of the primary and secondary models make up for any weaknesses in the third and i can imagine the pieces being fully usuable in building other trains while the basic idea of these tubs isnt quite as good as the xpods with regards portability and general niceness they arent bad and for a fairly cheap price 34 as well 4838 mini vehicles this is one of those set boxes that you see because of the ridiculously loud colours sound marketing scheme if you ask me ive managed it again there are pieces outside the bag or are there now these i like y  1 2 i dont know what the clip is for there isnt one on the other side 3 4 5 this is the main model of the set and again all the pieces are used bar these three the spares its quite a nice model although the cars a bit odd still i like the ramps and the colour scheme reminds me just a little of g1 ultra magnus hmm i think that boom arm could do with refixing 1 2 leftovers this is actually quite nice as well its that classic breakdown truck and the boom arm itself is quite nice with quite a bit of movement another solid model 1 leftovers im surprised by the amount of detail here actually not only have tlc included a spare wheel at the back but also what looks like a trailer hitch which all adds to the realism another nice model to round out a nice set and in the tub overall im not sure which of the two i like better when i bought them and on the way home i much preferred the train set but after building this set im not sure this is another good set from the year when tlc seems to be giving us so many there are some good pieces in here too and while theres nothing unique theyre still good so thanks for reading hope it helped someone and if there are any requests ill see what i can do thats requests for pics not songs   edited by whitefang 23 may 2009  0656 pm indexed
thanks for the review brainbox sweet these look really nifty i might pick up a couple of these as for the parts im sure they could come in handy for something and so cheap as well i still miss xpods though  do the kids still say nifty these days wacko
youre welcome guys vbbn on feb 19 2008 1124 pm said i like that orange lidded set the truck so nice i wont get it though d sorry that just made me laugh plural on feb 20 2008 1225 am said i still miss xpods though  yeah so do i they really were a neat idea plural on feb 20 2008 1225 am said do the kids still say nifty these days wacko i do but then thats not very helpful as i sit in english going through a book listening to the class find archaic words thinking but i still use those words d
thanks for these great reviews brainbox i never expected you to do a review for some reason i love these mini sets the train in particular is great i wont get any though those indy sets are coming in fast and im gonna need all the money i can muster still they are nifty little sets batbrick away 
so here it is finally my first ever review of a lego setoh wait its actually 2 sets so i dont really know how to do it right but ill try the best sorry if some pictures are a litte bit dark but im not really into photography and i got bad light here lets start with the dwarfs mine defender theme castle 2008 set name dwarfs mine defender number 7040 pieces 86 price 999 eur first as always the box the back a few instructions on how the defender works for those how dont know   and the instructions we continue with the minifigs sorry i forgot to make a closeup of the dwarf and finally the mine defender itself i personally think it isnt as bad as maybe some people think the chain for the catapult is great i think i kinda love those controls the mechanism with the rubbe rband actually works pretty well but only on a notglossy underground thats pretty much all of it its small but i like it a lot so lets go on to the tower raid now which would be my absolute favorite of those new sets  theme castle 2008 set name tower raid number 7037 pieces 364 price 2999 eur again first the box  instructions we got 2 sets of instructios here one for the tower and one for the siege tower the minifigs we got one archer and one soldier here both with the torsos of the 2007 sets now thw orc side starting with the great leader with the new armor and the golden helmet i love those pieces closeup of the armor  helmet then we got another orcknight and the prisoner with handcuffs the crownie tower looks great overall though there is something i dont really like about it but later on that now the back and that is what really bothers me there areno walls on the first floor except the one with the wallpiece and the door and theprison also is open at the back the orc easily could jump out there not sure what these are all about they really dont add much to the set enough rant now lets go on with a pretty sweet detail the golden crystal on the little table the wall piece on the first floor you can ram in and finally the very best thing of this set the amazing orc siege tower from the front the great working ram you can pull it back very far and it got pretty much power here we got another sweet detail the siege platform that moves out by pulling a cord in the back of the tower finally a picture of a bit siege action if you ram in the lower wallpiece the brown shelfs of the prisonfloor collapse and the prisoned orc is finally free summary likes as i mentioned before i really think thats the best ever produced siege tower its got so mich details and works extremely well also the overall look of it is magnificant the destroymechanism of the tower is pretty cool too the brown door is a fine detail too nothing much to say about the mine defender i like this little set and theres nothing really to bother about it dislikes the back of the tower thats really the only thing thats a bit bad imo they could have put there 2 more walls on the first floor and something to lock the prison easily final thought the tower raid for me personally is the best of the 2008 sets so far its got great playability and looks simply good my opinion buy it
tks for those so much  y nice reviews i love that tower raid and the defender and will buy them both quote really dont add much to the set oh but they do more pieces higher price 
this set didnt come with the new jail door piece id have guessed it would have since there is an orc in prison nice review im looking forward to picking up these sets steve
thank you for these fine reviews metalandi y therere really some nice playable features in the tower raid set and all these great orc torsos just sweet and it even looks like that black orcarmors a new piece lovely 
cheers for the reviews theyre both nice sets and i think i just may have to buy both or maybe ill get two of the dwarf set the figs in each are really cool as well the dwarf well theyre just cool anyway but the troll with the golden helmet and armour thats just wub
thanks metalandi these are 2 great sets im definately looking forward to seeing these in new zealand stores the collapsing floorprisoner freeing mechanism on the tower is wonderful a great touch some slight modifications like some walls will make this perfect and the dwarfs mine defender is a sweet little set with some neat minifigs thanks for the reviews y peace
thanks for the review i personally think the siege tower is probably the best one which lego has ever produced
well i dont think orcs are that sturdy seeing that theyd have to jump from the second level of the tower i dont see survival as his chief objective p awesome review im loving these sets more and more the tower raid is definitely the best and the cheapest set there  oh and pirhana its not really a king its more like an officer remember the wizard rules these goblins edited by trooperdavinfelth 22 february 2008  0249 pm
thank you for the nice review pity the tower is not designed better but i still want to buy these 2 sets if only there were 2 dwarves in the dmdefender
the rancor on apr 22 2008 0554 am said i perfer using the batle wheel to knock down the towers walls not the seige tower i love all the siege machines the orcs have they are certainly a much bigger threat than the skellies batbrick away
now that this topic has been brought up again i just want to say that the rubber band on my dwarf mine defender actually works
green grocer reviewed by dunamis set 10185 2352 pieces 14995 from the lego store glendale ca build time 65 hours holy guacamole almost exactly one year after caf corner was released we get the third installment in the increasingly popular lego exclusive town series combined with the famous 10182 caf corner and its trusty companion 10190 market street this trio makes the foundation for an amazing city block of lego goodness for those new to this series of sets check out my reviews of the two previous sets in this line cafe corner market street i would not necessarily recommend reading too many of my reviews in one setting as you might experience loss of brain cells andor drowsiness you have been warned so how does green grocer stack up to the two previous sets you ask well follow along kind reader and i shall attempt to unravel this question the box the gigantic box is pretty standard and looks amazingly similar to the caf corner box the back of the box shows some of the features of the green grocer as well as a lot of the cool interior that was absent from the previous sets in addition we are shown an image of the three sets together and a small insert image showing how they connect together as if we could not master that difficult maneuver opening the box is a matter of breaking two seals as it seems to be the norm now we have the reusable cereal box type tab system that we saw so often in 2007 sets however upon opening the tabs we are pleasantly surprised to find a cardboard tray have not seen one of those in a while as you can see in the photo we have two 32x16 green base plates three instruction manuals and a bunch of bags that are broken into four groups group 1 has 12 bags and goes with the first manual and builds the first floor group 2 has 9 bags and goes with the second manual to build the second floor group 3 has 14 bags and goes with the third manual for the top floor and roof and one bag that is not numbered and hence you can open it whenever you feel like it there are no stickers  yay moving right along we get to the three instruction manuals the manuals the three manuals are 55 47 and 47 pages in length they are laid out well and are pretty standard with all the usual trimmings  piece call outs for each step  parts inventory at the end of the second manual  page numbers color separation in these manuals was fine for me except dark bley and black we get a nice photo of all three sets together plus we get a nice tip showing how to split up the bags and what goes where those additional pieces you see in the photo just below the numbered bags are the pieces that come from the single unnumbered bag along with the base plates parts list random manual shot the pieces upon opening the first set of bags one thing is clear there are a ton of little tiny pieces the minifigs are included in this first section as well interesting to note that there are a handful of printed pieces and as i mentioned previously no stickers we also get a host of new and exciting pieces to add to our collection keep in mind my scope of lego sets is generally centered around star wars technic creator and the occasional racer set so what is new to me might have been around 15 years at any rate here are some of the more interesting pieces again note the printed tiles this time around lego has decided to include 33 more minifigs than the caf corner and market street sets yes we get four minifigs instead of three here are the cast of characters pictured left to right is sir top hat miss jenny blue overalls patti o furniture and little timmy cub scout ill leave it up to the minifig aficionados to decipher which torsos are new and to tell us all about the hairpieces i can say with reasonable certainty that the four yellow smiley heads are not new somebody check that dont forget the lovable little cat named tom he is the archrival of the mouse jerry that lives downstairs overall there are a lot of pieces large variety and wide range of colors the build if you have either of the two previous sets you will feel right at home here just like in the previous builds it seems like the first ten build steps are consumed with laying a bunch of 1x1 1x2 and 2x2 tiles everywhere almost feels like 30 of the pieces are used up right away see below there are several sections where you build various parts of the interior take a look at the cash registercounter below and the beverage cooler and the produce stand and everything that goes in it looks like someone has mail looks like someone just had a baby this set is incredibly well done and gives inspiration to go back and add similar items to caf corner and market street as before the average builder is introduced to some new building techniques like using the hinge plates to make the angles on the front of the building as shown below also the top of the roof shows some interesting ideas overall it is a really fun build that kept me entertained the whole way the design this is a great set with lots of little details i especially like the little mouse hole in the wall leading to the jerry the mouses area they even included a little slice of cheese it seems the designers cant get away from the usual staircase which i always feel is way too big maybe future designs can incorporate a spiral staircase to save room for other things in the model one welcome addition is the fire escape as seen below im going to show a bunch of examples of various items in the set so you can get the feel of the amazing detail in this design take a look at the lamps torches just outside the door and the streetlight with fire hydrant brickwork and archway awning here is the back side of the building note the trashcans and yard tools here is a closeup of the railings on the second story balcony and the second photo is the finished product with curtains in the window nice use of cups to make the banister on the second floor here is the fireplace on the second floor second floor staircase with toms hiding spot check out the radiator on the third floor more third floor nice grandfather clock and rug third floor check out the deck that is up on the roof complete with two chairs table umbrella flower pots and grill interesting use of minifig hammers on the roof finally here is what is left over when were done a couple of shots of the front a shot of the back and here are all three together overall thoughts this is an incredible set and the best of the three in my opinion it is hard to top caf corner but i believe green grocer just did i absolutely love all the details and building techniques that went into making this set there is a ton of different parts and wide color selection as usual we get a bunch of tiles and small plates but that goes with the series also we get four minifigs and lots of minifig accessories im giving this set a score of 100 i thought about it and i really dont know how they could have made it any better in short run dont walk to go pick this set up final rating 100 build 1010 excellent  lots of nice interiors details and accessories to build functionality 1010 outstanding raises the bar with interior and detail think caf corner on steroids design 1010 excellent  cant say enough good things about it parts 1010 great selection and diverse colors great minifigs price 1010 price ratio is excellent but lots and lots of little parts well worth the price as alway feel free to comment complain and question what you see here id like to hear your feedback on this amazing set
very nice very nice indeed lots of lovely little details even at the back this review hasnt changed my opinion one bit im still looking forward to when i can finally pick up mine at the post office im crossing my fingers that there will be more buildings following after this one im guessing that legos just testing the waters to see how far afols are willing to go regarding price vs details green grocer is still epic though
damn it  what a great great review  i definitly love this set  burn credit card burn  youre the must in there dunamis  many thanks 
this is a nice review thanks for all the great pictures
wow thanks for the nice review i have the other 2 sets and waiting for this to come to our shores stupendous design and details i really like the hammerrails on the roof cant wait wub
o m g i must have that set  y wub i remember you telling me that you were going to do a review of this set and i was so anxious i love these reviews thanks so much great pictures wub y y this will dent my wallet 8 i am so envious
a very informative review indeed thank you so much for doing so now i know that the price is worth every penny leaving my pocket  what do you guys think is tlc putting up as the next modular set is it asking too much of tlc to produce 1 modular set each quarter 4 times a year
a million thanks for this review this is greater than i thought i especially like that clock im going to get this set as soon as possible
thank you for the amazing review dunamis this set looks amazing wub i wont be able to afford it though  congrats this is on the frontpage y sweet
wow another old technic set review by you nice set and thanks for that review
looks like you have the original 1989 version with the yellow top cylinders  i got one too several years ago although i probably paid too much for it p on a side note if that pneumatic tubing feels harder and stiffer than the modern type i highly recommend that you dont use it and buy some of the newer stuff off bricklink instead tlc originally used a different material for the tubes and this stuff degrades the nozzles on pistons switches and so on over time the old tubes also grip the nozzles much more firmly and if you arent careful when removing them its actually possible to rip off the nozzles completely xo i had this happen a few years ago although tlc replaced my broken pistons for free i got rid of that stuff for good after that although the pistons on my power crane still have slightly discolored nozzles edited by cp5670 10 march 2008  0457 am
yeah if i rebuild and wash a model i will record it glad to see you liked it
this set is really cool i might actually get it
ah a good old retro review those old school days had some pretty impressive sets with alot more complexity than modern sets if you have it may i recommend 8880
thanks for reviewing this classic set i got it when it first came out and still love it the suspension steering and robust look of the model havent been done that well ever since this set puzzled me though back in the days the rear suspending part containing the differential and some gears was shown different on the box from the instructions in the instructions it showed that the grey part of the suspension in the back had to be made using a 1x2 smooth tile and 4 cornerplates 2x2 in grey the box however showed a much sturdier solution using a 1x8 tile and a 1x8 plate it is also visible on the cover of the instructions the pieces i mean are in this picture bernddasbrot on mar 9 2008 0705 pm said otherwise great set
thanks youve just motivated me to go on a senselesspreliminarydesignerrorshunt a few things ive discovered left side alternate model the steering link can only be put in place with a little violence the handlebar  is turned far more than its actually possible although the wheels are straight right side the 1x8 tile simonwillems pointed out the half bush right next to it is cantfindthewords wrong could be that the technic triangle is missing the windscreen 1x6 technic plates are mounted with 12 pins instead of axle pins with half bushes who can find more xd
i can remember that ive seen a few color variations on brickshelf and on ebay they sold well its new and familiar at the same time that makes it more interesting
i read blackbirds technopedia page on this truck the other week went onto ebay and picked up a misb copy for £25 gbp bargin great to get old sets unopened peeling the plastic off of the specialist parts was always cool love the front suspension
that price is exceptional its less than what i paid for mine 9 years ago and is even less than the original price of the set note that the stickers in this set are the bad variety that will crack and peel over time if you want to preserve them the technic flag in particular you will need to tape over it
somehow i also managed to get this set in very good condition including box instructions and all stickers for a mere €22 a few months ago this is indeed a very special set and was a pleasure to build the only flaw i noticed was weak support of the rear drivetrain which was easily corrected with a few extra plates
thanks for the great review vbbn y i already own 2 of these xd on your camera there should be a little flower sign switch to that to go to micro mode  its a really good first review y sweet
a nice review well done y the set itself doesnt look quite interesting to me compared with some of the newer ones like 7647 or 7648 the way the driver fits into the cockpit looks not very clever and pretty uncomfortable as well xd
sweet first pic review y i got this set for a birthday present last year and it is pretty fun overall the alien ship in this set is actually one of my favorites it just looks cool and the way you can fold it out is really clever the only negative for me is the cockpit of the mining unit not really because it isnt detailed but because mine is top heavy and keeps falling forward its kinda funny if you think about him driving along and then falling forwardbut not funny at all when youre playing 
vbbn on mar 12 2008 1137 pm said those new alien commanders for summer look promising though ive not heard of these can you direct me to some pictures steve
thanks for the review i do like this set though i am not a fan of the jelly aliens though the alien ship looks good with the curved parts and flip open and close design
sorry double post
zero1312 thanks dunamis on mar 26 2008 0621 pm said great review thanks for taking the time im glad to see another reviewer out there as there are a lot of sets to cover nicely done thanks and i plan to help the coverage i will buy the sets frowned upon hidden in shadows or even ones that i want and review them most of my reviews will be this way i already have another one on its way edited by vbbn 28 march 2008  0742 pm
hi this is my forth oldschool technic set review since blakbird pointed out that all my technic reviews are red i chose a yellow dune blaster for today just kidding this set is red as it should be dont worry my next reviews will be yellow and black uhhh forshadowing   i will start with some facts 277 elements and released in 1994 thats enough 1 the box 2 the parts 3 building instructions and catalogues wow no folds no wear marks  simply wub was lesen coole kids  klick das super magazin fuer coole kids how obvious 4 building no differential i really love the way the 1x8 technic bricks on the sides will be positioned later fun fact the engine contains no 2ltechnic axle and finished a real quick build 5 spare parts for the alternate model the yellow technic handle should be from 8412 maybe a bonus feature from the seller 6 random shots 7 final thoughts this is my second 8829 and i also noticed that the engine turns very hard the alternate model is really sorry to all those of you who like it crappy i mean a nice idea but not with this wheels  anyway a really beautiful technicset reminiscing this word exists does it thanks for viewing the pictures i hope you enjoyed it please comment if you want to edited by bernddasbrot 21 march 2008  0209 pm
a very good review with fine and informative pictures and a really nice set thanks bernddasbrot sweet hmm i really wish that tlc would make some steerable cars within the system line too
great set great review although the set looks better in yellow d
bernddasbrot on mar 21 2008 0707 am said hi this is my forth oldschool technic set review since blakbird pointed out that all my technic reviews are red i chose a yellow dune blaster for today this is my second 8829 and i also noticed that the engine turns very hard the alternate model is really sorry to all those of you who like it crappy i mean a nice idea but not with this wheels  anyway a really beautiful technicset reminiscing this word exists does it thanks for viewing the pictures i hope you enjoyed it please comment if you want to a great set review as always nice try making a review of a set that was not red it almost worked maybe next time sweet one thing i noticed is that a bunch of your pictures are missing the beam that goes over the left hand wheel as a fender like this picture what kind of camera do you use the pictures have very good depth of field meaning that both the foreground and the background are in good focus this is usually hard to do without a very small aperture yes reminiscing is a word it means to fondly remember the past i also noticed that the engine was sticky set 8408 has the same problem it took me forever to figure out what the problem was if you take the engine out of the model it turns nice and smooth then when you put it back in it works terrible it turns out the key is that in the back there is an 8 tooth spur gear and a 24 tooth crown gear used as a spur if you look at technica you will see that there are two different crown gears one of them works well mated with an 8 tooth on parallel axles and the other one doesnt the difference is only supposed to be longer teeth so it really should not matter but it does if your set works bad try switching the crown gear to one of the other variety worked for me eric
blakbird on mar 22 2008 0356 pm said imho 8829 is much better than 8296 first 8829 is a lot bigger i really like the huge rear balloon tires they both have rack and pinion steering and they both have trailing arm rear suspension with a v2 engine i think the body on 8829 is a little more well done for 8296 i think the alternate tractor model is much better for more comparisons see technicopedia eric wow 8 thanks for that cool link blakbird xd i agree that 8829s body is better i especially like 8829s rear spoiler and its angled side beams  toa of justice
hello all apologize for digging out a such old post recently i got a bag of lego technic parts where there have been mixed three sets 8858 8829 and 8235 the resurrection of 8858 has been described by me in a separate post going back to the dune buggy – when i saw it for the first time back in 1994 i did not like it as i was always big fan of 8840 which i consider to the day the best looking buggy and set 8829 looked to me ugly so there were those all parts in the bag… then i though why not build it  and i started to do it when i finished i was very surprised how the final look of this set is really taking my words back unfortunately in the bag there were missing some parts and i could not rebuild the back spoiler so i made some changes to it and make it from spare parts that i have and it came out acceptable i also added some additional parts such as “fake” steering wheel “rally” logo antennas i have also reverse mounting of the rear tires – why lego did them like that i never know – as i think they look better this way set well the review has been already made by owner of this post so i will only add few things into it engine – v2 aired cooled is driven by 4 gears  from the single wheel no differential as in 8840 using two old school z14 tooth bevel  then by z24 tooth crown and z8 tooth type 1 actually the as in most old sets the pistons are moving very fast not as in current sets and smooths – i needed to extra clean all engine parts as there was a lot friction suspension – set has “engine bay” working using two old gray shock absorbers 65l – the movement is not big but works very nice better then in 8840 in my opinion steering – this is a bit odd as there is no direct connection to hog as in most old sets but first the gear rack is moved by z8 then two z14 tooth where reverse movement is taking place later connection of two old school z14 tooth bevel goes to hog details – this is the most that i like in this set specially how the use of axle pin connector perpendicular and 1x10 bricks with 3x3 cut corners and plate 1x5 toothed ends 2 studs with center axle hole are making the body shape – is just wonder tires – the balloon rear are pretty nice the front is a new version of those that were in 8840 what i do not like 1 missing of technic figure 8840 had it 2 no steering wheel in the original set 3 no differential – but having in mind that lego has introduce 2412 teeth would be difficult to build the transmission in such small space where the engine is i will shortly upload new pictures and post them here later on  over all – i think it is worth buying it as it is very payable  actually very payable and runs smoothly  the steering suspension – perfect thank you and regards
pictures of my restored set 8829 i was almost 96 complete and for missing parts i add of my own the seat is black and not blue as one was missing in my 8858 the spoiler is different steering wheel added not connected to wheels and some additional items to make it look better this is how i change the tire orientation the new rear spoiler i still need to clean front rims edited by aow 26 november 2015  1232 pm
wow this buggy was my very first lego set i like this review  it remembered my childhood i also liked its body with those 8 studs long bricks on sides i can also remember trying to build engine in such way that it works smooth without success anyway i think its studless version  set 8048 is much better
finally after a very frustrating incident with the internet explorer 7s back button i present to you my very first review this is a review of set 8158 speed racer vs snake oiler its also the first review of a speed racer set on eurobricks also you should know that i didnt put the stickers on as they can be quite valuable later on down the road so im sorry for the lack of stickers  so without further ado i present to you my first review he he that rhymes d edit i just finished resizing the pics and uploading them to brickshelf after having a heated argument about when my bedtime is with my mother so i will be doing a complete redo of the picture portion of my review of set 8158 im going to work on that as soon as i finish typing this message edit 2 review fully redone now sighs that took forever edit 3 almost forgot to put in a new link to its brickshelf folder this is v2 of my review of set 8158 enjoy theme speed racer set8158 speed racer vs snake oiler price 1999us pieces 242 minifigs 2 first off pics of the box instructions dss minifigs and new parts there are so many stickers they had to number them xo sos sunglasses are chrome gold 8 closeup of the hemets new parts include first system lego hubcap new more curvy fenders curved windshield and a sshaped connector piece now onto the build first speed racers mach 5 back part of the car the cockpit of the car they connect with the new sshaped piece front part of the car front and cockpit also connected using the new sshaped piece side view of the car so far underside of the car so far adding more detail ground level front view of the car side view with added detail underside with newly added axles demonstrating how the new hubcaps are put on now on to building snake oilers orangeilicious racer back part of the car the cockpit of the car they are connected using the sshaped piece front part of the car with seemingly random color choices wacko the front and cockpit are also connected using the new sshaped piece adding orangeirific fenders side view of the car so far adding more detail smoothing things over ground level view with lime green eyes and white fangs side view with more detail rearword view of the car with newly added cuveacious windshield no hubcaps  now onto finished views of both cars first the mach 5 side view with sweet hubcaps up close and personal with the mach 5 a rearend shot i got hubcaps i got hubcaps speed racer now sos snake racer yes thats what im calling it p d beautiful blurry  rearend pic watchout it bites snake oiler hes ready to take on sr hubcaps or no hubcaps  racin now for some comparison shots hope you all like v2 better then v1 i know i liked it better xd seriously though i even learned a thing or two doin this last version  now its time for my summary overall a very well designed and executed set its only downfalls are that there are way too many stickers 32 to be exact  and there are no cool contraptions on the cars to take out the other racer a great buy for 1999 i reccomend this set to everybody because of the reasons i staed above and because even i who is not a big fan of speed racer xo was drawn to this spectacular little set price 1010 pieces 810 too many stickers minifigs 910 needed some accessories playability 810 needs some cool contraptions on the cars to take out the other racer overall 3540 general tarful edited by imperialshadows 01 june 2008  1207 pm
cant wait to get me one of those
general tarful please resize those pics even with the new resize feature people are having a tough time reading your review because it takes time for the tool to work check out the picture resize tutorial here and some other handy tutorials here thanks
im sorry but your review has only served to further enlighten me that these sets are a pile of cack absolutely lazy design and the only reason id get one is for the windscreen so i can build a proper landspeeder from star wars m
lasse d on mar 22 2008 0654 pm said i found all the april released speed racers sets in the shop in legoland i was going to post a review tuesday of this set but i can see im too late now i cross my fingers for the fierce creatures set doesnt get taken as well i would like to comment on the review but the pictures are too big  it simply takes too long to load regarding that new resize function i can see it does nearest neighbor rescaling doesnt it resize to less than 640x480 i thought that was the standard for forum post pictures 800 x 600
hinckley on mar 23 2008 0836 pm said  d youre actually responding to a quote from sinner but dont worry a lot of people mix us up and thank you for resizing all of the pics sweet oops  sorry edited also you are most welcome hinkley on another note heres a teaser pic of my next review set 8159 general tarful edited by generaltarful 24 march 2008  0219 am

i dont even see why you reviewed this set it didnt tell us anything that isnt perceivable from the box being so simple though i do appreciate the effort
hi this is my forth preoldschool review as promised a yellowset  my 8862 arrived today survived the washing machine coaster and actually was real fun to build 1 information this set contains 664 parts only i thought i’d be far more and was released in 1989 in the technic theme be sure to visit technopediaif you want to know more 2 building instructions wow these instructions are used im not used to this after all this sets with unread instruction booklets the pneumatics page the last step for the alternate model 3 the parts wow look at all those technic beams gears pins a few parts are missing in this photo 3 building the left worm gear is for the outriggers the right one for turning the “rear boom” the three 12l axles left one outriggers middle one steering right one erm… rearboomrotation the two worm gears in the front part left one lifting the bucket right one dumping the bucket the turningmechanism for the “rearboom” is finished once again a toothed 10l axle the boat weight 2x6x2 is hidden underneath the radiator grill okay… many hoses and a nice comfy seat have been added now you can recognize the backhoes real shape only with a little violence it’s possible to lift the bonnet  through the pneumatic pump yeah outriggers same technique that the 8854 uses the finished “boom  jib  scoop thing” bjst  xd the finished loader bucket and to end the building process the same picture from the introduction offtopic “it is all part of the miracle of nature  the circle of life” 4 functionality this time i tried something new i hope you can spot something  if not technopedia okay here we go 5 random shots i’ve got way too many pictures this time so i refer to my brickshelf folder until it’s moderated you can follow the multilingual links eins deux three quattro fem zes sédem osiem 6 final thoughts definitely worth buying as a child i thought it looks hideous  but today i’ve found out it’s totally fun to build and freaking functional three things i want to mention though the bjst can only be slewed a new word if the outriggers are deployed it is also possible that the bjst will reach the ground danger of grinding or sticking even if the outriggers are deployed the two mechanisms for the loader bucket can actually interlock and the 14 tooth gears might break  disentangle from the axle thanks for viewing the pictures i hope you enjoyed it please comment if you want to
ah what a very fine classic set and all these lovely technic beams with studs wub thank you very much for that excellent review bernd and you did a fantastic job with all these great pictures  y
another nice review the slow shutter speed pictures are great i think that was the only set with 8 distinct functions for a very long time and was only displaced by the 8455 backhoe in that respect the turntable on the back doesnt turn very well though as the weight is all distributed on one side the screw axle prevents it from popping off but there is still a lot of friction in it i dont have mine built anymore but it might be worth trying to put a weight brick or something on it quote do you have 8455 as well id love to see how they compare side by side it looks bigger than 8455 but i dont own any of the big old chuncky tires so i find it so hard to tell yeah its quite a bit bigger when everything is fully extended it becomes something like 26 long although the 8455 actually has morebetter functionality edited by cp5670 24 march 2008  0815 am
thanks for your feedback i like both but i would say 8455 is far more than just a studless version with 10 pneumatic cylinders and 2 pneumatic pumps its a wonderful set for every pneumatic freak unfortunately i dont own the 8455  yet  sinner said i hope you have more planned any chance of a supercar one i foreshadowed a black review a few days ago guess which one xo xd
quote there are 324 axle nuts on bricklink with an avg price of 089 i didnt know of this accessoryset 51102 you can buy it for 4000 8 i was thinking of getting one of those off bl several years ago back when the price used to be more like 15 or so but i realized that i hardly ever use the couple that i already have p they came out with the modern turntable the year after this set which mostly negated the need for these screw axles i think their only use now is to hold nonlego objects onto models like the technic pen in 8094 i guess you can try to make linear actuators out of them but theyre often too rare and fragile for that
bernddasbrot on mar 23 2008 0232 pm said hi this is my forth preoldschool review as promised a yellowset  my 8862 arrived today survived the washing machine coaster and actually was real fun to build the finished “boom  jib  scoop thing” bjst  xd thanks for viewing the pictures i hope you enjoyed it another great review and a wonderful set of pictures i like your nomenclature for the bjst acronyms always sound nicely scientific much better than digger no one would know you made it up until they found out what it means i also really like what i will call your kinetic photos they convey a sense of motion and show the range of the mechanism without the big file sizes of animations how long of a shutter speed did you use the secret to not getting too much friction in the turntable is using extra nuts and jamming them together you dont want to actually clamp the nuts tight across the turntable you want to jam two nuts tightly together at each end which prevents them from unwinding but still leave a little free play gap this way it will hold the assembly together but not prevent it from moving mine moves quite easily this same concept is used on the pen plotter or 8094 slewed i think thats a word how about slewn or slain or slewifacated i think rotated is best sweet eric
wow thanks for putting up this thread that reminded me that i own that one too sweet and i loved it as a kid
quote how long of a shutter speed did you use 15 seconds quote by the way dont forget to build the alternate model of 8862 i will review it too and post it in this topic quote slewed i think thats a word how about slewn or slain or slewifacated i think rotated is best actually i took it from your site xd quote white is pretty rare unfortunately i dont own 8480 but i think 8824 is also a very good though small white set 8462 rocks as a blue set i just got it a few weeks ago lets see 8462 also is one of the last technic sets i would call oldschool 8479 okay too but 8458 is imho not 8868 and the totally mysteriously black set will follow quote i was thinking you could somehow attach a 16tooth dark gray gear the one that spins freely around axles to the nut which would make the axle move in and out when the gear turned and convert the gears rotary motion to linear motion in a fairly compact package did you had something like this in mind if the toothed 10l axle rotates the axle nuts want to rotate too but they cant because of that 2x4 technic plate so theyll decide to move along the axle the 1x6 bricks on each end make sure that the axle wont move in or out thanks for your feedback
quote 8462 rocks as a blue set i just got it a few weeks ago lets see 8462 also is one of the last technic sets i would call oldschool 8479 okay too but 8458 is imho not yeah the tow truck was the last set that still used mainly studded beams they made many changes to technic the following year with models becoming predominantly studless and making heavy use of the flexible axleshoses and decorative panels the technic logo and box art style was also changed a lot i really like the overall construction of that set the model is fairly lightweight but extremely sturdy it must be one of the strongest large sets theyve released quote did you had something like this in mind thats basically the idea as blakbird said though it wouldnt be very powerful and would put the axle under some stress the linear actuators theyre bringing out this year do the same thing and should work much better
some time ago i sort of complained about the fact that there was not much technic represented in the eurobricks community this was the topic if someone is interested i am glad to see someone took that complaint serious and started reviewing technic sets on large scale to show us how fascinating the theme really is this review is once again an excellent one i really enjoyed reading it i must buy this set sometime soon because i always liked the threeway pneumatic system it came with and the overall look of the machine for many years it seemed out of reach much to expensive and hard to come by as a kid now as an adult there are many ways to acquire this wonderful set keep on reviewing y
thanks for the review general tarful i only saw the knife 27 times  i like this set but i probably wont justify the price the other set has orange  wub and the mach 5 as well as better fleshie head i reckon to the batbrick cave 
again nice review lego should have used this for their helmets you can put a protectingglassesdont know the name in front of it offcourse with a little m printed on it
nice it is probably the only speed racers set i will buy  and i will buy multiples those cars look awesome
thanks for the review and for giving me directions p i think the design of these two cars looks to be better than in the other set the drivers are positioned lower compared to the windscreen and the design of the front on th red car is really nice im missing details of motors and cars this big could use a working steering mechanism
speaking of pocket knives i just got speed racer and snake oiler at kmart and might mod the helmet so it actually looks like the cartoon the problem is  i dont want to shell out two bucks for a clear visor  by the way i know transclear visors are nonproduction but where did they come from a pickabrick if so what store well at least if i do go through getting the elusive clear visor its not as bad as the insane 25 red vader helmet this set is great i would have gotten this along with the one i purchased but i didnt have enough dough with me to get both
crap now i want these sets great review
thanks for a lovely review i only recently bought this set off ebay pretty good deal misb for 30 euros and i enjoyed putting it together and mixing it with the other piratesets when you put two sets of two baseplates together youll get a large pond with an island in the center just to achieve that i bought two more baseplates off ebay the result is this moc i always loved the islanders and have most of the sets not all of them but that is going to change in the future y
excellent review i really like this set and so i gave it a 55 this set is on my list to get i especially like the speedy pirate boat and the also very fast outrigger canoe with a sail i dont think a small number of these cannibals will make much of an impact on gaming though even if they get a bonus with spears duke
a mighty fine review youve created slyowl y after some sleep i shall immerse myself more fully within it
nice review  although im pretty sure eldorado fortress has 8 minifigs making this set no 4 in the minifig count i gave it a 5 the number of islanders and vegetation pieces comes in very handy for land based scenarios ive got 3 copies of this set 1 of them costing me less than 2euros from an ebay auction in scotland along with forbidden island its easily one of the most common and affordable pirate sets to be found on he second hand market
excellent review of an outstanding set i love the main image i want this set so bad
for some reason i never considered buying this set but your review changed that ill try to get it on ebay thanks for your efforts to make this wonderful review for us its now added to our index
thanks for the review i am getting very interested in the classic pirates sets and i wat some now this seems like it would be a great starter
great review i recently got this set for only 150 sek around 17 and it´s really good
fortunately i got this set on 2000 not the released version the original one and i said fortunately because its a lovely set how could i rate it but awesome a little islander army the islander girl ironhook and that cool boat with two sails the jailpolynesian statue i must recognize that i have a thing with the islanders i know that they are weird poorly based on the polynesian aborigens etc but they are very original broke with the traditional enemies and gave to the pirates theme an exotic and wild look
judging from your pictures there seems to be many interesting torsos and new fleshy heads but i dont think this set is for me fueling my dismissal of this set is that i saw the trailer for this film at the cinema today and it looked pretty terrible x thanks for taking your time to review this set though ricecracker  edited by casewindu 29 march 2008  1018 pm
no problem casewindu i actually like this set for the pieces and torsos especially sprittles
again no problem personally i would have liked a lower price 9604 cad with tax n  also my favourite would be the gray and black car
thank you for the pics y i want a trixie impulse set wub and otherwise that little boy with his monkey i like the print on his t shirt
doubt ill get this i used to like the anime but the the film looks cheesy as a cheese sandwhich
i picked up this set a few weeks ago along with the smaller sets that come with the mach 5 and racer xs car and i was pleasantly surprised the commentators stand is nothing to write home about but the assortment of figs is great numerous new face prints in flesh i believe and in spite of the large amount of stickers the three cars are each unique and very welldesigned my only gripe about them is that cannonball taylors car the black and yellow one was a missed opportunity as in the movie its yellow and purple i know tlc is dropping purple for the future and had a bunch of problems with it in the past but it would have made for a great looking car imo
such on 07 july 2011  0850 am said an opportunity has come up to buy this set for 100 aud just wondering whether people think its worth buying ive heard very little about the speed racer legos this comment does not seem a good reason for reviving a 2 and a half years old topic to me please avoid doing so in the future
ah thanks sommuch again for that great review y sweet man i am so happy they made this set the new one seems too boring 
somehow i competely missed your review when you first made it i saw your pics on brickshelf and wondered about the review you have managed to review my all time favourite technic set it was the first large technic set i was given by my parents when it first came out in 1995 i played for hours with this set making minifig seats in it it was so huge there was room for four minifigs to sit next to eachother in front i made various applications for it a bungeejump system with a large rubber band and lots of containers to be lifted the first changes i made included the inverting of the wheels and the disabling of one of the flashlightsteering wheels because they obstructed eachother by the way the nob for your winch is yellow instead of black i know this set by heart so watch out p  i always liked those nobs i do own the 8421 and i can tell you this 8460 is much much stronger it can carry more weight because the boom is lighter then the 8421 they are powered by the same two pistons you know when you made it right when the crane is in upright position fully extended and you release the brake from the winch does the hook lower without having to pull it if it does you succeeded in constructing the set right the alternate model was great fun too the pump is cleverly hidden and the crane folds up great between the cab and the loading platform you could easily mod it with a pneumatic claw on the crane a motor to turn it and a compressor the only flaw was the loading platform which had no floor only some axles thanks so much for reviving my memorie concerning this great set y
a great review thank you i do not know these old sets like this one but it is very cool to see how they were made i have an unopened 8421 maybe i should do a small review of that when i get to build it btw boxes are expensive so at a given price point its a choise between more bricks or nicer boxes i have no doubt what most people would chose front edited by front 06 april 2008  1021 pm
thanks for the review sweet for its size and parts count this is a remarkably featured set i dont think ive never seen the alternate model before personally i prefer 8421 because i think it looks much better and i love the six wheel steering i also love the three segment boom and the transmission they fit it all in so neatly i realise that it has trouble even holding up itself but ultimately it doesnt matter as its not like you are really going to construction work with it what bothers me more about 8421 is the design change in the boom from chainlinks to strings i would try to mod mine but all i have is the prototype picture to base it on and i dont have enough links anyway p bernddasbrot on apr 7 2008 0729 am said yeah somehow i wonderd why only vbbn thanks responded indeed i have been very busy the last few months and i kept meaning to reply at last i managed to find the time to reply today bernddasbrot on apr 7 2008 0729 am said another reason for the 8460 as favorite set its got a real alternate model not just a different erm crane yes that really sucks somebody i havent got the time to look  on brickshelf has made a quite good alternate lego have been a bit inconsistant with alternate models lately the recent tow truck had a good one i even made both
thanks guys  sinner i hope you refered to 8285 so my answer will match 8285 is interesting main model american styled truck alternate model european styled truck i dont think tlg produced many european styled truck edit i just found a wonderful mocalternate on brickshelf 8436 by industrialdesigner if i got him right he designed a few offical technic sets for tlg  all promises promises promises hm and again its ebay thats blocking me i want to foreshadow my next review although itll take some time to make it i know you know but please act inconspicuous until youll can act very astonished edited by bernddasbrot 09 april 2008  0325 pm
funny review just a question though did your set come with three cutlasses also your food crate seems to be missing edited by sir dano 15 april 2008  0904 pm
alex54 on apr 15 2008 0857 pm said those giant ants are made in a smooth plastic in dark red and trans black colour im pretty sure those ants are actually spiders i really wanted an in detail review of this set with opinions as well as pictures and you provided the goods alex54 i really need another tent i can later use it for rebel troopers and i love the selection of minifigs the new spiders are freakin awesome why didnt lego make them before this set is a must buy for me i guess in the uk it will be £899 edit where did you get this set alex54 i really want to know edited by the rancor 15 april 2008  0913 pm
actually they are ants spiders have 8 legs while ants have only 6 like these the two thing that look like legs in the front are the antennae back on topic i think this set looks great and i cant wait until i can get my hands on it and the other new ij sets edited by erdbeereis1 15 april 2008  0926 pm
cant wait to get this one ants i dont have a tent either so thatll be a great pickup im surprised though that it includes the gold exoforce sword i didnt expect this to come in any other sets besides the tower faramir
thanks for the review mustmakeantarmy
front on apr 16 2008 1015 am said they must be ants but im pretty convinced that what you think are the antennae are the ants mandibles or not there are six legs 2 antennae and 2 mandible and they most definately are ants to those still in doubt thanks for this great review alex this is most definately well in my opinion anyway the best set lets face it in motorcycle chase you really only got 2 bikes and 2 crates as the big parts of the set in this one which is the same price you get those ants a neat tent hurray a bprintedi map a chicken leg a castle sword ef sword and pirates sword a dagger now in light bley and a silver frying pan this set is packed with useful pieces im definately getting this one and i for one love mutts hair piece i sense my sigfig will soon have a new hair style thanks again alex for the sweet review peace edited by iamded 16 april 2008  0507 am
thanks for the excellent review alex this is so far my favorite crystal skull set released the cargo plane is however the best i love the small accessories like turkey leg banana golden sword and giant ants mutts torso is very nice i love the leather jacket print irina is just a another hottie but i would like to see her smile oh and another indy
i was already thinking of buying this set and youve totally convinced me thanks for the review alex btw i think they are ants having that shape moreover we already have spider molds and they have already been used in theatre themes see spiderman  luxorv
nice review indeed thanks for review all these new indianna sets just wondering did your set have a crate as im sure the prims has a crat with a banana in
i simply that tent i guess i´ll have to buy three of these just to make a proper expedition moc somewhen a great little set indeed with marvelous new mf torsos and that new black feminine hairpiece´s also great and very useable for creating some characters related to the sixties and seventies and finally a pan that´s not black and a knife in grey that´s very handy indeed the chrome one always looked a bit too shiny to me thanks for that sweet review alex
thanks for that great review this is a very interesting set filled with nice parts for customisation somemore the price is not that steep i will need to get ready for the second wave
set ref 7625 name river chase number of minifigs 4 number of pieces unknown price 2290€ a general view of the set we’ve got an amphibious vehicle a small boat an observation post and a dark green croco so beautiful  for the figs we’ve got indy of course marion and two russian soldiers nothing special here in the back of the tree there is a box to put some things the amphibious vehicle is very nice the proportions are really great not too big not too small and there are a lot of details everywhere like the propeller a back view an inside view the small boat is a dark grey zodiac but the details are nice too giving it a retro look in the same way of all the indy vehicles the outpost has a net to permit to the bad guys to capture some nice guys and girls… but it seems that the girl marion is scared of the nice croco so indy comes and help her pushing the technic axle with this round inversed tiles which push out the net and capture the croco now marion feels happier and she takes a can of oil and whacks the poor croco without defences who has said marion is a nice girl so i’ve bought this set like an add on to my city in fact the elements of this set can easily be integrated in a town layout i plan to use the outpost for my forest section and the amphibious vehicle is always a nice touch of originality in a layout yes you can use all those military things without creating an army in a layout just put the violent parts out and you’ve got nice things like a biologist car in the case of the amphibious vehicle
nice review i like what im seeing in this set i liked the little comic marion should be arrested though
wow this is a fantastic set i love the dark green croc and other features marion is good to have again and i love her new torso and those commies look great as well thanks for the review alex54 batbrick away
batbrick on apr 15 2008 0539 pm said commies look great as well haha commies this set really looks great i really see what you were saying about the whole retro thing reminds me a bit of a dino island set myself except without the dinosaurs always without the dinosaurs this is a must get does anyone know when these will be released in the us faramir edited by faramir 15 april 2008  1050 pm
thanks for the review i really like this littleish set quite alot of detail it reminds me of sets from the late 90s more soviets are always welcome too and the new torso for marion is nice as is the new dark green alligator all of the neat little accesories are great too a cup shovel binoculars and of course the cans of gasoline again thanks for the review alex
just like 7626 this is a must buy in my opinion i just the amphibious vehiclevery nice for army building
i like the creatures in this very much and it is good to see the vehicle from different angles thank you i think i shall buy this
oh man thanks for the review imo this looks like the best set in the new indy line do you have any better pics of the colonel
great review thanks a lot for all the pics i agree that this is probably the nicest set of the indy 4 wave so much dark green and i love all the plant pieces its been ages since weve had enough pieces in a regular release to build nice forests so its great to see 11 of the dark green leaves in one set and all the vines the design of the cutter looks very solid and brick built as well giant ants are great looking too
a great detailed review for an excellent set i love the jungle cutter vehicle itself and all the dark green its great to have the trees and cave entrance you can never have enough extras the figs are nice too two russian soldiers the coollooking general i think his name is dovchenko or something and the repeatedbutstillnice indy with rpg thanks again looks like ill be picking this up along with jungle duel by the way i think this set is called jungle cutter
wow those trees look so weak compared to those enormous blades anyway a highpossibilityandappealtouscompulsivelegoshoppers set so ill try to get it which means ill obsesively look until i find deforestation of puny trees on
thanks for this fantastic review alex those trees are a neat add on to any jungle as is that sweet cave but the main part of this set the jungle cutter man that is wicked packed with that awesome dark green and with those wonderful treads not to mention the smoothly spinning buzz saws however this sets a tad overpriced in my opinion and looking through the instructions they have that crazy colour syndrome again using blue yellow and red parts in the internal build still thanks for this sweet review with neat pics thumbup peace
xwingyoda on apr 16 2008 0537 am said great review again alex  same question in case you didnt se it in my reply to the other set where did you get those new sets  i really love that set  its called jungle cutter the trees are really cool and make a great adition to it imo that temple entrance or monument is really cool  those bionicle parts do make fantastic vegetation  you mean the spiny dk green things that hang from the holes around the secret entrance they were in the indy temple escape i totally forgot about that green frog  thats cool  those are so cute  5 more ants is great  the vehicle look really sharp ah ah ah 2 more commies yeay  that officer is really freaky actually  could have been a high rank under pol pots regime in the s21 yeay looks more asian than russian imo yeah tlcs really cranking out the new molds for both food and wildlife so lets see if i get all five sets i get 11 russians and six are basic soldiers although two are duplicates and triplicates yes that officer definitely has an italian look to him those cheekbones are a little too high now its time for my gripes  same bloody rant about indy   i havent read the instructions before but once again there are so many parts in crap colours that need to be changed look at all the crap red and yellow in there  i will need to look for those parts before buying the set like i always do  mod while building on  same rant any chance we could see the rpg i am really soimpressed with that indy line  i sincerely hope it will have a long and healthy life  agreed responses to the yodameisters review of alex54s review of the jungle cutter are in red now to my opinion great review more reviews on
what a lovely set i think i have to put this on my wishlistjust for that beautiful woodcutting tank thingie 2008 is gonna get expensive for me
the thing and the set is called jungle cutter and the reason the front pops off is because indy blows it up with a bazooka incase you wanted to know thanks for the nice review
heres a review of the second largest set in the dragon masters subtheme for castle month dark dragons den figs the set comes with 3 dragon knights two of which have the dragon wings on their helmetssad thing is one of my knights was missing the left wing on the helmet there are also the definitive dragon wiz the wizard or majisto if you prefertwo horses and a hawk try to find him in each picture the set theres a large spot under the mountain for the dragon to guard the treasure chest the chest has 2 red and green 1x1 circles in it another gate in the back along with a door for knights the right side of the mountain has a ladder and a removable rock face the left side has some stairs leading up to the top i love this tree design simple yet effective a shot of the top hey what are you doing no throw him in the dungeon overall this set when first released in 1993 was priced at 43usd although that might just be because of the juniorised pieces 6 burps its a fun set that provides excellent playability if you can find it at a 2030 price point pick it up overall grade 810 edited by kimt 10 august 2008  0133 pm
this is around the time that many consider the decline of castle in which point i somewhat agree but admittedly it still looks like a very playable set and the tree is very well done thank you for the review
ah the wonderful dragon knight or was it dragon masters sets i personally preferred the black knights but these guys still had some awesome sets thanks for this review this looks like a neat little set although those modern stairs look a little out of place that tree design is indeed a neat one i remember having that in one dark forestmen set i got the interior sure is roomy may i suggest for future review you photograph the set on a cleared table that way you wont get distracted by the clutter in the background and can focus on the main part of the image the set peace
this is probably one of my favourite sets andor one of the sets which i wish i ownedthe 90s was probably my favourite castle era tobad i was to young to buy this set when it came out man i wish i had one of those dragons they were one of the best type i reckon although all the dragons are good thanks for the reveiw edited by hollisbrick 16 april 2008  0741 am
agent rick youre definately the dragon master around these parts what a great little set i really like the classic dragon which reminds me of a similar style used for the lego crocodiles and the dungeon is pretty slick too i like the use of the large gates plus the doors plus the set contains the blue wizard awesome great review
i own this set and i think its a great for a smaller fortress building there is a good selection of mini figs the burps do detract somewhat from the set but they do make it feel as if its in a large cave the cloth flags that are included are really nice and mine have lasted a long time
i think the green motocross bike looks great i like the use of fairings on this bike the only thing i really dont like about the technics bikes in general is the clumsy design of the chaindrive it sticks way to much out to the side if they made a really big bike model it would be more in place with this chain drive im not sure if it wouldnt be possible to design a shaft drive to the rear wheel ala bmw style but the green kawasaki look great with the front and rear suspension i have the street bike 8420 a somewhat larger and more complicated set and will probably add the motocross bike to my collection soon it would be great if lego could make a line of bikes like they do the ferrari line front
i saw this set at my tru for only 2000 now i might go get it thanks sinner for another nice review quote hoped to find a figure the right size for it but none of mine would fit well just sit your booty down and ride it wourself  okay well maybe if you have a bionicle lying around or a halo figure
a very good review thanks sinner that´s really a pretty cool model very detailed with useful parts too hmm perhaps that one´s gonna get the first technic set i´ll buy beside that 4481 hailfire droid um thank you sinner
best review of a lime green technic dirt bike ever really it is i just dont understand the allure of the bike very much where does the fabuland fig go anyway very insightful review thanks for taking the time and effort to review it for us im not really interested in the set but wanted to support my buddy since i know how much work you put into these now i shall go read the cherry picker one i look forward to it because theres a walrus in it lasse d on apr 22 2008 0455 pm said it must be cold in that room nice shirt but the vertical hold is broken
thanks everyone for your comments thanks lasse d for that picture too ickelpete on apr 22 2008 0609 am said i wonder how it would look if you replaced the gear on the back wheel with a smaller one ill try to take a photo this weekend hinckley on apr 23 2008 0810 am said best review of a lime green technic dirt bike ever really it is i just dont understand the allure of the bike very much where does the fabuland fig go i did try to find a figure any figure that would fit my final fantasy ones were too small and the galidor girl one looked silly as it made he look saddle sore hinckley on apr 23 2008 0810 am said it must be cold in that room nice shirt but the vertical hold is broken front on apr 23 2008 0859 am said i must say thats a nice collection of motocross bikes the employe is displaying building technic is such a specialist dicipline i think it takes a lot of patience to finalize the design of a model even such a relative simpel one as this cute bike front indeed it would i marvel at how they are explained so relatively simply in the instructions it must take a lot of tweaking to have the model easy to assemble
sinner on apr 23 2008 1037 am said ill try to take a photo this weekend well i took the photo but didnt get around to posting it here it is with a smaller gear i think it looks better the problem is that its too tight and it doesnt rotate as freely anymore adding another link makes it too loose thus the set is probably the way it is as its the gear that fit best
great review i never have been interested in this set i am saving my money for a grey technic set or thatt technic ferrari set
great review sinner i bought this set a few weeks ago personally i prefer the alternative model of the flatbed truck
sinner on apr 22 2008 0849 pm said i didnt know you liked technic i look forward to seeing this rig well its mostly from the mindstorms robotics side honestly if i bought this it would be my first technic set ever
imperialscouts on apr 23 2008 1104 am said well its mostly from the mindstorms robotics side honestly if i bought this it would be my first technic set ever another illusion shattered interestingly ive never bought a mindstorms set as i have enough programming to do for work without doing it for fun i have been tempted though
sveltecorps on apr 30 2008 1044 pm said and what everyones been waiting for the skullies  three of em and a conquistador skellie  very cute note the backs of the crystal head have a plumesized hole  or maybe thats just where they injected the blue brainplastic spooky i love these skulls i wasnt sold from the initial pics but they have a very creepy smile and the head shape is just weird with the large eyes its kind of homer simpsonesque they reminded me more of the movie coneheads but i think your description is more accurate looking forward to the rest of the review
thanks sveltecorps i was really hoping that the conquistador helmet would end up being silver in the final set but i suppose its good to know that the helmet is being porduced again anyway and is the armour the skellie is wearing pearl gold thanks again i look forward to the rest of the review edit the dark tan baseplate is in fact very nice although the fact that you have to put stickers on it is a real downer but i suppose it is good for those who want it plain edited by tinypiesrus 01 may 2008  0219 am
sveltecorps on may 1 2008 0243 pm said hi tinypiesrus  i love that helmet too if only we had plumes again soon hopefully the armour is pearl silver not gold oh sorry my mistake so is it pearl silver as opposed to metallic silver that sure is an odd little vehicle the engine looks nice enough and the rubber treads are always good to have but other than that it really just looks thrown together thanks again svelte edited by tinypiesrus 01 may 2008  0258 am
thanks for the great review sveltecorps ive been wanting to see this set in detail since it debuted at the conventions i have to say that on the one hand i agree that the minifigures the crystal skulls and the colors are great i even like the waterfall but on the other i kind of think that the set itself is a disappointment it looks like they tried to accommodate design and playability needs but really didnt come through on either so as you pointed out the mid section doesnt really fit in with the other parts and the trap sequence doesnt really flow either but perhaps your right and all will be answered in the film i was surprised at just how empty the temple looked in the photo taken from above they really should have gone the extra mile and made the temple look more like a temple and not worry so much about the action features eh but so it goes but i too am a sucker for tombs and temples so i wont be able to pass it up archaeology on
damn youve convinced me to get it now thanks for the review tan is my favourite colour in lego batbrick away
great your cat is soooooo cute
wout on may 1 2008 1028 am said thank you for the nice review offtopic i heard something on lowlug that tlc cancelled 2624 little set with indy mutt irina and tent have anybody heard something about that that would be not so nice absolute hogwash i wouldnt trust anyone on a forum ive never heard of i dont believe theyd cancel it its still on sh right
the architectureaesthetic design looks like a twelve year olds modification of the real set the parts look good though steve
i brought this set a few days ago and agree with everything you say i would have never noticed that the boat sticker is the set number unless you pointed it out glad to see that one set of fuel can stickers was extra i spent ages looking for a place to put them cool review btw
nice review although you need to use the macro settingaka the flower setting for better pics are you using a digital camera you really need macro the idea is turn it on and hold down on the take picture button halfway until the pic focuses then press it down all the way to take the pic im glad this one also comes with the new uzi i wanted an extra
nice review wilhelm screamer very thorough the pictures are a little dark and blurry though i made a tutorial here for amateur photography tips i also edited your first post to include a link to alexs review great job
adiksalego on may 15 2008 0829 pm said wow simon you got two yummy id be happy if i had two no its just one but extended with the baseplate of 6381 mentioned above and some more plates and small fences alex54 on may 15 2008 1020 pm said looking at the pics ive got a question  is the rescue rig trailer one piece or is it brick build it is one piece not even the wheels come off this trailer is always ready to go and was only used in a slecect number of sets
thank you very much for that fine review of a really classic and wonderful racing set and i really wish that tlc would continue with showing some great alternative models on the back of the boxes just imagine on
i bought this set a few days ago and agree with what you have said about it the trailer is fun to play with but just so plain overall great review
good review a must have for my batman collection are these sets already out in germany
good reviewi think the sets amazing
its on the way and also the buggy
general grievous reviewed by dunamis set 10186 1085 pieces 8995 from lego shop  home build time 35 hours it is the start of summer here in california and along with the weekly deluge of new action films we start to see some of the next wave of star wars lego sets the latest offering from our favorite building toy company is none other than the infamous general grievous no doubt you all know the story of grievous two parts technic and one part human and his hatred of the jedi follow along as we get a closeup view of the mighty general no doubt the observant will wonder why i purchased this set from shop  home instead of my trusty lego store in glendale well it’s really as simple as two things i’ve been traveling a lot and didn’t have time to drive to the store to get it and gas is now 4gallon and i would likely spend more in gas than the 9 shipping cost to get it to me so there you have it the box a gigantic box much larger than expected held the mighty general we’re back to the perforated tabs on the side and two stickers on the front that let the box lift open inside we have 17 bags two manuals and three stickers on a relatively small sticker sheet the manuals the manuals are not terribly thick in fact the second manual is noticeably thinner than the first they come in at 75 and 31pages interesting to note on the back we see the next and more interesting wave of sets later this summer nothing new to report on the manuals as they provide the lego standard of high quality and features we expect  piece callouts  models divided into sections  large images  page numbers since there were links posted to the pdf files of the instructions online i’m sure you can all get an idea of the manual and the parts inventory however for those of you without access to the internet here are photos of the parts inventory pages random manual image features page the pieces the short answer is you get lots and lots of little pieces in white gray and black plus some big pieces in white gray and black mixed in the set is a fair amount of oddball pieces like minifig tools jedi hood and trans yellow dome fear not despite the eclectic collection of parts it all comes together in the end not unlike a typical day at work for me… it is probably worth noting again that there is a heavy amount of technic parts and pieces here the build the build starts off with a rather indepth build of the stand in which general grievous stands on once you think you are done you keep adding on to this rather solid base i bet there are 250 pieces just in the base alone it is quite nice when you get done with it though and really adds to the display i’m glad lego didn’t skimp on the base as it completes the model once you get through all that the rest of the build is a real thumbbruiser anyone who has built a decent size technic set knows the feeling of your thumbs being sore when you are done you get the same effect here it is actually a fun build and i really liked seeing how the designers used all the various pieces to recreate a fairly accurate model of grievous the model is built from the ground up as seen in a few of the progress shots here is what is left over the design the design is quite good and is very accurate some might be disappointed that since this is a technic set we don’t have more articulation in the shoulders and have the ability to separate two arms into four as seen in the movie however it would seem the real intent is for display and not functionality here is a shot of the torso and the detail involved here are grievous’ organs careful observers will note that my model is lacking two “arrow” stickers from the two white chest pieces i failed to see these on the sticker sheet and only grabbed the large grievous sticker so note that there are actually three stickers and not one chest protector and respirator head and arms i was a little disappointed that we got two yellow blades and no green blades on the lightsabers note how all the lightsabers have different hilts which is a nice touch here are some shots of the completed model with a few other sets shown for scale he is actually pretty tall you have the option to remove the top two arms and put in shoulder plates if you so desire detail on the back overall thoughts i’ve been saying for a few years that we should have a technic grievous set and we finally got one designed more as a model and not a fully functional swooshable figure grievous is a tad flimsy you won’t want him to veer too far off his massive and sturdy base it would have been nice to have is cape with him like the technic vader set i do like the size of the model and it is impressive to look at lego star wars system fans will likely want to think twice before purchasing but technic and ucs fans should be satisfied final rating 75 build 810 very good – fun relatively quick build technic fans will be more pleased than others design 810 very good – some nice snot and technic techniques a bit flimsy but the base is kind of cool parts 710 a mixed bag of stuff probably can’t get too many diverse builds from this except for other robot type models price 710 just ok – a bit stiff at 90 usd for a nice display model with limited functionality as always let’s hear your thoughts and feedback
nice review dunamis  i built it two weeks ago on the legoworld speedbuild in oslo and didn´t have time to get the feel during that crazy race i agree with you that the base is nice  sturdy makes it stand real still  i´m looking forward on your next score four eyes arms on copmike
i do a easy answer to you dunamis and just double post cm´s answer i was there as well copmike on may 17 2008 1242 am said nice review dunamis  i built it two weeks ago on the legoworld speedbuild in oslo and didn´t have time to get the feel during that crazy race i agree with you that the base is nice  sturdy makes it stand real still  i´m looking forward on your next score four eyes arms on copmike sturdy on ras
cool i like the idea of using the hood as an organ dunamis reviews on
thanks for that fine review dunamis i really like that set gg´s an interesting and well designed movie character and that lego version of him´s indeed well done and very detailed and although i would wish for a some more functional or playable  feature of move and even splitable arms i guess it´s an already very cool ucs version of that grumpy old kaleesh
quote since there were links posted to the pdf files of the instructions online i’m sure you can all get an idea of the manual and the parts inventory however for those of you without access to the internet here are photos of the parts inventory pages luckily for me i have access to the internet to read this review in the first place seriously though nice review my girlfriend has told me that i cant have this one after we just got through a 3day build of the 10030 star destroyer but im sure i can turn her around eventually 
snice review super nice though i think ill pass on this one i really dislike the head whats with the frame around the neck and the clip under the head that and i dont really care for ucs or technic stuff the base looks nice though
this is a very nice i never gotten to chance to own or buy one of the sw big sets im definitely getting these one
detailed reportthx for sharingi love to see the special parts of ityou persuaded me to buy this
nice review but id rather save my money for the indy and clone wars sets
excellent review as usual brickbitz i really love this set the moonwalker is amazing and the alien craft is really nice too i might get this someday
the rancor on may 18 2008 0638 am said damn i was just about to post a review on this heres the infiltrator with the nice shiny holographic stickers marsmistortinyjpg theres nothing stopping you from posting a review as well
hi yall guess what happened today when walked into my toys r us in fullerton ca just to buy a simple tiny turbo racer what do i see all the agents sets sitting on the shelf ready for the taking i didnt have too much money with me so i just got 2 of 8631 mission 1 jetpack pursuit its a really cool little set so i thought id review this puppy for you i shall proceed in the order of the instructions so lets get started the minifigs lets begin with the minifigs saw fist and agent chase they are really cool some of the coolest minifigs i have seen in a while i took off saw fists wig  chainsaw so you can see his head and cybernetic arm better here is a back view of saw fist and  surprise agent chase has a double sided head one side with his cool mission face with sunglasses and headset and one with his casual bruce wayne type face note though that it is not really the bruce wayne face his wig btw is mutts hairpiece in black very neat poor saw fist seems to be forced to always drag his chainsaw around for it is way too long to just hang down from his shoulder like a normal arm the snowmobile next up we have the snowmobile a sleek little vehicle with only minor design flaws the container with the jewel is attached to the vehicle by a single stud so it doesnt fall off but is easy to pick up in the pic below you can see the only two tiny design flaws thanks to the exhaust pipes the laser cannon or whatever its supposed to be cant be lowered any further than this also the corners of that slopeish piece that the handle bar rests on are sticking out a little at the sides other than that its pretty well done the jetpack finally there is the jetpack imo a name like autogyropack or something would make more sense but whatever although a little bulky the jetpack is very well designed the rotor can be tilted back and at the lower back of the jetpack there is hook with which you can grab the container with the jewel from the snowmobile what i like best about the jetpack is that although it is attached to the minifig in kinda the same way as that of the riddler this one doesnt rotate around so the agent is being held in place steadily see ya later chainsawcyborgdude stickers this set comes with a surprisingly large sticker sheet the reason is that half of it are extra stickers there are two large agents logos and one inferno logo  perfect for agents mocs there are also a star and a small round sticker portraying the number of the mission the star seems to be part of some kind of game where you collect the stars from all sets on an agents id that you get from the mission 5 set i dont know though if you get any gain from this except for becoming a fullstatus lego agent below you can find the list of parts from this set click here for a better quality pic thats pretty much it i hope you liked this review and will run straight to your next toy store to get one or more of this set this was my very first set review so any questions comments or requests any more pics you want me to take would you like me to exchange the chainsaw with something else or do you want me to try the agents new hairpiece out on another fig if so just tell me see ya edited by oky wan kenobi 25 june 2009  0821 pm
thats a great review for your first one i think the jet pack if far to bulky it could do with some minimising but that’s life i assume that you can’t fit a standard hand in the chainsaw arms are the hole would be to large but would you be so good as to confirm this for me overall i quite like the jet ski and the ability to lower the arms to much doesn’t both me how much was it just so i can get an idea of the price finally thanks for posting this review so quickly
thanks for the great review oky wan the two vehicles look quite nice for a small set and the minifigs look great the two sided head is nice although it wouldve been nice if it was a new head rather than the standard frowning face the cyborg looks good nice and cartoony i like the printing on his back the belt on the hips should be useful not to mention the robotic hand i assume that anything that fits into a 1x1x1 cylinder can fit in it i hope so thanks again oky any chance you can get any more sets
thanks guys i really tried to make it a good first review now to answer your questions the robot arm can fit ef robot claws and anything that a minifig can hold in his hand or that would fit into a 1x1x1 cylinder so normal minifig hands are too small to fit tlg is using the robot claw idea for the main villain of the agents line do you still want me to try it out and take pics the price was 1099 usd at the tru i bought it at i bet itss be a dollar less on sh and im sorry but i probably wont get any more sets any time soon i have to save my money for all the other good set that are to come but if i would get another set it would just be the one with the helicopter and the allsilver car if anyone gets this set can heshe please review it thanks any other questions i can answer for you guys edited by oky wan kenobi 18 may 2008  0859 am
omg omg omg im coming to the us in just under two weeks really hope i see them somewhere does anyone know what ny times square toys r us is like for new sets
i love the way the bad guy has a special attachment on the jewel case just to allow the agent to grab it with his hook its like the two of them sat down beforehand and drew up the plans for the vehicle together cyborg ok and then ill make my getaway in the special snowmobile and you can follow me agent and ill scoop up the jewel and return it to foil your plan cyborg perfect see you tuesday dr s
good review thanks oky wan hmm although i really like the villain not just the new arm i think the color is very villanous as all bondvillains with class have minions in uniforms its even possible to fill out their numbers with exoforce grunts of the same color im not that hot for the agent himself his uniform nah it doesnt even look like clothes just give the man a suit or some nifty leather i think ill try to grab some sets from the agents line just for the new parts to begin with mocs may follow who knows when they are available in stores here in sweden havent seen them yet though indiana jones just got here so there might be some further waiting for me now i want to see reviews of the other sets 
hmm interesting set great review i might pick this one up for the wonderful parts vbbn
what a lovely set thanks for that fine review oky wan kenobi the mfs´re wonderful that helipack looks solid and well done and i especially like the slightly asymmetrical design of the neat snowmobile a very playable little set for sure and the most interesting part´s for sure that new cool mf arm
yay oky wan wow the agents line is looking good so far the jetpack is pretty nice and the minifigs my dad was in portland just yesterday and if id have called an hour sooner he might have been able to get to the tru
thanks for the great review oky wan at first i didnt think i liked the agents sets but the more i see them the better i think they look i will definitely pick up 1 or 2 of the sets i really like the jet pack and the figs look great that double face is very nice tlg should make more figs with these faces in my opinion
thank you for the nice review it has some big pieces i dont like but the minifigs are good
mmm this set looks amazing lovely pieces and i actually like the minifig faces that jaw helmet is cool aswel  are those stickers on the crocodile heads or is it printed
thanks for the review this set is wonderful u love the two dark green crocodiles and awesome minifigs especially break jaw that bike is awesome and the base like all agents sets comes with great pieces like the barbed wire orange anything leafy pieces and brown log pieces thanks for the review ill definitely get this one batbrick away
nice set im definately gonna pick it up when i see it i like the design of the base and it comes with lots of usefull an neat pieces
wow thanks for the great review sirnadroj the overall set is what attracted me in the first place that elevated hut and swampy setting just sucked me right in it all looks really nice to me a definite buy that agents head would make a great indy for those opposed to fleshies and that monobrow i mean villain guy looks very er well the monobrow is unique thought i noticed the suit looks a bit skin tight in the crotchal area dont look at me like that you saw it too anyway the helmets the best part about the villain great for warhammer 40000 orks peace
i always joked that our house would have a moat around it with mechanical alligators now i can build the house in lego thanks sirnadroj for the review and pictures this is definitely my favorite agents set
great review and a good confirmation of exactly what i suspected this is a parts line for me much like exoforce before it this will be the theme i pick up when im out of other things or its on sale plus those dark green alligators bring tears of joy to an old pirate alice on may 22 2008 1243 am said i always joked that our house would have a moat around it with mechanical alligators you were joking what about the monkeys and the miniature golf course dont ruin my dreams 
agentrick57 on may 23 2008 0917 am said why do all of the reviews that we have for agents sets have the agents getting hurt is this a new trend no its an old trend and its because villains are cooler actually it could be longsimmering resentment towards the nothighlyregarded alpha team dino attack sets bubbling forth see dr luckys hilarious post here for an example of what i mean im sure the new agents will learn to fight back soon
does anyone know if the turbo car chase is out yet
grevious on may 23 2008 0954 am said indead the only reason to get this set is if you couldnt afford the batcave back in 2006 and want a mr freeze fig for a cheap price and anyone who did get that kit really have no reason whatsoever to get this ill get it i admit the vehicles are extremely poorly designed i mean really poorly designed but the mrfreeze fig is fantastic and i would buy two of this set just for him as his head and gear are very useful for mocing it also comes with some nice pieces like the grappling hook little wheels exhaust pieces and such still a pretty bad set build wise but it has atleast inspired me to make my own batbuggy thanks for the review theriddler appreciated batbrick away
as others have said this really is a set for those that didnt buy the batcave thus i want it the cars are pretty horrid though thanks for the review theriddler
pretty nice review for a first time theriddler next time though if your camera has it use the macro function little flower icon and perhaps a tripod that should get rid of any blur and provide you with better pictures apart from that a good little review keep up the good work
thanks for the reveiw the figs are bloody great but those cars are a bit well ill put it blantly retarded although they shall be good after some modding and whats with that grapple hook does it even have a rope so i guess batman will hokk it to mr freeze so his ride looks more ugle anyway can you pleese take some pics of the figs
thats a great set itd be even better if it were sold as two separate little cars they remind me of the dozens of little lego cart vehicles i got as a kid those were always fun quick builds that resulted in lots of cool play i think this set is aimed more at kids and in that respect its a pure winner it doesnt hurt that you can get freeze and the newly designed batman both in this set for a reasonable price
thanks the penguin and more pics on monday
thanks for the review i dont know if i would get this set though the cars are not that great and the price is a little too high
i got this yesterday and built it this morning apart from the figs it is very crappy mr freezes buggy is ok but the bat buggy is easily the worst vehicle ive seen for years colours are all over the place the grappling hook feels cheaply made the inclusion of those odd pearl silver parts which have been in the exoforce sets seem especially random here the terrible bionicle flame piece its the first lego vehicle ive built where ive immediately had the urge to disassemble it and pretend i never bought it really i only got it for mr freeze so i shouldnt complain but still its a real step backwards the comparable catwoman dragster set was heaps better the penguin sub is sweet though thanks for the review anyway
cant wait for the review the car is ly
yay cant wait for your review i plan to get this and the giant truck the brick rat on may 23 2008 0731 pm said 2this set contains the best lego sound brick ever its just begging to be incorporated into my arkham asylum what is a sound brick
the brick rat on may 23 2008 1031 pm said 1my set came with defective instructions in 2 places pages are missing and duplicates of other pages repeated for instance the car instructions are missing steps 1621 fortunately i was able to make out what pieces went where in the missing steps by studying the illustration in step 22 i hope you have better luck with your instructions everything was just fine with my directions sounds like you just ran into some bad luck there my friend quote 2this set contains the best lego sound brick ever its just begging to be incorporated into my arkham asylum i agree 100 and i didnt even see it had a sound brick until i read this last night usually lego promotes stuff like that pretty loudly on the packaging not here though
thanks deinonychus for another great review i must say i do look forward to people uploading reviews of new sets it really helps me decide if i want it or not if its a good set imo then it adds to the excitement of picking up one myself this i must say is one of those sets the only concern for me like alot of others is the price i will just have to wait and see and continue to look at these photos deinonychus has provided for us so much for thinking the agent line was going to be weak i wonder if the exoforce style code brick number plate is a hint from tlc as to what will replace exoforce at the end of this year jb
thanks for the great review im really liking these agents sets the more i see them the car seems to have alot of features its to bad the the ejection seat doesnt work as well as one would hope oh well makes me want the big rig even more now
great review deinonychus i really like it can someone record the sound os the sound brickmaybe on youtube i really want to hear it this sets are really cool deino can you post a picture of the agent card it comes with
great w im totaly gonna buy this set
dragonator on may 25 2008 0821 pm said thanks for the review whitefang i love these sets and i wish they were available in nz so far it seems they may never come here but i can sit and hope i like the look of them after your makeover a real skeleton army there did you say youve bought 12 thts lots of skelies are you planning a big moc or something no problem i had bought it last month i thought it was so simple to do a review for this was looking through the thread then i realised there is a request for it it was an unexpected shipment that send to singapore it came in very limited quantity most of the battlepacks were snapped within a day or two when it arrived well i am thinking of building something big in the future its just a plan that i have not decided yet for me i always love to see the beauty of a big army with different battalions forming a kingdom thats why i always buy many many sets that have figures that attracts me and for this battlepack it served a very good purpose for it
thanks whitefang i love this battlepack but can only really hope to get one still great accesories and a spider thats great batbrick away
no offence make this 799 can too expensive to be coming with only a few figures 20 earns you the same amount of figs plus a catapult barricade two horses and a jousting divider
mack on may 26 2008 0130 pm said you cannot say that the battle pack contains the same amount of stuff that the other two sets have and therefore should be priced the same it just seems that lego is ripping off canadian army builders to me if the battle pack contained a small catapult or wall so that it contained about the same amount of stuff that the other sets had it would be fair it seems stupid that you will only get minifigs from one set while you can get about the same amount of minifigs plus a bunch of other stuff from two other equally priced sets that’s why to me these battle packs are a rip off because of what they contain imho the battle packs seem to be only worth about 10 dollars mack i can understand your concern when pricing is concerned pricing is always a big issue for us to determine whether to buy or not to buy a certain set in a particular country pricing varies differently across different countries such as us europe canada australia and etc this is something very hard for us to decide on we cant be sure why tlc placed their pricing strategies this way well i think we should appericate what tlc is trying to do for us by not using price as the only factor to judge whether to buy this set or not at least i am sure there are many of us trying to request for battlepacks to muster armies for their mocs armies collection and etc different people have different judgements towards different sets and different themes i respect your opnion imo lets dont let price be the only determined factor to decide whether to purchase a particular set or not instead consider an array of factors that is offered however i do know that consumers like me and you are always affected by price iamded on may 26 2008 0140 pm said thanks for the review whitefang your additions look great i like your mace much better than the use of a small technic cog your looks much sturdier and that helmet looks really great on skellie soldiers i never thought to use that before very cool indeed iamded i am glad you enjoyed the review and my slight modifications that mace was a much looking weapon it looks much firm than the orignal look the design was inspired from dwarf mine and dwarf mine defender i would not want to have so many troll flags hanging around the nose cone helmet was to give the soliders a whole new look to me it retains the classic look yet it belongs to present theme suitable for my skeleton elite guards
for those of you who buy so many of this and the other battle pack with crownies what do you do with all of them is this simply to create a largescale army or do you plan to build large castle scenes with all the figs id love to see some pictures on the share your castle army thread
thebrickster on may 28 2008 0941 am said thanks for sharing these closeup images of this battlepack whitefang i actually had this set in my hand at legoland cal and could not decide if i wanted it im currently out of castlemode with my large indy jungle set up on the table and creating ghost train mocs that are starting to line up on the bookshelves once i buy the troll ship ill want to start collecting these great fig sets thanks again for sharing brickster you should try and get back into castlemode there are so many great stuffs waiting for you such as dwarf mine tower raid and etc however i can understand that the problem of space is always the key issue without space it is hard for us to keep it on display for bigscale mocs or for storage purpose i will be waiting for you to get your troll warship too hope one day soon enough we will be able to view a castle moc from you too exobuilder on may 28 2008 0942 am said thanks for the nice review whitefang i got the knights bp just for the scared face thanks exobuilder i did not know that the crown battlepack has a minifig with the scared face i hope it will reach my shores soon once again robbo on may 28 2008 1007 am said sorry to be going a little off topic here but personally i have just bought 40 crowny battle packs for the only reason that i am running out of space to store the left over blocks about 500 of my crownies came from sets mentioned above on sale which would have been cheaper than the battle packs thanks for the review whitefang but i dont think i will be buy any skeleton battle packs that army is large enough thats lots of battlepack share us some images on your collection too i love to see such big army thebrickster on may 28 2008 1121 am said for those of you who buy so many of this and the other battle pack with crownies what do you do with all of them is this simply to create a largescale army or do you plan to build large castle scenes with all the figs id love to see some pictures on the share your castle army thread for me i will use these battlepack for army building purpose i always feel that every kingdom needs a considerable amount of soldiers to defend their kingdom therefore most of the time the amount of soldiers will dictate how strong that kingdom is in my collection in the future i hope to build large castle scenes combined all playsets armies everything together and developed a kingdom scene of course that is just a dream for now i am still currently not able to afford much space and time to do such big scale project at the moment meanwhile for this great castle theme i am storing them at the moment and take it out when the time is ripe one day soon i hope i can post an image or two of my armies edited by whitefang 28 may 2008  0850 am
hi gang as you all know indiana jones iv has just debuted and tlg has released a set depicting the incan temple 7627 from the films climax but lego beat harrison ford george lucas steven spielberg and company to the punch by nine whole years with johnny thunders adventures in the amazon ancient ruins the vitals year of release 1999 parts count 453 msrp 8000 the set included eight figures from left two skeletons dr lightning gail storm gabarros achu johnny thunder and señor palomar on the far right is my new sigfig el conde voltio villar construction begins with dr lightning and his jeep its a sturdy adventurersstyle vehicle with fatter tires at the rear for better traction next is gabarros and his unusual boat the hull is from bellevilleparadisa sets where it is usually pink or white tlg ought to have put it in the pirate theme as it is a nice intermediate size in this set it is a small steamship the temple is built on modular 8x8 green bricks which fit into square holes in the baseplate this is the treasure room this square has a nasty doublespear trap careful this is the top section of the temple crowned by achu the mummified incan more modular sections these are from the front of the temple site across the river from the main building el conde you are too beautiful a woman to be wandering alone in the jungle miss storm please allow me to accompany you gail storm im with johnny and i have a cutlass el conde ill be on my way heres the finished temple with all parts in place now for the traps hmm a giant ruby to bring home to the king ¡uf that was embarassing miss storm saw me fall and now ive fallen again i had better rest here before something worse happens ¡chispas thats it im leaving this place why me why the verdict this is a fine set a set whose bare partsprice ratio does not accurately reflect the intricacy of its design nor the rarity of its parts i had to buy replacements for some of them and let me tell you they are pricey that green baseplate 14 the little dark gray saucepan near the fire not available on bricklink at any price the brown boat hull vhtf with this set parts quality trumps parts quantity and the minifigures are wonderful theres not a dud in the bunch with the possible exception of the very common dr lightning and even he is not bad when you factor in the coherence of the color scheme and the brilliant traps it is obvious that 5986 is a classic 1010 edited by whitefang 27 november 2008  0533 am this review is added to the index
ive always wanted this set ever since it came out in 99 i have never seen it close up unless you count driving over it in lego racers 2 so thanks for the pictures and the great review voltio on may 26 2008 0443 am said el conde you are too beautiful a woman to be wandering alone in the jungle miss storm please allow me to accompany you gail storm im with johnny and i have a cutlass el conde ill be on my way hehe
a real classic thanks for that nice and funny review voltio a well designed set very playable with a lot of nifty traps a very good use of that raised baseplate and really nice crafts the mf characters´re excellent too and although the color scheme´s great and original especially with all these neat printed pieces it´s perhaps the only part of that set that looks a little out of date today nevertheless the set´s plain charming and shows clearly that tlc don´t need licenses to do some distinct adventurer sets
great review i saw the instructions of this set but never atracted me until now a great set an a excelente review
thanks for the awesome review voltio el conde is the man
voltio on 26 may 2008  0343 am said i really like your blue gorillapod camera stand in the background edited by bubble 30 january 2013  0407 am
haha i love seeing reviews where sigfigs and minifigures from the set present the set im looking foward your next reviews d
the images are obsolete please fix it
welcome to cardinal bricks review of 7736 its a small set but as i bought it the other day i felt that it probably did merit a short review the box is ofcourse far larger than necessary theres plenty of air inside the contence is one bag and the instruction booklet you could proably build it inside the bag if the desire took you we have one new coastguard with the slightly stubly head found in the castle range and a transclear visor the build was challanging and arduious the final product is quite nice at one 300 its a good set only 50p more than an impulse set and with enough extra parts to justify the increase in the price a good set for a little gift or so on the buggy moves well theres not that much to say really for i cant really think of additional models to build with the parts but then what do you expect for the price edited by cardinal brick 26 may 2008  0647 pm
thank you very much for the review cardinal brick thats indeed a very nice little set klausdieter
i might buy a second one of that set and build it in the bag i just wanna prove that it is possible
so i just piced up a new digital camera and i thought what better way to try it than doing a review of my newest set the new 7738 coast guard helicopter itsmy first review so go easy on me lets start off with the small stuff first the mini figs you get 4 figs total two helicopter pilots a diver and a civilan to rescue the torsos are nothing new on the pilot and diver same ones as in the last coast guard line but i like the colors alot better in this coast guard line than the previous generation the yellow and blue really work well together and the coloring on the badge looks great the civilian looks to be just a dock worker with an overall torso and a beenie the diver has nice vented helmet and a pair of flippers that suits his duty perfect next we have an absolute work of lego art the rescue raft the orange flaps can be moved back for easy entry to the raft as well as the white support beams with the caution tape i put support in perenthaces cause they really dont support anything just there to fill in the gaps at the top of the raft is a red locator beacon ccommunications antenna and a cargo loop for lifting the raft lets move on to the interior of the raft not much here but you can see the techinc beam that attaches to the top loopand to the floor of the raft so far this has proven to be very sturdy and has supported the full weight of the raft quite well you can also see the white box that holds the equipment of the raft here you can see the life saver tube heres a shot with our dock worker peaking out the side the raft says max ocupants 4 but with the storage box that might be a tight fit now lets move on to the helicopter in my opinion this is one of the best helicopters tlc has come out with to date i really felt they captured the look and proportions of a real coast guard helicopter it uses a lower hull and tail section of the new airliner and cargo airplane it really seems to work well with this application the engines have good detail using new cheese graders as vents as well as the new engine stacks that come in the new speed racer sets the rotors also appear to be new as well lets move on to the cockpit we have two seats for our pilots with a sticker sheet for intruments on a flat 4 wide plate theres also an antena being used as a flight stick another shot with our pilots at the helm now lets moveon to the high lihgt of this heavy lifting machine the med bay and lifting winch httpwwwbrickshelicopter020jpg here you can see the winch arm at rest along with the medical strechter the bad part is that the med strechter doesnt include the ussually included fold away wheels heres a shot with the winch arm extened ready for rescue in the second shot you can see the drum that the wire coils up in it coils up via a recently new power functions pull back motor to operate just pull out the winch cable hook on your load and presse this orange button on the side the bad part of the new power functions winch is that although its very smooth in its operation its not very strong it will only lift the raft a couple inches before it runs out of torque it also has a tendency to want to pull the crane arm backin while its lifting it doesnt matter if its a light load or heavy load the bay doors open on both sides for easy postioning of the figures and accses to the strechter here we have our diver looking over his rescuee nice and roomy if you dont mind a crane arm being in your way at 3999 and a peice count of 445 i felt this set was a great good considering what your getting the raft construction is very creative and is probbly the highlight of the set by itself the helicopter is probbly one of the best if not the best helicopter tlc has ever came out with if you can get over its size in a scale of one to five price peice count playability design overall 5 i would have given it a full 5 out of five but since the winch cant pull the raft all the way it didnt fell it right even with this minor flaw i still highly recomend this set
nice review a must have for my city collection
thank you very much for the nice review 5150 lego the helicopter is  apart from that it is very very big and that it does not include any interior  a very nice set  the most i like the life raft becuase it is simply  nevertheless i dont know if i buy it probably not  but its very nice two questions  where can you fasten the stretcher on to haul it up and down is the motor working with batteries klausdieter edited by klausdieter 28 may 2008  0919 pm
i could tell from the pictures that a lot maybe all the designs on the raft were stickers in the whole set are there any printed parts besides the torsos or is it all stickers
5150 lego on may 29 2008 0712 am said thanks everyone for the nice coments its nice to finaly have a camera that can take some decent photos makes doing reviews much more enjoyable there is no real way to lift up the stretcher due to the crane arm being in the way there really isnt any room for any kind oflifting straps the set does include a 1x2 plate with a hinge for the diver to stand on so at least he can hold on to someone the crane lifts them up and then he can put them in the strechter thats my guess at least as far as the motor i dont believe it uses bateries since you pull out the motor and all the button does is recoil the winch line back in i have to say it does a very good job of that and is very smooth as long as you dont have anything to heavy one detail i forgot to meation is the shark its nothing new just the basic shark lego has had around for nealy 2 decades but it was a detail nothing less thank you very much for that information 5150 lego
this is a very good review thank you but i have some questions about the grey new parts in the life raft are they 1x1 like their counterparts with the clips or 1x2 and can they be held by a minifig by the handle if so these could be very useful for brickbuild weapons  tools also im looking forward to some orange eta 2 jedi interceptor mocs now who wants to be the first to make one btw which jedi has an orange eta 2
thanks and yes that is a new torso soon the 7886 wil be reviewd who wants the second riddle edited by theriddler 28 may 2008  0211 pm
uncle jokers cheap technic missile surprise great review however there isnt much appeal to the set after you see what the surprise is though i can modify the truck to have an evil gasice cream making interior
i have been thinking about buying this set just for the tumbler and now i am sold one more set for the shelf great review
4olic on aug 28 2009 0659 am said if you do not have this set i highly recomend it if i could i would trust me i havent seen one with figs for under 200 looking at this review actually makes me sad
thank you for clearing that up i felt that it was ok to review an old topic as stated rather than just go ahead and start a new one a shame that this set as all other batman sets have gone up so highly in value but still all things considering general after market lego price hikes it is still a wonderfull set even with its market value today that is if you can ignore the mrsp
i too thought the jokers van was the pleasant surprise of this set the tumbler looks good yes until you see it in person its grossly oversized they should have made it closer to a regular car size like the movie because this one is a monster
i bought this off ebay while not having been collecting space as a child it was mainly wild west and city i have decided upon reading kdogs mtron bar brawl mania strip in his space comic to buy as many mtron sets and figures i could find except i got distracted and bought some different sets as well to start off with heres a picture of the box heres a general shot showing the entire set a front view the buggy another shot of the buggy without the minifig the flyer the flyer without the minifig mtron crate with some equipment and hoses i dont know the use of the hoses though  the cockpit open the cockpit closed with the crew the magnetic crane another shot of the crane rear view with hatch open one of the side slots that can carry either the buggy or the flyer top view of this excellent vehicle excellent for getting spyrius or blacktron out of your way  final shot excellent set one of the biggest space ground vehicles and one of the best sets made by lego undoubtably better than its newer counterpart the mt101 armored drilling unit a great addition to any collection and has a lot of cool neat features that make it have a lot of playability simply excellent five out of five
cp5670 on may 28 2008 0852 pm said first time ive heard of that what are they going to do for the train couplings new couplings are going to be available soon there is a thread with pictures of the new couplings here
joebot on may 28 2008 0731 pm said kinda sad to think that with tlcs recent ban on magnets in their products since when is that the new train couplings have magnets only with a special casing anyways mtron is one of the greatest space factions with mega core magnetiser as my favourite set of these guys even though i do not own it  the only thing that bothers me is the lack of reachable controls for the minifigs to drive their vehicles but iirc it is the same with a lot of other spacesets as well
sinner on may 28 2008 1135 pm said care to explain why personally i think that aside from the colour scheme the new one is far better why suspension more enclosed cockpits buglike appearence i suppose its a matter of personal opinion though i just thought that the mt101 was very skeletal and couldnt really steer that well although i do like it also the mcm has a better design in my view as the wheels are closer together making it look a lot more tankish than the mt101 also space in the rear isnt wasted on having a shuttle cp5670 on may 29 2008 0252 am said as for the hosejetpack things i always assumed that they were either welding torches or flamethrowers take your pick hmm well they dont have much else to defend themselves with and i think in the uk the mcm was marketed as a mobile recovery center fluyt on may 29 2008 0356 am said anyways mtron is one of the greatest space factions with mega core magnetiser as my favourite set of these guys even though i do not own it  the only thing that bothers me is the lack of reachable controls for the minifigs to drive their vehicles but iirc it is the same with a lot of other spacesets as well yeah they could have used the normal levers instead of the pronged two piece things at the front of the cockpit but there is certainly a lot to mod joebot on may 29 2008 0425 am said but the old mtron round magnet pieces are presumably discontinued shoot guess that bl and ebay are the only sources now thanks for your input
inertia on may 29 2008 0844 am said i just thought that the mt101 was very skeletal and couldnt really steer that well although i do like it also the mcm has a better design in my view as the wheels are closer together making it look a lot more tankish than the mt101 also space in the rear isnt wasted on having a shuttle thanks for an answer ill shut up now so we can focus on your review
sinner on may 29 2008 0520 pm said no but we especially imperialshadows are working on new indexes supposedly the space one was my job okay just dont forget this when it goes up i like self promotion i have about 10 old space sets coming in from ebay and gonna review them soon as well so that should be some good additions to the index when it goes up thanks
asuka on may 30 2008 0217 am said of course i don´t want to offend some technic lovers and although i always was more the system kind of guy why can´t they just use some technic beams with studs at least thats because of cost the older beams needed a four sided mold and the newer ones need only a two lego do seem to be using both types more as of late though asuka on may 30 2008 0217 am said i grew up with just imagine with pictures of alternative models on the box and i don´t think it´s that easy especially for younger kids to mod some of these terrific blownup sets like it once was with sets like this one here implosion off ive never heard an official word perhaps i should raise a topic but i think that they dont show them any more because it became a support nightmare what do i mean i bet tlg was tired of letters and calls saying timmy cant make this model shown on the box can you send instructions and the extra parts i know that for some recent models they were designed but not published how do i know this the creator said so
sinner on may 30 2008 0138 am said thats because of cost  ive never heard an official word perhaps i should raise a topic but i think that they dont show them any more because it became a support nightmare what do i mean i bet tlg was tired of letters and calls saying timmy cant make this model shown on the box can you send instructions and the extra parts of course it´s a money issue my question was more rhetorical but i still don´t like how they sacrifice inherent set design on the altar of cost saving efforts to be even more correct i don´t understand why they try to make extraordinary cool looking sets with a pretty weak inner life yeah they want to sell sets with something that looks exciting on the box art but lego was and fortunately is with many recent sets too always more than just an impressive spaceship or sf tank vehicle it´s the sum of the set itself and its parts and what you can do with it that makes out the full fun of it the best thing you can do with a new set beside some ucs sets perhaps is to mod the set according to your own likings this is where just imagine begins and how kids start to learn how to moc at least it was like that to me individualizing official sets and looking on some cool alternative models gave me my first ideas and helped my imagination and skills to grow back in these days when i was a wee child books movies and tv series as a source of inspiration just came a little later i can see many people complaining about how to make the alternative models yes but just stop using them on the box art´s a very poor solution and a dangerous one too at least in long terms of course i know that you know all these things too sinner i just think it´s a shame and a risk too because tlc´s perhaps sacrificing more than they might know by yet building with bricks is the main attraction of lego not just some cool crafts to play around with others can do this too and maybe better than tlc if the kids of today ever forget about the fascination of being imaginative tlc´ll only lose in the end
a great and very creative work i especially like the speed boat and the smaller car just splendid
thank you very much asuka but i get the hint last
harley  mistah j i want to preface my review by admitting that i’m an unrepentant harley quinn fanboy i’ve been enamored with the character since she first appeared in batman the animated series back in the 90’s and i’ve since followed her misadventures through her introduction into the regular batman series during no man’s land into her own series and even on the shortlived and notsogood birds of prey tv show so please excuse any proharley bias so down to business the 267 piece set retails for 30 us 35 at toys r us and builds up very fast and easy it consists of batman’s bat cycle harley’s hammer truck and brand new batman and harley quinn minifigs there is also no lack of weapons in addition to the usual bag of bataccessories and guns the set also comes with a pair of gray revolvers batman in this set has the new “armor” torso print and the hips are the same color as the legs hinting that this is supposed to represent the movie style batsuits more so then the traditional comic book “underwear over tights” look harley quinn is a very cool looking minifig and i haven’t grinned so much at a new batman character figure since my first batman minifig a couple years ago the figure is very true to the character and the torso has been accented with a few shape lines to try and distinguish her as a female despite the boxy body harley’s jester cap is an interesting new piece it seems to me at least to be made of a slightly different grade of plastic then we’re used to it’s molded in red and painted with black and white and it comes packed in its own separate little baggie i expect that this piece may have cost lego a little more then usual to produce harley also has a buildable accessory a giant mallet sure she can’t stand up all that well unless it’s held in specific ways but it’s neat and most importantly it’s funny it’s especially fun for smacking the everloving crap out of other minifigs with the bat cycle is in bag number one and is a very fast build this isn’t some little japanese sport bike like nightwing’s cycle this monster is almost a car and seems to pack just the right amount of intimidation for the caped crusader to exploit thanks to the thick tires two in front one in back it stands up just fine on its own and rolls very well the huge exhaust pipes are a nice touch and give the thing a look of engine power the only real flaw is the inclusion of the flickfire missiles mounted on the sides but as with any lego model they can be easily left out without hurting the look of the vehicle the hammer truck is the bulk of this set and a lot more fun then it looks of the monster truck persuasion the vehicle is designed and built with a surprising level of solidity the axle mounts are particularly impressive the big wheels and tires just beg you to drive this thing right over the bat cycle or batman the megamallet gimmick is also a surprise not so much for its technical complexity there isn’t any really but for the fact that once you start turning the knob at the rear to swing the mallet back and forth it’s really a lot of fun there are some low points to the truck design again the flickfire missiles are tacked on and there’s a cargo cratebed set into the back for harley’s loot of jewels the crate would have looked a lot better molded in black in brown it breaks up the look of the truck a little speaking of which the look of the truck is very pleasing the red and black harley quinn color scheme works really well on the vehicle there are a few stickers here and unfortunately the diamond patterned ones are applied over multiple bricks the rest however are great not only does she have an “i love joker” bumper sticker but she has a joker playing card taped to her dash i guess serving as a picture of her beloved puddin’ there is also a sticker for activation of the hammer which boldly shouts hit me this is a fun set a neat new batman vehicle and a big truck with lots of playability the harley minifig is a musthave for any batfan and if you only get one of the batman sets this year i’d recommend this one the price versus piececount on this set is a little bit of a deterrent though this might not be the best set for collectors on a budget or people looking for something completely new and innovative but anyone buying this for a child can rest assured that the kid will get your money’s worth out of the set through its play value when added together and averaged out the pros and cons of this set combine to give it a score of out of 5 even if harley herself is a clean 6 out of 5
looking forward to the review this looks to be the best of the new batsets funnily enough it took me a while to realise ms quinn whacking deino was not on the boxart batbrick away
i bought this set too didnt get a chance to put it together yet but the harley fig is awesome anyway looking forward to your review
quote looking forward to the review this looks to be the best of the new batsets gasp are you kidding me honestly i hate this set the batbike looks far too blocky and that hammer truck looks super shoddy and thrown together the only real reason id get it at all would be for the harely quinn figure  but id probably just get her separately on bricklink besides the tumbler and robins jetski sets look far better to me they actually seem to have great vehicle designs no new villian figures i know but still some great old ones er wait a minute oh yeah hope your review gives the real scoop on this kit deino
grevious on may 30 2008 0503 am said gasp are you kidding me honestly i hate this set the batbike looks far too blocky and that hammer truck looks super shoddy and thrown together the only real reason id get it at all would be for the harely quinn figure  but id probably just get her separately on bricklink besides the tumbler and robins jetski sets look far better to me they actually seem to have great vehicle designs no new villian figures i know but still some great old ones er wait a minute oh yeah hope your review gives the real scoop on this kit deino the batbike may look blocky but the hammer truck is by no means thrown together read the instructions it actually has a great assembly add into the fact it has harley great wheels a modable batbike awesome stickers and awesome pieces and id say this was a win the penguin is a bit of a repeat and the tumbler is too big for me either way its a great set batman 08 wasnt nearly as bad as i thought it would be which is great batbrick away
a very nice review thanks deinonychus that batcycle looks pretty neat like a hells bats angels version of that tumbler a really nifty idea the truck looks simply sweet a smooth design and this time tlc´s new habit of vehicle oversizing just works very fine a wonderful and very comical vehicle indeed and harley oh my this bill i´ll have to pay for myself clonecommando007 on may 30 2008 0222 pm said truck flick fire missiles lego have you no sanity sure theyre great but youre putting them on every single action set yeah this starts to become a little annoying these things simply don´t work in a that much satisfying way when i was a child all i needed to play with my mfs were some old fashioned classic space blasters zoom zoom zzzaaap honestly do they really think that this tiny rockets deliver that much fun just imagine on
so down to business the 267 piece set retails for 30 us what but its £30 in the uk why lego why
my set has arived and i have build it what a nice thing anyone want a review for me without blurry pics  who wants the second riddle
hi all so i was at the walmart yesterday and had the munchies and was looking for something to eat somewhere along the line i stopped caring about food and decided to browse the toy department to see what they had legowise usually they have jack squat but on this particular day they had a lot of new sets i impulsively picked this set up along with harley quinns hammer truck and the new little campsite from the indy 4 line i must say when i first saw images of this set i wasnt exactly thrilled or anything i mean i didnt really see anything particularly special about it but after purchasing it i must admit that i would consider it a must buy for any lego fan but enough babbling about myself onward with the review my first of an official set in this picture you can see everything you get with the set i thought the boxart was pretty nice looking the manual on the other hand took somewhat of a beating within the box a common problem with most more recent sets i do have to say that i wish they would at least make some effort in fixing this they could just make a little thin cardboard folder to minimize bending and tears for batman minifig collectors the highlight of this set are the robin and penguin figs previously you could only get them in the pricey batcave set but this set provides a much cheaper alternative one thing you will notice however is that robins hairpiece is a new mold as it is actually a black version of mutts hair from the indy 4 line personally i think it actually looks better than the hairpiece used on the older version of robin as the batcave had before it this set comes with some bricks to make two cute but deadly penguins they help add more charm to an already charming set when youre finished building youll end up with a nice little assortment of extra parts 1 black cheese slope 3 1x1 tile black yellow and white a revolver a technic pin and a 1x1 red round plate heres robins scuba jet its nice and sleek looking notable parts of interest would probably be the green turbine engines my only complaint on this one would have to be the use of decals on the 2x2 round yellow tiles for that type of a part printing seems as though it would have been the best way to go now for in my opinion the best part of the setthe penguins sub this set has more decals than robins scuba jet but they seem more necessary in this case i actually wanted to put the decals on the sub as i think the it looks great with them obviously it looks like a penguin but wow does it ever do it with style it has a lot of interactive features the first of which i will mention being the periscope which raises up and down and for the collectors of parts in new colors it has a few parts in medium orange such as 2x2 tile heres a shot of the bottom of the sub another nifty little feature is how you can lift the top off and fit the penguin inside and there is enough room inside so that you can firmly place top on again and without interference to the movement of the periscope another little feature is the rear springloaded missile you just tilt the small lever toward the front of the sub and it fires and the last small feature are the flickmissiles on each side overall this is a great set with a lot to offer for a decent price a lot of fans might view the only drawback to it as being the use of decals but if you plan on keeping the kit together they make it look really fantastic buy it if you can matt edited by imperialshadows 01 june 2008  1142 am
thanks for the great review brickadier general the sub looks very nice and i like the idea of a raising periscope did the batcave sub have that feature and the details on the sub look very nice the inclusion of the penguin robin and two of those great brickbuilt penguins really confirms that ill be getting this considering that i didnt purchase the batcave however i am rather dissapointed that this set is so similar to the vehicles of penguin and robinin repectively in the batcave set i feel that it only really caters to those who havnt bought the set and i wouldve much appreciated different vehicles overall a very nice set perhaps the best of the 2008 wave despite its lack of originality thank you very much for the review bg
i was never considering getting this set as i dont really like batman but if i found this set and had some money with me i would buy it ii would use it for indiana jones or something and the revolevers and top hats the only problem i see with the boxart is that the penguin is drowning
i see youve also learnt to call dibs looking forward to seeing your review edit oh i see i just arrived early a truely fantastic review you make me not want to pass this set up even though i cant possibly afford it without leaving my beloved castle collecting it really looks like a fun set so many neat vehicles and two laptops i cant wait to see what other sets well see them in thanks again great job peace edited by iamded 31 may 2008  0956 am

great review thanks thats one hell of a set i think lego has reached a certain kind of peak with the design cleverness and fun of this one im so relieved that agents seems to be shaping up to be even better then i thought it was going to beand i thought it was going to be cool to begin with agent charge not only does he look like dash justice but he has the name of one of dashs alpha team squadmates i call shenanigans
woah i got to have this set i shall buy it asap thanks for the review expertly done
excellent review by an excellent reviewer on and excellent set this theme really does seem to be one of tlcs best edited by plural 31 may 2008  0324 pm
nice review the power functions is a nice idea and i ownder if it will appear in any other new sets regarless if i get this i decided to just to get what ever looks good in the shops from now on  im defianltey picking up some of the white visors off bricklink
isnt it a lovely set i too have one modded of course 
so is there some way to get all those motor bits at once or do you have to buy them on their own i dont think ive ever seen them in a store here
thanks for the great review sveltecorps i bought some of the mm last year and ended up selling them off for sw this new set has got me interested in mm again partly due to your cool review one question though did you get this set in aust shops or sh just wondering if i should be looking for it yet edit sorry just saw your other post saying it was ordered from sh cheers isc edited by i scream clone 04 june 2008  0808 am
really nice review i love those sweet looking power functions on it if only the orange bits could be replaced then you could have a futuristic and motorized jungle cutter anyway the alien bit was disturbing but the overlytall new commanders look very very cool all in all a great set but i wont be able to buy it because in a few days sh will become 600 richer and my wallet will writhe around in pain on the floor
well title says it the description youll understand later i ordered this off of sh last tuesday and oddly enough its listed on sh as mx81 hypersonic airplane id like to apologize for the random horrible faded pics i took the review outside and the clouds kept shifting changing the lighting and then i had to go inside because it started raining its been raining for a week its raining now as i type this so i foolishly went outside to take pics the front of the box not bad as far as boxes go it features a liftup tab which shows the various functions back of the box still not much to say two manuals i think this is just right not too thick but not too many manuals either oddly enough the box came with a little folded up piece of paper telling us not to mix the bags it comes sorted into 4 bags by the way minifigures the set features 3 normal mm figs 1 normal jellie and one of the new commanders i really like this guy he has a few issues like his hands being stuck sideways and still being hollow but still a great improvement hell make a lovely addition to any halloween moc stickers the set comes with a fairly big dss for the spacecraft pretty normal but i do like the dragon sticker then suprises of suprises a technicolor sticker sheet for the aliens how cool is this huh the tops of the actual stickers are shiny which is hard to see in the pic even the bottom is shiny who said stickers cant be cool the mining craft the little guy is pretty cute and well built my only gripe is that theres nowhere to spin the drill it seems so lifeless without a feature the alien craft youd think a commander would be important enough to have a seatbelt rather than be stabbed with a clip and stuck on the ship like those other grunt aliens i think this thing has some potential shiny stickers different body shape and when you look at those engines this thing could be an alien corvette but then you look at the back pretty bare no flares or anything its a cool little craft but it justlacks the modules these things have some potential as well with some modding they could be pretty cool unfortunetly its pretty boxy there are no engines and the wings are too small the top is pretty nice though the greebles are all right the controls as usual are a sticker pretty spacious mind you the cockpit doesnt stay flush with the body though the front plate underneath it can be easily replaced with a brick to fix that im not gonna comment on this the main body too bad the labratory isnt much of a lab a transred panel and some tray thing are all that compose the lab i was expecting more but true to form this mars mission set has no impressive interior to speak of there is a lot of space though so it shouldnt be hard to mod phew the lab folds up like so pretty simple and would allow access to the lab if there was one and then we have this thing what is it defense laser communications array satellite tv the modules connect like so sorry out of place too bad the pins stick out various pics as you can see this thing has more of those bars than an att commercial there you understand the topic description now  the rear it uses a white city plane wing for thewings when i first saw the prototype pics i thought they slanted downwards that wouldve been really cool ah now to the platform from the position of the drill i think this could be a really cool turret location when i mod it to more military space back to the bars if we had space monkeys theyd love this this set has more bars than a jungle gym  here we see the button that drops the platform pretty clever and its not in the way best of all it really works really well actually good job tlc 2 more bars and a shooter mechanism jeeze this is really setting itself up for a joke a shooter mechanism walks into a bar never mind here we have the handle that allows you to pick it up safely a good idea but its placed waaaay to far back way off the center of balance you have to hold on to it pretty well to keep it angled up though it does stop your hands from getting in the way of the platform ah the platform in action this is really a neat little feature not only can the ship land in a reduced footprint but it also prevents the nice white paint job from getting red dust all over it its centered pretty well too and you dont have to worry about knocking it over just dont shove it back at all here we have the latch when the button on top is pushed this gets pulled inward which pulls out of this hole and allows it to swing neatly down good luck and happy mining again sorry for the lack of inprogress review i wouldve liked to take pics of the mechanism and so on but typical of the mm sets you cant really take it apart well this is really a nice set which can hopefully be upgraded with a better lab with little difficulty some of my military mod plans include strip the lab and install a command center get rid of lots of bars the thing has more bars than alcatraz install some turrets this is a big command ship so why all the forwardfacing weapons itll need some aa defense mod the landing platform to be a troop dropper with installable aa turret mod the cockpit pods to be more aerodymic so thats all folks shall i include one last bar joke
i appreciate your review mr mandalorian but why the negativity id try to find more positives about the set instead of kinda criticizing it after each picture i personally think it looks freakin awesome the size is very impresive and i nearly fell of my chair when i saw the first pics earlier this year its quite unlike anything ive ever seen from lego edited by radiant7 04 june 2008  0827 am
thanks for the review mr mandalorian this is an er interesting set lots of frontal firepower very big too and i like the idea of those two little craft that attach on the sides sort of like little escape pod things anywho not one of the things on my to buy list but i do like that radioactive sticker that could come in use looking forward to seeing your modifications too peace
thanks for the review i have to concede this does appear to be the weakest set of the summer mm lineup ive noticed a trend that the larger sets have plenty of parts potential but when assembled the model is not more than the sum of the parts eagle base certainly didnt seem worth the asking price at least this is one large model on a positive note the lame aero tubes darts and martian carrier pods have disappeared dont get me wrong i love mm and most of the lineup is great this one just seems to fall a little short of the bar
algernon on jun 4 2008 0934 am said i dont understand why theres so much negativity this is actually my favorite of the new mm sets the finished look is very sleek and not very gappy at all the deployable landing pad is great and itll make it easy to put on a shelf without taking too much room lots of greebles although i will concede that its just begging to be modded still though im definitely buying this one  it has a really great look to it i dont understand the negativity either one mans treasure is another mans trash i suppose that said having grown up with lego during the 80s this set has a certain nostalgia factor in its overall look and feel that harkens back to that earlier period in my life which i fondly remember aside from the factory star justice set elements of which i loathe i expect the 7644 to be the closest thing to a classic space revival that well ever see again from the lego group but i hope to be pleasantly suprised someday though im not living in the past and do appreciate everything lego is doing now and will do and has done since and like you im one whos definitely buying this set no matter how few of us there may be
iron moose on jun 4 2008 0215 pm said do tell im being curious not confrontational  well first and foremost like many other people im no fan of those dreaded unprinted minifig torsos and stickers but also the cost to piece ratio of the set it just seems too expensive for everything that you get such as too many small parts and a lighter than usual piece count for the price though if it had included printed minifigs and other elements i maybe would of been able to swallow its 100 usd cost a little easier but star justice is still lego space in the most classic sense thats available today and i will probably pony it up just because anyway i hope were not breaking forum protocol by not discussing the 7644 review of the original poster or that particular set in general
wow ill definately have to check this one out i always tried making a big mining deployment ship but it always turned out crappy edited by maiq the liar 04 june 2008  1052 pm
i think this thing is compensating the poor lab with the bar army
yes the beard and hat are leftovers from what was meant to be a athos photoshoot i was too lazy to remove them so they are  2 maps of slovakia and one of europe stauder
a very nice little review of a pretty nice little set that i wish id bought between 1 and 10 of just for the griffin oh well your review has shown me that its useful for more than just that so maybe ill try to pick one up someday cant have too many black capes books or printed things speaking of which whitefang on jun 9 2008 0941 am said interesting parts it comes with a wizard book owl 2 printed tiles with a spider and stone prints on it the far right seriously i dont find any good use for it can any eb members enlighten me on that gray thing on the right the gray thing is technically a plume like any castle plume except in this case its a feather presumably from the griffin and made from the mold to the old indian feathers in the wild west sets its a case of an old part coming back for a slightly new use in a new colour beyond that the stone print tile is a bundle or rolled up blanket or package depending on where its used i dont think its ever meant to be a stone it was used as a rolled up pack on the back of the star wars speederbikes for example nice pics plenty of useful information id give this review an a thanks for doing it
thanks for the review you made me very jealous i want it also in multiple but i dont own any of it oh well for later then
thanks for the nice review  it was one of the first ones i got when emerging from my dark ages  i bought two of these just for buckbeack  i thought he would make a good statue in a persian temple type moc i also liked the minifig head pumpkin and plant part in bright green  both new pieces to me at the time all in all it was a good castle or forest building set with a nice selection of pieces for rocks grass plants and trees the dark bley plume piece also now appears in the 10185 green grocer set as detailing on the roof of the turret
guys thanks for your kind comments i am glad that you have enjoyed this review for this set i think i bought about 7 to 8 sets all for the griffins its used for my griffin riders in my castle collection now the green and brown parts come in very handy for castle mocs too imperialshadows on jun 9 2008 1113 pm said a very nice little review of a pretty nice little set that i wish id bought between 1 and 10 of just for the griffin oh well your review has shown me that its useful for more than just that so maybe ill try to pick one up someday cant have too many black capes books or printed things speaking of which the gray thing is technically a plume like any castle plume except in this case its a feather presumably from the griffin and made from the mold to the old indian feathers in the wild west sets its a case of an old part coming back for a slightly new use in a new colour beyond that the stone print tile is a bundle or rolled up blanket or package depending on where its used i dont think its ever meant to be a stone it was used as a rolled up pack on the back of the star wars speederbikes for example nice pics plenty of useful information id give this review an a thanks for doing it i am very happy that you enjoyed and find my review useful thanks for enlighten me now i know where is the origin of that gray plume i wonder if i can use it to match with my castle knights as its plume in addition i mistook the rolled up pack as the stone print tile why didnt i think of it i must have overlook it and used it as a stone tile instead nevertheless i am glad you have give me some good insights on the parts that i am not familar with sveltecorps on jun 10 2008 1049 am said thanks for the nice review  it was one of the first ones i got when emerging from my dark ages  i bought two of these just for buckbeack  i thought he would make a good statue in a persian temple type moc i also liked the minifig head pumpkin and plant part in bright green  both new pieces to me at the time all in all it was a good castle or forest building set with a nice selection of pieces for rocks grass plants and trees the dark bley plume piece also now appears in the 10185 green grocer set as detailing on the roof of the turret i never thought of using buckbeak as a statue for worship i find this concept very interesting yes i agreed that this set offers new parts at that time personally i pretty like the green plant good for any kind of terrain settings i did not realise that the dark bley plume piece appear in the green grocer thanks for pointing out edited by whitefang 10 june 2008  0339 am
great review nice set for plants huh too bad i didnt get thus set but luckily my neighbor did that griffin is nice for castle mocs and that orange head pumpkin i know seems rare to me not much else to say
ohhh great idea to review the old potter sets especially the line from prisoner of azkaban i was in my dark ages then luckily i was able to catch up on the missed figs with one internet order this draco is the best tlc has made if you ask me the new one also doubling for belloq and guards in the indy line doesnt look quite as hautain as this one buckbeak looks cool looks like his neckhead can be moved right rather similar to lego horses well designed the orange brick doesnt have a pumpkin face on it right unlike the one from philosophers stone in the set with the troll im looking forward to more reviews by you sir whitefang good work
guys thanks for your comments glad you find this review useful and be sure to watch out for more old sets reviews mr spielbrick on jun 12 2008 1228 am said this draco is the best tlc has made if you ask me the new one also doubling for belloq and guards in the indy line doesnt look quite as hautain as this one buckbeak looks cool looks like his neckhead can be moved right rather similar to lego horses well designed mr spielbrick thanks for pointing out some important highlights for the review i have overlooked it earlier i strongly agreed with you that this draco is the best tlc made i pretty like the face compared to others furthermore i used my multiple dracos for my castle armor guards instead one could not have too many dracos buckbeak design is well made the head can be moved upwards and downwards the mechanism is similar to the horse design in addition buckbeak wings can be removed similar to the typical green or black dragon wings that we used to see in the past well the main reason for me to buy this set was in fact buckbeak you dont often find a griffin lying around except in harry potter sets mr spielbrick on jun 12 2008 1228 am said the orange brick doesnt have a pumpkin face on it right unlike the one from philosophers stone in the set with the troll sorry to said there is no print on that pumpkin face its pure orange
nice review i like the treemaking pieces the most of this not very expensive set the buckbeak fig is very nice and can bow his head like the horses i was annoyed to get another draco without some other not made figs pansy parkinson for example about the dark bley feathers in the second version of hogwarts there were several of these feathers put in little 1x1 cones like it was a feather to write with it i bought 2 sets of these and when they were for sale i just bought  6 more of it only annoying that i had then even a bigger army of dracos
lookin good so far though i must say its doc ock not dok ock the catapult is well ridiculous but the boat is very spiffy and the buoy is a nice addition i actually like the stickers on the window pieces perfect for this building and great for postapoc scenes black lifesaver rings are a nice addition tooanyway hurry up dragonator and batbrick and daisy i want to see the rest of the review iamded away
thanks for the review even if it is a number of years late i picked this up whn it came out and thought it was a rather cool set besides the catapult plenty of cool pieces and the baseplate has found a use in the batcave although i think my dad managed to spill some beer on it at one point that was awful to clean off batbrick on jun 13 2008 1044 am said and brainbox is too busy complaining that this goes against all marvel continuity i wasnt expecting that there i was casually scrolling down when i stumbled onto a picture of me
where is my soap haha anyway nice review as always batbrick i too have the set and hate the wall jutting out catapult and missing wall but hey review
thanks for another great review i remember getting a few vwings cheaper because the boxes had been crushed on their way to the store not an allthat set but still a fine parts pack with a decent design kimt
nice review i would have snapped this up back in 2006 if i was not in my dark ages
commanderbly42 on jun 16 2008 1111 pm said great review and what are the stands that you used they look much better than the white bricks that i use oh those stands were once cdr spindles its from the container that can hold 100 cdrs hi whitefang cant deny that they were once my fav hunts for lego and yes that price tag is a tad hard to remove well while am delighted at the vwing i still kinda wish it had come with a printed brick for its instruments panel
hmmm i must rebuild my sw ships awingjsf  vwing just to name afew nice review this is probable one of my favourite sw ships i cant belive i broke it for pieces just to make small crap mocs next time my friend comes over we will rebuild some of my sw ships he always asks me if we can rebuild them so i finaly said yes 
mofo jones on jul 15 2008 0139 am said nice review but i have to correct something for you this quote is wrong  heres a link to the hasbro vwing photo archive over on rebelscumcom and i have something to correct for you valentin on jun 15 2008 0953 am said hi everyone please note that this review was done back in 2006 so do forgive me if you happened to notice any dated comments the first sentence is your best buddy my friend anyway nice review love this set dsr
yes i recommend this set it was my second star wars set ever and i must say it was a stunner for me commanderfox
why have you uploaded this twice
skipper 24 on jun 15 2008 0802 pm said why have you uploaded this twice because this review is very good thanks for all the pics i want to buy that set too they are so big but why did lego made them in these strange blackdblue colors this set is very old i saw it one time in my local toyshop for 69 euro and now its gone pitty will look on ebay
i bought a tiny turbos seta nono for me after i saw this bag building its actually pretty fun i built it faster than i would if i had opened the bags
great review indexing it as i write this how come you think the ctt is the atats predecessor do you mean the motorized atat or atats in general i think this is a great set and i am very fond of mine its one of the few sw sets of mine that is on parade at all times most are packed away in the attic kimt btw its not alone the older version of the atat is keeping it company
nice review  the driverpilot whatever you call him   s helmet looks kind of odd and why does have a long red pole instead of a kickbutt lightsaber
10143 death star ii production year 2005 pieces 3441 minifigs 0 price 299 usd peeroncom 10143 gallery the review ph4tdud3ds review  u 2 kewl 2 do diz meyes ph4tdud3kewldo u have pix of the minifigs meerhmwhat minifigs ph4tdud3the ph4t figs from the ds1 methis is the other death star ph4tdud3omfg theres more than 1 meyes ph4tdud3keeeeewl must have megoodbye pushes the incinerator button ph4tdud3wut nooooooooooooooooooo and on that note lets start the reivew of the ucs death star ii now this is an older set 2005 and ive only gotten around to buying it a short while ago it took me around 2 evenings to build it and i must say that i am fairly impressed by this set time for a box pic the build since i started building this huge small moon size set at mortens appartment i wanted to keep as few polybags open at any given time as possible with this set it is actually possible to have a minimum of bricks scattered over a table or two while building not sure why but the division of bricks in the different polybags just work very well and that is great with a set this size  3441 bricks the building of the set is divided into several build this times x for example the upper and lower part of the unshielded ds are completely alike this is difficult to see when looking at the model but heaven when building it and this is how they solved the problem of having the wings connected to the buttom of the death star  geniously done imo note that in the first pic the skeleton is easily seen the skeleton holds the x to which both the upper and lower part is clicked on with technic pins also theres a steering wheel im sure theres a pirate name for that  like the one in the bottom in the top of the model to hold the upside wings so after having build duplicate wings upper and lower the belt all the way around the star and the upper and lower part of the unshielded side it was time to step back and watch the death star ii in all its glory such a great ucs set now i did have a few huhs during the build huh 1 in the instruction the technic lesserdragonhead should be dark grey but i got it in light gray go figure and thank you replacement parts ive experienced this before and apparently tlg uses different colours when outofstock all one has to do is call them and ask for the right colour and its on its way still a huh experience huh 2 again it appears that tlg changed the design of the technic axleholed 1x2 bricks the bottom has changed and i got the set where it was mixed up between old and new version not that annoying but still got me perplexed as to am i doing this right kinda stressing to consider taking most of the star apart to check the remaining 231 technic bricks 1x2 with axlehole now for a verdict  1 looks great 2 even my wife likes it  female appeal 3 its a great build 4 the polybags work for you 5 its star wars 6 the design is awesome  1 it wobbles if you touch it 2 very small parts come off if you touch it 3 parts come off when you try to move it somewhere safe 4 zero swooshability so in short yes even shorter the dsii is a well designed ucs set that has a great design like most other ucs sets it is not meant for play  hence dont play with it ucs verdict the numbers 510 designinstructionsbrickssturdinesscolourscheme design awesome look and great greeble set instructions easy to follow steps with bricks mentioned hard to see wether its black or dark grey bricks loads of great bricks a zillion bricks of the same type sturdiness dont touch colouscheme grey in grey with a little touch of black need a missing instruction then click the logo
hmmm ive still got this set and i must say i think you did a good job of reviewing it but overall i hate the set probably the worst ucs set so far apart from the naboo fighter but that hardly even counts as ucs from my experience unless you really really want it and have nothing better to spent your  on in that case go for it but in my case it was a very repetitive build and final model was quite well bland not must variety to it if you know what i meanfor the price i would really reccomend the ucs star destroyer because thats a much better story
grevious on jun 24 2008 1012 pm said thanks for the review eh honestly i though this was awful ever since i first saw the pictures to me an incomplete grey ball doesnt really work as a special ucs kit for the sole reason that its boring extremely so now the new death star playset is a whole different story they should have done that in the first place theres nothing to add to grevious post thanks but i never like the big grey ball benny
i think its a very weird and boring ucs set but what a lot of grey plates you could build something much better out of them but it would be fairly flat it looks very fragile though  my ucs atst is edited by shoc 25 june 2008  1028 am
kimt on jun 25 2008 0834 am said i dont agree that the isd is better  imho theyre exactly them same  big and grey this is a question of personal liking  which is the coolest ds or isd not comparative here are some advantages that makes isd win for me  a lot more fun to build with less repetitions  it is easier to build alternate models from it how many alternate models of the ds2 have you seen  the bricks are more varied  you get magnets  it is a larger set if you look at the size
id love to get my hands on one of these but youd need about three jobs to justify the prices of this guy on ebay fantastic review kimt
7656 general greivouss starfighter release 2007 number of pieces 232 minifigs 1 brickset welcome this is my first review so contstructive critisism is very much appreciated on to the review first we start out with the box the box art is the same as always since 2006 nothing special then we start the build the build is fairly easy and will take the seasoned builder about 1520 min to complete here is the finished model and birds eye view as you can see this ship is very sleek the fins or wings each have an outer slope and an inner one with the guns in between there are also cones on the front of the fins which give the ship an even more sleek look in the middle of the wings there is the main body with a big slope and stripes decorating it this set has a very good playability factor as im about to show you now the guns on the ship are pretty cool looking to begin with a bley slope attaching a lightsaber hilt and a transneon green stud to the fin on each side but theres more than what meets the eye yes the guns flip up and they can flip all the way back to hide them for whatever case they need hiding lets have a look at the back there is a tail fin used as landing gear and some lightspeed boosters but wait the tail fin can flip up for flight thanks to a hinge attached to the back of the cockpit heres another playability factor the cockpit can slide open very smoothly and easily heres how this is possible a clever system under the hood allows the cockpit to open see those two bley pieces on the black ones those bley ones attach to the tan plates under the hood and the hood and windsheild attach to the black peices the black and bley pieces work together as a sliding system so the cockpit opens viola and then the cockpit snaps in place thanks to the red hook and clip its a very accurate system and works very well youll want to open and close it over and over again now finnaly to the fig the general himself a very impressive fig with a new head and torso mold in this set which is one of only two with greivous in it he comes with 2 green and two blue lightsabers all with bley hilts   i was hoping for chrome hilts but its a minor fault grievous also comes with a new mold pistol blaster not pictured heres the general in the cockpit sadly a weak cockpit no details he just half lays down on a small slope in this set he doesnt come with a cape beacuse with it on the cockpit doesnt close thats about it heres the final verdict build 710 fairly easy but fun a little bit weak playability 810 many playability factors but some are boring or pointless swooshability 810 very fun to fly around sometimes pieces break off minifigs 1010 one amazing fig with 4 lightsabers and a new blaster what more could you ask for design 910 very sleek but hardly any real texture i like it but others might want greebling price 1010 overall score 910 a very cool ship with a very cool minifig and accessories one of the best sw sets i have ever seen for its small price i highly recommend it to any kind of sw lego or sw lego fan hope you enjoyed my review please leave feedback edited by jimbutcher 15 september 2008  0301 am
you should have posted the entire review up i am about to look at the gallery for the rest of the pics edit as soon as i post the images came thats weird nice review is there more it says ill be back good first review edited by skipper 24 26 june 2008  0911 pm
sorry about that skipper i added the topic after the first pic was uploaded just to make sure the pics would be in the post you probably posted while i was editing it and i had to go to visit my grandparents im at their house right now sorry if you got freaked out
the set no longer looks as ugly as ive always thought thanks for the review  i might have to pick one up now to go with the magnaguard fighter
thats a neat little set i like the design of the fighter thanks for the review  its been keep it up kimt
yesterday i buy this setand im waiting for a pack this review is very helpful jimbutcher on jun 27 2008 0834 pm said ill try to do the sith infiltrator this weekend i wait
jameseh on jun 28 2008 0824 pm said does the sliding cockpit come off easily my friends brothers breaks everytime you touch it but he may have built it wrong it put me off the set im very sad to say that sometimes it does but thats only if you hold it from the top and bottom with your fingers and thumb respectivly but if you hold it in your palm or from the sides it wont break emphasis on sometimes but dont try to mess around with it by removing its pieces or adding new one or modding it in any way because the sliding mechanism wont agree with the mods and break but this hardly takes away from anyone liking this set because imo its perfect just how it is
yeah general grievous starfighter will land in my house greate set i love decals  brown and sandy pattern ingenious btw when you show sith infiltrator review i wait 
nice work jim for your first review i must admit the set didnt really appeal to me at first but your review has definitely shown off the cool functions built in to this ship well done cheers isc
guys thanks for your kind comments i am glad to know that you have enjoyed viewing this review trooperdavinfelth on jul 2 2008 1115 pm said its a rat i thought by calling it as a mouse it will be a little much friendly unlike calling it a rat brainbox on jul 2 2008 1120 pm said thanks for the review bearing in mind that the whole point of this set is to get a cheap troll warrior i actually quite like it the cart isnt brilliant but for 13 pieces its not that bad the troll fig is great as always and i guess the rats are always nice to get not so much in real life though the sets that contain the trolls have a fairly solid number each i mean tower raid has three but nevertheless i think i may have to pick up a few of these norro on jul 3 2008 0610 am said a more affordable troll warrior for those of us avoiding the large sets me is always nice thanks for the review i must agreed with the both of you that this is a much easier way to acquire these troll warriors at a much affordable price i am glad these trolls are available in impulse sets now will there will be a dwarf impulse set in the future i supposed that will be much interesting glman on jul 3 2008 1215 am said its a good review but you forgot another thing the troll needs a shiled like they used to in the 2007 castle line the sets always had shields for the minifigs and it could be better if it was 300 instead of 350 but yes it is a good impulse great army builder if this impulse set includes a troll shield my rating will defintely go higher this is a troll army builder set with minimum feature and limited weapons range if the troll comes with an armor or a shield i will think this set is worth it troll armor is hard to get by as it appeared only in troll warship and tower raid edited by whitefang 03 july 2008  0306 am
grrr you beat me to it i got two of these in the mail today and was so eager to do a review of it thanks for saving me the work edited by wilhelm screamer 03 july 2008  0330 am
hey your review is great as usual as for the set itself  well its an impulse set after all  small and cheap nothing special well the rat is special hehe for me the rat is the most interesting in the set cause i dont have a rat i dont have a troll warrior either but im not very interested
nice review i will definately need a few of these
whitefang on jul 4 2008 0543 pm said well mouse sounded more friendly because it can associate with tom and jerry but calling it a rat equal calling it a pest its just a matter of putting it in different terms thats all the thing i dont get is how jerry is friendly
hello all eurobricks members i will be doing a continuation of my impulse set reviews i was pretty excited when i laid my hands on these new impulse sets yesterday hope to give most of you a good insight for this set name street cleaner theme lego system  town  city year 2008 pieces 22 minifigs 1 an image of a 5620 street cleaner let the cleaning begin the street cleaner has a job to do it is to clean the rubbish on the streets after a new year countdown it seemed the cleaning agency have a new equipment to use its not as big as the previous street sweeper machine the cleaner will need to operate the equipment manually by pushing it look at the mess after sorting out look at the pieces offered its not a very complicated set since its an impulse set there are some pretty useful parts lying around such as the broom spade however i was quite surprised when i could not find the lid of the rubbish bin i cant used this rubbish bin to place it around my town without a lid on top of it i believed it is not a norm by not including the lid look at that bin well that rubbish bin seem to be containing his equipment in it instead of the rubbish the cleaners face looks pretty sad i think he wants to have a change of job front view i love that blue brush very much quite fun to play with especially pushing the rubbish aside thats why a spade is there to help him to dig out the litter and the broom to brush it away ok now i know why his face looks so sad where is that street sweeper machine summary review playability 6510 not bad to play with design 7510 the design is relatively interesting with the use of the technic part to be its foundation price 810 an inexpensive set to get another cleaner and some neat accessories overall 710 not a bad set after all pretty average but still quite good to buy if your towns required more cleaners hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine comments and critics are strongly welcomed pictures can be found in my brickshelfwhen moderated edited by whitefang 04 july 2008  0344 pm
thanks for the review  not a bad price of course its impulse for a fig a little cleaner thing and two accesories the brush fig and spade i dont have yet so i might just pick this up
looking at this is making me want to build one of the favourite sets of my childhood 6649 street sweeper might do that today actually cheap good pieces despite the lack of a bin lid thats just inviting disaster isnt it nice fig and one of those blue brushes which ive always loved but never managed to use thanks whitefang
wow what a great little impulse set i relly dig the face as well as a chance to get some cool accessories like a broom bin no lidsigh and a mushroom top hat a really nice review and story too whitefang i think this guy will be joining my set of lego when he shows up in australia cheers isc
hello all eurobricks members i will be doing a continuation of my impulse set reviews this will be the third review at a go hope everyone of you will find this review useful in a way name coast guard kayak theme lego system  town  city year 2008 pieces 21 minifigs 1 an image of a 5621 coast guard kayak roll roll roll your boat it seemed the coast guard has a kayak of his own roaming in the sea making sure that swimmers will be safe in the beach now i am illustrating him as a life guard instead this set is simply wonderful among the 4 new impulse sets coast guard kayak is the best looking set in my opnion the kayak design is very simple but looks realistic  furthermore if you dont need it to be a coast guard kind of stuff use it as a leisure water spot instead down in the marina i will think any lego citizen will love to have some water spot in their busy life so come down here and wind down with this new sport bits and pieces kayak and the bouy the bouy is very useful to position it at the coast of your water to highlight the boundaries in the sea and warning incoming ships or vessels oh i did not make it tilted purposely there is a white round base which allow it to tilt on both ends useful parts these parts are useful to add on in your city somehow when i see that red cone i can use it as a police stop to inspect vehicles on the road or form a barricade with it the bouy base shape is unique too i like it very much it is great to attached it by the side of the boat as a life bouy the coast guards life vest and helmet are very useful for water activites the life vest was produced in past sets and now it resurfaced again i am glad these vests made their way back a look of him without the life vest summary review playability 7510 fun to play with especially the bouy when you see it moving up and down design 8510 design is simple but straight to the point especially the kayak design price 810 an inexpensive set to get more coast guards and more kayaks overall 8510 a very good set to have in your lego town the kayak is simply so lovely to me hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine comments and critics are strongly welcomed pictures can be found in my brickshelf when moderated
thanks for pics the hawk it seems to me lacks a cockpit theres not even a seat to keep the pilot from falling off perhaps it theyd redesigned it to be a backpack jetpack sort of unit using similar pieces itd at least make some sense based on the other mm impluses can we assume this goes for 35usd at that price it seems to me that the astro fighter at 5usd was already a superior impluse set guess id buy one on clearance for the minifig
thanks for your comments guys i really appericate it brainbox on jul 3 2008 0611 pm said this is quite a nice set actually it evokes some of the design elements of the mx11 while looking different enough to justify me buying it the head on the astronaut is one i like so even better i hadnt realised it was that one actually does 26 pieces make it one of the bigger impulses sets i think i may have to get one if not two imo impulse set total piece count should be 30 or less it will be ideal and more ways to construct a much better impulse sets such as past impulse sets that we came across i may be wrong on the 30 piece count thing but this is how i view impulse sets brainbox on jul 3 2008 0611 pm said plus its called crystal hawk how can that not be considered cool do you know i bought this set mainly because it have such a cool name attached with it crystal hawk i simply fell in love with that name
thanks for the great review now i just have to have that set
thank you for the nice review this set has a very classic space feeling so i dont care about the lack of cockpit a nice little set with a nice minifig
excellent review sc thanks for sharing the figs are awesome i really like the female villain  an excellent face i also like the agent uniforms the laser gun is perfect it has that peter sellerspink panther dooms day device look that i envision when i think of laser destruction the volcano has some neat features as well like the trans redorange lava it is a bit heavy on stickers though as are many new setsthemes but overall i think this set will really appeal to the kids  a great review of a neat set
awsome review dude im proably getting this though the main downfall is there is hardly an inside
thanks for the stepbystep set looks great mmmmm clawdette
i know the word secret base but whats this the base is hardly secret with a massive laser gun and wide screen sticking out it looks good lots and lots of orange woo
great review and such a nice figure i consider rock raiders space too i also consider many of the diver themes space as well ive yet to own a rock raiders set i have tried to buy a few off ebay but they always went too high
7663 sith infiltrator year 2007 number of pieces 310 number of minifigs 1 price 2999 usd brickset hello everyone and welcome to my second review on eurobricks the sith infiltrator lets start with a pic of the box shall we as you can see its a limited edition set meaning the fig and set could be worth a lot in the future this set takes about 20 minuets for the seasoned builder an overview of the infiltrator also know as the scimitar as seen in the picture this ship is very sleek with very few studs on top snot studs not on top basically its the cockpit with two wings with two fins on each wing attached to the hull heres a side view of the scimitar very cool looking it lands on two feet in the front while the cockpit rests on the ground rear view the back the outer cockpit is beautiful a printed piece on the back no dreaded sticker sheet dss and a large printed disc on top heres a look at the middle there is a flickfire missile transred cone attach to technic pin on the inner wing a transred lightsaber blade in the back of the hull and a transred lightsaber blade in between the fins on either side all of those lightsaber blades may come in handy hey look the fins open from the wings the fins open due to double hinges on each fin unfortunately you have to hold the ship up in order for the bottom fins to open now lets have a look inside the cockpit to open you lift the back printed part which is attached to the printed disc on top which is attached to a hinge it opens pretty smoothly but is somewhat loose so sometimes it closes on its own also the disc isnt secured well enough to the door and often breaks off even with the smallest movement to it inside there is an elevated control panel and two sliding pieces near the floor this ship also comes with a small speeder bike its very cleverly built and is a really neat addition see that clear disc on the bottom it fits perfectly into the sliding pieces in the cockpit hmm whats this a hidden compartment now this was a very cool idea by tlg a secret compartment found by taking off the top slope of the hull contains darth mauls weapons and tools which include a chrome lightsaber hilt a pair of electrobinouculars and three probe droids a closeup of a probe droid just a plain black minifig head with a black lever on top finally the fig darth maul in the flesh plastic a good fig altogether with a black hood and lightsaber blades taken from the ship he did come with a crisp new black cape packaged in a small white cardboard box but i am currently using it for another fig note that this is a limited edition fig so stock up a comparison pic of the two mauls the 2007 version is on the left and the 1999 version on the right note a few key differences between the two the new one has smaller red tattoos and a smoother torso also the new one has bigger eyes and a more cartoony look maul on the speeder bike of course he fits perfectly in the cockpit wile sitting on the bike and he can reach the controls well thats about it here is the final verdict build 810 easy and fun breaks every once in a while playability 710 this set has many features but is very fragile between the cockpit and hull and between the two cockpit pieces swooshability 110 too fragile to fly around plus the flick fire missiles fall out minifigs 910 a great fig with a chrome hilt and a double sided blade a little cartoony design 710 very clever techniques very sleek but very fragile price 810 fair enough could be a few dollars cheaper overall score 6510 a very sleek ship with clever building and play techniques but very very fragile and shouldnt be picked up off of the shelf too often and with that my review is over but all of yours are not comments and thoughts very welcome edited by jimbutcher 15 september 2008  0259 am indexed
jimbutcher on jul 10 2008 0944 pm said a hidden compartment now this was a very cool idea by tlg a secret compartment found by taking off the top slope of the hull youre supposed to slide the front of the hull off rather than lift the top piece off
led zeppelin on jul 10 2008 0446 pm said youre supposed to slide the front of the hull off rather than lift the top piece off yeah i was looking at the construction booklet and it reminded me of that i forgot about it but that makes it more fragile
a very neatly designed sith infiltrator though i think it lacks the size of the older version a fine ship but not what i would call a sith infiltrator it should be bigger thanks for another fine sw review kimt
hey all so i purchased the remaining three agents sets i needed and saw that there was no review up yet for this set heres the first batch of parts and the first instruction bits the mini figures the first small vehicles heres a mistake that i found in the instruction booklet there is no difference between steps 2 and 3 the team inferno boat this is a nice chunky boat that looks fairly heavy duty and evily its nice to see the smooth disks on the bottom that lego seemingly havnt done in recent boatplane sets and the agents submarine this is a nice build aswell nice and long with a few hidden compartments one for missiles a place to put the treasure some final shots of the completed set the spare bits another special mention has to go out to slime face i think he is my favourite ever lego character the detail on his unique torso is brilliant his head is fantastic and his costume just looks great with the black and green plus green is my favourite colour check out the back of his torso with the slime pouring down deep sea quest was £3499 price  910  this is a pretty reasonable price for a fairly substantial set parts  810  a lot of nice bits few nice boats bits and a lot of smooth disk things minifigures  1010 as i said slime face is my favourite lego character and the details brilliant vehicles  810 both very good with some interesting features build  810 a pretty fun build overall  910 its gotta be if just for slime face alone but this really is a great set
im not real fond of slimeface he looks too much like the jokerbombs i was hoping for something newer the slime printing is a nice touch though steve
sveltecorps on jul 11 2008 0914 am said i would have liked it if theyd gone all the way and made it some kind of giant robot jellyfish or squid coughalphateamcough anyway i was about to reply earlier and say  great review svelte then i realised it was not you nice reveiw anyway the only reason i would get this set would be if i got all the other agents sets  all the sw cw sets  all the pieces i need on bl  all the new city ect setsthen i would think about geting it
it was £3499 so usd its likely to be 4555 i would imagine
great review really thanks i slime face even slimey as my slime sense nice that break jaw is also in it undersigned mowo
batbrick on jul 19 2008 0953 am said is it impossible or just very hard to mod nothing is impossible to mod probably the easiest part to change would be the front where the missiles are and the treasure chest slides out  you could make a sizeable compartment there however the middle section is so narrow and the end fins are just that  fins  that it might be harder to expand without changing the shape of the sub youll find out soon when yours arrives batbrick on jul 19 2008 0953 am said the octopus sounds great thanks for that is he meant to be on any side im guessing hes a mutant inferno creature about slime face is his head much different to the joker bombs i know he has slime marks on his head are they very apparent its not really clear but since all the other mutants are evil or at least controlled by dr inferno its probably a safe bet the squid is too slime faces head is different to the joker bombs  different eyes and teeth although the smile is similar i guess and the slime marks are much more apparent in the flesh or abs although they dont photograph that way joker bomb face below for contrast
wow thanks for the review that is one awesome set slime face is excellent i must add him to the collection i think we need some new agents theres so many inferno minifigures now maybe next year thanks again
thebrickster on jul 10 2008 1048 pm said for those of you following my classic space reviews this is review number 9 of 10 my final review of anall time favorite will be coming soon no more of your great reviews why a good review right here got into the thick of the set without becoming boring with an absence of pictures or not having enough text this looks like a good set and id better catch up with the rest of your reviews asap
this is a great little set i like how it combines two very different color schemes for different parts of the model i have made some slight modifications to mine adding a roof on the vehicle and a back wall on the outpost also those white 1x1 headlight plates at the front are thinner than the modern kind and seem to be quite weak i got this set off ebay a while ago and one of them was broken in shipping even though the set was otherwise in display model condition and the other one broke off while i was building the set i replaced them with the newer variety mutex on jul 10 2008 1137 pm said my only complain about this set was that i found that the wheels where too small  i had some trouble passing the rover over the little cratersmountains of the space plates the only bad thing about this set is the name it cant even roll over a single plates height not very all terrain at all edited by cp5670 11 july 2008  0743 am
give me an excuse to sneak into your house and let me have a feel of these classic space sets i never had a chance to have any experience with the classic space sets through your recent reviews on these it gave me a wider perspective of space i loved to play space as a child such as the late classic and futuron sets back to the review this 6927 is a great mobile command center vehicle suitable for all kinds of harsh terrain in the unknown space the 6 big wheels are real solid and firm back in those days transparent blue windscreen at the front is wonderful i just love these parts especially when its in blue 4 computer printed tiles arent lego so generous back in those days when printed parts are more commonly available unlike now its a real nice set however there is one thing i dont understand about this design why is the driver seat has a wide back with no cover behind and the command center has no door at the back i understand that these space guys are always carrying their helmet around for oxygen supply i wonder if there is a better answer to it
quote great buy on this one what did it cost you it was 30 which was a pretty good price given the condition it had no box or instructions though this set is actually fairly common on ebay though considering how old it is i see them pretty frequently on there quote its a real nice set however there is one thing i dont understand about this design why is the driver seat has a wide back with no cover behind and the command center has no door at the back i understand that these space guys are always carrying their helmet around for oxygen supply i wonder if there is a better answer to it i just modified mine to make everything fully enclosed edited by cp5670 11 july 2008  0639 pm
ive always associated this set with 6929 the voyager theyre of the same timeframe and more or less the same style 6927 is without any doubt my favourite ground vehicle of space it was pretty simple but it was such a creative set the stories you could tell with this model g most defenitely in my top 5 of space sets
this set never got me as a kid i suspect it was because of the wheels i had mostly basic sets so it would have been more of the same looking at it now i can see i have misjudged it and i love the lablift method im going to have to build this to see it in action thanks for another great review
awesome review brickster i didnt you are also a space fan oh how i love classic space the all time perfect lego space related theme everytime i see one i want to buy them more and more when compared to modern fang dangled sets with detailed figs and cool new accessories they have nothing on classic space simple beauty maybe its the bluegreytrans yellow color scheme classic space forever edited by piranha 30 august 2009  0751 am
yeah first time that i am getting a set before everyone first of all the package the european version has no limited edition button hooray sorry for the blurry backshot we see the hospital back a few bubbles with set functions and a little comic comic bubbles the figures are injured spongebob patrick and the new fish doctor spongebob has a headprint and a backprint other than the normal spongebob spongebob and injured bob the set comes with two litters the ambulance car is a bit extraordinary i don´t know how the car is like in the show and i saw a lot of episodes but it looks a bit strange mostly because the weehls are too small of course we get another ss not so d this time the litter fits in the back with help of this lid i wish it would be the hingelid from before 2004 now we come to the meanpart of the set the hospital the entrance has got babyblue traindoors and a hudge sign that shows emergency the tubes are nearly everywhere in this set i was getting insane when i came to the part where i must put the stickers on the tubes this parts are very usefull but i wanted that the set looks good because i will display it so i stickered just two of the parts and not all four now we come to the interroir the doctor has a desk with computer sadly it´s not very well placed and he must duck because of his fin next to the door we get this little case wash basin and two drawers again we get stickers not that i don´t like stickers it´s just everytime i get to the part where i must put the stickers on i think how i can reuse the model and if i rebuild the model later and and and i hate it to deside a few posters are in it too the set is a great addittion to your own bikino bottom but the playability is not very big for the kids they can just play that patrick steals the ambulance car like shown on the package and is hitting spongebob than the drive back the doctor gives spongebob two medicines and let him go i bought the set mostly because of the parts tubes in lightbley and a few woodpieces but i am thinking about let it stand in my little bikini bottom just consist of crusty crab and chum bucket playability 310 figures 1010 price 810 design 910 total 3040
oh so spongebob was the injured one i thought this set depicted the episode wherein mr krabs was the one rushed to the hospital
i love the sponge bob sets i have all of them nice review
great review i want that set mainly for patric and the spongebob with the bandage but why does bob have full length pants i thought he wore briefs
nice review the set looks promising
wow that set looks better than i thought i just might get it if its under 30 usd i love all the details inside and it seems to have a better interior than the city hospital and the new figs look nice
thanks for the pics this set is necessary for each spongebobfan it looks so great
this set doesnt have much playability but the hospital is better than the one released by lego recently it has more detail i like it
theres a lot great pieces in this set i would be willing to get the set just for them thanks for the great review
excellent review its nice to see how its nice to see how   its nice  okay i cant get over the sex in the bedroom and the unattended baby crawling into the oven i didnt read anything else except where does the puppy sleep and my daughter made me build this you are sick and twisted and thats why i love you it seems you are coining the belville edge now will you please stop sitting around eating clams and get that baby out of the oven or make the fun in the bedroom a threeway please thank you ps ok i read it i want the baby toilet and i think the jellyfish is supposed to be a jellomold i bet you knew that the fireplace lattice look like the harry potter one and not the fabuland one boo wienies when your daughter outgrows it will you turn it into a belleville star wars moc please thank you in advance
the lego lives on but you are one evil parent getting your kids addicted to belville like that but uh whats that doll doing on the bed whats underneath it and look what you found a bucket
jimbutcher on jul 13 2008 1238 am said bucket pale same thing its can be called a watering pale this reminds me of that popular tv game show in the states identify the bucket vs the watering pale no ones won the million yet
hinckley on jul 13 2008 0155 am said this reminds me of that popular tv game show in the states identify the bucket vs the watering pale no ones won the million yet i was on that came close to winning too but the one i picked was too well tanned wahwahwaaaaaah
sinner you know i had never seen a belville set in any review with such great pictures before i just cant take my eyes off in the master bedroom the scene is quite a little hot enough of me peeping up there lets take a look at the interior i am very surprised by its construction of the house its quite big and is nice of you to buy a great sweet gift for your daughter i am very sure she will enjoyed playing with it somehow it reminded me of barbie doll products maybe its too pinkish for me the accessories is the plus factor in any belville sets it offered quite a handful of great accessories to add into any types of mocs construction to add in the plus factor in it sinner you are a very nice dad i like how parents buy educational toys for their children to expand their imaginations instead of sitting in a couch playing video games and etc
thanks for your report and the pics my sister wants this set but shes already got the last house and she doesnt play very often with it but the new one looks very good too
sveltecorps on may 23 2009 0454 pm said did your daughter ever go back to it on and off shes been building very odd spaceships with the big pink pieces

trudop561 on jul 12 2008 0923 pm said when i saw this topic i was like  oh my god this set is out since 2007 this guy is so late but i read your review and this idea got out of my mind thank you jim i have 2 of these and i even have twice more droids than clones i should have buy more but its sold out now they are not sold out if you go into uk woolworths they have loads in stock
7654 droids battle pack year 2007 number of pieces 102 number of minifigs 7 price 999 usd brickset hi everybody and welcome to my fourth review on eurobricks today i will review the droid bttle pack set note this set originally came with four megaphone blasters for each battle droid but i replaced them along with the crooked arms with the new blaster pistols and new twisted arms a picture of the box as it is on the shelves of majorretail stores a small box as expected for inexpensive sets like these note the build your army button on the front tlg obviously is encouraging customers to buy multiples and with good reason which will be explained later in this review an overview of the sets content you can see a droid carrying vehicle a stap and some battle super battle droids a look at the carrier a light tank note the guns on the front the guns and cockpit can turn a little bit left and right from the main body also the guns can move up and down free from the cockpit and check out the cockpit two 2x1 center studded plates side by side for the pilot to stand on now moving on to the stap a small very useful vehicle in the sw universe these are seen frequently in both the movies and games as well as other multimedia the design is very clever using vertical building and a clear stand rear view the guns handlebars can go this far back and finally the figs the figs are very good but very common we havent seen sbds in a while and now instead of metallic blue they are metallic dark grey the worst part of this set is that the battle droids have the old arms and guns while the droids in the mtt and clone pack both of the same year as this have the new ones i wonder why tlg decided to do that again this set originally came with four megaphone blasters for each battle droid but i replaced them along with the crooked arms with the new blaster pistols and new twisted arms so thats about it heres the final verdict build 810 very easy should take the seasoned builder about 510 minutes playability 610 has a few play feature but nothing exciting is good for mocs and army building swooshability 810 i suppose you could fly around the stap minifigs 710 the battle droids are good but very common and the dont come with new arms or guns the sbds are very nice and in a new color all figs are great for army building design 810 the stap was clever but the carrier was a little bulky price 1010 as fair as it gets overall 7510 the figs are great to have and make mocs and armies and the vehicles are pretty cool the carrier is a little lame the main problem with this set is that the bds dont get the new guns or arms so they dont fit in with all the new sets also droids arent as cool as clones but the price is very fair and now my review has ended unfortunately i believe this will be my last review for a long time for two reasons one the remaining sets that arent done according to kimts index i either dont have or are broken or have missing pieces and two my budget is low right now and i wont be able to get the clone wars sets right when they are released so someone will probably beat me to reviewing them too bad because i would love to do an rgs review well as always comments very welcome
thanks for the review unfortunately the droid battle pack is discontinued for the uk sh also the clone battle pack is discontinued for the usa sh  for the americans
thanks everyone glad that you guys enjoyed this review rriggs on jul 13 2008 0806 pm said as for the wheels these were primarily technic wheels but did find their way into some other models in white i can only find a handful of minifig sets that they are included with theres half a dozen space sets but apart from the 4wheelin truck the only other town set appears to be the 6524 blizzard blazer tractor with snow plough the wheels were also in a train set called 4549 road  rail hauler where they were the wheels on a big forklift i never realised that i supposed these wheels is one of the earliest technic parts appeared in system sets zzz on jul 14 2008 0549 pm said minifig is really classic made only for this set appears in some later train sets as well and shows the exact image of the truck on the shirt including the motor piece one of the most detailed and loveliest little sets from a sweet era of legoland city i will show it to you in a few days time that this minifig torso does not only appear in this set in fact i am quite fond of this lovely torso with its symbolic truck printed on it snefroe on jul 14 2008 0737 pm said hmmm i probably would not have bought this as a kid in 1987 unless i had money to spare or the shop had no other set from space or castle the two other big lines in 1987 and no better set in the town section i think its a great parts pack but the model itself does not look very attractive i never really liked those wheels honestly theyre from the basic sets mostly and they work pretty well in those but im just not a fan the roof on the other hand was very popular and the blue modified bricks at the front were quite rare in those days but generally speaking this was not the star of 1987 i wouldnt agreed less this set is a good to have and is defintely not the main highlights in 1987 this is actually a great addon to your classic town vehicle collections after seeing so many typical police cars ambulance fire engine and etc i need more variety of civillan vehicles roaming down the streets
omg i have seen the light will it be availeble from sh or is it just a promo thanks for making my day wonderfull dr brick
i wish i had seen it judging by the reactions it is a pretty good set
awww i wanna see it please edit omg its all over the interwebs if you know where it looks amzaing its a giant windmill with a house at bottom edited by pencoin 14 july 2008  0524 pm
omg omg wow thats simply amazing wow i cant say more wait i can this is such a beatiful set i sure hope it will be available for us to like european people its so nice it looks like the real thing great cottage great pieces great van and figures and the windthing wow
sounds cool but i cant seem to find any of these leaked pics not even on brickshelf maybe i am not searching under the right phrases oh well i guess i can wait patiently
wow managed to find a pic on brickshelf and this is a great set hope it going to be released properly and not just a promo one thing though would it not be quite noisy if you lived in that house
i also found the pics and most of what i can say is its kind of funny how its a small house with a gigantic windmill over it though
i recently got a few still sealed and new sets from the 90 on ebay and after the rock raiders hover scout this isthe second one ill review i really like the space port theme even if the sets may be more simple than earlier space city sets i like the overall look and the color scheme but enough of that lets go on with the pictures set nr 6455 name space simulation station number of minifigs 3 number of pieces 240 release year 1999 first again a few pics of the boxes and the instructions the main box this theme had a kinda strange seperation of the pieces the parts for the control center and the shuttle are in seperate little boxes and the others are in polybags with the models printed on them also seperate instructions for each step a general overview we got 3 lovely minifigs here from left to right the control engineer the mechanic and the astronaut the i dont know the english word for it testingthing the astronaut is being tested to hard nerves there the mechanics little car on the back an extinguisher and a radio device is attached the takeoff station for the little shuttle with the shuttle itself on it and without it tools tools tools the shuttle as standalone i think that would be fuel tanks i like this little detail and finally we have the controll room would have been better with seats but its alright a really sweet midsized set if you ask me a few juniorized parts but it fits perfectly with the set the theme itself is also great and i wish that tlg brings it back i could see stunning sets with the quality city sets have right now
in the catalog images i thougt that the base was on a 1616 baseplate i have some sets of spaceport and like them but i would want real town sets in 1999 edited by lord santos 15 july 2008  1058 am
my sister got this from our grandparents once when she was interested with space but it fell into my hands later i had a lot of fun with that by the way the name for the test thing is called a centrifuge it tests a persons ability to withstand high gforces edited by filefolders 15 july 2008  0355 pm
minibump wow id completely forgotten about this theme which is suprising since i absolutely loved this theme as a kid minus the sound n light brick which i thought was pretty big and ugly sure brings back memories of looking at those little catalogue booklets that came with the sets
i had never seen this set or this theme before it was released during my dark age and i had missed it its nice to see such sets surface once again to educate members like me that there are some good sets we had missed during the dark age and i must admit that this is a very good set its comes with 3 minifigs and staudie with it geez i never thought he was an astronaunt back then the testing facility is great and i love to see it spin by putting staudie in it for a testrun the buggy is cute as well but somehow i dont really like the white frame at the back it looked a little odd to me the tools are simply wonderful to have furthermore these are grey tools the last time we had so many tools are the aeroplane mechanic the shuttle is nice but does the shuttle supposed to come with a cover as well i guess since this is a simulator they must have cut down the budget for it the control room is good and it will be even better with chairs included metalandi thanks for the wonderful review
oky wan kenobi on jul 20 2008 0627 pm said stop calling them manga guards people that sounds silly its magna guards sorry but i just hate mangas no need to be a sourpuss cheer up but half the time these are the result of typos i do them all the tmie tpyos on datrhperson
dfenz on jul 17 2008 1142 pm said nice review with very clear pics i have preordered this item at a local belgian store and will be getting it on july 29th together with the 7676 gunship wow 5999eur is a lot of money what country do you live in here it costed me 46eur so quite a price difference imo the sets certainly not worth that much money reki
update i will be merging reviews as they go idle this is now the dino attack review thread what jays not doing viking reviews nope i think christopher110 took care of those just fine instead i have brought you what is most possibly the highestanticipated set of the year  d  the t1 typhoon and i gotta say  dinos apart its actually really cool the dinos lets get the worst over with yes those are all the parts in that dino
the copter this is one bigass copter the photos really dont do the size justice lower cockpit with cool computer too bad its a sticker although ill definitely leave this one on upper cockpit with cool computer see above awesome gatling gun yes even the technic beams have stickers im actually really fond of that little canister thing i can see using it elsewhere yes  thats a sticker the rope and hook i forgot to mention it before this set comes with two accessories besides the machine gun  binocs and one of those little things to slide down the rope also the thing that extends the rope turns the other side because theyre slightly asymmetrical one of my favorite stickers the door says survival equipment its on both sides definitely a keeper
another of my favorite parts  landing gear this is the front section  and it retracts unlike most ships with landing gear this does not retract without effort coughxwingcough very sleek the back landing gear  and again smooth retraction gotta love it final score 8410 parts 810 figs 1010 dinos 210 copter 910 value 710 dont buy if  you can wait for vikings  you dont like any set with stickers  youre not a space fan buy if  youre a space fan  you dont mind stickersdont apply them  youre like to create cool figures overall i think it was worth the price even at 605 pieces however id suggest buying vikings even considering this well hope this review unexpected as it was  helped someone out there until next time bloody jay
thanks bloodyjay another brilliant review i really like the helicopter though i hate the stickers it seem like there are a lot of it it wont stop me from buying it too bad that when will the dino line arrive in singapore    guess ive have to wait for the meanwhile
wow great review for a great set thanks jay i really like it although to big for my city  i too really like the mfs because of your review i am definitely considering it thanks again legobmw
thats interesting news about the european release id definitely be interested to see how they modify the set  chains ropes and crates are definitely useful pieces cant wait for pictures to everyone looking for just the figures  dont skip out and get the smaller set and the tank spend the extra 20 and get the t1 its well worth it i might pick up the steel sprinter and the fire hammer myself still trying to decide if i do ill review them
i guess well have to wait for the photos officially announced by lego the dino attack line is going to be made available in europe in october 2005 edit check out the official dino attack site here
yeah i picked up another one i really liked the chopper lets cut straight to the chase dinos first the worst of course these things are so horrible they dont deserve more than one photo theyre rubbery one piece and the only things that remotely indicate that theyre made by lego are the holes on the bottom of their feet theyre unrealistic to an extreme unmatched by even the previously reviewed dinos in that they are waaaaaaaay too thin one is pink and theyre all grinning fig one interesting thing to note is that this one has the same torso as the ironmasked dude in the chopper not his own barearms torso pic for the sake of comparison now i dont consider this fig as good as the others because the other heads are useful for vikings and assorted castletype people but this has sunglasses all in all youll probably find it useful but i dont still great torso for special ops stuff hummer those headlights  while stickers yes all prints are again stickers although there are much less than the chopper  are great pieces i can see using them as furnace covers or stove burners the windshieldhood area not much to say about this one drivers side my question when this is brought to europe will the steering wheel switch sides  seriously though i love that little steering wheel piece more than i love taffy and im a man who enjoys his taffy left side in its entirety  and the right side view through the right side  no seat here couldve done with another fig to fill the nonexistant seat as well
the weapon whatever its called this uses the same mechanism as the longboat for those that dont have either you snap the little sports stand thing which hits the missile which fires and since theres nothing holding the technic beam up to that height any more it drops down so that the next missile drops into place pretty cool if unrealistic the two on the side do not fire i think theyre mainly there for extra ammo my biggest problem with this set open bed this could have easily been remedied with a few plates interior opened the fire hammer next to the t1 they look very cool together dont they you can also see my curio shelf final score 7410 dinos 110 fig 810 but thats just me hummer 8510 parts 910 im a harsh reviewer i still think that if spacevehicles are your thing you should buy this however if youre a bigger castle fan or just like to get all sorts of lego i would still suggest buying the viking catapult before this however i do think that these are some of the coolest sets of 2005 this is something you will eventually want to get until next time bloody jay
sorry for the double post but i just had another question in mind how longhighwide is this badass copter including rotors i have heard of as long as 25 inches for the length but is this true or is it just an exaggeration
thanks for the awesome review metalandi your pics are very clear and you go into detail about all the functions of the set i agree this is a great set  one of the best of the cg line for sure way better than the boat set with the tower on the bionicle baseplate and cheaper too i even like the helicopter better than the oversized version lots of great parts and a really nice build by the looks of it too i cant wait for this to be released in oz
seeing the pictures in this review certainly reinforce my original thoughts on this set heres an oilrig mod waiting to happen
great set and great parts pack as well i guess i´m gonna buy this when it´s on sale just for the orange parts excellent for exo force
metalandi on jul 19 2008 0128 am said i dont know really in which country do you live i havent been to my local stores for a while now so i dont know if they have it there but maybe ill find some time tomorrow to check it out heh i live in japan probably the only one here who does so i dont have sh at all if sh us or canada had it which they dont i could probably get it forwarded
the worker looks like he soiled his pants um oh yeah nice reveiw very cool set im not sure about the bottom floor glass being dark grey and the top floor glass being light blue
i agree with both of you first i have to add that a few of the stickers were a bit annoying as it comes to put them on espacially the ones on the helicopter where you have to put them on round parts but i didnt really see this at a bad point i really can live with it second it was a very hard decision believe it or not on which new set to buy cause i got a huge 2008 setwantlist i guess itll take some time before i can get most of the other sets i want
thats a great review of a great city set thank you very much metalandi first of all i wanted to buy the 7999 cg petrol boat  tower but now i surely will buy this amazing platform instead of the 7999 if my local toy seller sells the 4210 reason 4210 is something very unusual set i think we wont get a set similar to that in the next 20 years and because of i dont like the petrol boat inside no backwalls  nearly no interior  klausdieter
thebrickster on jul 19 2008 0230 am said i just cant believe someone would rate this set a 1 it appears to be a trend among these classic reviews never with a comment of why maybe a tfol it is our destiny to show them that lego existed before 1997 and was imho way better than today we need more classic reviews i hope i can continue with technic sets
people giving this 1 g id give it a 4 id give it a 3 but added a point out of nostalgia i think its a nice town set from the old days the only problem i always had is the lack of an ambulance and we got a female doctor 
brickster strikes again with another awesome review ah one of the few hospital related kits lego made wasnt this the first hospital with modern minifigs because i seem to remember seeing an even older hospital online that had the armless faceless figs regardless this would be great as a little doctors office in someones town layout  although the vehicle is a little silly and that eye chart sticker has to be the coolest decal ever quote maybe a tfol well it sure isnt me i personally love older kits even though im only a teen i like a lot of the newer sets a bit more than some of the classic stuff but i have always agreed that the 70s and 80s were an extremely high point in legos time even though i dont really own any kits from the period edited by grevious 19 july 2008  0505 pm
gave it a 4 its not exactly town plan but its above average
i like this set like most i view it more as a clinic it sits nicely in my town plan these old sets are all very cool
hello all eurobricks members and town lovers today i will be doing up a review on hook  haul wrecker this name is quite wierd to me i will prefer to call it the regular tow truck this is one of the service and repair vehicle that are always ready 247 on standby for any emergency towing in our towns name hook  haul wrecker theme lego system  town year 1989 pieces 44 minifigs 1 price usd600 an image of a 6660 hook  haul wrecker let the towing begins hook  haul wrecker is the typical 4studs wide vehicle that takes care of broken vehicles that is left stranded on the roads this tow truck is pretty useful as you can see current city sets hardly have any tow trucks available to tow new cars design this tow truck is catered for 4studs vehicles for classic town can you imagine yourself this truck towing a speed racer car i think it looks really out of proportion in addition the minifig which is included in this set has the regular truck print on its torso i am very sure they must be a fan club for trucks otherwise they should really need a change of clothes nevertheless in my honest opnion i really love this torso very much somehow it makes them look tough even though their face looks very friendly side view this vehicle has a combination of two primary colors which is white and red this color combination looks very good you cannot mistook it for an ambulance since they made use of this two colors too in most emergency vehicles this is my guess i supposed the designer will have tow truck concept as a form of emergency and considered red and white as its combinations this vehicle setup has the typical sunscreen on the top of the vehicle frame however this baby has more unique features installed in it these are the source of its brutal strength allterrain vehicle this tow truck equipped with the best wheels in fact these wheels offer suspension on the roads even when its travelling uphill the truck will move accordingly with its tyres when you act pressure on the top of the vehicle it will either be shifted leftwards or rightwards closeup of these unique tyres take a careful look these wheels have springs installed in it that is the magic of these vehicle and is defintely suited to run on any rough roads with least problems if any eb members know which other vehicles has this unique features please highlight it to me because if i remembered correctly i only remember seeing this pair of tyres in this great set he is ready for some serious towing the driver had finished hook up the pizza van on its back its pretty simple you just have to lift the back of the vehicle and placed it onto the hook presto the van is ready to go this vehicle provides so much fun you can really tow any 4studs vehicle in your town and here we go to the service station poor pizza guy summary review playability 1010 superb fun you will love to use this truck and tow any vehicles design 9510 excellent design especially with the use of the suspension tyres price 910 an inexpensive set based on the 1989 pricing this set is made up of less than 100 pieces overall 9510 every town must need a tow truck if a vehicle breaks down whom will be ready to tow i gave it a 5 based on my review score card what about yours hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine comments and critics are strongly welcomed pictures can be found in my brickshelfwhen moderated
oh never seen that set before fun and strange that wheel supension system has it ever been used in any other sets
indeed they have theyve appeared in 15 different sets in total they also have an identical width with the wide 2x2 wheels holder which is used on cars today they are still excellent today since retrofitting these suspension parts onto todays offroader trucks wont give them weird proportions or any problems and it looks perfect plus they are useful if youre lazy and dont feel like constructing the pinsuspension used in the early 90s for trucktrailers altough stability probably will suffer
superb review of a great setthis is one of my favourite classic sets becouse of all these functionsenginesuspensionand its great design with less than 100 pieces used only 52 congratulations for the reviewi think that its an outstanding set and surely worth 5 stars
cheers for taking the time to put together this review whitefang considering the year of release of this set i love it would still fit in nicely in any city
exxon gas station set  6375 year released 1980 piece count 254 minifigs 3 list price approx 20 one of the gems of my sets from 1980 has to be the exxon gas station it has very nice colors lots of great details and a high level of playability starting with the instructions the backside with a great picture of the complete set the set includes three minifigs including two gas station attendants and my favorite the urban cowboy one of the best things about this set is that it includes not one but two very detailed 4stud wide vehicles heres a picture of the red one which is a twoseater the car has two working doors a hood that opens and a little holed brick on the other side for pretending to fill er up heres another image at an angle isnt she a nice set of wheels heres the yellow car i always liked this one better perhaps it was the color with the black pieces in the back although it is a oneseater the set includes four fuel pumps that are numbered with decals and included a string as the hose heres a little accessory rack for oil and tools and another rack for tires the set had a nice exxon logo on three 1x6 bricks a large jack allows the cars to be lifted high into the air for tire and under engine repairs i love the office with its large 5x6 window inside is a chair and desk and the entire set happy motoring in legoland
i think we only got shell stations in europe in the 80s never got this one but it looks like a typical lego gas station  once again i just dont know how you were able to keep stickers and prints in such a great condition i am sooooo jealous the tires of the cars are a problem though it was difficult and painful to put them off the wheel and back on later the black hat g i would have looooooved to have that when i was a boy
great review of a classic set man this is sure a wondeful kit even today the level of detail is astounding for the time and the whole kit is really cute you know i honestly dont get why some people have complained about the city gas stations figure count  the majority of lego gas stations had no more than three figures  including this one and the wonderful gas and wash express which i actually own i also dont get why people complain about the stickers so much  because even older kits often had a lot personally i think stickers are okay because printed pieces cant be used in as many places if the stickers are really specialized
excellent review its nice to see review of old sets that i dont own i hope to see many more was this released under the esso name int the uk
brickster once again this is another excellent gas station awaiting to be in the limelight i dont understand why i always loved these classic gas station such as shell exxon and octan they just look so lovely no city or town could ever survive without these important key installations around to pump gaspetroleum for all vehicles that depend it for fuel consumption as always all gas station will always inculde a road plate and i am glad i am still seeing roads included in such sets such as the recent 7993 service station however town plans gas station did not include a baseplate though nevertheless let me continue with this review 3 lovely minifigs included in this set its not common to see exxon torsos these days i just love that lady staff very much especially with its classic hairdo 4studs car just simply rocks with such fabulous simple design furthermore it gave you 2 cars instead of one what more can you ask you dont see tlg giving more cars in recent sets these days what surprise me about this cars is the ability of opening the front engine column i remembered vividly that only trucks or massive vehicles does have this playing feature nevertheless its an excellent addition for a 1980 gas station set this is a perfect set even when its going to fit into my current town buildings i am sure it wont have a hard time to match with the rest of the facade i can use this gas station and stationed it near the country side this set is so hard to resist with such elegant design of its fuel pump there are a total of 4 pumping stations the vehicles wont be fighting against each other for slots then the reparing area is very nice it will be even better if it include a shelter on top of it the office is simple and nice i had never expect an office to exist in gas station most of the time there are groceries stores for the consumers to get off buy off some stores and load it in the car no major complains from me i am not trying to be selection bias i had demostrated key points which is good enough to justify my score and i gave it a 5 outstanding classic gas station set
i cant wait the set looks really good i dont know why but i think it looks a bit like the star wars atte edited by skipper 24 19 july 2008  0422 pm
thanks guys the review wonbt be until tommorow but to hold you guys in suspense
best mars mission set ever deserves a great review d
skipper 24 on jul 20 2008 0421 am said i dont know why but i think it looks a bit like the star wars atte could it be that its really big minifig scaled and walks on 4 legs anyway i dont normally like it when people make a topic to say theyll review a set soon but ill let you off since this is one of the few mars mission sets i really like and im glad to know somebody has the set and will be reviewing it peace
excellent i can’t wait to see the review this set looks very interesting

this review should be put on the front page
holy brick i just love the water tank and those legs are soooo cool i dont think i have enough cash to buy after the star wars releaseyikes thanks vbbnfor a super review
i dont like mars mission sets but this one is just spectacular it is beautiful i must have this set even if it means selling my kidney i only have one mars mission set the etx alien mothership assault which is okay but this set blows my mind two thumbs up
today im gonna review the bigger of the 2 castles from the fright knigh theme i got this one last week at a pretty fair prive at ebay new and still sealed i love opening boxes that had been lying arounf for years and being the first to build an old set since i know this castle theme is not liked so much by the general public ill try here and change their minds cause i really think this is a great set this time i have to say my pictures turned out pretty amazing even if i am still using just my cellphone cam but im really pleased now with the quality here we go set nr 6097 name night lords castle number of minifigs 7 number of pieces 598 release year 1997 lets start with a few box  instructions pictures the inside od the box with a few alternate models the back with another possibility how to assemble the 3 main parts instructions next the 6 minifigs starting with the witch on her black dragon all 5 figures of the fright section and the poor royal knight we go on with the set itself first a general overview its really high on the first floor theres a trap with which you can drop stones or other things down on unliked guests the pot comes originally from fabuland i think i love this thing in the same floor there is a second trap if you pull the bar the door opens we move on to the tower itself did i mention its really high on the ground level theres the place for the witch to do her spells the wall is a secret door which reveals a skeleton when turned over on the next level there is this little thingy first it only seems like a barrel but when you pull the two 1x4 tiles on the back a skull is being revealed scary huh  i dont really understand what this is for but i assume its a telescope to watch and observate the dragons i do find that a bit senseless since there havent been telescopes in medieval times or have there been the back of the tower with the prison and the room for the treasure chest the prison opened its secured with a chain which i like very much cause you really can lock it with that treasure chest from the highest peak we now go down to the very ground level at the back of the castle there is another secret walldoor flanked by two shields at the back half of the inside there is the throne hall for the bat lord with a nice warm fireplace in the back this is where the secret door is placed the second half is pretty empty except for these two baskets i dont know exactly what they are for but i ike the idea for using them as water places for the horses one thing that might be a bit stupid is that 2 of the 4 side entrances do not have doors so they are open and a guard would have to stand there the whole day you can see it in his face he isnt very happy with that  that was my last review of the sets i got the last weeks but im looking forward to make much more in the future overall this is a pretty good set i dont know any other one with so much details and playability the minus point is as already said that it is too open on the sides but that can be solved easily with a bit of modding also i must say this set isnt that much juniorized as many might have thought though the design is a bit unconventional but exactly thats what i like most about it all in all it gets a 910 for me hope you enjoyed the reading and the pictures cant wait to see your response edit oops i forgot to put one figure of the fright knight faction on the photo but its the one in the last picture edited by kimt 10 august 2008  0128 pm
nice review good closeups and a good unconventional choice of a set as for the set itself it has its pros and cons in my eyes i like all the minifigs but especially the witch the fright knights are probably the closest you can get for an evil human castle faction as for the building itself on the other hand i like the fact that it can be modified but some of the design choices are just stupid the holes in the wall the one huge tower as opposed to several smaller ones the huge empty space in the center and the excessive usage of bright yellow i guess for a smaller kid the play value is great its easily accessible and it looks sturdy enough but to an afol its not much else than a source for bricks and figs in my opinion oh and they did have telescopes in the medieval times the witch most probably uses it for astrology and even if they didnt were talking about a castle with a dragon and a wicked witch in it so its not exactly a good example of accurate history
ah this brings back memories i have this set and i loved the playabilaty factor opposing to older castle sets i have in medieval times there actually were primitive telescopes you can read about it here thanks for this review great storie great pics
sandy on aug 5 2008 0621 pm said my first post in this topic looks foolish now that i bought this set from ebay i just really wanted the minifigs although i already had the batlord and the black dragon and the parts they will help me greatly in building the impenetrable fortress of the dragonwarriors for my princess quest comic by the end of this week this set will be in my clutches great cant wait for the next installment good review the pieces are so shiny and new all my space sets arent shiny or new this is an excellent castle i got it the day it came out it has a lot of playability
metalandi on aug 6 2008 0140 pm said well that the bricks look new comes from that they are new i got this set new and unopened i know pretty good deal
ahh i remember how badly i wanted that set when it was new oh well definitely one of the most original castles if not the most i actually liked how the 1st floor was made into a throne room the tower looks pretty impressive too of course the castle has a flagrant flaw  the walls on the sides are open i also think it lacks in the minifig count though that is understandable for a castle with a dragon quote the fright knights are probably the closest you can get for an evil human castle faction totally agreed
quite the topic bump but dang what a cool set and so tall this is the kind of sets i had as a kid but i dont remember this one im jealouss
fire station set  6382 year released 19801981 piece count 368 minifigs 4 list price approx 20 legos third fire station was this little gem 6382 the set offered new design elements not previously offered in previous sets what really stands out for me is 1x3 car doors and torsos with printed designs a decal was used for the large sign on the building and the 1 on the hood of one of the vehicles i think this was also the first set to offer the sliding garage mechanism a feature that added a great amount of realism and playability the set also included two blue doors and the new fire hose with preconnected faucetspicket getting on to the pictures i saved the cover of the box for this set but lost the instructions over the years i was able to download some instructions from the web heres a shot of the box cover and the back of the box the set includes four figs three of which are fireman and a lady who can serve as a dispatcher as mentioned above the torsos are printed on my favorite of the two vehicles included i love the design of fire engine 1 i always loved the fire hoses included in this set no string to have to tie or freyed ends engine 2 is this much larger engine with ladder i like how it contains an oxygen tank and fire axe on the other side of the engine are two shutter doors that reveal the hose and ladder controls these are stickers the ladder is much wider than previous lego ladders and extends a good length i like the baseplate of this set which has the numbers one and two marking each garage the building is simple but has a nice design i love the sliding garage doors note notice the two windows of the 2nd floor the actual set should have blinds on these windows ive lost one of the stickered windows so placed the single blinded window on the 1st floor each of the two sides of the garages are the same heres a shot of the right side on the first floor is the dispatch area and a classic blue space computer the 2nd floor has a bed and a chair heres a shot of the entire backside and lastly a shot of the entire station this set is one of my favorite fire stations that offers a great amount of playability hope you enjoyed the review
this is a great set and a great review  thanks for doing these i remember my brother getting this set i got the police station 6384 on the same day truly classic sets  its a shame that i dont have them anymore although i do have the two immediate descendants of the sets cheers rog
a 55 the set is beautiful both the remake and the original a classic and a beautiful thing like dos edited by maiq the liar 20 july 2008  0945 pm
i have a slightly different version of this set and i must say it is great boy to these reviews bring back memories thanks
great review i love tis set too the best firestation ever made by lego mainly because the 80s sets are the favourite with me only i miss a helicopterplatvorm well i made a little modification
i´m glad you are reviewing 4digit sets now brickster thebrickster on jul 20 2008 0714 pm said this set is one of my favorite fire stations that offers a great amount of playability this pretty sums it up the firestation was one of the few sets in my childhood i owned and was not classic space i especially liked the roller doors this was one of the first sets they came with in the late 80´s i sold it to my nephew darn i really regret it when i asked him a couple of years ago if he still owned it and i could buy it back he also had made cash out of it i gave it a 4 there is always room for improvement like the helipad mentioned so it can´t be a 5 in my opinion take off you rose coloured glasses
no question this is a 5 one of the best and most influencial town sets ever imo
i honestly glad i got the latest fire station cant remember set number its waayyy better i voted 3 its realy not that great but its ok
great review great set nice look great features very playable
fire copter 1 this is fc1 over im making my way to main street now the smoke is coming from the legoland hotel over thats a roger im going to shoot the 500 gallon now over fire in your tabletown no problem legos set 6685 fire copter is sure to put it out  classic style set  6685 year released 1982 piece count 99 minifigs 1 list price unknown heres a great firethemed addition to your classic legoland display starting with the instructions the set includes one classic fireman with a nicely printed fireman torso what a great little detailed helicopter i love the use of the red and yellow colors the front opens to allow your fireman to quickly climb in in the back are two round yellow 2x2 bricks for the water supply and a hose connected on each side unfortunately i lost one of the hoses and the entire set isnt she a beauty 6685 fire copter 1 is a great supplement to set 6382 fire station released one year earlier after buying this great little set i had fun puting out fires all over my tabletown oops i think i smell one now
a great small set i remember this set most of all because of the inverted window screen loooooved the chopper but never got it another 5 please
a nice little model with some neat features for its age plus the allyime classic fireman as a bonus however this design of chopper the police station around the same time was the same design i think dated very quickly while is was good to use the hinged car roof  which was relatively new at the time  together with the inverted screen it was superceded very quickly by designs that stood the test of time far better for example 6657 also i dont think i could everbuy a lego fire helicopter because it is not something we have in the ukeire police coast guard ambulance military etc etc but no fire helicopters not something i would therefore want in my lego town great review though many thanks again for doing these cheers rog
hello all eurobricks members and town lovers today i will be doing up a review on snorkel squad one of the most important and basic vehicle in any fire department snorkel squad in simple english terms it refers to fire engine fighting fire always on standby ready to save the citizens from crisis trust me you will understand why this snorkel squad is superb impressive by the end of this review on a side note there is only part that is replaced by another color can you find the difference name snorkel squad theme lego system  town year 1987 pieces 151 minifigs 2 price usd1350 an image of a 6358 snorkel squad looking smart on their standby this snorkel squad is a fanastic fire engine that is ready to save people from the fires its primary color red is used in all fire emergency department and vehicles in case of any emergency this snorkel squad will be activated and arrived at the scene as soon as possible no time to waste personally this is the best fire engine that i had ever seen meet the fire fighters it comes with two brave fire fighters both of them wear the standard fire fighter outfit that is present in almost all fire station sets in classic town the torso is very nice and formal and looks real impressive onto them i love the buttons on them furthermore these white helmets are a symbol to the world of fire fighting these are the people whom save lives by risking their own lives in dangerous situations water hose compartment the water hose is a string that is stored in the front it can be rolled out and the fire fighters are able to use it without much difficulty they will just pull out the hose and spray onto the fire the next picture shows a much clearer look in its interior in addition the fire logo that is on the compartment is actually printed yes its not a sticker and that is great news for us interesting features these clamps on both sides is supposed to stablise the fire engine when the ladder is heading upwards it is a simple mechanism which illustrate clearly what it does this feature is recently seen in construction vehicle such as the mobile crane of course it is not a complicated feature it just made use of three quite common white parts swivel mechanism these swivel mechanism in my opnion are very fun to play with these connectors on the front and the back enable the long fire engine to make sharp turns on any junctions arriving at the scene fast enough this is not a fire engine that only travel straight roads try it onto your base plates and you will be surprised how well it can turn best playable mechanism in 6358 the driver will be activating the ladder at the back of the vehicle in order to adjust the height and making sure that the ladder do not fall short the tiles on the plates are acting like a stoppage the ladder are able to rotate 360 degree without much problem if you removed the driver out of the control panel it goes up as tall as 30cm look at that amazing height too bad i have not constructed my cafe corner yet otherwise i can give you a better feel of how amazing this baby can go i used the old road baseplate as a guide and roughly it can goes as tall as 30 to 35cm look at the black hinges below by shifting it to the last that was the maximum height it can move this is a very good way to adjust the height oh and i forget to mention that there are 2 storage compartments for the fighters to place their equipments behind quite easy to access no doors apart from the standard roof top on the drivers seat there is no doors present at both side i am quite sad to see that there are no doors maybe these fighters are supposed to jump off the seat instead of opening the doors well i guess this is the only major flaws that i had found in this set heading off got you meet the model 6358 fire engine summary review playability 1010 superb fun the ladder and swivel mechanism is really very fun to play with design 9510 excellent design it got an almost full 10 the lack of doors dropped my ratings slightly price 810 a very mid range price i dont think it cost very expensive but i am not sure how much it cost now overall 9210 best fire engine ever and one of the great looking one too get this model now i gave it a 5 based on my review score card what about yours hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine comments and critics are strongly welcomed pictures can be found in my brickshelf when moderated
a great review i like this set it captures the classic town feeling well and the ladder is cool i cant help but feel thought that these reviews are being churned out to quickly you should leave a gap i am being flooded with all these great reviews
this definitly is a nice set i think this was also the first set to use that white basket nice one whitefang
what an awesome little set i really like this engine but dont remember seeing it during the late 80s it must have been out during my dark ages i love the basketsection for the firemen equally nice is the fire hose which extends a good length the color combination of red with white and the trans blue windshield looks goos as well this is a great engine and one that would look perfect in a classic tabletown  and its 4studs wide very nice review whitefang i look forward to seeing more of your classic town reviews
nice reveiw it looks like a great set i think i know what i will do tonight rebuild my lego fire department it has fire pickup truck fire truck from 2005 sorry cant remember set number and the most recent fire station if i can find all the pieces
nice review whitefang with lots of photos  exactly as a good review should be as for the set  i own it and its a very good one the fire squad vehicle is a nice addition to my other fire dept vehicles it offers very good playability and this ladder is so long you can have so much fun with it
quote i am not against with the newer sets it just that part of the reasons which reflected in the review had fufill the basic key factors of a typical fire engine in addition it was my alltime favourite under the firefighting theme yes i agree this set is wonderful even today and is one of the best fire kits ever release and actually realistic scale is not really a necessity in lego  its just my personal taste for example ive never liked the tiny planes in the old airports that much but i can see why a lot of people like them better than the new ones edited by grevious 28 july 2008  0317 pm
one of my all time favourite i still love it even after all these years though it did always seem a bit out of place as when i was a child i’d never seen a similar looking fire appliance in the uk

where are the pics
here you go edit all done edited by jameseh 21 july 2008  0541 pm
it looks amazing i cant belive its actually bigger than the first one id still like an answer to my first question but my mind is set im going to get two 
use your birthday money wisely young padawan im going out now to get this
this sounds very similar to the first one im glad im saving this one till later in my purchasing cycle all the sw walkers have a skeletal fram with almost nothing inside its very disappointing but i guess filling them in would up the piece count considerably does this beast have any good handholds for picking it up i seem to recall a handle or something coming out of the top in the prerelease pics
so basically you cited as faults what everybody had been complaining about since the first information of the set arrived skeletal interior and lack of clones although i didnt realize it didnt have numbered backs that really is just ridiculous lego finally comes up with a very intelligent solution to the frustration seen when building large sets but then they neglect to implement it wtf lame still this may be the only clone wars set i buy besides the exclusives the exterior which imo is the only part that matters looks so fantastic i dont care about clones i have enough of those already and at 90 its still a better buy than the rgs the torrent is cool but not as cool as the fighter tank or dgs imo awesome inconstruction pics
just picked this set up and just took a break from building to go to football practice i have just finished building all of the legs and so far it looks like it is going to be a great set i would have like it if more clones were included but whatever i find it interesting how many clone accessories they give you i dont like it only because i cant decide what i want to use i find it interesting that at lease 2 people are missing pieces i have had multiple times where i thought i was missing pieces only to find that they were in the bag somewhere other than the fact that there is a lack of minifigures i love this set and cant wait to finish it later tonight edited by swman 04 august 2008  0833 pm
i just got this set sunday and its so huge that i cant put it anywhere it is pretty sturdy and heavy thats where the handle comes in im pissed that you only get 2 clones rex has to fight on the ground while you need more clones to man the gunscockpit the legs were the most annoying and time consuming part of the build and yea i agree that if tlg had made numbered bags it would have taken only 2 hours rather than 4 edited by ih master 13uilder17 14 october 2008  1138 pm
i bought this a few weeks ago and absolutely loved making it its amazing how the paneling comes together to make such a tight fit but can easily open up the legs could have been a bit more poseable and the guns dont launch easily unless you push hard and fast id like the firing mechanism to launch more smoothly but it looks absolutely amazing about price it was ¥13000 where i am but im used to lego being expensive in japan so it was good value
probably my most wanted setrgs is too much but this seems a lil overpriced i mean 90 for a skeleton iill wait fr it to go on salewhich i doubt it will
kinganon on nov 5 2008 0436 am said probably my most wanted setrgs is too much but this seems a lil overpriced i mean 90 for a skeleton iill wait fr it to go on salewhich i doubt it will i think it is currently on sale at 60 check the sales thread
sorry for reanimating this topic there is a technic brick in the mid section of this set does anyone know the function of that 
jimbutcher on jul 28 2008 1220 am said hey everyone i just got the rgs yesterday at tru after i came home from camp i saw all of the topics that i missed and noticed a minireview and a review with one pic so i thought id make a huge shiny new review that has lots of pictures and all of the requirements of kimts index im about halfway through building it so expect the full review tomorrow hoope you guys will like it mabye you shouldnt reserve threads and actually wait till your done the threads wont run off i assure you

jimbutcher on jul 28 2008 1256 am said thank you oky wan and apologies to the rest of you guys i guess i was rushing a bit and didnt think this through it was wrong of me to reserve a review if someone does an indepth review before me someone please close this topic otherwise i guess i will do it again many apologies for opening this topic before i actually had a review bad example from me very sorry its ok just remember you dont have to reserve them
cant wait my friend
good but you said that you thought that cody was orange but he turned out to be orange
thanks for the review jimbutcher  i really like this new gunship but i can´t own one until like two or three months and this is with all the clone wars sets 
thanks for all the feedback so far guys i meant yellow for codys color
thanks for the review i havent seen any other clone flashligh pics so thanks for that one starting tonight people will die im a man of my word jifel
inertia on jul 29 2008 0700 pm said for now there is the impulse set i dont suppose you have seen the troll impulse in aus yet
great review this is an awesome set besides knocking down the wall at the side can the battering ram do any other damage to the tower ex reducing it to rubble bricks and why cant the orc just jump out of the hole in the back do they need to do that much unnecessary damage to the tower
th set was fantastic becuase it was cheap and supplied a very good amount of pecies and had rather good minifigures
jimbutcher on jul 29 2008 0102 am said nice short review although a little hard to read i agree that this set is a really great one how is it hard to read but thanks for the review great little set but i do agree that it could have used a russian or two maybe oxley too darthperson
i give it a 1010 for the parts thats the reason i got mine
ha you posted as i finished the last update also can you take the quote of my update out of your post its making the topic obscenely long dsr edited by dark sword ragnarok 29 july 2008  1227 pm
hello again wow this really is an in depth review at first when i pictures of the set i thought yeah kinda boring but after reading your review i think i might buy it when its cheaper the pieces look very good and i love the droids and their accesories thanks for the review also awesomestar i knwo it is a default thingy but it would be good if the quote was taken out of your post as it does clutter up the topic or yopic as dsr calls it
thanks for the review dark sword ragnarok  since the first pics of the clone wars sets were leaked i want this set and with your review i want it even more  edited by darkrebellion 29 july 2008  0448 pm
fantastic review its very indepth and i love it i hope well see more reviews from you
thanks for the review nice job and speaking of indepth reviews my ultra drill walker review was very in depthtwo brickshelf pages
jifel on jul 29 2008 0615 pm said nice review i probably wont get it since i dont like ships much but maybe ill order a magn guard from somewhere i dont really like any of the starships either harder to battle so the closest i get are the 2 gunships this review is certainly indepth but unfortunately £3999 
awesomestar on jul 29 2008 0107 pm said well sorree alright ill remember next time it was just irritating to have to scroll through the same pics for a while thats all besides its gone now dsr also front paged i cant believe it
hmm a tougie i really like the world city one yet the dino one is a better deal ill vote for the dino because i regretably dont even have the world city one
its definately the street sprinter for me there are many reasons for that most of which have been mentioned by others already i hate yellow its the most useless color but i love tan and dark red its bigger and more detailed than the coast guard one plus i think there is a hinge in the back of it so there is apparently some more playability to it as well i love the postapoc style fig its detailed and simply looks cool also while the digger fig has quite an individual look to it the coast guard driver has the generic hero head and coast guard uniform its an overal better deal especially if you count the ludp which gives the set a whole lot more playability no matter how u the ldp may be tan  postapoc figs on
that was an intresting race and i was split between the two until i saw whitefangs reply and the fact you can use the sprinter as a militery thingwhich you could do for both but sprinter just pulls it off better and i like the radar on the back of it so ill have to go with the street sprinter thanks for the nice topic brickster
i vote for the dino quadbike definately i wish i had that but ill have to make do with the much less violent european version dino 2010 not attack heres a comaprison european version usa etc version theres a subtle difference but i prefer the us one as for the coast guard quad i think its ok but not as good as the new one
i like the coast guard one but dinos eat coast guard people so dinos ftw and i think the dino bike would fit in with my collection pretty well
dino attack for me you just cant say no to a huge bazooka though the tan and dark red works for me too
the rancor on aug 2 2008 0939 am said i wish i had that but ill have to make do with the much less violent european version dino 2010 not attack heres a comaprison european version usa etc version theres a subtle difference but i prefer the us one i did not know that europe had a different quad or at least one without the bazooka interesting that the gun was removed from the european sets or added to the us sets i sort of like the chain i also notice a big difference in the boxart destroyed city to prehistoric volcano i wonder if the story was different as well thanks for sharing a good picture  well it does look like the dino quad has the upper hand almost double the votes
thanks for the review christian i was hoping for one soon  this set really looks good but as you said rather big the figs are good and i agree that kiadi mundi should be included i like the hidden compartments for the blasters and missiles and the cockpit is really cool considering it seats two i thought only one i will surely pick this up sometime
nice review thanks for taking the time to share your thoughts looks like a really nice set and ill be picking it up eventually when it makes it to the us
do you have any pics of the wheels i wanna see what those are like
this is my favorite set in the clone wars wave and ill be picking it up without a doubt that is whenever the folks at lego decide that its okay for us to buy their sets in us
great review i really like the look of this set and having played a lot of battlefront i am quite keen to pick one up in australia when it comes out after the ds is paid off looks like some nice greebling and cool colour scheme too
this and the atte and the spider tank and maybe the droid gunship are the few clone wars sets ill buy i loved playing as this tank in the clone wars video game even better with cheat codes for extra missile spam  so this is a must get
this set costs a s100 in singaporei went to hng kong too see lego and the shops there are more expensive by a few dollarshoweveri went to australia before and everything there is the same price but when there is a sale it becomes very cheapanyway thanks for the reviewi was wondering about the details of this setthe clones faces look a lot like anakins facewhy is that soi thought it is supposed to look like jangos
im definatly gonna get the atte im thinking about getting the spider droid and fighter tank i alredy own the older version of the republic gunship but i still want it agentrick57 on aug 1 2008 0844 pm said i loved playing as this tank in the clone wars video game even better with cheat codes for extra missile spam  sorry to get off topic but i own that game i liked playing as the republic gunship the best
4478 geonosian fighter review parts169 figs4 price1500 i think here is a review of the amazing geonosian fighter set it was my first ever star wars lego set here gos 1 manual not much here although its an old style manual cover random shot back 2 general set and minifigs a pic of the entire set it has 2 reddish tan battle droids geo pilot geo soldier geo star fighter and geo turret the 4 figs the droids come with backpacks geo soldier i prefer this gun give him a cane to become poggle the lesser the geo leader detailed legs are always nice the bodies are a little fat for geonosians i guess but nice printing on them the head the wings 1 2 3 voila all done 3 the star fighter it has a landing gear type thing the detail on those plates the pilot in the cockpit cockpit with canopy 1 of 2 ball joint things this is the engine 2nd ball joint which is the front gun 4 the turret the turret by itself turret with the soldier a printed round plate 5 overall build 710 a little repetitive but enjoyable minifigs 910 4 thats pretty good for a set this size design 610 the fighter dosent really look right nor does the turret but they are both strong parts 810 lots of interesting parts and comes with two of the ball joint things as well the minifig parts being good price 1010 cheap for the uk considering the amount of minifigs and parts playability 510 not much but you can have mini battles with the turret and starfighter overall 810 i gave it 8 because of the design which was not accurate and the low number of parts thanks for reading and hope you liked it as much as i did  edited by kimt 04 august 2008  1142 am indexed
i wish they made more sets with those colored droids as well we should have got them with the hailfire droid and dwarf spider set i think i also just noticed look the ball turret on the manual theres no markings on it
nice review sadly my dark ages came right before this set was released
this set was on my wanted list for a long time and the sales at sh came just in time i also loved the set and like you only put the stickers on the toll both it looks great on a town layout with almost no modifications the racers are great the trucks and the limo are the best in my oppinion the sticker sheet is huge but ive seen bigger stickers over multiple pieces are the worst the slammers are ok but not great i played with my 4 years old son and we tryed to do what shows in the box the cars passing the toll jumping the ramps and crashing the trucks but it is very difficult to get it right but the crashes are very fun
tiny turbos are good for parts but im not so keen on them as they have no minifig drivers so i wasnt sure about this set but your review has made me like them more i probably wont buy the set but i appreciate it more thanks for the review
kimt on aug 3 2008 0106 pm said thanks for the review ill definately get this set sooner or later you better hurry they are not at sh any longer quote a fine set carwise dump the slammers and buildings into the spare bag and keep the cars that´s exactly what i did the slammers are already seperated to our color boxes
as my summer holiday was kinda wet for 2 weeks i decided to shop some sets i crossed the german border and bought me this one mainly for the parts to get time going i built the models and made this small review for you to enjoy or hate high resolution pics can be found here when public set 4994 title fierce creatures price 999 euro  1299 usd pieces 193 minifigs 0 the box the box looks awesome it has some great animations of the 3 models in the instruction the rear of the box shows some nice upcloseandpersonal drawings of each model i think it works better having the models drawn instead of a mere photo of them somehow it allows the great colourscheme to really show the instructions the instruction is easy to follow and shows which pieces are used in each building step that makes it all a lot easier especially with so many small pieces as in this set the bricks are divided into 3 polybags and the instruction is a fine small book which can be easily stored along the rest of your evergrowing amount of booklets and pamphlets printed by tlg the models model 1 is a spider and it’s nasty the 2x2 modified brick with the hole would allow one to hang it from a string this beast is sure to give you several nightmares were it hanging from a string in your bedroom – so i wouldn’t do that plus the fact that my wife threw away the box and ordered me to take the spider apart when she saw it – she’s an arachnophobian and does not take spiders lightly it looks real in a brickishnonrealway model 2 is a snake there’s not much to say other than the head is awesomely designed and the rest is bad the body is poorly designed and does not live up to the coolness of the head build the head ignore the rest model 3 is a flying scorpion or something not as realistic as the spider but still a great model with a cool head the tail is a bit poorly designed but it’ll do and it does offer some good ideas on how to use bricks all in all verdicts this is an ok creator set it holds a lot of fine pieces and the models are an ok inspiration given its size it’s an ok set but it’s nothing more than that i’ll give it an average score i enjoyed building the models and fumbling with the bricks in the shade during a “siesta” on my vacation and that’s what it is an enjoyable build and a little inspiration on a hot day with a erdinger dunkel weissbier in my other hand kimt edited by whitefang 23 may 2009  0629 pm indexed
thanks for the review kim kimt on aug 3 2008 0101 pm said i crossed the german border and bought me this one mainly for the parts what parts were you looking for or just for all of the parts i like the story with your wife the spider is really cool nice photo shots on the grass kim too bad the other alternative builds are kinda odd always creators on
4500 rebel snow speeder review parts 214 figs 3 price £2000 edit new box pics added sorry theyre a bit blurry because of the light i took them in this is the original trilogy edition version of this set but there arent any differences to the normal one 1 manual  box the front of the ote box the minifgs on the box top the back of the box with some alternate models and overview of some of the functions the manual cover you can see it is the ote version of the set random shot 1 of 2 posters in the instructions the second poster 2 general set and minifigs the built set contents the three figs with the included weapons how i like to customize the pilots helmets luke from 4500 and luke from 10178 motorized atat the three helmets included with the set 3 turret heres the turret with the rebel gunner standing next to it the controls for the turret  the turret can rotate and tilt two fire at those pesky atat walkers i put a spider web sort of radar dish thing on like on the original 7130 to make it look more like the one from tesb 4 the speeder a front view of the speeder the pilot controls with a atat print the seats for the pilot and rear gunner the rear gunners tow cable a detailed printed plate next to the engines printed plates under the airbrake things more printed parts there is no dss with this set got tie up those walkers we might need some more tow cable  5 overall build 710 pretty symmetrical build but its fun minifigs 810 3 figs in a £20 set is pretty good i think design 910 very strong and close to minifig scale the turret could have some work though parts 810 lots of variety and includes some interesting ones such as the cockpit and rear air vent price 710 3 figs and 214 parts not to bad i guess playability 610 could be better if it came with a snow trooper overall 810 the set comes with 3 figs that only come with more expensive sets also it has a variety of different parts as well as the build being enjoyable edited by skipper 24 04 august 2008  0310 pm indexed
i once bought a entire lego collection including this set however i never have build it seeing this fine review has given me new motivation to do so nice work again skipper
skipper thanks for doing up all these sw reviews it certainly had given me some valuable insights on these sets especially on the snowspeeder it kind of making me regret to pass off this set however i had bought the hoth base instead but had never built it i am just wondering if the snowspeeder had any difference keep up the good work and always strive your best to make each upcoming review a better one
there isnt much difference apart form it has stickers on and is grey also the guns and tow cable gun are different as well as the engines but if you look at pictures of the hoth base speeder not to much is noticeable
i have mixed feelings about this set its one of the sets that sent my into a dark age the birth of my son contributed heavily when i first saw this set i was convinced that the earlier snowspeeder 7130 was superior in every way i liked the look of the 7130 version better i liked the coloration of it better the turret was better it used a webbed 6 x 6 dish after seeing this review i realize i was wrong on some accounts the cockpit is much more movie accurate the 7130 version had two separate compartments this version also came with a tow cable something that was lacking from the previous set while i still am unimpressed with the overall look of this set it is much less blocky which is always a good thing overall i still prefer 7130 to the 4500 version but the 4500 isnt nearly as bad as i first assumed and i regret never buying one of these when i had my chance
podracer not sure where you got that from i didnt have them out the set with treads is a dino 2010 thing which fits in well after a bit of modding also there are some of the old exoforce sets out there like the fire vulture because i always saw them fitting well with star wars
ahem please get back on topic guys
skipper 24 on aug 3 2008 1109 pm said the minifgs on the box top they spelt dacks name wrong good set though
plutofish08 on sep 11 2008 0727 am said they spelt dacks name wrong good set though no they didnt read this youll find the answer close the end of the article
kimt on sep 11 2008 0829 pm said no they didnt read this youll find the answer close the end of the article oh nevermind thanks
i really liked this set it was simple to build yet detailed and included three figures which was nice if only lego would do a few more hoth sets then we could make a real battle
thanks for the rewiev a nice set indeed to bad i din´t buy it when it still was in the stores
you have to love the originals well i didnt like the very first snowspeeder so this is the original to me i like it more then the new one that comes with the echo base beter color scheme and more realistic i think i got this set in stores and still love it to this day 
good review i like it a lot nice job
not one of my favourite sw sets kinda boring and the set is poorly designed imho we do get the general but thats not nearly enough thanks for the reivew and fine pics kimt
my brother had this set and i think it isnt the best set but great minifigs could use a star corps clone or 2 from the bp
7153 jango fetts slave 1 review parts 358 figs 2 price £2000 i got it on offer i think the rrp was £40 the only set to include jango fett and young boba also the decals on jango are from fine clonier im trying to say they dont came with the set 1 manual worn manual random page another random page looking at this page you can that this set has numbered bags back cover look how old yodas computer looks  2 general set and minifigs the sets contents jango with his hair on jango with helmet on with front view of face twist jangos head to initiate super bounty hunter mode jangos doubled sided head boba nothing to special although i think the torso and head are exclusive to the set 3 the ship not really scaled up right as you can see the guns can rotate the central sections interior not sure what this is is it a hyperdrive or a bomb or something there are these side panels on both sides behind the panels a secret compartment trans orange minifig heads in the compartment i think theyre supposed to be saturnic charges side storage compartment the back of the ship how those trans orange minifig heads fallout there is a magnet on the inside of the ship but for what the secret prison which also has a magnet on the top so it can stay on but easily come out the doors on it can lift up to put prisoners inside 1 of 2 identical wing things they can fold for flight mode the controls bottom jet thing let me out of here the prison is great for capturing small children 4 overall build 710 impossible to build without a hard stable surface minifigs 1010 2 exclusive figs design 710 nowhere near to scale but has some nice features parts 810 good parts like that big cockpit canopy price 910 for the price i got it was pretty good especially with the figs it comes with playability 710 lots of features but it would be better if it came with a jsf overall 910 lots of features and comes with exclusive minifigs edited by kimt 04 august 2008  1144 am indexed
stash2sixx on aug 3 2008 0519 pm said i have all three of the slave i ships and i agree with kimtalthough it is a very small compact ship the first slave i boba fett is still the sturdiest the newest slave i boba fett is not bad and is of much better construction than this slave i from jango fett even though i like the size and scale of the jango slave i and the newest boba fett slave iwhen you pick that very first one up it had the feeling ofyou can throw me against the wall drop me off the roof of your house or let 4 two year olds play with meim not gonna break at least thatss my opinion good review thats the exact explaination i was looking for the old one feelswellits just special kimt
very good review theres only one thing you did wrong quote nameskipper 24 post337180 dateaug 3 2008 0846 amthe controls i got this set for a very low price as well and for that its a very nice parts pack with 2 neat exclusive figs
i got the original jsf for christmas which i might buy and review wonderful set the obi in this one is really awesome and its really just a great ship sticker free probably my favourite id fly it if any ship from star wars maybe i should get it and the slave i from episode ii after all i like jango despite having a crap story
good review i always wanted to know how it was different to the boba fett slave i i would probably only get this though for jango fett the newer one looks sturdier and proportioned better imo
outback desert racer gday mates today from the legolands desert down under ill be sharing an image review of outback set 6550 desert racer set  6550 theme outback year released 1997 piece count 48 minifigs 1 list price 4 usd starting with an image of the box and the back side with three alternate models instructions and decals the pieces a side view of the vehicle diagonal view one minifig and the complete set pros  price is under 5 4 usd retail  good impulse set  goes well with other outback sets  combination of yellow and green pieces  working doors and liftable top for playability cons  stickers on doors hood and 1x4 tile no printed pieces  no accessories a wrench gas can and other extras would have added to the set  no extra tire for blow outs summary i picked this set up new a number of years ago as a true impulse buy after buying one of the larger outback sets amazon crossing or outback airstrip its a neat little addition to the theme with its working doors and playability factor although i only built it once before today i would buy again if i had the opportunity hooroo for now some good aussie music to leave you with down under
i remember having this set actually i even still have it at least the pars are somewhere  when i was a child and i used it for making races as it is there for all these many reviews let me think again at that i also planned to make some reviews for the town section i got your message thebrickster dont worry i got a lot to do at the moment but i should find some time this upcoming week
7261 clone turbo tank parts 801 figs 8 price £7000 ouch  edit new box pics added my version of the set comes with a normal mace windu figure and an extra clone trooper also the mace windu barc trooper and jet trooper minifigs were exclusive to the set well you could make the jet trooper yourself  also my set came with 4 extra blasters youll see them later and baby blue vent things instead of trans blue 1manual  box the front of the box the box compared to the motorized atat and the hailfire droid and dwarf spider droid minifgs the back which has pics of the sets functions and alternate models inside the box it has a white cardboard divider probably for strength seeming as the box it so flimsy pretty hefty manual the tt manual compared to the one of the atat ones random shot another random shot poster at the back of the manual 2 general set and minifigs the whole set i accidentally left one of the plates up when i took the pic close up of the figs two battle droids come with blasters and a mini turret the republic from lr jet trooper mace windu not lul barc trooper normal clone the commander look out jet pack maces torso barc trooper legs barc trooper torso he has got to be my favorite clone trooper by tlc the mysterious commander on lsw he was called cody right but he has star corps armour making him commander bly left  normal clone and the look out clone with electro binoculars 3 speeder bike side view of the barc speeder menacingish front view is menasingish a word printed back engine piece one of my shield things came with a crumpled handle it is worse than it looks in the pic 4 the turret the turret it can rotate and point upwards but what if you want to blast all those battle droids that are shorter than the height of the turret blasters add another hinge in that extra hinge in action 5 the tank its to big to get a decent side view pic johnny the cabin boy on the crows nest front 2 seater cockpit the 2 seats better be careful you dont fall off your seat there are some pretty big gaps down the sides back cockpit with dual missile launchers the back seat the engine the large central storage the turret controls fold down to lock into place so it doesnt fall out when driving you can put 2 minifigs up top mace and a clone driving you can see those 4 extra blasters 2 orange at the front of the pic and 2 between the chairs the turret and jet trooper barc trooper on the barc speeder the commander on the lift chair in the back cockpit another shot of that chair 6 overall build 810 quite enjoyable because it incorporates technic and system parts minifigs 910 on a set this size it has quite a lot including some exclusives such as the barc trooper but it could of had a droid or 2 more design 710 way out of scale but generally pretty strong due to the technic frame parts 710 lots of plates and nice minifig parts price 610 justifiable because of the amount of figs in the set playability 710 includes some cis units to fight the clones overall810 needs more droids and it could be bigger i will also probably have a break form reviewing for now seeming as i have just put out a whole load of reviews edited by kimt 09 august 2008  0851 pm indexed as 7261 review 2
nein you rejected lul luls are awesome thanks for the review i like the set a lot mace is only featured here great fig of him too i like the grey jedi robes torso cody is great as with the other figs the tanks probably a second favourite next to the mighty atat of course
thanks for the review ill index it later ive added a poll so that members can vote their opinion and refrain from useless comments like awesome this has been done to all reviews in the sw review index keep up the good work this is one of my favourite sets  i have both versions and as it is known the only difference is the minifigs i really like the tank it has great playability and if it had wings id definately swoosh it kimt
hanks for the price i got the set a while ago and couldnt remember correctly i have now changed it
skipper 24 on aug 4 2008 0404 pm said did your version without the lul mace have trans blue grill things like the ones on the back of the speeder  or was my set a one off i bought mine online thinking it was the new version but i ended up with that very lame lul fig i just hate that fig its completely useless we cant use any part of it for anything although i only discovered yesterday that the lightsaber blade was a standard one and not glued as i always believed so all isnt completely lost in the end i still was rather disappointed by the set its too full of holes  hum i think theres kind of a paradox in that sentence but the barc speeder and green clone are indeed fantastic oh and yes mine came with sand blue grill parts instead of the transyellow ones didnt realise it at first and i spent half an hour cursing thinking they forgot to put them in the box but in the end i dont know if the replacements are any better  since theyre supposed to represent some kind of thruster light or something all in all i think its my worst set not necessarily for the set itself which is ok but psychologically theres too many things that went wrong with it
an ancient set revived from kimts collection just take a look at the box art this is one classic space minifig pack which deserve high rating and i gave it above average i never had any of these classic space figs before if tlg could ever released this again i am pretty sure i will grab multiple packs without a glimpse you need to build your space agentsastronauts with a little bit of accessories added to explore the unknown space i love this pack very much thanks for sharing
lol i dont know whats going on there
sinner on aug 6 2008 0354 pm said you bet but this set is still the most freaky its timmy and a nudist with the trains logo tatooed to his chest edited by maiq the liar 06 august 2008  0702 pm

erhm wheres the review it would be nice to have a few pics of the v19 itself and a few comments on it could you please add that kimt
im still reviewing it the internet broke half way through it
simonjedi on aug 4 2008 0557 pm said im still reviewing it the internet broke half way through it the internet broke thats bad news to all did you push this i am eagerly awaiting the rest kimt
first thanks simonjedi for a great review im interested in what you think of the hydrolics i could spend hours just deploying and undeploying the wings and landing gear im a little worried the very first batch of the hydrolic piece for umm i think it was the offroad 4x4 technic set was very fragile and broke after a few uses these seem to be holding up but im anxious to see if they hold up after 100200 uses quote namewalter kovacs dateaug 4 2008 1147 am post337841 those black pieces used on the landing gear look very bioniclelike if they havent been used before id suspect they will be not that im a bionicle expert or anything quote right you are they are bionicle bohrok head pieces so pretty old in bionicle terms and fairly useless in my opinion but they do make interesting looking landing gear as i deploy and redeploy the wings and landing gear hopefully well get a pilot in the battle pack to help mitigate the fact we only get one here tohst
having just bought myself a copy of the wonderful metroliner 4558 i felt like doing a review before we start id like to thank greenhair for selling me one of his metroliners for a mere 80 euros granted the motor trainstation and tracks werent included but i did get an extra railcar instead   please note that i have included the fourth wagon in the final pic but that the official set includes just three wagons the metroliner was released in 1992 and was extremely popular amongst lego fans the set a picture of the box showing the set completely pic taken from peeron and one of the minifigs and the accessories as you may notice tlc was extremely generous supplying us with a grand total of 11 minifgs amongst which no less than 4 female minifigs ah the population crisis is finally over we also have three suitcases three cups and a small freight parcel and freight handling thingy normally this would include two bicycles a red and a black one a general side view of the three carriages thanks to greenhair and the brickster and heres one of the extra carriage thanks to greenhair and the brickster moving onto the front and back carriage which are externally identical please note that greenhair changed my back carriages headlights these would be yellow in the normal set all the doors in the entire set are printed pieces sorry for the bad picture quality in this one the interior of the two however is laid out a bit differently the space in the front carriage is occupied by a cockpit or whatever it is called in trains and some space to store your cable connecting the front lights with the engine i can imagine it must get quite cramped and dangerous for the minifig driver with all the cabling further back we have a quite random weird looking engine one part reminded me rather of a jet engine on a commercial airplane the engine is accessible by means of the two side cargo doors at the end of our first carriage we hit what looks like the trains restaurant two tables and no chairs the two middle carriages are identical both have a small sink nicely hidden from the intervening and impolite looks of fellow passengers the carriage further contains two tables and four seats two cargo spaces are nicely tucked away from view below the tables our final carriage has a back cockpit as well but differs from the front carriage in the central cargo area  where our train employee is hard at work earning his lego nickels  and the rear sleeping area the bed is a double one the upper one able to be flipped up for somewhat difficult access to the lower one the train station i could not take photos off since it was not included in the purchase judging from the building plans however i feel it was thrown in at the end just to add something to the set its construction is very simple consisting of a few grey plates on top of a few pillars access is provided by a plate which is connected to the platform with a few hinges there are however two lamp posts a timetable and a few chairs so if you dont like the platform you can still use these parts in a variety of other constructios to end off i took a pic of the complete set with extra wagon and a friendly surprised train driver opening the door and greeting the camera man conclusion being a 90s set the train basically builds itself the entire build cost me two hours and a half i lost quite some time simply admiring the set and was extremely straightforward with no suprises at all but i need to admit it has its charm the exterior is simply amazing the sleekness of the design the colours it matches perfectly i believe however that a width of 8 studs would be more to scale but 6 wide still looks amazing the interior is somewhat simplistic but is easily moddeable with a few extra pieces i basically bought the train as a parts pack the standard set three wagons includes no less than 8 train doors with windows 14 train windows 4 smaller longer ones and 4 freight doors the front and back of course count as unique pieces as well one feature i am displeased with are the printed doors i like printed pieces and while the bluewhitered stripe looks beautiful on the side the printed doors kind of limit mocing capabilities to carriages with a stripe on the side i considered simply removing the stripe but i found out i could just get normal grey ones from bricklink for a fair price i am very pleased with the train but since you already know my opinion feel free to tell us yours of this fabulous set edited by thebrickster 09 july 2009  0151 pm poll question was not multiple choice switched to radio group
ah i wish modern trains had 11 figs but seriously why is there a civilian train stop in a cave did 1 too many people get lost playing zork edited by maiq the liar 04 august 2008  1021 pm
i remember to literally jump of joy when my grandfather offered it to me for christmas its an amazing set the train is really beautiful and it comes with 11  mfs so can somebody ask for more
its great to see someone reviewing a train this set is definately a five lego hasnt made a complete train set like this in a long time the metroliner is really a legend among classic trains the great level of playability and detailing makes it a terrific model specifically i was just noticing the details of the passenger car it has a sink  how cool is that and 11 minifigs  when was the last time lego included 11 figs in a single set a truly outstanding train set thanks for sharing images as ive always wanted to see it upclose it would be awesome if you could share some single side shots of the cars
nice review i collect all metroliner i can i have 3 metroliner and when i can i buy a other  my aim  have the more big metroliner collect in france  in first time  its my favorite set
hairy ruben on aug 5 2008 1200 am said the interior of the two however is laid out a bit differently the space in the front carriage is occupied by a cockpit or whatever it is called in trains and some space to store your cable connecting the front lights with the engine i can imagine it must get quite cramped and dangerous for the minifig driver with all the cabling further back we have a quite random weird looking engine one part reminded me rather of a jet engine on a commercial airplane the engine is accessible by means of the two side cargo doors at the end of our first carriage we hit what looks like the trains restaurant two tables and no chairs there shouldnt be so much of the light cable in the front section or cockpit most of the cable should be in the central part of the train then it is not so crowded for the engine driver i have never had a problem with the cable and the space available for it the only problem i had was that the cable had a loose contact after some time when the train went into a curve cant remember if it was a left or right curve the light went off i have now got the same problem with the cable that i put into my santa fe super chief always when the engine turns into a right curve the light goes off my dad could repair the cable for the metroliner even though he is quite skilled at repairing electronic things he found it very difficult to repair since there were no screws to open the electronic plate it annoyed him a lot so ive been asking myself if i should really bother him with a second cable with the same problem the train set itself is outstanding and thats what i voted for i only have the legend 10001 but its 99 identical to 4558 i also have club car 4547 i dont have the legend club car 10002 the reason for this is i always had the choice between one big lego set or several small ones for christmas when i was a child i always went for several small ones metroliner 4558 would have been a big train set but i really wanted a passenger car so i bought 4547 with my savings without having the metroliner i was quite happy when the metroliner was rereleased i bought it with my own money then i could finally use the club car with the train it was created for edited by legotrainfan 15 august 2008  0755 pm
panda9001100 on aug 16 2008 0737 am said only strange they named it metroliner in holland when we speak of a metro i need to think at short distance trains only used in big cities like rotterdam it was only named metroliner in the us because of the color scheme is similar to the reallife metroliner i believe in eu it was called the euroexpress and probably just passenger train wherever that would be suitable the productnumber 4558 is universal though hairy ruben you dont have a review of the doubledeckerclub car on the way do you i myself never got it and i am seriously considering buying one from bricklink plus it is moreorless an requirement for this train one of very few doubledecker cars to actually stay within the general outer dimensions of the train
well it makes the latest trains look crap

i got my indy exclusive in the mail today packaging front back instructions minifigs this set comes with 1 minifig the standard indy with hat and whipno satchel the build i am really happy with the amount of frown headlight bricks that come with this set 12 in all the mudguards are cleverly built with 1 x 2 panels and 1 x 1 panel corners in dark green in the first 2 pages of the instructions there are a lot of great pieces this set would sell like mad if it were released for sale parts monkeys alone would go insane buying these up for the dark green and frown pieces the body of the car consists of black plates brackets and modified bricks with curved tops that allow the dark green mudguards to just peak out cool technique the grill looks cool using only six pieces i wish all small sets were this unique and cool heres the completed jeep it looks a little small for an actual jeep but for a brickmaster set its awesome imo some more detail shots of the set with indy in the drivers seat i hope they take brickmaster exclusives overseas because itd be awesome if everybody could get these my buddy copmike would probably love to be the first to review this set so ive dedicated my review comic to him my rating playability 810 you need to add some other sets and characters to really play with this set design 910 great techniques and inclusion of rare parts but loses a point for being an unrealistic size for a jeep price 1010 part of the brickmaster package it is a reasonable prize for an exclusive set and everything else that comes with the subscription overall 910 great but not perfect and definitely needs to be offered overseas lego would make a ton of money releasing this for sale imo as it really is a terrific small set
super review thanks simply put id have to admit this is one of the best indy sets and in such a small package its a very detailed lil jeep and thats why i like it i have this too but i dont want to open it since its exclusive wait i thought we were calling it rown and not frown
thanks for the review hinckley i love this set i still havent renewed my bm subscription but im sure i can find this on ebay or bricklink and what an addition this would be to my army edited by vbbn 05 august 2008  0132 am
nice review hinckley i just got mine as well by paying quite a high price for it since its exclusive to us however i had not opened it yet and i left it in my friends car i gave it for an above average for that cool little jeep for an exclusive brickmaster set this is certainly one of the best vehicles i had ever seen i like its construction built if this is ever released in the main stream i am sure it will be a hit to get a small sized indiana jones set
nice review i would like to get this set unfortunately i dont get brickmaster mag and the prices on bl ebay will most likely be ridiculous i wonder why indy doesnt come with his murse man purse in this set thats the best part of the fig the jeep itself is very nice especially with the dark green by the way what is frown brownish something i guess oh yeah and funny comic
jimbutcher on aug 4 2008 0909 pm said by the way what is frown brownish something i guess fakebrownfrown faramir on aug 4 2008 0911 pm said nice comic too remind me not to run into copmike and his gloveless hand in sweden the latex gloves are yellow
i really enjoyed getting this set in the mail its such a great small set and a good example of how smaller vehicles can have great details on them too the only drawback is that i didnt get another satchel for my various uses for them
hinckley on aug 5 2008 0531 am said in sweden the latex gloves are yellow in sweden the police make fun of you stauder
thanks for the good review  i can´t wait for mine to arrive and just think how close paulc was in his reverse building of this which turned into a event exclusive in billund  he was just wrong on the color of the headlight bricks black instead of frown and the rear bumper stuff which couldn´t be seen on the bag picture kudos paulc as for my badass patrol car and the sop standard operation procedure of cavity searches there´s more to see here over at brickzone  here´s a teaser copmike
this is by far my favourite outback series set i loved the fact that you can bend the bridge in different directions so that the suspension of the car really worked to keep the car levelled like you placed it in your last picture i had lots of fun with this when it came out eleven years ago in 1997 the bridge scene could also be used in the adventurers serie of 1998 classic highest rating buy it if you dont already have it
stauder on aug 7 2008 0617 am said the great thing about the copter was it had 2 suitcases which as far as i can tell aint a common part not rare but still nice to have and it had the guy with the green jacket the winch wasnt bad either the only flaw was it was a standard lego copter meaning similar ones where avalible in quite a few sets do you plan to review it oh i wish i had it i dont recall seeing 6487 in the stores back when i purchased the other outback sets id love to see a review
nice review this set looked very nice for its time
very interesting indeed i especially like the folding ladder i never thought of making such a clever function i might have to use it in my future lego models another great reveiw bloody jay 
thanks for the reviews once again it looks like qite a nice set to me although the european version will lose the big gun i like some of the stickers although i wish they were printed and i actually quite like the dinosaur i probably wont get it though the set im most likely to get is the fire hammer

this is my first review so i thought the smaller the set the better 6626 snowmobile year 2000 subtheme arctic pieces 20 1 extra note polybag 6577 is the boxed version price €1  sh on ebay misp mint in sealed polybag building time less than 2 minutes if it came out in the last months if would be called an impulse set it actually came out a few years ago being those my dark years i missed the arctic line now that im back into business i wanted some but not all of the sets were good or easily available i had the chance to buy this one and i0m happy with it as you can see below it consists of a figure on a scooter the only accessories are those chainsaws that lie on the sides unless you take the skis from the scooter and have the minifig wear them the extra piece is a transyellow 1x1 round plate according to brickset and peeron the difference between box and polybag is the sticker sheet you choose whether the nose is better with or without the sticker id say with the judgement its cheap it has a cool minifig with a cool head accessory and a nice torso i dont think i like that orange colour that much and i cant understand why those blue pieces have to be blue i guess its beacuse the whole line uses blue with orange but i have to say this is definetely a good set id give it a 4 out of 5 in its category if you want to own at least a set per every theme this could be your arctic one packaging content minifig i hear you ask whats that yellow thing on the left leg dust or something alike the snowmobile edited by the cobra 07 august 2008  0233 pm
here we are my first clone wars set and my first star wars review here we have the wonderful droid gunship one of the cheaper of the clone wars sets this set is exclusive to walmart and its one of the better exclusives out there im looking at you twilight  first off we have a shot of the entire set with the box a random page shot along with pics of the parts list the build is split up into three sections the back the cockpit and the missles the back has a lot of nice dark blue plates and is the only part of the set which uses stickers the bottoms shows various technic systems which ill get to later the cockpit has many details mostly guns and the rotating guns are a nice touch the cockpit can fit a battle droid but not a minifig im not sure why a droid would want leather though the last part is loading this baby with the missles there are four blacksmall and two dark bley large missles which are loaded in groups of three as sls the middle mechanism is for the missiles and the back part with the bionicle teeth are used ad landing gear the knob on top turns to release the missiles on the clones  leftover bits and the used ssnot so d this time around the gunship versus a time traveling agent charge  overall build 810 a basic build but at some points repetitive minifigs 1010 just your basic droids you cant go wrong design 710 a basic design with some interesting techniques pieces 910 a mix of old and new pieces along with the return of this lovely piece which hasnt been seen for almost 10 years price 810 30 for a gunship ill take it final verdict 810 a great price for a small set like this and it has a great bit of swooshability
this is a very nice looking set it could do with a few more clones but hopefully that will be fixed next year with battle packs back to the set i think the colors on this are great i love dark blue and the design is pretty good too it seems to be pretty accurate compared to the real thing thanks for the review
agentrick57 on aug 9 2008 0925 pm said thanks ill try to have some better pictures by tomorrow as soon as i get my camera back from my brother great that would be awesome nice review though  thanks for contributing to our evergrowing review index
my one post was deleted so i shall remake it thanks for the review i really want this set and i will get it as kim said perhaps it could be taken in sunlight
i dont really like this set because it isnt my idea of the droid gunship which is from sw battlefront which can hold as many droids as a rgs can hold clones if i buy this itd be for the dark blue pieces which is the signature color of one of my castle nations  dark red and dark blue 
well i havent been keeping up on what was going around in lego starwarsbut i think this review would be an average
cloneme on dec 30 2008 0423 pm said actually its on sale now or at least for americans damn americans jk nah im aussie mate
hollisbrick on dec 29 2008 1122 pm said damn americans jk nah im aussie mate oh that sucks actually im 14 aussie but i dont live there i love this set i dont see how people dont like this this is exactly like in the movie and personally if you thought it was supposed to be different i think you should study your star wars a little bit more
thanks for the welcome everyone though im still wondering where the drone minioncommander idea came from
set 7680  the twilight theme star wars year released 2008 piece count 882 price aud14999 or 15999 if you buy at tru 9999 euro us9999 pity the twilight when rumours of the set name first circulated speculation was swift twilight  that suggests something sleek elegant and mysterious anticipation mounted fanfrenzy grew finally a pic leaked and the verdict was clunkadunk it appeared that in the jedi offseason anakin was running something that looked like an intergalactic garbage scow like roger wilco in the old sierra space quest pc games blocky and bley seemed to sum it up the set went from being one of the most anticipated to one of the least liked of 2008 pretty much instantly its a mark of that dislike that in the eb clone wars review feeding frenzy nobody has so far even bothered to post a few pics of this set even 2 weeks after its official release im here to redress that imbalance now and find out if 7680 is as horrendous as everyone originally thought part 1 box  parts front of the box its quite big same size as the 10144 sandcrawler annoyingly its the old style with the perforated corners that you have to tear to flip open the lid detail of the back showing set functions interior of the box  a lot of wasted space the set comes with 2 instruction manuals each 76 pages and no dss sheet polybags 13 of em like the other cw sets these are unnumbered parts ahoy you can tell at a glance that this set is comparable to the atte although there a large proportion of the 800 parts here are technic pins and bley plates part 2 minifigs and build the set comes with 4 figs or 35 depending on how you look at rotta  anakin ahsoka r2d2 and rotta very disappointing that theres nothing new here for such a highpriced exclusive although i guess it is maybe movie accurate anyway to paraphrase the wise patsy stone you can never have enough hats shoes or new anakin ahsoka hairpieces so its not too bad pics of the build in progress a quarter of the way through we can already see that this is one of those convoluted technic frames with some plates affixed type builds halfway and the smaller wing is added at the three quarter mark the giant single wing is added and voila done the final quarter is a race to attach all the exterior surfaces and details such as the engine and escape pod the build itself is a mixed blessing it is very technic oriented im not a technically minded person and dont really have much of a conceptual grasp of how everything functions until i see the final result so i find these type of builds a little uninteresting pins axles and beams give me bricks any day i really liked the 7676 gunship and the 7679 fighter tank although they do contain some technic framework they are largely brickbuilt ships especially the fighter tank which is solid largely brick built and full of neat functions the 7680 build is one of the most technicy builds ive ever undergone in a system set akin to the experience of building the 10178 motorised atat but whereas with that set you could understand the need for a technic framework the thing walks a lot of this seemed excessive yes the twilight does some have nice functions and it is so large and heavy it does need a strong skeleton but to me it just seemed too much and aesthetics have been sacrificed for in some cases limited functionality i will discuss in more detail what i mean as i look at different parts of the set on the upside this is the only nonsymmetric set in the cw range so at least every page and new step brings something different part 3 a closer view closeup of the main body of the ship fronton it is welldesigned how the figs appear in line of sight unlike the 6211 where jabba and leia were photoshopped in to the box art dont ask what rotta is doing out of the line of vision there some things are better left unsaid side view showing escape pod smaller cylinder and drive top view rear view showing back door the rear deck is huge indeed the whole ship is huge oddly so i dont know if this is moviescale or not but ive seen people complain the fighter tank is too big  and that set is nothing compared to this baby its wider than the gunship and in wingspan and length is almost bigger heres a few pics next to an mtt for comparison pretty big hey turning to the dark side must be good for business even if all you can buy is a rusty old beast like this at least you could comfortably squash pretty much every vehicle in the opposing fleet just by landing on it at least now you can see why it costs so much the official pics make it look smaller somehow by truncating the rear and wing the ship is in fact so big you cant really pose it with wings open  only hold it that way i was too lazy to build a giant transclear support strut so propped it up on a shoebox instead the wing opens very neatly  you push a technic lever and a pin holding the bottom wing pops out quite smoothly the little top turret can move up and down as well to get the full crossshaped effect part 4 features and functions the front cockpit folds down very neatly although i find the build here a little weak whee it goes all the way down to the floor the mechanism is cool but it takes up an awful lot of space basically the whole front is cockpit and all lego could manage for controls is 2 printed 1x2 tiles as well not pictured here but theyre attached to the part that folds up and down theres also no way for anyone to get in or out of the cockpit and an invisible windscreen technology has come a long way side view looking from wing r2d2 is here as well as some tools you can also glimpse here one of the main problems with the set despite being a huge boxy ship theres no interior none the twilight doesnt even have an internal floor all the room inside is taken up by the landing gear which folds up  again a clever function but it really gets in the way of the set as a whole kudos to the designer for coming up with stable working landing gear but too clever by half if it means that this giant ship ends up basically being one tiny cockpit and a rear door at the back that doesnt lead to any interior underside showing landing gear when open and closed  when the wing is folded down the gear is locked in place which is pretty neat spaceconsuming but neat the rear section the door when opened reveals an orange cupboard and a towline as ahsoka uses in the box art the door clicks into place when open and can be released by pressing the technic bit at the top again clever but pointless as you cant get inside ahsoka can indulge in a little recreational bungeejumping if she so wishes the rear deck is so large that it is wasted just being used so ahsoka can bungeejump i came up with a much better use for it outdoor garden despite having one roboticised hand anakin was still quite the green thumb and his lightsaber was very useful as a hedge trimmer so much so that he set up a side business between rottarescue missions heres a promotional postcard a few other bits and pieces the gun turret on the enormous megawing can only hold one flick fire missile at a time you do get two though  rear engine detail the escape pod sits neatly on the side and is basically built the same way as the gunship bacta tank the pod sits on these tehcnic pins and is held in place by the light bley parts part 5 in conclusion the twilight is a huge ship with a huge amount of great functions  folding wing folding cockpit rear door escape pod retractable landing gear but this functionality comes at a price  a very complex technic build and zip interior compared with the gunship for example which is stuffed with nooks and crannies the twilight suffers in this respect i also think it is just too large  it doesnt really fit with the other craft and vehicles released with the clone wars line i may be wrong and it is movieaccurate but when you have all the cw sets laid out it does stick out like a poor thumb part selection is ok with the only interesting things being a few dark orange plates the orange cupboard and the big transneon green radar dish dont get me wrong i dont think this is a bad set at all its just the other cw sets are so sweet i would say its an above average set in a field crammed with excellent ones if youre a completist buy it but if for example youd rather invest in another atte to upgrade your republic army then i couldnt really disagree with you either and to finish on a light note id like to remind you that you do get another ahsoka hairpiece which can be used for all sorts of things ugha warrior upgrade dr inferno hair transplant and finally attack of the deadly blueringed octopus native to australias beaches and oceans thanks for reading
really awesome review sveltecorps  you did a really complete and indepth review of this beast and with your nice pics is really enjoyable reading your review so congrats  i like this ship even if it looks so bulky but i need to buy first other sets so maybe this beast will be landing in my collection the next year or this one if i am lucky  i can just ask for something can you post a pic of all your clone wars sets together with this one all the sets in one pic not many pics with this an each set  please  edited by darkrebellion 12 august 2008  0220 am
this is probably the best review ive ever seen why it put the set in context with peoples changing thoughts about it it commented on the box why do such expensive sets have such ordinary boxes the photography was outstanding every issue that a builder could have with it was discussed in a calm and rational manner i have the same issues with technic structured sets and sveltecorps summed up my feelings on this beautifully this was an even handed review so thoughtful finally you gotta love a bit of humour in a review that gardenis brilliant i was probably never going to get this set anyway but it sets a new worlds best standard for reviews i strongly encourage anyone thats going to review a set to have a good look at this to see how well it can be done thanks for the magnificent review
thank you sveltecorps for the review i like the inside nice and cosey i also like your little garden for me this put the twilight different in a better perspective than my first perspective of the twilight i voted outstanding greets theforce
i will not be picking this one up the main thing is that it simply looks akward it is big and bulky and seems to have random pieces on it with not reall streamline feel to it i also agree that for an exclusive that it 100 it needs more than just 35 mini figures anikan and ashoka and rotta already come in the atte which is cheaper and has more figures r2d2 is a figure that i am sure everybody has at least 4 or 5 of for that kind of money i expect something with at least one unique figure and more than 4 i also want just a cleaner and better designed set this is probably the letdown of the collection so far every collection needs one
seems like tlc has done a pretty accurate representation of the ship the real fault for the ships messy design has to go to lucasfilm not tlc my guess is lucasfilm is trying to recapture that what a piece of junk magic of the millennium falcon i guess well have to wait to see the movie to see if they succeeded or not the idea of a space mobile home reminds me of the winnebago from spaceballs great review informative entertaining and opinionated so many people shy away from stating an actual opinion in their review for fear of offending anyone whats the point of making a review if you dont state what you think about it
i think some people agree that this ship is better than when we first saw those pictures at least i do it looks like it has some nice accessories that come with the ship as well my favorite of you custom things has got to be the octopus its so funny and a great use for the headdress thing great review edited by skipper 24 13 august 2008  1124 am
quote part 3 a closer viewb closeup of the main body of the ship fronton it is welldesigned how the figs appear in line of sight unlike the 6211 where jabba and leia were photoshopped in to the box art dont ask what rotta is doing out of the line of vision there some things are better left unsaid quote rotta can i get on your knee to look outside anakin no rotta can i pull this lever anakin dont touch it rotta i want to drive anakin if your not quitting i will get you back to that mean white woman rotta i need a clean diaper anakin ashoka get of the toilet its my turn to get some rest ashoka i thought i would become a padawan not a babysitter quote the rear deck is so large that it is wasted just being used so ahsoka can bungeejump i came up with a much better use for it outdoor garden despite having one roboticised hand anakin was still quite the green thumb and his lightsaber was very useful as a hedge trimmer so much so that he set up a side business between rottarescue missions heres a promotional postcard and to finish on a light note id like to remind you that you do get another ahsoka hairpiece which can be used for all sorts of things ugha warrior upgrade dr inferno hair transplant and finally attack of the deadly blueringed octopus native to australias beaches and oceans thanks for reading quote lol the garden would be lovely to see in gardeners world never thought patrick star also liked gardening
i bought four of these sets i guess this was the best selling impulse set so far great idea to have weapons and helmet choice as for the price id say 7090 is surprisingly cheap
argh what i was typing kept getting deleted by my stupid keyboard on topic this looks like a great little set i could use a few of these but i havent seen any at a local store too bad for me i suspose  great review and i like the green plate on the bottom never can have too many greens for my small but expanding swamp im building hope i can pick some of these up eventualy
time for another of the great castle sets and yes this one is a great army builder set as well d set 7090 set title crossbow attack price 529 euro  599 usd pieces 54 release 2007 the box and as the other two sets reviewd so far 7009 and 5615 this one has a fitting box that is too easily snatched from the shelf and put into your shopping cart  not sure its a great thingtoo expensive in the end d the crossbow attack cart the cart is a neat little build that actually works and for once were not given that awful technic launcher but a buildit launcher it actually works just fine for its purpose the addition of two crossbows makes it worth buying never can get enought weapons for the evergrowing crownie army the figs oddly ive not taken any pics of the figs and therefore ill illustrate using the sh pic the figs are great i love the silver helmets and in this set you get 2 crownies and a skeleton plus a white skeleton horse thats a lot of figs for a set this size a true army builder thumbs up for that the all in all verdict another small yet super set in the castle theme i bought several of these to make a fine little army its cheap and often found on sale i can hardly resist buying it when i see it kimt
hard to find in italian shops i had a friend buying one for meas soon as the set was available i always wanted another one so while in switzerland see kimts 7009 review for the full story i bought two for 5 €uros you get two knights a skeleton and a skeleton horse some hand weapons and a shooting device please remember dont aim at the eyes just great
this little bugger brought me back from my dark ages as a movie fan i just couldnt resist the thought of making an animation with living lego skeletons im referring to ray harryhausens work on the classic jason and the argonauts here buying the indy sets stopped me from getting a lot more castle sets though in time i added the final joust the wizard and the impulse knight to my collection as well as buying more unique figs king princess from expensive castle sets off bricklink so yeah great little set two crownies a skeleton and a skeletal horse you just cannot resist that even if you hadnt been buying lego for 5 years as far as im concerned this set is one for the ages i love it
and another set enters the scene set 7009 set title the final joust price 829 euro  799 usd pieces 62 release 2007 the box and yet again tlg has put the bricks in a box that somehow corresponds with the amount of bricks in it the castle theme has got well designed boxes  the whole set build 2 knights jousting fence and weapon rack the weapons rack another great addition of weapons flail halberd and skeleton scimitar super weapons for those close encounter melee battles fought when tipped off the horse  grinp the jousting fence not much to say its a fence simple yet it serves its purpose very well the crown knight gotta love that guy he looks like nothing can hurt him he even got a selfsufficient smile on his face im sure hes convinced that no skeleton can defeat him also the horse its barding and the headcover looks awesome a great old school sword and the ever cool normannic shield what could possibly go wrong for this knight the helmet i really love imo its a lot better than the old knight helmets see review of 5615 the knight for a pic of one of those the skeleton knight the black skeleton horse rocks i love that design and in black its even badder than than the white version the shield reeks of dread and the knight is one bad skeleton on the rampage i do find that the helmet is a little off id rather have a black knights helmet instead the kk helmet doesnt really do it for me the all in all verdict this is another great army builder set it holds a lot of great weapons some cool minifigs and great pieces the only thing that puzzles me is why would a crown knight joust a skeleton doesnt really make sense kimt
ive been waiting to hold this set in my hands for about a year and a half thanks to a silly tlc decision 7009 was not available in italian stores i finally decided to buy it on the net 2x  plus some other sets and those morons at the custom charged me quite a lot after i bought it while waiting for it to arrive i found out it was available in a store in switzerland not far away from home thats for the storytelling as for the set i thought it was great and still think so a good army builder as quite a few sets in the 20072008 castle line and a time traveller 6021 being my first lego castle set ever rating 55 edited by the cobra 13 august 2008  0904 pm
lovely set nice collection of weapons cool horseaccesoires for the white knight cool black skeletal horse on the dark knights side loving the printed armours of both knights and as opposed to kimt apparently i really dig the black helmet i feel theres a lord of the ringsflavour to it with those curves well designed
i should really get one more of these for the figures shields and weapons this set is the only one with the scythe in pearlgrey by the way the only thing that puzzles me is why would a crown knight joust a skeleton good question for a joust to make sense this set should contain two human knights instead  which would be fine with me so long as they had differing armour and colours edited by tenorikuma 13 august 2008  0351 am
im not a huge fan of this set but it is a great way to nab a fully mounted knight complete with a very attractive barding given that in prior years it wasnt possible to get a barded horse in such a small set this set is actually a decent way to build a mounted cavalry for your kingdom looking at bricklink it would probably cost as much to buy the knight horse and weapons separately and that doesnt take into account the skeleton or the extra bricks despite my indifference to this set i actually have purchased four of them in the past year simply because there isnt a cheaper way to acquire a mounted knight a quick question about the poll are we voting on the quality of the set or the quality of the review later edited by blueandwhite 13 august 2008  0550 am
good review kimt pictures are clear and show each of the pieces in great detail i agree with your comments as well im a bit curious does the knights helm have a hole for plume ive been debating whether to purchase this set or not im not a big fan of horses so ill likely barely use them but i do like the unique minifigs weapon rackweapons and the fact that the divider has a few useful pieces that can be added to other sets however i just dont feel the set is worth 8 when compared to crossbow attack and the knights catapult unless the buyer is really wanting some mounted minifigs luckily amazon just lowered their price of this set from 8 to 6 along with another 20 if using bill me later just in case anyone was also in the same situation i was in at that price its damn well worth it
dj2005 on aug 29 2008 1126 am said im a bit curious does the knights helm have a hole for plume i can answer on behalf for kimt if memories served me right yes there is a hole for placing the knights plume do correct me wrong if i had answered wrongly its been awhile since i last touched my castle sets thanks kimt for this fine review this is one of the castle sets which i had bought high volume mainly for its horses barding and the weapons a great army builder and accessories for your castle armies this is an instant 5
this looks like a really great set i wasnt around in 88 to get it but i like it it actually has things inside the interior thanks for the review hinckley on aug 13 2008 0611 pm said there were quite a few sets in the 1980s that werent sold in the us hooray sort of in england we dont get in normal shops batman and spongebob sets and not at all  avatar sets and brickmaster but america gets all of these maybe its revenge for americas lego neglect in the 80s hinckley on aug 13 2008 0611 pm said i remember reading once that it was because they contained wine glasses and tlg felt they wouldnt be able to market a toy that encourage the drinking of alcohol this set was one of them they didnt want to encourage the drinking of alcohol in america but were fine encouraging it in other places maybe thats why my country has such a big problem with binge drinking or maybe not
thats a great review of a great set hinckley i voted for outstanding  this set is simply amazing i regrettably dont own this set since its very hard to find on ebay andor the stickers are missing but nevertheless i hope that i one day will be able to get this awesome set  or even better  see tlg releasing a new city villa in a style similar to that brilliant set  klausdieter edited by klausdieter 13 august 2008  0630 pm
shoc on aug 13 2008 1128 am said they didnt want to encourage the drinking of alcohol in america but were fine encouraging it in other places maybe thats why my country has such a big problem with binge drinking or maybe not i think this was an early sign of american parents being hypersensitive to things wont somebody think of the children guarded inn was another set only sold in the shopathome and not in stores for the same reason
hinckley on aug 13 2008 0949 pm said i think this was an early sign of american parents being hypersensitive to things wont somebody think of the children guarded inn was another set only sold in the shopathome and not in stores for the same reason and to think that this is the same place that got dino sets with guns when we europeans got them without well that is a couple of decades later
shoc on aug 13 2008 0319 pm said and to think that this is the same place that got dino sets with guns when we europeans got them without well that is a couple of decades later yes yes in the states horrifying and deplorable violence is fine but drinking and swearing sends kids directly to hell
lots of rare parts and a good baseplate sounds great how much did this cost you and where did you get it from
this is my favourite house which i owned during my childhood although its in the crypt but i hope to build it back one day looking at your review makes me so envy of you to own a complete set the baseplate is very unique especially for its stoned pattern classic lego telephone is just so lovely especially when its printed the entire house layout is simple and very nicely constructed in fact the simplicity just showed how much lego could do with such parts there are many nice furnitures included in this set such as the little ovenstove dining table bed and car porch the little black car is a classic example of a true 4studs car i love this house very much and my verdict is a full 5 no doubt about it thanks hinckley for this lovely review
ive 2 of these sets one is for sale 
i wish i could find this set some day including the right baseplate some of my house mocs are styled after the classic 6349 and sometimes ive rebuilt it after instruction scans exchanging the baseplate i dont own one of these with 2 at 16x32 each and this city house out of an older thread of mine its offensive that ive used styling elements of 6349s just enlarged in terms of interior details not much but still enough for classic town i voted outstanding mfg widdi edited by widdi 09 october 2008  0122 am
this would be great for any pirate fan the extraback pack for the soldiers some spare owes for the row boats a female face for a wench and a rather simple raft for that unlucky pirate lost at sea over all a nice set i am a little confused by the dynamite though perhaps an easy way to go fishing or perhaps to clear a rock in the forseen future or is it that she is just a suicide bomber attacking the white house water joke not ment to be tasteless or offensive to those lost in the act of terrosim greatest respect to those who have lost loved ones great review regards cpt pb
overall an excellent set concerning the price range nice review whitefang
aerial recovery set  6462 theme town resq year released 1998 piece count 201 minifigs 3 list price 25 usd my personal favorite of the resq theme released in 1998 was this helicopter 6462 aerial recovery the set offered a pretty modern helicopter raft threewheeler rescue gurney and net and three figs including a diver the set is actionpacked and offers a high degree of play value starting with the box front side and back front back i always liked the rough oceansea water pictured in the boxart the same image from the front of the box appears on the cover of the instructions but the back of the instructions picture a plain view of the copter one sticker sheet with a few resq stickers is included mainly for the tail section of the helicopter interestingly the set includes three figures one being a diver what i always found strange is the inclusion of an xtreme team diver who has the logo on his torso although its a very nice fig back shot i think this was my first set with a lego threewheeler i always liked it a lot the set includes a yellow raft also found in the divers sets and some scuba gear note the raft has a black piece in its center for lifting up by the helicopter for sea and emergent rescue a gurney can also be lifted by the helicopter the set also includes a net with hook to lift the threewheeler and other items an extra string pulls the net closed heres a shot of the helicopter the front section has a large trans blue piece enclosing the cockpit inside is a printed radar slope a smaller trans blue piece appears a bit higher for access to the middle section of the helicopter andor a small storage area in the middle section is an place for the gurney and a box for storing some of the adventure gear heres a picture showing the gurney on the side is a pulley mechanism that swings to the right when not in use on the opposite side is the winch to raise and lower the grappling hook heres a picture of an open storage box i like the tail section with propeller decal is not shown heres another shot of the copter from a different angle and the final image the entire set final thoughts personally i think this is pretty nice set i like the thought of using the helicopter to rescue people at sea using the working winch extras like the trikethreewheeler and the rescue net make the set even more fun hope you enjoy this resq review
i got this set as well as a resq hovercraft this set is cool because of all the accessories and it come with a x team guy your set is also in much better condition than mine you have made me decide to rebuild it another great review thebrickster keep up the good work
ive always wanted this set and the hovercraft too bad i never did great set
what exactly makes you feel this set isnt realistic it has got nothing what wouldnt be on a real helicopter imo and for the futuristic design yes it looks modern but it works and actually most of todays real helicopters also dont look like in the 70s anymore
wow i loved this set i still have it actually in pieces though i took it apart quite soon after i got it then managed to lose the instruction manual
very nice review this is another set which i had never seen before when i am in my dark age quite an useful set especially with the accessories and the minifigs torsos the speedboat is able to hold the car and the rubber rescue boat how can the driver steer this boat with so many things blocking the way i cant seemed to find its control though thanks for doing this review
well i for one really like this set it has to be one of the nicer ribbies that tlg has made tons of playability and nice options for redesign great set overall thanks for the review
about the rarest one up there is that black ninja i only have one ninja and he is dark grey i also have five samurai the witch may be fairly rare but i am not sure i didnt really collect much in the fright knight era
this was a cool set i thoght of it as i was building the post plane
one of the best in my humble opinion as far as i know it was never released in the uk so the only reason i managed to get my hands on it was on a family holiday to the us i think they’d only recently opened the lego store in disney arguable the best feature is that it seems to fit into a wide selection of themes is it a airstrip in the middle of nowhere is it next to a only mining town that’s not deserted the possibilities are rather open and that’s truly great
legoman132 on aug 18 2008 0936 pm said this was a cool set i thoght of it as i was building the post plane interesting thought i have the post plane but i havent opened it yet i suppose its the yellow the plane in this set is much different than most of the other classic town airplanes in that it has the double tail section heres a shot of the new 7732 air mail set  definately a nice set
i have had this on my bricklink wanted list for ages and yet noone with my criteria has it nice review and brilliant set
you think its not a great thing that we get a yoda fig in an affordable set like this that was the main reason why i got this set and what do you mean by another wasnt this the only one that was ever released except for the one in the dagobahxwing set sure he is not the best fig with the unmovable legs and all but still its yoda besides he doesnt move his legs a lot in real life either nice review though and thanks for telling me what that liftarmthingy was meant to be for i never got that and thought it was supposed to lift up the speeder for some reason i got two of this set and the printing on those blue parts were off in the second one i got edited by oky wan kenobi 18 august 2008  0845 pm
i think this is a pretty lame set it came with dooku who i think only came in this set plus a unique lightsaber still they could have made it much bigger added anikan and obiwan and added structures and made it more like the scene from the movie also the speeder doesnt seem very accurate
i wonder how expensive this set would be on ebay shop victoriously

kimt on aug 18 2008 0504 pm said thanks for the review its always good to have a 2nd opinion on a set ive added the usual poll and ill index it tomorrow must sleep super pics and great to have inbuild pics a fine set which ill surely buy when i find it your welcome i was going to make that poll but thanks for doing it and i always try to take clear pics and inbuild pics lt col thok on aug 18 2008 0506 pm said very nice review one thing you have to consider when lego sees pics of the star wars universe they have to decide which would be the easiest set to make with the most playibility therefore they chose the hmp thanks one thing i belive is this lego is starting to make the blue droid factionaat vulture droid etc but sometimes makes brown onesmtt so maybe they will make a 50 maf in brown later like the brown vulture droid last year lets hope edited by vbbn 18 august 2008  1012 pm
thanks for the review i have had second thoughts about purchasing this bad boy and i think you made it clear that it was a nice buy however i would have loved the maf too
youre me want to buy this
niuce review i voted above average its very cool but not awesome
i dont know what it is about this set but i love it i cant get enough of it it looks amazing nice review
metalandi thanks for doing up this review this is a chance for me to gain some insight for extreme team theme this is a very interesting set that can be used for so many purposes 3 different vehicles wide range of accessories and nice minifigs what i love the most is the mountain bridge and tent it provided so much playability i am very impressed with it thanks for sharing
set data 4920 the rapid rider year 1999 subtheme rock raiders pieces 37 1 extra  trneongreen plate 1 x 1 round price euro 350 used not including sh on ebay building time less than 10 minutes more info bricklink  peeron i could have owned the 4910 hover scout see metalandis review here but while i was buying some used sets i forgot to buy that one too so heres my only rr set the second smallest one if we dont count japanese promos sweets are surely sweeter if they come with a lego set pieces face and torso closeup i like the torso the face is good except for the bandanna building is based on two big pieces landing skids and plate 6 x 6 x 23 cross with dome lets go building is over review pros small set  cheap 1 fig two accessories some interesting pieces like the rock and the crystal no stickers but 3 printed pieces good color choice cons tipper bucket is fixed no hinge no levers or steering wheel it probably moves by using the buttons on the 2x2 tile it deserves a 45
i have never seen this set before but the minifig head would be perfect for a solid snake from mgs 2
i always thought that this set was underrated it contains a really interesting collection of parts a decent fig and introduces an odd theme in only one set very well designed for one of the not greats god bless nathan
hello all eurobricks members and classic town lovers  editors note to mark the celebration of classic town this set which is released in 1994 and rereleased as a legend in 2002 pizza to go review is dedicated to classic towns opening cermony and members such as hinckley brickster imperialshadows sinner and many others whom have contributed to the final success of classic town thank you so much for inviting me to be part of this wonderful project and i wish all the best to the success of classic town i urge everyone of you to check out classic town and take alook at the cool stuff we have done  today i will be doing up a review on pizza to go set this outlet is one of the most favourite eatery for any lego citizens living in their town when they are driving on the road they are sure to look out pizzeria signage they offer the best pizza in town no one in town can resist the delicious aroma of pizza coming out from the red chimney let us find out why is this shop so popular among so many lego citizens and was one of the famous sets that is rereleased under the legend theme pizza to go is my favourite set of all time i believed there is no other pizza outlet lying around in any lego city apart pizzeria it seemed there are the sole outlet that is selling pizza for many years this set was rereleased in 2002 and it is part of the legend theme this is one of the few sets that are highly demanded to be brought back by many fans of lego around the world i owned the 6350 any members whom had owned both sets before is there any difference between these two because when i searched through peeron it shown 144 pieces instead of 194 pieces for the 1994 set name pizza to go theme lego system  town year 1994 rerelease 2002 pieces 194 minifigs 3 an image of a 6350 pizza to go let the delivery begins pizza to go is the regular pizza outlet that sells nothing but pizza they deliever pizza to every household in town with their trusty delivery van walkin are welcomed too there is a stand for customers to dine in their pizza quickly before making their way to their next destination in my opnon no town can ever survive without the pizza tradition devoted pizzeria staff every outlet comes with 3 dedicated staff making sure that operations will run smoothly on the left we will have the pizza boy whom is wearing the regular blue dungarees and its white cap i wonder who is that boy on the middle we will have the pizza girl she looks like any typical sweet girl in town that the boys will look at she is wearing a suntop strapless on her she reminded me of one person though i think her name is called alice taking a careful look i wonder if imperialshadows is the pizza boy back then without that black patch on its left eye on another note this minifigure was my favourite female minifigures are very uncommon back then i am glad i have this figure adding to my town population on the right we will have the hardworking chef preparing the pizzas in the oven he wears the regular white chef outfit but he wear a grey pants instead of the usual fullwhite outfit in most resturants such as breezeway cafe 6376 lets take a closer look at the pizza boys van this van is very very small looking and very fuel efficient it is able to cut lanes very fast due to its small size the pizza van is made up of 4studs wide design no doors by the side however in this vehicle i think the doors is not a must to be included in this design our pizza boy will need to leave vehicle pretty fast and ensuring that the pizza delivery is on time common mechanism this van has the regular rooftop that can be lifted up to place the pizza boy into the driver seat there is a sun roof on its top which enable him to let him have some sunlight from above the logo on the side of it is actually a transparent sticker which have the pizzeria itallian logo and a tasty looking pizza on both sides of its van i like that sticker very much mine looks quite worn out over time if its a printed piece it will be a terrific bonus nevertheless i can still accept the sticker our pizza van can deliever up to 2 pizza at a go at every trip 2 piping hot pizza will be stored at the back of the van the pizza is fitted in perfectly in each compartment furthermore the white window shutter is terrific in this design you dont see this kind of design anymore i think i have not seen much delivery vans on the street anymore too base of the van from the base you can see that it is using of the regular red car base that is common in most 4studs vehicle design in fact this car base served as a foundation for its vehicle design back of pizzeria alice and the chef will be showing you around at the back of the kitchen there is an oven on the left a water tap and a holder for the oar stick looks pretty empty right look below for a surprise my favourite feature this oven can be used to heat up 2 pizzas at a go now i understand why this set is named pizza to go i have been using their slogan unknowingly this feature is superb nice now we know that the pizza is prepared from the outlet instead of using delivery van to collect it from a factory alice what are you waiting for help the chef quickly pizzeria the signage sure looks big from far and catches their attention easily too with its pleasnt looking design as you have already noticed this is made up of sticker i dont mind for this set it contains sticker sometimes i do hope they can give us spare sticker for us to change after a long period of time distinct red chimney this is the front of the oven and that is where the smoke comes out using only bricks to construct this is simply wonderful i like the use of their white bricks to construct the wall layout and a combination of red parts especially on the top i like the look of this very much another picture on its side printed parts in this set you will get a total of 5 pizzas and i believed no other sets offer so many pizza you can placed up to 4 pizzas in the van and oven alice will be carrying the last pizza around the green and red round dish is a printed part most exclusive part in 635010036 the most unique and important printed parts that is only exclusive in this set its at the front of the pizza van it is none other but the pizzeria logo standing at the front of the delivery van forgotten to take a picture of this piece took it from peeron different views of pizza to go outlet another bright sunday day in pizza to go summary review playability 1010 a lot of playing by doing up the pizza process from preparing to delivery design 9510 outstanding design with great use of bricks i like the structure of it very much price 9510 an inexpensive set based on the 1994 pricing it comes with 3 minifigs shop a van and a exclusive printed piece overall 9710 i am not trying to be bias in fact this set is absoultely filled with minimum flaws look at my review again if you are not satisfied with it or tell me what you dont like i gave it a 5 based on my review score card what about yours hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine comments and critics are strongly welcomed pictures can be found in my brickshelfwhen moderated
easily one of the best town sets ever and pretty expensive for its size too iswas it that rare i hope i still have all the pieces from mine unfortunately my stickers are in pretty bad shape took them off because i needed the bricks stupid stickers covering multiple parts  only downside to this set the design is simple yet so detailed and the pizza van looks great 55
jopiek on aug 24 2008 1048 pm said a very good set indeed we have at least 3 of them but we like them all what do you mean by we you own three sets of the orignal 1994 series or the 2002 legend series
this set looks really cool especially for one this inexpensive the van is neat and the hidden storage compartment i back is the icing on the cake i like the back with hidden oven as well and the rare sink piece makes it all the better with five pizzas and three minifigs its and excellent set to behold
excellent review white fang  and a great set to commemorate the establishment of classic townnet i almost ordered this set back when it was rereleased by lego but passed on it im so mad at myself this has all the terrific qualities that classic town sets exemplify i love the delivery truck and the pizza oven a great review from one of the master eb reviewers  outstanding
nice review3 or 4 years ago my dad picked up two large boxes full of classic era legos classic townsome pirateand alittle episode 1 star wars etci couldnt find the building in this set but i had the little van from this setits very sturdy i should know my idiot friend dropped this from my second floor window and it styed togethersure the pizzas fell out and they probably got cold thanks for the review
its defintely nice to see this past classic town review resurface again i tom bricks on may 15 2009 1005 am said i used to want this set so badly and i almost got it when it was rereleased i still wonder why i didnt because with a building van 5 pizzas and a then very rare female fig this set would have been perfect for someone with a smaller collection like i had then what surprised me the most is how well this set still holds up to others today off to bricklink i agreed that this set is perfect for someone with a small collection in fact i feel that this set is one of the must have set that can allow you build your pizza franchise in your town posades on may 15 2009 1045 am said definitely one of my favorite sets from my childhood i still remember my sister getting it for me for my birthday and me building it that same day too bad i had it displayed all these years on my windowsill so the pizza delivery van and pizzeria have become yellowed is it possible to restore it by getting those bricks or parts again yellowed bricks is really very saddening it reminds me of my breezeway cafe those were the days where we are too young to know how to take good care of our toys alywin on may 15 2009 1059 pm said i also always think the girl minifig is supposed to be a customer lego is really up to everyones own imagination you are right the girl could have been a customer i thought of her as a staff misrepresentation could be so easy but then again the box nevr stated its role too
indexed allright hi everybody again today im gonna review the biggest set of the resq subtheme 6479 emergency response center with this one i think the reviews of all the resq sets are complete now and while im in a reviewing mode right now i thought id bring that up this set hast got many nice aspects and also some very rare pieces and comes with a wonderful amount of vehicles including a speedboat a tow truck a helicopter and a trike which can pull a little boat so sit down get your popcorn and beer were off to stormy weather at the coast subtheme resq set nr 6479 name emergency response center number of minifigs 5 number of pieces 420 release year 1998 unfortunately i dont have many of the boxes of my resq sets anymore so ill start right off with the instructions this time on the backside there is no alternate model as usual this time but only a different shot of the whole set next a general overview sorry about the slightly bad picture quality on some pics this time originally this set has 5 minfigs which all are really nice but the guy who drives the tow truck has been lost in the flood heres a picture of the missing fig lets move on to the vehicles we have something for the water the ground and the air in this set first the great tow truck i love the mechanism with the hooks in the back next on da speedboat at the rear its got a stretcher and a wench which adds a lot of playability if theres a a little accident near the coast the trike comes to appearance for more complicated stuff we have a little helicopter i broke the rotating piece at the top yesterday ouch   no space for a victim you say well not really but the helicopter also got a wench with a hook in the back now it comes to the station itself at the docks a neat life belt sign is mounted remember at this time there werent real ones as today a little more right an equipment holder is placed with various tools on the front and fire fighter equip at the back at the very front a little lighttower secures the shelter i havent quite found out what this thing is supposed to be maybe somebody knows another equipment holder this time with all the stuff you need for diving more equipment and even more we come to the hear piece of the station the control room with lots of buttons and scrrens last but not least a quick shot of all the accesoires and tools that you get which really is an amazing amount this set might have a few junioriced pieces as the big window in the front or the briedge on the roof but that doesnt matter because there is nearly one other set in which you get so much rare pieces and such an overwhelming amount of accesoires so i can recommend that for everybody who is a piecesfanatic not to forget the playability the great figs and the in my opinion very good color scheme once again thanks for taking the time reading and looking at my review i hope you liked it edited by thebrickster 31 december 2009  0919 pm
i own this set and its one of my favourites simply because of the cool colour scheme which you mention plus all the vehicles and accessories the resq theme is one of my faves of all time actually i own nearly all of them missing a small set that was only available in the us or japan i think dr s
thanks for that very elaborate review nice to have several pics from different angels amazingly well done if this is your first ive added a poll and will index this review within this week along with all the other topics i am to index 
yes the review is great indeed i love indepth reviews with tons of photos as for the set  im not planning to buy it but it looks ok i think its a good tank
bad quality pictures whats wrong with them this is a great review and thanks i was planning on buying this set and no others but the price stunned me thus i bought the atte and the rgs the set is better than i thought though i might do as mutley did and make my own
thank you kimt for adding the poll hehe this is my first review so im not so confident about the pictures thank you guys for viewing and commenting
splendid photos and well written review i love it ive owned and built mine and must say its a good set and the tank dont disappointment in terms of design and playability i got mine stickered well been a perfectionist i am p thanks again for the review that it should deserved d
baby i will like to take a moment to said outstanding piece of review for your first attempt you have done well with the pictures and its flow i have to admit that i love this fighter tank very much the downside of it which is overpriced and two clone troopers do not really justify the purchase well if i have the spare cash i will defintely get one of this keep it up
mattzitron on aug 13 2005 1130 pm said the strange thing is for the first time i can remember the minifigs came decapitated and theres no neckwear i recall jake saying something about it being new lego policy to supply the minifig heads and torsos separately what with the expensestrimming and all its apparently one of the many little quirky things theyve discovered in the manufacturing and packaging process that people have done for years without thinking in this case putting the heads on the torsos but that turns out to be a surprisingly significant expense timewise i suppose think it was in one of his blog posts but not sure too tired ie lazy to go hunting for it now sorry 
mattzitron you have done well to display images of the dung stain hull its a darn shame that it cant be extended however i see no reason why lego couldnt produce a special middle hull piece that is compatible although the way theyve made the hull is a bit stupid the old system was a lot more flexible better still why cant lego design a hull that can be extended in length and width then they could be as made as long or wide as desired and that would be great
good work samsta no wonder i wasnt aware 4 pirates and all
sam89 on aug 17 2005 0308 pm said thanks for the pics so far will you have highres pics of the other sets in the instructions theres just the back page ad but ill scan it
im interested in the scan of the back i have an idea for a new avatar 
woohoo thanks for these pics im probably more excited about the dark red 1x4 arch than anything else i have a large project that im doing in dark red but there has only been the 1x6 arch made in that coloruntil now now to figure out how to score about a hundred of them  jeramy
joebot on aug 27 2008 0315 pm said very nice review of a set that ive been dying to get but my friendly neighborhood lego store never seems to have in stock the yellow seat is most definitely not a new piece i had two of those in my old beta1 command base almost 30 years ago it is interesting however
metalandi on aug 27 2008 0750 pm said that explains why it isnt in our local stores i also got it from sh but my box hasnt got the special edition printing on it surprisingly just like dwarves mine is exclusive to target holodoc on aug 28 2008 0416 am said nice review vbbn i stumbled upon your yellow seat as well didn´t you have one already or what made you think it´s new the big letdown on this set is the big canopy i would have preferred single bricks for that and for this truck there is no real need for a hollow canopy  it could as well have been made of solid bricks maybe we get another set with different use of the canopy this is one of the reasons i didn´t buy it so far and i´m especially not interested in another forklift i have plenty of those i agree it´s the best one we have seen so far though thanks i have a yellow seat but i just thought it was interesting as for the canopy it really looks good on the finished truck i like it and that forklift could be the official one and the rest could become parts
today i shall be reviewing 8290 mini forklift which i recieved when i went to tru to get a technic set so enjoy set name mini forklift number 8290 theme technic parts 89 price 1099 1box the box for this set is suprisingly small its about the size of a 399 set it shows the main forklift and the set information the back of the box features the dragster a very cool model and the suspension works perfectly 2contents we have two instruction booklets one for the forklift and one for the dragster the bags here are a few interesting pieces the long double pin in blue a bionicle connecter joint and a yellow l joint 3build we start off build nice and solid with your average technic build the following steps build up the detail of the bottom part next comes the cab its pretty simple yet effective after that comes the forks they work very well but if you have the palatte on them and you let go it might topple off hint put the edge of the palatte on the small lip on the pieces that connect to the forks this will hold it on better the finished product and palatte extra pieceskeep them as they are used to build the alternate model here is something that i found how to put a minifigure into the cab first remove the side doors then set the fig into the cab with his arm sticking slightly out the gap and finaly seal off the cab a nice way to put system into technic for your towns  parts 910loving them all price per part ratio 810somewhat pleaseing playability 910 works in any system town and has a great dragster alternate model overall 2630 86 b overall i would definatly recommend this set to anyone whether you are a system or technic fan this is perfect it has great parts and is pretty cheap the alternate model is also very good i hope you all enjoyed my review i have made the pictures the requested size on my camera i look forward to hearing your comments edited by vbbn 27 august 2008  0702 pm
nice review the figure fitting inside is great i think the price might be a little high but you did get it from tru so what else is to be expected
what that looks like a walker an imperial walker no€ theme space blacktron i set name alienator set number 6876 number of pieces 82 figures1 released 1988 list price £99 it seem no source online has the price peeroncom bricklinkcom as always lets have a look at the box first as i€™m luck to own a boxed version of this set walking across a planet with a grid pattern sky the back shows a great selection of alternative models after opening the box we find a single instruction booklet inside the instruction booklet now we come to the man in the black visor the mark i blacktron and black and industrial he look in my opinion i think he probably has the second best lego space torso before the focus group decided they needed to be brighter now turning to the walker itself it€™s a simple build which i don€™t think even i with my great skills for messing up could get wrong the final unit is built in three key parts the command pod which is attached to the body by two pins at the back the walker legs this is pure design genius simply built easy to replicate and no fancy parts the top section which open to reveal the blacktrons hightech tools time to put the entire set together i think you€™ll agree it looks great for such a simple build looking like you could take on the universe a side view of the finished product a frontal view of the alienator what the hell how did that take down an atat this is one of my all time favourite lego space sets actually i didn€™t have it predark age and only recently bought one what attracted me to it was an old boxed set but since then i€™ve discovered a set that i wished i€™d owned long ago the rating system figures 810 i love the dark industrial space look parts 710 yes it may be nearly all black with some yellow highlights but is have a good range and they fit to make several great models fun fun fun 810 it walks well and it€™s a great set it has a large number of possible mods design 1010 it€™s ingenious the walking mechanism is so simple and yet so good i can€™t fault it price 10 while i could tell you how much i paid i was luck on ebay so this remains a question mark grand total 3340 reduced top level due to lack of price knowledge conclusion a set which in my opinion showcases what lego was about in the 1980€™s the set has an excellent design ethic and looks great with very limited parts it retains great action and functionality twinned with the great main model you€™re shown that there are a number of other great models you can make with the same parts this set is what it€™s all about for me i€™m very glad i bought outside my normal theme when i saw this actually on the strength of this set i recently order 6894 blacktron invader and can€™t wait to get it and see if it lives up to the alienator
i loved all of these walker sets it was such a smart technique i made one myself with what i had ahhh good times thanks for the great review
kimt on aug 27 2008 1041 pm said you mean swooshing as in swooshing for real or just plain swooshing he doesnt know the story but those pics of you swooshing it naked sure are halarious the one in the park is extra good you should see peoples faces i mean they are jelaous of your ywing yoda has my email p hehe staudie
kimt on aug 27 2008 1049 pm said haha i was making a joke and here comes stauder with his clearly insane lies for the truth go here now can we get back on topic or a you just dying to become sarlac food oh hush not like many people know the story the true story can indeed be found in the interview so i shall leave you be for now edit  also you should note that you said you would swoosh the ucs ywing staudie ps  sarlacc edited by stauder 27 august 2008  0855 pm
ive built the ywing and the imperial landing craft 7659 more or less at the same time and for about the same prices i think the imperial landing craft ilc is much superior to the ywing the ywing doesn’t have much functionality besides an awkward dropping bomb device and a moving cannon the missiles firing system is … your fingers the ilc has an awesome missiles firing system i wish i could get it individually for mocs a clever bomb dropping mechanism 5 minifigures with weapons the wings fold up together and the “cargo” can be detached as a play set i’ve built the ilc first so i got quite disappointed with the ywing
i like the model it is one of the best rebel sets out there but i dont like it that there is no landing gear when you set this one on the floor your rebel base it looks like it crashed or something and looses its look of superiority actually quite fast it needs to be at least 2 studs high if not more from the ground tlc is in these days afraid of flimsy landing gear as they gave to us in the early sw time now they want something sturdy for playability but i think there should have been some details on the bottom especially a landing gear that unfolds i also dont like the mistake of tlc that they changed this year with the release of indy hopefully to give the pilot a usual smile face the old yellow version of gold leader even had a headgear i hope tlc realised this year that we want more detailed faces well the licenced sets we got proved that but who knows the upsides of this set are the amount of pieces and detail especially the engines were fun to build and perhaps the most interesting construction i have seen in years also it is big bulky and looks sleek at the same time just wonderful and next to the 4502 xwing it looks in the perfect size i gave this the highest rating even if the underside disappoints but whatever it is lego you can add some landing gear on your own thanks for the review your pics were really really good next time make more of them please
fallenangel309 on 19 september 2011  0201 am said again we know next to nothing about the new ywing it wouldnt be possible to say whether 7658 is worth the money relative to the new one until we know what the new one looks like what its minifigures look like how much it will cost etc also note that yodalikespie has been banned is that a threat is it fair to ban someone on the forum because they revived an old thread and made inquiries thought this was a forum to discuss lego and that is what he was prompting i dont really care why he was banned but this isnt the only time ive seen this type of behavior and discourse here on eb
maybe the thread should be locked or taken down since the pics consist of broken links kind of a pointless review without the pics and for the record there are other websites with preliminary images of some the new 2012 sets that are not on the eurobrick star wars 2012 rumors thread perhaps that banned fellow was hoping some of the lego insiders had some knowledge about it i guess well never know now edited by sharky 22 september 2011  0922 pm
another fine review i love the last action picture thanks for sharing btw i am so looking forward to that 384 london bus review
cardinal brick on aug 27 2008 1002 pm said …got a job working construction for the johnstown company one of the greatest songs ever written but now onto the review i really like your pictures the quality and lighting is amazing i never gave this set much attention but now it looks pretty good to me also cant wait for your next review i have never seen this bus before
thanks for the review vbbn i have to say ef has never really caught my attention but this set seems alright to be honest when i saw the topic title i was expecting a tiger looking mech the mech itself is cool except for the huge leg pieces i think the minifigs are great in ef sets with the dark colored outfits like dark red or dark green
thanks for the review one of the best sets in the entire line
since my last post ive had the chance to build the tiger and i was surprised in a good way a much better set than i actually thougth front
i think this is almost the best set in the exo force line i really like the orange cockpit peice
what do you mean the troll’s should outnumber the crown knight how are you going to manage that well here’s the answer theme castle set name troll warrior set number 5618 number of pieces 19 figures1 released 2008 list price £250 gbp 350 usd 299 euro 5618 peeroncom 5618 bricklink catalog 5618 shop at home lets us begin with the box the troll warrior and his might cart set sets for children to pester for at christmas now for what’s inside the contents of the box it doesn’t look like much now for the troll himself i’m glad they selected this troll torso rather than the other one for the impulse set i think this one is the superior one also he comes well armed with a spear and sword but no shield sadly someone really needs to look at the rodent problem in the castle sets now the cart nice easy construction as with all impulse sets i’m still not convinced by the flicking missiles a line of those would do some damage what an oncoming army can expect to see all together now and it looks rather good so there we have it a cheap way of bolstering the troll army and outfitting them with some more weapons also for anyone planning a pied piper moc another set with a rat in it the rating system figures 810 preferred troll torso and helmet style  parts 710 two spears and a sword but sadly lacking that all important shield fun fun fun 410 somewhat more to do on it’s own that other impulse at least the troll can fight the rat design 710 well designed even the flicker missile doesn’t look bad price 810 at £250 more than the other castle impulse grand total 3450 lack of a shield and to small to stand alone for my rating system conclusion castle fans got a great army builder with the knight and they’ve been lucky enough to receive another one with this set i’m glad we’ve got a troll impulse as it allow for enlarging the armies of evil some the crown knight don’t totally outnumber all their opponents
good review i got 2 of those wheels are very useful especially if you dont have any  as for shields  i dont imagine trolls use them too much i think that they fight berserk style  all out assault one complaint is the piece that the wheels are attached to  its a single piece with smaller than the standard pin connection so you cant change the width of the cart for your mocs using the wheels i dont know if a piece with such a connection only on one side exists though 
thanks for the interview i nearly forgot this set is out yet maybe ill grab one off my local store tomorrow
wait a second a troll isnt that an orc i thought that this is a troll
thank you for the nice review the set is not that bad but a shield would be a nice addition i also dont like the flickfire missile a camp site with a fire and a chickenleg would also be nice about the rat isnt it just foodsupply for the troll the only problem would than be that the food is running away
opps well that’ll teach me to do reviews without my glasses thanks for pointing that out stauder
i wasnt all that impressed with what you get in this set for the price but you have an interesting point that the robot can be considered a reference to the classic space bots makes me think i ought to try modding the robot later
something i forgot to mention is that great review xenologer on aug 28 2008 0828 pm said makes me think i ought to try modding the robot later mod the robot why you should see the interior stauder
kimt on aug 28 2008 0952 pm said id rather get another impulse set than this except the other life on mars mars mission impulse sets actually i kinda like the crystal hawk impulse the default model isnt that great but you get a few nice wing plates to work with after rearranging it looks pretty good i guess this one though is good for some nice parts tho its pretty limited in what you can rebuild it into and it seems less value because the astronaut has no vehicle best impulse set has to be the troll warrior feels very complete and space orcs are always nice to have
cues the indy theme song lets follow indy on his pursuit on the stolen ark indy rides full speed ahead on his white horse but the nazis are pulling away will indiana jones be able to grab on to the truck and reclaim the treasure or will the nazis and their highpowered mercedes trucks prevail lets find out 7622 race for the stolen treasure set info set name 7622 race for the stolen treasure theme indiana jones released 2008 price 2999 usd 3495 euro 2499 gbp pieces 272 minifigs 4 price per piece about 11 cents and now the main event first the box shots the front shows a nice image of indy on his horse trying to make it on to the truck and the attack truck taking aim the back this side shows some of the features of the set in little pictures on the left instruction manual not much to say here as its the same picture as on the box inside the manual on one of the last pages we have a nice picture like the one on the back of the box showing some features of the set random manual pic here we have the nice piece callouts that we have come to expect lately the bags were numbered as well the pieces a nice selection here especially if you like black dark bley and bley cool pieces the golden treasure chest has a really nice sparkle to it the set also has a good assortment of coins and jewels and some wonderful silver 1x1 dots the canvas covering this is quite nice it has a nice dark tan color and some nice detail on it as well the minifigs first comes indys beautiful white horse i always like lego animals and this one is no exception here are the figs on the left indiana jones and his nice stubble printed legs side bag and the best lego hat in history and the nazis peter hans and klaus their torsos are very nice and the hats are amazing they look really nice with all of their tan the extra parts here you get two of the nice silver 1x1s some clear 1x1s and the usual technic pins and levers now the finished set first we have the attack truck the truck looks very good it looks very military like with the colors and the design it is designed wonderfully with really nice mudguards and a welldetailed front the only fault of this is i think the top part where the gunner stands is a bit bare the front here you can see the front which has a nice smooth look with some nice details as well the front ridged piece works well here the gun this is well made it is built by attaching a lightsaber hilt in a sort of videocamera piece the actual area where the guy stands is pretty bare but not too bad backside of the truck the spare tire here is a simple but nice touch a side view the mudguards are smartly built by clipping wing flaps on to handle plates this part gets a bit tedious but the end result is worth it the big boy cargo truck this is another really well built truck it has a lot of the same design elements as in the smaller truck such as the mudguards front view the front of this truck is as nice or better than the other truck it uses good snot building and everything fits in well a closeup view of the tire area just behind the tire you can see those silver 1x1s being used as the suspension this is a really nice addition and it looks great note its only visual suspension it is not supposed to work the canvas cover in action now the canvas attaches by putting the holes in the canvas on some little blue technic pins and then clamping them down with the hinged pieces it looks really nice and curves nicely the windscreen treasure my favorite piece in action i took this picture with the flash on so you can see how it sparkles i think we have waited far too long for this great piece the complete set everything all together indy is chasing fast indys got it brickshelf folder now for the ratings price 910 not bad but could have slightly more pieces at least it has 4 minifigs and that makes up for it parts 910 a nice selection of parts lots of greys and black design 1010 the trucks are really welldesigned the mudguards are excellent playability 810  i always like rolling the trucks across the floor  build 910 pretty good but gets a bit repetitive in some parts overall 4550 brickset bricklink entry peeron lego sh even after intense fighting everyone always gets along when theres food to be eaten hey indy vant some mustard how about some ketchup summary this and all of the other indiana jones sets are some of my favorites they all have nice colors good design and great minifigs although i need indy in a different outfit pretty soon his outfit is starting to smell a bit ripe  this set in particular is very well designed and i cant wait for some more indy next year thanks and happy building edited by erdbeereis1 29 august 2008  0347 am
great review hmm i notice that the leg of that old guy is not so perfect perhaps you want to push it
nice review i really want this set but i think the €35 here is too much more like €25 would suit and havent found it cheap enough on ebay yet incl shipping
very good informative review i really want this set but i never got around to buying it i thought all of your photos are great and of good quality keep it up
i discovered this review a month ago and since that point in time i could not get the image of the sparkling golden chest out of my mind i finally just purchased the chest for myself i suppose this is a testament to how well honed your picture taking skills are this set is definitely a nice one im not a lego indy collector but i was tempted to purchase this set several times the vehicles are very nicely detailed and have some cool building techniques such as the wheel guards
very good review
great review i was debating on whether or not to snag this up before its gone and i think i will great review and thanks again
rriggs on aug 31 2008 0255 am said i actually like the use of the old style car base and mourned the day that these became exitinct the first time round c1990 i dont hate the piece but i did object to the way this set fills in the middle recessed area with a 2 x 2 plate that is nearly impossible to get out again without doing some damage to it whats more if you fill in the recessed area youve eliminated the only rationale for using the car base in the first place
what an outstanding review of a great set i esp like your intro i have this set but have not opened it yet it looks like a fun little beach set the new coast guard theme is very nice edit this set could almost pass for classic town except for the use of orange and the lack of opening doors on the car 5 stars
great job i will want to get this set soon its a lovely set with some coast guard saving on the jet ski what i dont like about this set is the lack of doors everything about this is nice but i still have to give it a 4 as for the entire flow of review i agreed with brickster that your introduction is very good with the little amends i had added earlier it turns out to be very good keep it up
a very good review of an especially charming and lovely set thanks the whole cg theme looks very nice to me with a good and detailed set design and this one´s no exception although it would be nice to see more car doors and some new mf faces though
thanks for this review i was thinking of getting this set and having read your review went out today and got it what a great little set what i particularly like very sturdy build feels very solid as you build the pickup compared to the fire pickup  trailer i also have the orange pieces my first pieces in this colour the tyres which give the smoothest ride of any lego towncity vehicle ive ever built the raised suspension and side runners the coast guard dude again a first for me and his megacool flippers and aqualung the jetski controls  the handlebars actually move left to right which is a great detail little details that lego didnt have to do the grey handle by the ball joint moving handlebars the new tyres as you can probably guess i have voted outstanding for this set erdbeereis1 on aug 29 2008 0602 am said color separation is not a problem here and since it is a small set the piece call out is not a necessity you do get a piece call out with this set i did anyway its on the back of the small poster that is included in the set thanks again cheers rog edited by rriggs 02 september 2008  0253 pm
nice set nice review i already have one coastguard set that truck but i like the idea very much however the rigid inflatables could be much improved see the real ones at wwwrnlicouk or wwwknrmnl
what a great review of an excellent set i love the islanders and that drum outstanding i think these islander sets never got the credit they dserved i really like this set and its a great addition to the pirate collection
great review well done for sure i love these reviews of old set and this one is especially unique i must agree with you the color scheme is magnificent makes me want to go to ebay and buy it now to bad for spongebob though he got in with a real bad crowd
thanks for the great review this set is pretty standard as islanders go but it is such a cool subtheme that i dont care a bit i totally agree with your comment about old and new sets i dont think i would enjoy lego as much if i didnt have a decent amount of kits from pre 1999
another very nice review and im glad to see it has some nice pieces as well as characters too looks to me that no one on bl has it in australia for sale so i may pass on this beauty though i did pick up king kahuka recently he makes an appearance in my medium entry
an outstanding set because who doesnt love islanders outstanding review as well
very solid set 5 minifigs and plenty of weapons to go around adding up to great playability what more could you want aspecially from a set this size only i would have liked another cutlass a musket instead of 1 of the pistols and for 1 of the pirates to have another head but those things are no big deal it is still a lot better than sets nowadays edited by fluyt 23 december 2008  0950 pm
those indians look useful for indiana jones in the future as long as the have the new skin color i wish i could have picked one of those up when i could
well this is a not so old set and i bet most of you already have it so here is another review from me as usual let us start off with the box art box art i like the box art they put a nice background for the atap at the side we have the minifigs scale and at the back there is the function shown and advertisement for other set the content the content is consist of 6 packets of bricks and a instruction book yeap no sticker sheet instruction book the instruction books not only show us the steps but also show us all a clear pictures of the january release sets and some sets show with their function well this includes the atap functions as well besides there are bricks checklist as well and the how do you start off before assemble your sets and a little poster where the clones with their atap battling the droids heres a random page new pieces to me i never see both of this piece before so i assume it is a new pieces anyone have any idea is there any other sets that contains this piece the blasters we are given a 2 long blasters which is great which i it is more accurate as most of the clone troopers use a long blaster the minifigs the minifigs is 2 shock trooper but is different with 7655 clone troopers battle packss shock trooper the leg is different in colour we are given white hip while the one in the battle pack are given a black hip furthermore we get a new printed headgear which i think they have improve it check out the mouth printing the colour is brighter so here is the headgear the headgear limit itself from turning to the side this is because the front part it is too low until it block by the torso the shock troopers without helmet on we are given a black stud no face printed how i wish that i have extra with helmet on comparison with shock troopers from battle pack the atap heres the atap it looks ugly at a certain angle and looks great in a certain angle anyway i still like the set i like the walker vehicle below are the pictures taken randomly top view side view without stabilizer leg with stabilizer leg rear view the functions well the functions are not so impressive just something turning around open here and there the only function that is say as special is the retractable stabilizer leg the cockpit the cockpit can fit two clone troopers but too bad we are only given two and is not enough as there is no gunner on top inside it there is a guns holders which can hold two guns but fall off easily when you are trying to remove the guns well the other side have some speedometre thing and a controller to reveal the cockpit you have to open the top hatch look below so you can see whats inside oops the side hatch and back hatch as well open and close i think this pieces is use not to let you open the hatch but to make some design i mean make it able to move inside with clones beneath so this is the pieces that hold the stabilizer leg when is not in use this is how the stabilizer leg move at last and of course the revealing cockpit from below and at the back guess the droids have alternative way to take this things down faster the leg there are pieces blocking the leg to go to the front i mean overhead and lose balance the base in not movable the side armor the side armor has door and this is how it is attach it is very flimsy when you want to adjust it to be a little steep to creat the shape they might just fall off so it is connected to the body with just a technic pin and to hold it properly here is the support the side hatch it open and close easily very loose nothing to hold it tight heres some view when the side hatch is open the cannon the cannon on top is movable and adjustable the big cannon can move up and down while the smaller one can cove sideways but the smaller one tend to lose balance when it is without minifigs means the one on top and below will not b align this is the pieces that only enable it to move up and down to prevent it from moving freely lego put two pieces to block it completion i try to make the sets looks great i think this angle is right spare parts it is so few compare with 7673 magna guard starfighter and it is more expensive overall this set is not really a good set the hatch is quite flimsy top and the side since there is nothing to hold them tight besides it is lack of one clone but to complete your walker collection you must have it pros no sticker needed new improved headgear long balsters cons lack of clone flimsy expensive as few pieces are given hope you guys like it edited by kimt 30 august 2008  1201 pm
i agree the pure white legs are odd as is the inclusion of shocks instead of pilots or regulars or maybe even kashykk troopers that might have been better
i switched my shock trooper legs as soon as i got this set as for the new pieces im pretty sure that they were also featured in the striking venom set nice in depth review i switched my shock trooper legs as soon as i got this set as for the new pieces im pretty sure that they were also featured in the striking venom set nice in depth review
wow talk about a bumper nice review baby this set is quite nice i would have goten it if i had had the money but didnt back then so didnt get it it has a nice parts selection why did lego do the shock troopers with white hips and the bp ones have black hips confusers me commanderfox

valentin on aug 30 2008 0231 am said the ssd looks very similar to the actual screenshots from aotc though am still wondering whats that little translucent red piece for i assumed it was the droids eye great review btw now i know what all the little bits are i have this set as well i quite like the droid dr s
so thats what all those miscellaneous parts are foranyway great review and i like that you took pictures of everything from different angles
doctor sinister on aug 30 2008 0822 pm said i assumed it was the droids eye great review btw now i know what all the little bits are i have this set as well i quite like the droid dr s dr s yup only notice it after rewatching aotc its the sensor for visual data tlc gave the better effect than hasbro since they made it glow like in the movie kimt not at the moment since i have slowed down quite abit due to my day job though i still definitely enjoy the company here to contribute more reviews when availablemeaning after i find a better way to coexist both my hasbro and lego stuff spending millacol88 yup those accessories definitely makes me want to start lego clone troop building
valentin on sep 13 2008 1035 pm said thanks keke imagine the horror that gripe my heart to see the discounted price on the sgs toys r us flyer about a month after its release into retail anyway looking forward to your other reviews too hey valentin and white fang glad to see fellow sgs here more reviews pls
theres plenty of reviews in the review index pinned topic
kudos on a well presented and written review i think the reason this set didnt release in us was because it didnt have any warnings about choking anywhere on the box therefore no lawsuits in us for lego cheers isc
i scream clone on aug 31 2008 0227 am said kudos on a well presented and written review i think the reason this set didnt release in us was because it didnt have any warnings about choking anywhere on the box therefore no lawsuits in us for lego cheers isc no thats not the reason im sure youll get this set eventually as for the box well theres always been 2 boxdesigns  one for the us and one for eu actually theres an asian one as well the eu doesnt have the box count or the dont swallow we know that the us version has the brick count and dont swallow warning typical us thanks for a super review strawberryiceman i like the wizard im only sorry they put him in an impulse set whod want an army of medium blue wizards so its the worst army builder but a cool wizard does that make sense
well set out review with alot of great content gotta ask you though how does the set look nothing like the box art with so few pieces id have thought one could mentally put it together given the box front
i’m not a great communicator but what i was trying to say was that on the box the sets looks quite exciting and well made and that the alien fits much more snugly than it does so i was a bit disappointed that it seemed wider and less compact and certainly less exciting when i opened it
well now we at least know that we can avoid that set  johan
thanks for this review as for the set well i am not to crazy about this set but i want some sort of small alien fleet vehicals and this would work well but i would rather ave my money to buy classic town edited by vbbn 01 september 2008  0248 am
i rated this poor due to the fact the set is unimaginative looks like a bunch of plates where thrown together and it just isnt worth the money lego is asking for it imo ive never been a fan of the nonarticulated jellies so ill leave my disgust for them out of this post however unlike the set the review is a fine work of art that clearly depicts the goods and provides valuable insightopinions about the sets playability usefulness and overall value

7670 hailfire tank and spider droid number of pieces 249 number of minifigs 4 price 1999 usd 2599 eur 1999 gbp brickset hello everyone today i will review the extremely underrated hailfire tank and spider droid set i hope this review does it justice so lets start with the box note this picture is not mine standard box for star wars in that time the background on the box looks like its from geonosis indicating that this set is from episode ii and not iii or the clone wars the back of the box not shown shows the playability functions and some other sets that were released at the same time as this overview here is an overview of the whole set it comes with one construction manual and no sticker sheets   this is a very simple set but with not much to it it is still a very important part of the cis army especially if you are interested in army building i like to call this set a super battle pack and youll find out why soon lets get right to it and look at the feature of the set the hailfire tank front a front view of the very cool tank here you can see two triangular shields on the hull the main body is very simple but altogether very effective and clever and making it really look like a hailfire tank although a little bit sized down from its movie version the transred stud used as the eye makes the tank look more menacing side the side view the wheels are very easy to make but its a real pain to connect all of those chain links together i dont see what you could use the links for except for another tank but maybe someone creative will find something for these the dark tan is nice though the wheels are held on by technic poles and the tank rolls on the wheels fairly well on carpet or a hard surface back this is the back of the tank here you can see eight flickfire missiles four on each side of the new type so they dont easily fall out also note the modified 2x2 with extended hole piece sticking out of the back this may be used to easily push around the tank i just wish you could fit a droid in the body for the cockpit now we move on to the spider droid or what i like to call the dwarf spider the front this one is also simple but very cleverly built the main body is two semispheres connected together for rotation and an antenna a cannon four legs and eyes made out of a useful telephone piece the picture speaks for itself as far as how the gun and eyes are built side a side view you can now see the legs better which are more sturdy then you would think each one is made out of two pearl bronze exoforce robot arms a useful bley handgun piece and a dark bley battle droid body all connected to the under body a big knoblike piece back the back not much to say here i like this spider droid because it is very sturdy and the legs are easy to adjust finally we look at the minifigs there are four minifigs in this set which is quite generous for a set of this size it comes with a yellow battle droid commander i really like this one two battle droids and a super battle droid all three battle droids have the new blaster pistols and one twisted arm thats about it for the review so here is the final verdict build 810 very fun and easy besides the chain links should take the seasoned builder less than 20 minutes playability 710 the flickfire missiles are fun as well as just zooming around the tank could use some clones for a battle swooshability 810 you can roll around the hailfire fairly well minifigs 910 a generous amount of figs and all are pretty good design 9510 a really simple and clever set although a little too small for the movie version price 1010 a very fair price considering the priceperparts ratio and the coolness of the set overall score 8510 a very neat set to have a great army builder and great for display next to all of the other cis sets the price is fair the figs are good and the build is very clever thats all for now folks please feel free to give some feedback edited by jimbutcher 15 september 2008  0308 am
jimbutcher on aug 30 2008 1025 pm said oh yes i will add the other prices and i was going to make a poll for it i made one for the homing spider review but you beat me to it thanks thats my job im a moderator
thanks for the review jimbutcher i really like that set it combines interesting and good design with some awesome cool parts and a neat amount of charm
this is a great set i have 2 of them now and i plan to get more it is much better than the droid battle pack for 10 bucks more you get better battle droid arms and some canon vehicles good enough for me
thanks for the review is a great one this set is not really a good set but i like the spider droid the hailfire droid scale is not right i think it is suppose to be even bigger anyway this is the first set that rerelease the commander droid so i grab it
thanks for the cool review jimbutcher  actually i really like this set it is small but very clever and even if the hailfire droid is undersized what in the whole line is not under or oversized  the new spider droid is the best small build i have ever done in a set and the droid commander is pretty cool  i am happy with the set and i will get another with my comiccon exclusive 
7681 homing spider droid limited edition number of pieces 206 number of minifigs 5 price 3499 usd 2999 eur 1999 gbp theme star wars episode ii year released 2008 brickset folder bricklink catalog welcome to my sixth review on these boards of the mighty homing spider droid at first glance this ball on legs may not seem like much but hopefully this review will change your mind the box this box is the standard for all of the new clone wars sets sleek shiny and a rightoutofthefactory look the blueandwhite color scheme is fantastic and portrays that the sets are based off of a cartoon well this box has a limited edition in spanish too  seal slapped on the front although you wont have trouble finding this in your local toys r us because of the big clone wars display in the front of the store that you cant miss overview in this picture you can see the contents of the whole set minus the instruction booklet built you can spot five minifigures which ill get to later and a very tall cis weapon known as the homing spider droid this weapon of destruction is a musthave for your cis army although the color scheme mostly dark bley and light bley is a change up from the regular colors brown or blue of the cis this may have something to do with the blended armies of the trade federation and corporate alliance but i dont know for sure the instruction manual is very thin only about twenty pages homing spider droid this is the main part of the set four huge legs two mounted guns and a red sensor eye are the highlights of this artillery unit theres not many playability factors to this one but sometimes its just fun to squash the little clones a changeup of the contrary it also looks good next to all of the other cis sets but you might want to clear some room in your display area the legs take up a lot of room this thing is also massively tall about the same height as the republic cruiser main body this is the main body of the spider which has no cockpit and is remote controlled this spherical body not in that sort of way is a very quick build and features a big red eye connected by a red stud and hinge top gun here is the top gun not with tom cruise which is connected to the body using a clever technic system pun not intended as you can see from this picture you can see that it can rotate a full 360 degrees but only if you remove the eye also the gun can be pulled back and if you let go it will snap back like the a gun does when fired due to the force of the shot im not sure this was intended by tlg because it wasnt showed anywhere on the box or in the manual lower gun here is the gun attached to the under body of the main part it is attached using a hinge which allows it to move up and down i also like the cord that presumably transfers power included on both guns hips here is one of the hips attaching the legs to the body there is one on each side with two legs each the are attached to the body and legs with technic pieces legs you can see the tall legs in this pic they are basically just technic poles and connectors feet this is one of the feet the essential to balancing the whole vehicle these and the legs are repetitive so i suggest doing them all at the same time to avoid flipping back in the manual and repeating the process three more times the picture speaks for itself for the design of the feet all are connected to the legs using a doubleholed technic piece one massive son of a gun this thing is so tall it frightens the skin off of even the toughest most experienced soldiers run for your lives look at how much havoc and fear it causes family photo enough of the battle scenes here is a shot of this spider with its smaller cousin the dwarf spider droid minifigs finally here are the minifigs that come with this set there are five in all which include battle droid nothing special but still an addition to your army commander battle droid i love that yellow torso super battle droid again nothing special clone trooper im glad they gave us one in this set i can add it to to my other phase 1 clones commander fox i love it everything from the dark red markings to the accessories are fantastic the head is just the regular anime style clone wars face this set comes with two flashlights two antennae one visor one pauldron and one kama closeup of fox here is a closeup of fox so you can see the detailed insignia of the republic guard that wraps it up for the review here is the final verdict build 810 very easy and straightforward a little repetitive with the legs should take the seosoned builder around 20 minutes playability 610 not many play factors but its fun to just squash puny clones with this giant arachnid swooshability na minifigs 1010 you really cant ask for more in this sort of set design 810 not very sturdy but it is altogether clever price 510 yes it is limited edition but pumping up the price fifteen dollars more than it should be is a little ridiculous overall score 8510 an excellent set for display although not very sturdy minifigs are superb but the price could be better in the end i would highly recommend this to any prequel trilogy fan looking to build up his her army well thats about it for this review please feel free to leave your opinions edited by jimbutcher 15 september 2008  0309 am
i just bought this set the other day and i must admit that it gets a below average from me the price is not corresponding with what you get which would be implied had jim added the eur or gbp price in the infohint hint  the spider droid is flimsy at best making it stand or even move without tumbling over is hard also why the brown cylinders on the legs keep the colourscheme clean please the figs are fine except that i dislike the clone headgear and the fact that the helmets now have holes in the sides allowing the flesh head to show within  goofy looking i am soo replacing the clone heads with black ones great review of an acceptable set
thank you for that good review jimbutcher i think that this is really a pretty interesting and original looking set maybe it´s not very stable but it owns some special war of the worlds charm for sure
thanks for the review i really do like the first year of ef nowadays they mecha are perhaps more cleverly designed and use ball joints for playability but i really love the blocky bulky look of the first drones machines and somehow the older ones seem a better value of parts im more inclined to buy duplicates of them than the newer models
thanks for the review this is one of the few first wave sets that i didnt get im not really sure why as it wasnt too expensive
thank you for that fine review thebrickster i really like how this two small sets create an intense and adventurous atmosphere against the backdrop of a pretty exotic region the sets´re well designed and very nice with a fine amount of rather unique and well fitting gear the whole theme offers a lot of playability in a setup that´s a little different to tlc´s standard sceneries for sure and it always reminded me of who goes there too
a very nice review i really miss the arctic theme i didnt own any of the sets but after looking at the pictures in this review and reading the instructions on brickleys words and brickfactory i want them
nice review brickster the arctic theme is very nice the minifigs have a great look to them especially with the hoods the colors for the arctic sets i have always liked and somehow the idea of minifigs exploring the arctic is fun to me
great review i hope tlc does another i rember reading a book once based on the theme which stated the scorpions and thespiders and such were aliens 
great review whitefang and co a thoroughly enjoyable one im glad we have a series of reviews that you can expect to be packed with humour and craziness looking forward to the next peace
thank you very much for this review skipper 24 i voted for outstanding since this set is a little but very lovely set i really it although i dont own it yet  since its very similar to todays impulse sets a minifig and some nice additional stuff and i like the black cat which gives the set a more gloomy atmosphere hopefully tlg will include a black cat and a chimney like in this set in the new advent calendar too klausdieter
i chose above average it has a great minifigure i wish i had itsomeday i will

6205 vwing fighter number of pieces 118 number of minifigs 1 price 999 usd 1399 eur 899 gbp theme star wars episode iii year released 2006 brickset folder bricklink catalog welcome to this review of the vwing fighter this will be my eighth review on the boards strangely enough there was another set called the vwing fighter that came out in 1997 for the space theme note that i am missing several small pieces to this set but they are mostly insignificant to the overall look the box this is the standard box type for all 20052006 star wars sets i cant say that i like it as much as the 2007 or 2008 box types but itll do it features a profile view of darth vader and silver text overview this is the whole set this ship is meant to protect the chancellor at all costs they are usually found in groups of three or four front this ship is very sleek and youll notice that its colors are dark red light bley and dark bley with a touch of black it starts at the nose very narrow but as the body progresses to the back it gets wider like a v hence the name back here is a view of the rear note the transneon green discs used to represent the boosters also notice the dark red r4 astro droid and the hinges used as aromor flight all four wings two on each side can open up for flight attack mode they can open even farther then the pic shows but its not an intended function the wings a great but its a real pain to position them correctly and the bottom wings close when you set the ship down tail fins this is what the tail fins look like on each side with two flaps attached to the top and bottom if you look closely the tail fins and wings look a little bit like a mini ship themselves maybe controlled by remote no this is not an intended function either guns side the guns are very simple but very clever using a double technic hole piece two black bars and two technic pins also note the landing gear minifig finally here is the minifig a clone pilot it has light blue arms and legs white hands a helmet with black markings and republic insignia on it and a doublesided torso the front of the torso is great featuring shoulder straps armor plating and a life support system while this minifig is not altogether accurate to the movie it has still been one of my favorite star wars figs back the back of the fig that can double as the front of clone marines this side features shoulder straps and armor plating cockpit lastly here is the pilot seated in the cockpit he fits perfectly although it is not airtight we wouldnt want the poor guy to suffocate now would we that wraps up the review here is the final verdict build 810 a nice easy build and the last of the small sw ships 10 or less playability 610 pretty fun to swoosh around but thats about it could use a vulture droid but that would take away the small factor swooshability 1010 very fun and easy to swoosh around endlessly without fear of it breaking minifigs 910 there really is no need to have more although a palpy fig would be outstanding the pilot is a great figure though design 910 extremely accurate to the movie but the cockpit is not airtight price 1010 you couldnt ask for a better deal overall score 86 an excellent set unfortunately this is the last of the small sw ships currently the fig is great and the sleek design is accurate that just about sums it all up feel free to leave your comments edited by jimbutcher 15 september 2008  0311 am
this was a great set for the price ten dollars for a cool minifigure and a decent sized ship is great
i had a chance to get this set but i didnt i really wish i did though because i saw it at my cuzs place not to long ago and its quite nice i wish tlg would do more 20 small sets like this besides bp although they are nice 
i was going to get this but when i rang up sh apparently theyd sold out already price is a little on the steep side as well and i can only see it going up on sites such as amazon as the number of people wanting them goes up which it will it its anything based on the star wars battle packs
how were you able to get three small shields i only got two in mine i am going to check the trash just in case
and another great review from one of our academy teachers i always look forward reading them  i think the battlepacks for castle are a great initiative from tlc i like this one but also the one with the skellies you get some different looking soldiers and a few weapons and shields so thats cool the low prices make it so that most people could build a large armybattle if they want to a big for your review and another for tlc for making these edited by zorro3999 06 october 2008  0540 pm
its an ok set but its extremely overpriced where i live i simply couldnt justify paying 1799 tax for 5 minifigs the fact that these figures are featured prominantly in other sets makes this set a difficult purchase given the price i find it hard to look at this set with much enthusiasm
its way to expansive for what you get besides you pay more for the package then its containts
i like your review on this battle pack but i think that this battle pack was over priced 12 for this i am not paying that much for 5 knights
i really love these impulse sets at a low price point for lots of minifigs this police one doesnt appeal too much to me at the moment but who knows with your reference i may need it with a future project hmm its actually a good way of getting those dogs cheaply
not a bad set altough the radar is a little weird looking
a very nice set but one of my least wanted impulse sets i eventually bought it and looky here i got an extra doggy
thanks for this fine and elaborate review on the 2nd best impulse set there is yes the troll warrior wins by a zillion miles ive added it to the index
set name crossbow attack set number 7090 theme castle pieces 54 minifigs 3 released 2007 price 599usd 399 eur 799 cdn legoshopcom description ready aim fireits a battle of brave knights against the evil skeleton rider includes 2 knights skeleton and a skeleton horse rolling wagon has a launcher that really fires bricklink inventory peeron inventory brickshelf gallery now on to the review the box as you can see the front of the box illustrates the set very nicely showing the skeleton warrior attacking and the knights firing their crossbow the back the back of the box shows a small battle happening between a knight and a skeleton as well as the main feature of the set the firing crossbow more on that later the instructions not much to say here its the same as the front of the box the back of the instructions this merely shows pictures of other sets in the castle line random instruction page this set does not use piece callouts to tell you what parts you will need in each step however the set is so small you should never have trouble finding a piece the minifigures this is the main reason i bought this set you get two knights one with a standard helmet and the other one with a new mold you also get a skeleton warrior the horse the set comes with a skeleton horse that looks great however it is a single molded piece that has no articulation closeup of the warrior riding his horse here you see the brave skeleton riding in on hisaherumnoble steed the accessoriesweapons for minifigure accessories you get an axe a skeleton sword and a skeleton shield extra pieces i was left with one skeleton arm and one leg when i was finished the build the crossbow wagon and now to the main part of the set the crossbow wagon it is really just a plate with some whells attached and a lot of those cheese wedge pieces to create the track for the projectile back view this view shows the mechanism that makes the crossbow fire it is powered by a rubber band you pull back on a technic piece which creates tension in the elastic band when you let go the elastic pushes the piece forward which in turn hits the projectile and makes it fire it works fairly well but i would have prefered it fired farther entire set the skeleton charges at his adversaries the knights prepare to counterattack overall build 1010 the build is simple easy and quick set design 710 the crossbow could have worked a bit better playability 810 the crossbow is fun to shoot minifigs 1010 it doent get much better than this i love that domed helmet mold price 810 the set is very affordable and worth the price overall score4350 conclusion overall this is a great set and a solid army builder you get three minifigures for a fair price and the crossbow wagon adds some muchneeded playability i bought two of these to bolster my army and to stock up on those rare domed helmet pieces basically get this set thank you for taking the time to read my review i hope you liked it
i like this set mostly because it has some very usable pieces but also because of the amount of minifigures in the set which is a whopping three and one large animal skeleton horse the one thing however that i dont like about it is that one of the catapult operators isnt armed in my opinion this would have been a good time for tlg to release a suitable dagger piece not the kitchen knife for its castle line great review by the way it captured the key elements of this fantastic small set
nice review to start off you got all the details someone could possibly need in my opinion at least i do enjoy this set as well and ive bought only one to keep my minifigs as unique as possible despite my personal preference i still find this a nice army builder good amount of minifigs for the price as mentioned earlier with each being different from the other though i would like the catapult manager to be armed with at least something i still feel that he can just flee if hes ever in trouble hes a good guy to use for the castle gimmics if you have it one more small comment i also love those domed helmets even if they arent actually new my favorite of them all being followed up by the racer helmet
millacol88 on sep 6 2008 0155 am said ive experienced that problem too i find my knights outnumber my skellies about 31 a crownie dies easyer than a skeleton its so hard to perforate the lungs or pierce the heart on a skeleton with a spear or crossbow bolt isnt it a great set with a reasonable price thanks for sharing it with us added to the index
youre really rolling these reviews out huh i am not sure how i feel about this set while it does include five figs three are skeletons and are generally worth much less than say three trollsorcs i know they didnt exist at this point in time so this is understandable the amount of horses is nice but im not a big lego horse fan what this set does have is a great appearance and brings atmosphere to the table 20 is an affordable amount for those of us who do not wish to splurge too much on a toy while being enough to actually get a large enough set to create something out of personally id rate it in between average and above average like another castle set i cant remember which i just feel this one also lacks something
well indeed looks like a very nice set especially the scared knights are very nice 
that’s a nice review though i do feel the price was a little high but as you said you get so much in it last year argos in the uk reduced it to £799 which was a true bargain and sent me all over london looking for a store with more in stock again as with all the lego castle sets i think what makes it work so well is that lego are now providing a much larger number of minfigs and that’s often what makes a set
thanks for the great review i was going to buy this set this saturday and after reading this review i am twice as likely to buy it
i bought this set to have the scared minifig but i found a lot of cool pieces and stuffs i love this set 
what an amazing review i actually have this set and i decided to take it apart it has a brown horse and a lot of useful pieces so taking it apart was a good idea now i have three lego horses hoorah the end of the review was the funniest lego12
other than the minis accessories and animals this set is meh at best
i really do love this set it has 5 figures which is unheard of for a 20 set it comes with plenty of weapons and accessories and has a great design the detail is really well done and for anyone who wants to just buy one set this set allows for hour of fun just by itself i already have one of these and hopefully will be getting a second
great review this is my 2nd favorite lego castle set tied with skeleton tower that i own my first favorite is drawbridge deffense
big cam on nov 20 2009 1041 am said you say in the review its great to get 9 minifigs but there are only 2 minifigs and 3 skeletons hes probably counting the four horses as well
sir dillon on nov 20 2009 1007 am said hes probably counting the four horses as well oh since when are hores minifigs

i voted outstanding because i think this is the best cement mixer tlg ever made also love the 6stud wide based vehicles as you mentioned i both bought and sold it again this year and i already regret it but i had to sell some stuff because of a loss of space
lovely review really but the sad fact is weve seen it before twice httpwwweurobrickshowtopic20293
ive skipped a few lunches on behalf of this set its a great army builder but so are many of the new castle sets what makes this great in my opinion is the figs  2 orcs and 1 dwarf  what else could one want thanks tlg for making this set and thank you for reviewing it for us review added to the index
indexed going through the boards i was amazed to find out that no one ever attempted to review one of the best lego classics the 6399 airport shuttle while i was studying for exams a few weeks back i decided to take a break built the monorail and take some pictures of it resulting in the present review along with this i made my first ever poll here we go first some data setnumber 6399 setname airport shuttle released in 1990 in holland though bricklink says 1991 number of parts 731 number of figs 9 price unknown prices on bricklink vary from 261 up to 2300  but this was an expensive set even in the nineties the box mine is a bit battered by the owner before me but theres still plenty to see this is one of the largest boxes i have look at the minifig in the downright corner for the comparision and it is a really neat storing facility for many sets the box shows the set and in the background the silhouet of the set that is to accompany this one the airport from 1990 i like the angle of the box showing the two stations track and train in one picture the back of the box shows some really nice ideas for other setups why oh why has lego abandonned this kind of showing whats possible with one set inside flap of the box showing details of the set and the functions detail on the front of the box displaying the dimensions it really is a huge track layout for one set the instructions there is a nice little booklet showing the same picture as the box art with the figures lined up underneath the last page nicely folds out to show the entire setup of the tracks the figures a brilliant selection of minifigs including airport people and a cook all figures that are supposed to go on the shuttle carry a ticket and there are also some suitcases tickets fit inside of course station  1 the set includes two stations here is the first depicting the airport there are lots of details a phonebooth two seats some flowers a map luggagelockers and of course the streetlights a detailed shot of the station showing the luggagelockers and ticketvalidating machine part of the beauty of this set is the fact that it is so extremely detailed just look at the signs to show where to go next stickers and the scenery opposite the street the station has the same shape as the airport shuttle logo how sweet is that the station pictured as part of the layout the stations ends are made with airplane wings to smoothen the arrival of the shuttle station  2 here is the second station my personal favorite an elevated stop with a little snackbar underneath and stairs leading to the platform some chairs and streetlights here as well plus two old fashioned trees the part of the set that can be used in any layout the snackbar with hamburger sign sticker yes those hamburgers look tasty indeed also notice the lights hanging from the platform overhead and the ticketvalidating machine at the bottom of the stairs here we have the platform with information panels and seats also notice the two trafficlights for the train heres how it works the train will travel in the direction the arrow is pointing when turning the knob the two grey blocks will move towards or away from the trackcenter activating a button on the centerpiece of the train the motor which makes the train start its journey around the track there is only one speed and the train can only be put to a stop or change direction at stations the station as part of the layout the shuttle now on with the train there are two carrriages connected to a centered motor the power is provided by means of a batterybox containing a 9v battery the batterybox is in one of the carriages and displays airport shuttle a total of five passengers can be seated inside leaving room for their luggage and two drivers the front carriage with the button for the batterybox showing the underside showing the gearwheel metal that brings the power from the motor onto the geared track the black pointy things alongside the gearwheel react with the direction knobs at stations this is how the shuttle negociates with height differences everything hinges and rotates making the shuttle capable of performing steep climbs the motor is powerful enough to not slow down at such a climb detailed shot showing the first set of covered wheels in hinged position the shuttle on the layout the full layout this layout is quite huge involving lots of track pieces ramps ten large stanchionpoles and the two stations to show the movement of the shuttle i have made a 20 second movie which can be seen in my brickshelf gallery of this set conclusion well to conclude the review some final thoughts this truly is one of the more detailed sets around at least from the nineties and one of the largest in dimensions the monorail system is cleverly thought out and works excellent track extensions are hard to get however and very expensive nowdays especially the switchpoints and long straight track pieces the tracks included with this set will provide you with hours of fun though because there are a lot of them it can be quite hard to incorporate the monorail in your town without having a clearlybasedonthemonorailalone town i tried to incorporate it some years ago link here posing a real challenge the ratings price 810 this is an expensive set if you can get it for under 200 get it this set is rare in any condition parts 1010 lots of rare pieces cool minifigs 9v system roadplates lots of minifigseats en red trainwindows originality 1010 there are very few monorails released this one being the only town set compatibility 810 can be a bit hard to incorporate in a town but hey you got the monorail so no complaining here total 3640 i can only reccommend this set to anyone it is my personal favorite set upto this present time if there are any questions ask them all comments are welcome of course
an excellent review of one of the jewels in the crown of the lego town range to answer one of your question i think the lack of people owning this set is one of the reasons that its yet to have a review personally i’ve only seen this set in the flesh once in my life when i was a child just before it was withdrawn from sale it is a lovely set well made and well produced though i think there is a flaw and that’s when the passages get of the other end of their train ride what picks them up a bus set for the airport would have been a good addition apart from that i can’t really fault it and that fact it comes with three female minifigs is just stellar as for incorporation keeping it elevated seems the most sensible suggestion i’ve always thought it i have it and wanted to integrate the set to a town to use it in the style of the dlr in london but that’s just a thought
thanks for that splendid review simonwillems i clicked on outstanding of course i also like those little details especially the ticket validating machines youre very fortunate to own this wonderful set i hope you have an airport to go with it edit and bricklink is wrong giving 1991 as the release date youre right it was 1990 edited by legotrainfan 05 september 2008  0657 pm
an aweome review of an outstanding set
norro on sep 6 2008 0934 am said thanks for the in depth review of a set miles out of my price range i thought it was out of my price range too then i realized that i had probably spent enough since coming out of my dark ages to buy a misb 6399 so i bought it and i am going to cut back on buying other sets for the next year or so to offset the one big purchase those glimpses of the 2009 sets havent made me regret the cutback edited by section8 06 september 2008  0907 pm
judging from videos ive seen it seems that the monorail does very well on slopes i wonder why there havent been more or at least an updated set i also wonder why the trains cant incorporate some slopes like the monorail
it would be cool to see a review comparing this set with the newer orange garbage truck
definitely the best garbage truck ever the color scheme is great and the design is awesome outstanding without a doubt i must have it sometime
tenorikuma on sep 7 2008 0830 am said it would be cool to see a review comparing this set with the newer orange garbage truck well i might want to do that but then in a different way as the railroad maintenance i will then review the orange one and make comments on it compared to this one
yeah its very nice along with all the older sets ive got the cement mixer that was released around about the same time as this
thanks for the review like many such town sets i would characterise it as cute contrasting it to the new bin lorry its nice that this set has two minfigs more realistic and two bins those bins are a great addition to lego although wheelie bins would be nice now need some kind of 2x2 container you can clip a plate onto as a hinging lid and clip miniwheels under the back two studs having two minifigs is a superior point for this earlier lego rendition of a bin lorry in fact even though our bins are now emptied by a private company rather than the local council as was the case up till the mid 90s and of course for the last two decades there have been wheeliebins bin lorries have three guys  the driver and two collectors however our bin collectors for sure dont use a broom or shovel indeed on occasion theyve befouled the street themselves if something goes wrong with hoisting the bin on the mechanism the shape of the lorry in the set is still quite accurate pretty good for a fourwide vehicle i must admit to preferring the newer vehicles
tenorikuma on sep 7 2008 0830 am said it would be cool to see a review comparing this set with the newer orange garbage truck true woold be good for the people that have few new city sets like me and your review is good btw i own this set however because it was really cool those days nowadays all trucks nd cars can do neat things but that wasnt so back then
greetings just looking through the review index when i came across this one i recently acquired this set through ebay which came with a practically perfect box and instructions i would almost say that no one played with it much as all of the parts were brand new anyway i just wanted to say that this is a great set that was worth the 1499
nice set but nicer review looks like the set has quite some nice parts
a nice set my brother used to have this i wish the pilots helmet had a little printing on it looks messed up to me
the interceptor is my favorite tie ship so i wish i picked it up thanks for the review i agree about the helmet needs some silver printing on the mouth piece and the ends
i remember my cousins having this set both are in their permanent dark ages now but are not willing to give their lego to me if you have one of those old airports then this set is what you need to have even more fun since it makes a great addition to the airport excellent review 1010

i was going to get this but instead i got someting else firetruck i think nice review
nice review cobra thanks for sharing i esp like the doctors torso i rate this little set a 4 based on the design of the vehicle and the classic doors blogged edit i must have missed this review after it was posted back in sep i went ahead and kept the blog since its always enjoyable to look at these reviews
i think the 6382 fire station is the better one from the 80ies
found this set on a flea market in munich yesterday just 25 years after its release the instructions for a total of five models two of them printed the other 3 are just photo instructions in the book it still has the box in good shape despite some wear from the age sadly five little pieces were missing and 5 wrong pieces inside instead 2 complete wheels and a classic 80s90s plane wing dumped into my bricks but i was able to replace the missing minifig torch and the 4 missing plates with identical pieces from my collection the box and contents the set still has the original box inside the pieces plastic insert instructions and a 1987 technic catalogue imagine that set livespan today four years and the 8841 is still in the catalogue classic technic design from early 80s showing a function drawing of the steering and the main model a small set but with a flap shoeing the contents all pieces in the inner box and the papers included 5th model soapbox racer this is more or less a soapbox racer with working steering but no engine its got a rather blocky design but still looks sleek enough and is a simple build little over 100 pcs out of 180 the soapbox at step 2 just included the steering at step 6 completed and ready to race downhill total 710 simple but effective 4th model simple chassis very simple and boring alternate using just 13 of the 180 pieces in the set it even hasnt got a seat construction its just a plain steering mechanism attached on wheels with a spartan chassis of just a few pieces this is the whole model at step 5 just attach the steering mechanism and wheels and youre done total the worst alternate model of the complete set just a boring 410 3rd model balance very original small model its a small model of a working classic balance and it works with small parts laid on the scales altough theyve got just a 4x4 footprint its a fast build just 15 minutes and youve done it the model as it looks at step 3 finished easy build with just 63pcs out of 180 total very original model it actually works with small weights but a very simple build still a 710 alternate model tractor with equipment this is the second model its a simple but boxy design featuring a harrow and a plough the tractor has a similar design to the very first tractor set but much smaller the plough is about 24wide and the harrow is completely snotted even back in 1983 has two functions working steering and the coupler for the equipment uses almost all pieces of the set the tractor at step 8 the steering isnt completely attached now this is the completed tractor the complete harrow finished alternate with the plough attached total nice but quite ugly and boxy design for a tractor with 4 wheels of the same size takes me to a 610 main model desert racer this is the main model with a nice for early 80s but boxy design it has two functions steering and a working 1cylinder rear engine which is of the old 2x2 piston type since the small piston design wasnt invented back then this is the only model of the set which has piece callouts in the instructions the printed alternate model has no callouts they werent invented on both models back in 1983 the three smaller photo instruction alternates have a piece callout at the beginning showing all needed pieces the seat is a nice but blocky design and use a primitive snot technique this is the model at step five the piston is already attached imagine this state on step 5 in modern sets back then lego had challenging instructions not the step madness like today this is the engine just made of plates with a hole in the middle for the piston step 9 the piston engine is completed on step 12 the roll bar and the seat are installed only the steering isnt completed yet front view of the finished model just 15 steps needed back then birds eye view of the whole set displayed on the box model verdict nice design especially the colorful seat in snot technique but quite boxy especially the engine since there were only the huge pistons still a 910 set verdict design and models 710 very boxy designs due to the age the chassis alternate sucks build 910 classic 80s technic building quite challenging but fun sturdyness 710 rear section damaged after the table fall but rather easily fixed fun 910 blast from the past overall 810 mfg widdi edited by widdi 07 september 2008  0411 pm
great review i really love the seat and the great possibilities with the alternate models also congratulations for getting that set in perfect condition
name electric passenger train set no 7725 theme lego  system  trains  12v  train set year 1981 pieces 485 minifigs 1 price usd 7000 which equals about eur 50€ and gbp 40£ introduction our most favorite theme is 12v trains actually i got my first 77series back in 1981 5th of december i was 25 years old just a week before my brother was born some years later i got the 7740 after our dark ages we my brother cousin and myself got all 12v trains at least once this 7725 was gathering dust in my brothers room the train in all its splendor as you can see it doesnt occur at the back of the 12v era train instructions although its larger brother the 7740 does some investigation learned that all the sets at the back of the instructions date from 1980 so the 7725 wasnt released yet here you can see the front of the 7725 with the driver in the cockpit the driver is in fact the only minifig that was included in the set as you can see our version of the train has a different front than the one in the instructions apparently the former owner used 7861 lighting set 12 v to upgrade the train with working back and frontlights i like the original lights but didnt notice that the train had those double lights until i did the review maybe we will give the train again its original signs and put custom leds in it or so so that the train can drive into two directions with accurately working lights another thing about the lights that puzzle me are the backlights while typing this i realise that the former owner might have added those so lets have a look at the instructions then as it turns out the lights are there also in the instructions i recently learned that only the last car or coach of a train has its red lights on so unless the train drives with only the front car it will never use those red backlights here you can see the cockpit with the engineer the cables dont look very pretty but well the train at least has working light here you can take a look at the inside of the engine car while the 7745 has a nice fake engine there just the weight bricks and the ugly cables apart from the engineer and his cockpit no other nice features here btw lego always used tiles in such a trains to make it easier for kids to take off the roof and have access to the minifig passengers etc here the proof that it is an electric train the pantograph of the front car it has the same kind of panthographs that the 7745 has the middle car has 4 chairs as you can see some vandal must have nocked over this one hope they leave the cables alone this early morning train seems to have one passenger a workman i like the small 2x3 windows from this car very much they give this care a nice look also the door in the middle adds something special to the train as far as i know no other passenger train has the doors in the middle here you see the side of the train just after the train has left brickingham station where the worker probably from set 6647 highway repair that was also released in 1980 a closeup of the last car with steering stand to allow the train to travel back and forth without having to make head in other words putting the engine in front again the train shunted to an end track so it can be cleaned i think it is apparent that it definitely needs cleaning very badly this set can be found on peeron lugnet brickset bricklink entries playability 510 the train is fine but with only one minifig not very playable without other sets also no accessories at all design 710 nice train the inside could have been a lot better but i really like to original front lights price 710 the train came with motor so not a bad price goes now for quite some money at ebay overall 6510 nice set but the 7745 is a better train im sure well that was it for today i hope you have enjoyed this review and got tears in your eyes seeing how nice the 12v era was it never comes back but maybe lego rereleases some of this sets in the 2009 train era very likely that this is just wishful thinking edited by jopiek 12 september 2008  0456 pm
freddie on sep 7 2008 1152 pm said a very nice review jopiek you know i was wondering how lego could justify having two 12vpowered passenger trains at the same time but after reading the review and seeing the lack of figures and accessories i guess i understand why plus the train is rather compact oh and i cant help but think that the chairs in the middle carriage are somewhat oddly placed because those placed next to the door are unusable because the door takes up room needed for figs arms also it appears that your set also has the newer couplers ie theres no hooks for the decoupling rail to grab hold of with the light assembly it really wont matter playwise or if you dont have any decouplers but its still a bit of a bummer the chair was just loose so it should be placed on the 2x2 plate that is also visible in the picture of the middle car btw the front magnet is the old type i have some decouplers but we dont use them because they are not really that reliable lego just release a whole line of trains at the same time i just discussed with my parents and they told be lego had those sets longer in store back then i must have gotten the 7745 somewhere in 1983 or even 1984 although it was released in 1981 i started of with the 7710 push along train and then upgraded the tracks with current rails when i got the 7745
jopiek on sep 7 2008 1120 pm said the chair was just loose so it should be placed on the 2x2 plate that is also visible in the picture of the middle car thats not the one i was thinking of it was the other two chairs towards the middle of the wagon that i was thinking of if you try to seat a minifig in either of them youll quickly find that its impossible beacuse the door interferes with the figs required personal space if you move both of them one stud forward so that the back of the seat lines up with the edge of the window itll solve the problem and still leave space for a figs to be seated in the other chairs
giorgio on sep 8 2008 1123 am said the 7745 was realsed in 1985  lego had 2 12v passengers trains between 1981 and 1984 the 7740  7725 during the 80s the avergae life of a train was about 5 years freddie yups now i see what you mean i checked the instructions and indeed the chairs are in the wrong place whoops you are totally right i meant 7740 instead of 7745 fixed it edited by jopiek 08 september 2008  0500 pm
the best 12v legotrain is for me the 7740 the 7725 is still a goodlooking train and the only one with short wagons in a electric version before i started to with bricklink i started to build this train in blue ive build 4 trains of it and sold 2 of them still one for sale  you can also build this in other colors like a yellow one or you can build a black version which i made a death train of it driven by a skeleton  edited by panda9001100 17 may 2009  0801 am

lego12 on sep 7 2008 0805 pm said i have one question only how can you be reviewing at this time at night thanks for your comments lego12 i did this review a few weeks ago and just now posted it remember also that we are on different time zones
like whitefang i too only remember this line in computer game form i used to love that game i actually have never seen a review for an xtreme stunts set so this was nice to see as for the set i think it looks pretty good i really like the hippie guy the windboard thing is nice as well but looks a bit strange somehow i give this set a solid 3 out of 5 thanks for the nice review edited by erdbeereis1 08 september 2008  0405 am
her name was sky lane its quite sad though to actually play the gamethe xtreme tower is the only set that made it into the game itself and it was a really watered down version of the information center from the first two games but the island was in the game filled with incredible buildings that would have made really cool sets
hippie dude thats snap lockitt island xtreme is one of the best themes ever im trying to get the sets off bricklink thanks fo the review i need this now
thanks for the review i loved this theme it had some of the greatest pieces ever arranged in any theme brilliant printed parts and figures and some good colours snap lockitt hippie dude  is a great figure with a cool name i own him from another set but unfortunately not this one it looks like a very good set no stickers and good printed parts too nice review pencoin on sep 9 2008 0521 pm said hippie dude thats snap lockitt island xtreme is one of the best themes ever im trying to get the sets off bricklink thanks fo the review i need this now hahaha that made me laugh for some reason i dont know why though i agree with it
thanks for the nice review whitefang i quite like this set the front looks a bit bare but for a small set like this it doesnt really matter this set gets a 4 from me as well
this is one of those sets that make me really want to start building up a city its a great value has a lot of useful pieces and is just plain fun to play with i do miss vehicles having doors though great review i was a bit curious as to how the dumping mechanism worked as well as the sticker count
erdbeereis1 on sep 10 2008 0538 pm said actually it does the back part of the truck with the panel hinges up so that when you want the truck to dump it doesnt get in the way i should have taken a better look at the one my brother has  it still is a nice truck much better than all the strange sets that were release those dark ages before
a good set with a nice color scheme i still prefer the last one that had a removable bin
this looks like a great set and im happy you were dumping spongebob he deserves that this set looks very nice and if i see it i will probably pick it up
thanks for this review i really love this set its perfect for my town and brings a sense of classic when i see it
hi i bought this set a while ago and have since remodeled it into a larger 8 wide truck now it can hold a driver and passenger its kind of boxy i may redesign it in the future
thats a really nice mod badsneaker the added bulk serves it well
